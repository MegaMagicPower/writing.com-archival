What was she looking for, you wonder.  Whatever it was, she didn't hardly have the time she thought she had, as there was a sudden pop and the wooden supports holding the building together collapsed, narrowly missing your group of three.<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then!\" Olivia heaved out, hand clutched close to her chest.  She glared at you bitterly.  \"If you're the Chosen One, then go save everyone here!  I'm taking Sierra and myself out of here!\" she barked out, grabbing the princess and dragging her out of the building.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were completely and utterly mortified.  Sure, you were probably one of the toughest guys at your school, but you weren't fire fighter material let alone \"Chosen One\" material, whatever that malarkey was about.  Knowing you were losing precious time, you decided to stick a pin on that train of thought for the moment and get to the task at hand: saving the trapped occupants in the castle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You searched rapidly for any sign of life, scouring each room you came upon, but each one was devoid of any sentient being, and there were clear signs of a struggle going on in each one of these rooms.  This led you to one possible conclusion: that the castle had been under attack, and all heroes and heroines had been the target for capture.  This hardly made any sense to you at the moment.  With all this deep thinking and sweating, you almost missed out on a distressed cry for help.  Quickly, you followed the cry to its source.<br>\r\n\"H-help..!\" whimpered a familiar looking character, both of their arms being held firmly by some very sinister looking enemies.<br>\r\n\"Oh shit...\" you huff, knowing that this meant you were going to have to fight.  You sure hoped that saving this familiar looking person was worth it...<br>\r\nErr...<br>\r\nWho was this easily recognizable character?</span></span></div></div>",

It sounded like a clicking mixed with a sort of loud mumbled tone.  Being familiar with video games, however, you could identify these foes as Primids; sinister creatures made from shadow bugs.  Primids were under the control of Tabuu, who was the embodiment of Subspace.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You have no idea why these things were here, as Tabuu was thought to have been destroyed in the final battle to return the  pieces of the World of Trophies to their original areas.  Glancing to PoPo, you quit thinking and get straight into action.<br>\r\n\"PoPo, watch out..!\" you huff out, rushing to grab his discarded hammer, which was set ablaze at the tip.  Taking a moment to get accustomed to the weapon, you rush out and swing at one of the Primids, sending it flailing back into a wall where it then dissipated into a pool of shadow bugs.  To its partner, you also swing, though it just manages to hang on and starts to flee with PoPo.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not willing to let Olivia or the Princess down, you chase after the creature as it flees down the flaming hall, PoPo being dragged hollering the whole way.

You grab the small ice climber into your arm as though he were a football and begin to run through the flaming halls of the slowly crumbling castle.  Your eyes watered as you scanned your way through the castle, attempting to find an exit of some sort.  It was then you saw a flicker of daylight through a smoke-stained window.<br>\r\n<i>That's our only way out... And it's too dangerous to stay here any longer,</i> You think to yourself. You hope that no one else remains inside as you break through the glass, Popo trembling in your arm as a blaze of fire whipped from behind, attacking the oxygen it could grab.  You land with a thud on the ground, remaining firm on your feet as you stood up to face the blue sky which was now being filled with the smoke from the castle.<br>\r\n\"Please put me down,\" Popo whimpered, his gloved hands covering his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right, sorry,\" you exclaim, setting him down.  \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Nana...\" he stammered, some tears falling as he started to cry. \"I couldn't keep her safe...

I couldn't find anyone else, I'm so sorry,\" you begin to explain, but her finger silences your lips.<br>\r\n\"If we are lucky, those that attacked us have taken the rest as prisoners.  Though it is not ideal, it is better than the alternative,\" she said, almost in a calm, or rather apathetic, tone. \"Even though you failed to get the others, at least you got one.\" Her direction turned to Olivia. \"Olivia, make preparations to arrive at Dreamland.  I have a feeling it has gone undetected from this moving threat.\"<br>\r\n\"Right away, Ma'am,\" Olivia replied, giving a quick curtsy before quickly scampering away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watch her go off out of earshot before turning your attention to the Princess.</span></span></div></div>",

We will be departing this place soon,\" she explains, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sierra, I need to ask you a few things,\" you start.

No one will let anything get in their way; anyone with their right mind would be after me.  To have anything that you desire?\" she trailed off, her eyes darkening.  \"To have whatever you want... It's the ultimate prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... But what does that have to do with me?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

They were almost like an animals eyes, the way they sparkled in the stars.<br>\r\n\"Yes, there is a need of an explanation here...\" She sighed. \"Well, it was a normal day and then something bombed my other castle. The one you saw before it...\" She gulped with a shaky voice. \"I had to take evasive action. So, I teleported, trusting the stars would guide me to the right person and then I landed at your foot ball game. I sat and watched you and other players, trying to see who I saught out. Then, you did it. The other team was about to score and you pulled out the most amazing play I had ever seen and scored. I knew then you were the one. You came and accepted the offer and we were gone. You rescued everyone left in the castle. You redeemed the Nightmare Monsters and found out where to get Dedede and the others. But-\" she said, spoiling my moment of epicness.<br>\r\n\"I'm still curious why you use only Kirby's abilities. You can use Meta Knight's abilities and even mine. Why don't you try them. If only the enemy knows you can use the Kirby ability very well, we can use that as upper hand and attack him with the combination of every powerful attack that everyone can use! But, it takes practice just to master a single ability. But I feel I have wasted enough of your night. You should go to bed...\" She sighed as she stared at the stars.</span></div></div>",

But, I don't know who else is in here. And I never knew other humans lived in the video game world either. I once played a game involving a cross over world, but Escargoon is in this world. Escargoon was never introduced in the games, only the television show.

Please, sit down and meditate with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to where she was sitting. I sat down, crossed my legs, and closed my eyes. Everything was dark at first, but then everything turned a majestic pink. I saw Sierra sitting there beside me. She was focusing in front of her, so I did the same. I saw several figures pass by, all video game characters. I recognized most of them. There was Ash from Pokemon, Link from Legend of Zelda, even Mr. Game and Watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you can train your abilities\" said Sierra. \"You saw some of the characters from video games, and some of those are the characters you can use.

My parents said I was too old for Pokemon, but I ignored them and kept playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not bad\" replied Sierra. \"You let your true intentions out and keep them hidden when possible. May I ask, how many games have you played?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not 100% sure if you know this, but a new series came out recently. So, I have five games, each set with at least six Pokemon each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, and turned towards me. I stood up as well, and the area around us changed. It appeared to be a traditional Pokemon battlefield. I was amazed by what was happening. Sierra giggled when she saw my reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To master this power\" she started, \"You must imagine your Pokemon. Every trainer has their own personalities, and each Pokemon has one differently as well. You must imagine that precise Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes and focused. I saw every single Pokemon I have ever caught in the games. I always imagined them as real creatures when I was little, and I sometimes made them different. I couldn't decide on one, so I let my subconscious choose. I felt something in my hadn, and I opened my eyes. To my surprise, I saw a Pokeball. A actual, real, psyhical, POKEBALL! I threw it immediately, and it opened. To my surprise, it was Speckle, my Hydregeion. Hydregeion is a black and purple dragon Pokemon. It had three heads, but only one of them had control of its body. It had a fuschia colored crest on its head, and six wings. The only difference between a regular Hydregeion and my Hydregeion is that Speckle has white specks on her fur; hence her name. She landed on the ground and looked around. She slowly turned around, and saw me. She loocked shocked, and she turned completely towards me. I slowly walked near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...Speckle?\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeckle ran at me and tackled me to the ground. She bit my leg hard, but she let go quickly. I laughed as she grabbed me and nuzzled her snout into my chest. Sierra ran up to us, and Speckle faced her and growled. She backed up, but I told Speckle to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" I said. \"I always imagined my Pokemon to have REAL personalities. Speckle is very tough, protective, and powerful. She always bites my leg lovingly when she first comes out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some love\" she replied.</span></div></div>",

Sierra still looked annoyed by Slice n' Splice, but she still looked worried. \"What are we going to do?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing we can do\" I said. \"We rescue the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant idea sire!\" said Slice n' Splice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, we all got something to eat, and we prepared to go back. Sierra pulled out her necklace again and we were back where we first set off. we met up with the rest of them, and we set out. While we were in Sierra's castle, the others built several different vehicles to not only let us travel faster, but also to make room for others that might join us. Kirby got his Starship as a car, Me and Slice n' Splice got a large vehicle, adn Meta Knight got his own car. Me, Slice n' Splice, Kirby, and Sierra met with the Cappies before we left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you have to leave Kirby?\" asked Tiff. \"We could use your help in rebuilding Cappy Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poyo!\" said Kirby. He pointed to us, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look like Kirby wants to go with them\" said Tuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small yellow bird flew down and landed in front of us; Tokkori \"Kirby wouldn't be much help anyway\" he said. \"Kirby is no help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not nice Tokkori!\" said Tiff. \"Kirby and Taylor saved us, even you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, well, good luck with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say that Tokkori\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your coming with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why on blue balzes would I do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice n' Splice walked forward, and Tokkori looked scared.

He wore sunglasses, a chef hat, a blue hat, and had a mustache and eyebrows. He nodded and walked beside me. A second beam shoy out, and Dejaa came. Dejaa is a smaller monster, but is very powerfull. He is a living bomb supply. A third beam shot out, and Bugzzy appeared. Bugzzy is a giant beetle that carries two weapons; a club, and a sword. He raised both weapons proudly and grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone ready?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice n' Splice raised his weapons high, Monsiuer Goan transformed into his true form, Dejaa prepared two bombs, and Bugzzy smashed the ground in front of him with his club.

He looked at me slightly worried. \"I am being serious\" I told him. \"You're pies are not that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked happier, but we were interupted by the other monsters. Popon, Cobgoblin, and Crab looked fierce, but Ebifryer looked worried. It was almost like he did not want to be here. Everyone got ready again, and Belly Buster joined us. Maybe just a good complement was all it took. Popon said something, but I couldn't understand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Popon says that they want to attack King Dedede\" translated Slice n' Splice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't he at the castle?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopon shook its head. I knew that answer. King Dedede must have hid from them when they arrived. Cobgoblin grabbed me with his tendrils and brought me closer. Some of his tendrils forced my mouth to open, and he spun around, shooting corn kernels into my mouth. I felt the kernels explode in me, kinda forcing me into different directions. After the last kernel, I fell to the ground. Slice n' Splice  ran up to me and forced Cobgoblin back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Master?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always hated corn\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and faced Cobgoblin.

Everyone stared at the items with complete shock and curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire\" said Slice n' Splice, \"What are those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your world isn't the only world with monsters\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw them all up in the air, and they all opened. I chose the six Pokemon that I owned that can use Dig. They were Checkers, Pine, Cada, Gabe, Scuttle, and Digger. Checkers is a Sandshrew, a yellow mouse Pokemon. His hard skin had the looks of a brick wall, but his was checkered with black and yellow, hence his name. Pine is a Forretress, a bug Pokemon encased within a hard shell. He had four extrusions that he used ine battle. Unlike most Forretresses, his shell was covered in yellow stars. Cada is a Ninjask, a wasp-like Pokemon. His wings were blue instead of clear like the others. Gabe is a Gabite, a Pokemon that looked like a cross from a shark and a dragon.. The dorsal fin on his back had a huge piece missing from it. Scuttle is a Crustle, a large crab-like Pokemon with a large boulder for a shell. Digger is an Excadrill, a large mole Pokemon. He had metal growths for claws, and one over its head. His face is white, and he had red markings on his chest. Everyone looked in astonishment, but Sierra looked a little to surprised. All of them except for Gabe rushed over to me, nearly knocking me down. Slice n' Splice ran up to them with his weapons held high, but I stopped him. Everyone got in line, and I began to introduce them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, these are my Pokemon\" I said. \"Pokemon are creatures that look like regular animals and have amazing abilities. The first one is Checkers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckers rolled up into a ball and rolled around. He stopped at Olivia's feet and looked up at her. Olivia kneeled down and petted him. \"Aww, he is so cute!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next one is Pine. He loves to spin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPine concluded my remark by spinning very fast. Cada flew over and landed on my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one is Cada. He is very fast and stealthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCada flew off my head, and showed everyone his speed. It didn't seem like he was flying in a circle, he disappeared in one spot and reapeared in another. Gabe crossed his arms and leaned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one over there is Gabe. He is cool, calm, but tough when you need him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe just waved one of his claws quickly, not wanting to be part of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is Gabe like that?\" asked Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabe is kinda solitary\" I said. \"He doesn't show it, but he does really care. Anyway, this crab is Scuttle. Underneath his rock-hard shell is a very gentle heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScuttle walked over to Samus and made a bowing motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last one is Digger. He is probably the most powerful Pokemon out from my final team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigger raised his claws high and yelled. Meta Knight approached me with his cape drawn around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are these...Pokemon...going to help us?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you.\"</span></div></div>",

The extrusions shone a shining gray color, and created a belt around him. He stood in one spot, while I faced the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, attack him\" I said. \"Once Pine starts spinning, there is usually nothing that can stop him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejaa spat out a bomb and hurled it at Pine.

He swung it at Pine, but it bounced off. You usually can't see his face, but he seemed surprised. Kirby shuffled his feet, and tried to inhale him. Pine spun around, and broke Kirby's suction.

I still had all my Pokemon out, and they looked around the world with amazement. We stopped behind a hill where no one could see us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone\" I told my Pokemon, \"We need to get into that prison. We need your help into tunneling under. Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of my Pokemon cheered, and readied themselves. \"Alright everyone, use Dig!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckers rapidly clawed the ground, eventually concealing himself underground. Pine spun rapidly and slammed into the ground. Cada flew full speed into the ground with his front claws moving very fast. Gabe jumped and buried himself. Crustle dug himself into the ground. Digger jumped, folded together, and spun rapidly. He burrowed his way into the ground. There were six holes in the side of the ground, but the ground eventually gave way. A giant tunnel appeared, big enough for Slice n' Splice to get through. We traveled through, and all my Pokemon were there. The tunnel continued behind them, it seems like they were already done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fast\" said Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are done already?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them nodded, and we walked down further.

They carried us to a room with many different computer screens. In the center of the room, was a large R.O.B. It was standing on a large platform and had many wires connected to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not find the prisoners so easily\" it said.

A Electrode looked like a pokeball with a face, only the design was upside down. TNT had a black lightning bolt-shaped marking on his forhead. A Ampharos was a yellow mammallian pokemon that slightly resembled a bare sheep. Static had a orb on the end of her tail that had a pink heart on it. Aggrons are large Pokemon covered in steel armor. Nora was a sweet girl, but was a little mischevious. Ambipoms resembled monkeys that have two tails. On the end of each tail, resembled a hand. Eelektross looked like a blue eel, with arms that looked similar to is mouth, long fins, and long body. Stunfisks looked similar to a Stargazer, whose bodies are completely flat. Galvantulas are big, yellow and blue hairy spiders. Jolt had a black fabric wrapped around each of his front feelers. Klinklang resembled giant gears that constantly stayed in motion. I commanded all of them to use their electric moves, and they did it. All of the attacks were absorbed by Mother ROB.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignorant organic\" she said. \"That will only make me stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignored her and commanded my Pokemon to continue.

However, the room glowed red again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixty seconds till self destruct\" said a voice that sounded similar to Mother ROB's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do!?\" asked Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to escape!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all ran out of that room, and headed towards the tunnel. The countdown was know on thirty seconds. We all hurried in, as we ran for our lives. Just before we left the tunnel, the prison exploded. Exhausted and relieved, we went back to the outpost. I had to admit, I kinda liked being split. I had someone to talk to that knew everything about each other. It was awkward, but kinda interesting. It was almost like talking to yourself; literally. We got to the outpost, and relaxed. Everyone got some food, while Slice n' Splice wanted to see me and Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire, I need to ask you something\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to join you two back together?\"</span></div></div>",

It was entirely black, and decorated very creepily. It almost seemed that all hope and love was being drained from me as I looked at it. Taylor and Slice n' Splice saw my reaction. Taylor understood it as much as I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong sire?\" asked Slice n' Splice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned on my intercom to tell the rest of the gang. \"Everyone, do you know who's castle this is?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" said Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whosever it is, they did a very lousy job decorating\" said Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor, I know who's castle that is\" said Taylor. \"That is Wilfre's Castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the heck is Wilfre?\" asked Tokkori. Even through it was through the intercom, his voice still sounded annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wifre is a character from the game Drawn to Life. He was the villian that tried to destory the entire world of color, and imagination. The only thing that stopped him was the hero you created. I enjoyed both of those games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well which game is the castle from?\" asked Slice n' Splice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Wilfre owned a castle in both games\" said Taylor. \"It made a better appearance in the second game though. What's worse is that the castle is heavily guarded. We need to distract some of the guards to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us handle that\" I said with Slice n' Splice. \"Just drop us off here, and wait fro the signal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the signal?\" asked Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll know it when you see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stopped the car and me and Slice n' Splice jumped out. Taylor went into the driver's seat, \"Are you sure I can drive this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're me\" I replied, \"You should be able to drive this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and met the others. Slice n' Splice walked over to me as I opened my cell phone. Broom King appeared and looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Taylor?\" he asked. \"We couldn't get a hold of you earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine\" I said. \"Now then, we need Sasuke and Delivery Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need them both to enter a prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now sending data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light shot out of my phone, and Sasuke was the first to appear. Sasuke was a small round monster. It wore one of those round chinese hats on it's head. Delivery Man came out next. He looked like a hard-core motorcycleist with a super fast motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke, we need fireworks\" I said. \"How fast can you make them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke saluted and went right to work. \"Delivery Man, once Sasuke gets done with the fireworks, we need you to place them on the right side of the castle. Then, we need your help to get insdie the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, and I went to Sasuke. I sat down beside him, but he turned to work on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\" I said. \"Your fireworks need complete concentration to be very good. And by the way, they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw that Sasuke glanced at me for a second, and then handed me some stuff. He motioned that I simply pour the two powders into each other. I did as he did, and handed me a a set of containers of multicolored powders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can choose which color?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and went back to his work. I chose blue, since it was my favorite color. I looked back at Sasuke, and he finsihed a lot more than me. I was surprised, and he looked smug. Delivery Man grabbed all of the fireworks and rushed over. He came back in a matter of seconds. Sasuke grabbed a remote, and pressed it. Several fireworks fired up, and they looked amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready guys?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded, and we prepared. Suddenly, a white vortex opened behind us and swallowed us. We then appeared in a cage. we looked around, and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a pile of different objects in front of me. There was a pile of instruments, a jar full of color, and something that looked like plants. They all seemed useless to be in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are these things in here?\" asked Tokkori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just looks like a pile of junk\" said Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the pile of instruments first. There were many instruments, but there was also a stereo system in there too. I grabbed each item, and placed it on the floor carefully. After a time of arranging the items, I finally recognized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Meganote!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" asked Slice n' Splice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meganote was one of the heros I created in the game. Meganote was a living combination of musical instruments. But, since the cell has the power to drain other powers, he is just a pile of instruments. The other two are TreeBark and Spectra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cell door opened, and two rounded white ghosts appeared. I grabbed one of Meganote's speakers and faced it to the ghosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meganote\" I said, \"If you can hear me, we could use your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speaker started to shake, and sound waves blasted out of it. The ghosts dissappeared, and the cage was left open. I grabbed as many instruments as I could, and the others grabbed them. We left out of that cage, but I stopped. I looked in the other cells to see if anymore people were in there. I saw the remaining heros. I also saw Pit in one of the cages as well. Pit saw me, and walked to the front of the bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever you are, get me out!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax\" I said. \"I will get you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I would like to see you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focused my energy. <i>If this is Wilfre's castle, and my heros are here, that means that I am the creator. I should be able to make anything of I concentrate.</i> A key formed in my hand, and I placed it in the lock to the cell dor. It fit percectly, and it opened. Pit looked surprised, but he was too worried about getting out. I opened the other cages, and grabbed the rest of the heros. Once I got out, all of the items started to shake. The rearranged themselves into the heros I created them to be. The first one was the first one, and his name was Stumpy. Stumpy was a blue creature that only hand one eye, one arm, and one leg. He had a black spiral on his chest, a few scars on his body, and an x where his other eye should be. He looked at me, and hopped my way. He managed a hug, and turned to watch the others. The next one was TreeBark. TreeBark is a living plant with large wings made of branches and leaves. The next one was Marine. Marine was a mix up of several different species of sea creatures. He had the legs of a crab, but onlt two of them. He has one arm with a sea anenome for a hand, and the other arms was normal, except he had webbeed hands. The gills were located below his arms on the sides of his body, his head had an octopus beak, fins on his head, and blue eyes. The color of his skin changed depending on what body part was where. Plus, he could change the parts to something else as will. The last of the first series was Shadow. Shadow was a hero based on wilfre's old henchmen. He was an entire being made of darkness. I used him to fight Wilfre in the end. Fight fire with fire. They all looked excited to see me. Everyone else took some time to get used to them, but then the others started to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of these blasted scribbles are there?\" asked Tokkori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Shadow. \"We may be poorly drawn, but at least we can fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of the second series to form was Meganote. Like I said before, Meganote is a living combination of several different musical instruments. His body was a stereo system, topped with two speakers. Inbetween these two speakers was his head. His head was white, and he had a music note-like mask covering his eyes. He had four arms and three legs; each one a different instrument. The next one was Scrapper. Scrapper was a robot that did not look very well constructed. He had four legs and three arms. One of his arms was like a human hand, one was a robotic claw, and another looked like a large spike. His legs resembled crab legs. The third was Bot. Bot was more of a junk bot than Scrapper. He has one arm, ended with a oddly shaped hand. He has a spring for a leg, and his body is cylinderical. His head was spherical, and his eye was red. The last one was Spectra. Spectra was similar to Shadow, but he was a variety of colors. They all looked at each other with happiness, and then they saw me. They all looked at me with a combinatio of worry and happiness. The others arrived, and they all got into battle poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait!\" I said. \"These guys are not enemies! They are my creations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor walked up to them, and they all looked at her in surprise. They turned between me and her constantly. I didn't want to tell them what happened, because they might attack Slice n' Splice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what happened to you guys?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We went to Wilfre's cstle to stop him from doing any harm\" said Stumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortuantly, we did not count on those strange powers of those holding cells\" said Meganote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we entered, we fell apart\" said Scrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall shadows appeared around us, and creatures that looked like Shadow appeared. They circled around us, and was pushing us to another room. In the room, was...</span></div></div>",

He held his scepter in his right hand, and was looking down on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well\" he said. \"Looks like the little creations got free. My question is, who are the rest of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The question is, who are you?\" asked Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is Wilfre\" I said. \"He is the creep that wants to remove all imagination and creativity from the world, and rule it all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am surprised by how much you know\" he said. Wilfre raised his scepter towards me, and a beam fired. It surrounded me, and lifted me into the air. Slice n' Splice tried to stop him, but Wilfre's creatures stopped him. Wilfre brought me closer near his face. He smiled wickedly as he brought the scepter to my forehead. I was actually slightly scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are...you g-going to d-do?\" I stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just smiled, as a coursing pain went through my body. I felt something getting pulled out of my head, and it solidified outside of my body and into Wilfre's other hand. The pain stopped, and he threw me down. The creatures dissappeared, and Slice n' Splice caught me. I gained consciousness and faced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just sampled your mind\" he said. \"Now, we will have a proper battle. I will change the arena to suit the battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved the scepter and the walls quickly spread out. we all looked around, but I paid more attention to Wilfre. He had something in his hands, that looked similar to a book. It did not look like the Book of Life, but it was definitly a book. He smiled as he came upon a certain page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one will do\" he said. He fired a beam from his scepter, and a cloud of smoke formed. Out from the smoke, stood a massive machine. The machine was purely white. It had four crab-like mechanical legs, which had shield-like armor on the foreleg. It's body was semi-circular, with several different machines out of it. The smaller one resembled small cannons, and there was an extremely large one with a large satellite dish on top. It was decorated with yelow markings. It had a big yellow eye in the center of its body. I backed up slowly, and the others did as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that contraption?\" asked Tokkori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i don't believe it!' I said. \"it's Cannon Crawler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cannon what?\" asked Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something I created when I was a little kid. It was a war weapon that had nearly no weakness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannon Crawler began to walk forward and fired its small cannons. We dodged the attack, and hid behind the pillars. Thankfully, Cannon Crawler was very slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we defeat it?\" asked Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cannon Crawler's armor is nearly indestrucible\" I replied. \"The only way to destroy it is from the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can we get in if the armor is indestructible?\" asked Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is an access vent directly under Cannon Crawler. If one of us can distract him, one of us can get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice n' Splice ran around and started to attack Cannon Crawler. Cannon Crawler started after him, while I made my way under Cannon Crawler. The latch was visible, but it was stragnely sealed shut. Slice n' Splice was getting hit pretty good. I created a wrench to try to get it open, but it wouldn't work. I ran out, and pushed Slice n' Splice. Some of the heros grabbed him and ran behind some cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The latch is sealed!' I said. \"I have no way in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirby, get that thing!\" said Tokkori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby ran out and shufled his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirby wait!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby began using his inhale ability. Cannon Crawler just stood there. Kirby's power was failing, but he kept trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Kirby keeps this up, he will get too tired to even fight!' said Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even try Kirby!\" said Wilfre. \"When I sampled Taylor's mind, I also sampled all of his knowledge as well. I removed everything that you can use!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor, what re we going to do?\" asked Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, Wilfre said that he removed everything that Kirby could ever use\" I said. \"But, if Kirby had a new transformation, Wilfre wouldn't know about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can we create a new Kirby?\" asked Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the powers of the Creator, where I can nearly create almost anything. But, wilfre took most of it, so I can only do little stuff. all I have to do is think of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will try too\" said Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at the wrench at my hand, and back at Kirby.</span></div></div>",

A brown bandana with a darker brown star on it appeared on his head. A large wrench appeared in his hand as well. Kirby looked at himslef in surprise, as well as everyone else. Wilfre was looking through my book to try and find that transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't find that one anywhere in here!\" he said while flipping the pages rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured out how this place can work\" I said. \"This place increases my imagination's power and my creation powers as well as your powers.

Say hello to...Mechanic Kirby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a rediculous name!\" said Wilfre. \"Cannon Crawler, destory Kirby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannon Crawler turned and aimed all of his cannons at Kirby. Kirby threw his wrench at Cannon Crawler, who was knocked back.

A beam shot out from it, and encased Cannon Crawler. Nothing happened for a few seconds, and Cannon Crawler began to walk. Suddenly, he started to fall apart in pieces. The color drained from the parts, and Cannon Crawler dissappeared. Wilfre looked mad and threw his arms in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will get something from your imagination that can win!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say that\" said Slice n' Splice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit flew back down to us, with the book in his hands. I grabbed the book, and it quickly dissolved in my hands. I could feel the knowledge being absorbed through my skin. Wilfre looked even more mad, but he then stopped and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your creations might not win\" he said, \"But I now who can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilfre waved his scepter in the air, and black smoke surrounded us. The smoke cleared from around me, but only the heros from the game were around me. I tried to look for the rest of the gang, but I was interrupted by laughter. Wilfre was sitting in a large throne that was on top of a cloud. He was like he was in the end of the second game. I heard some rumbling from the smoke. The smoke cleared, and I saw every boss from the game. There was Frostwind, Deadwood, Angler King, Wilfre's pet scorpion, Bakibeard, Giant Robosa, and Council Defenses. Each one looked evil and ready to battle. I was more worried about my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are my friends Wilfre!?\" I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed his scepter behind me, and I turned around. The others were in a cage emtirely made of shadow. I turned back around, and looked at Wilfre. He was laughing a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make you an offer\" he said. \"If you and your heros can defeat these enemies, I will release you and your friends.

Me and the other heros were standing on a large platform. The arena was now a full water battlefield. However, Bakibeard's ship was floating in the water. Bakibeard was on the ship, and Angler King was slightly above water. Marine and Meganote were right on the edge of the platform. I gave Marine his custom Starshooter. It was a blue gun with a yellow star on the side. Marine dove into the water, and Angler King swam deeper. Meganote began playing the Boss Battle music on his speakers, and he made his way down as well. I couldn't see Marine, so I had to pay attention to Magenote. As he was playing music, music notes were surrounding him. They shot out at Bakibeard, but they passed right through. He laughed and disappeared. He reappeared behind Meganote, and scared him. Smaller ghosts started to appear, and they went to Meganote. They were in the formation of a flight of stairs. Meganote kept trying to use his sound attack, but they passed right through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meganote!\" I yelled.\"Use the ghosts! You can't hit him with sound!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeganote jumped and hit one of the ghosts. The ghost disappeared, and he was launched higher. Meganote did the same to all the ghosts, and slammed into Bakibeard. Bakibeard disappeared, and reappeared at the opposite end of the ship. He sent out several ghosts, who surrounded Meganote. They picked him up, and threw him overboard. Bakibeard laughed and he traveled deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilfre!\" I yelled. \"This isn't fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did you expect the battle to be exactly like the game?\" he said. \"And this time, you can't help them. A true hero must learn on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at the bubbling water where Meganote once was. <i>But, Meganote isn't suited for underwater.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarine and Angler King were fighting wildly. Marine shooting his Starshooter and using his powers, while Angler King was sending out Shadow Fish. A loud splash was heard, and they both looked up. Meganote was falling deeper into the water. Marine tried to swim up, but Angler King stopped him. Marine became surrounded in electricity, and stunned Angler King. Marine swam up to Meganote, who was faintly playing his song. He turned to Marine, who was trying to get him above water. Bakibeard slowly descended, and Angler King broke out of his daze. Meganote said something faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma..rine\" he said. \"Use...this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic notes surrounded Marine, and he started to glow. The light eventually illuminated the entire area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly saw the entire water glow white. Bakibeard rose out of the water and Angler King surfaced. A large veil of water was beginning to form, and then it eventually burst. Out of the water, looked like a giant, monsterous version of Marine. He looked around, and then raised his one hand. The hand looks like a sea anenome. The tentacles stretched out and surrounded Angler King and Bakibeard. Electricity flowed through the tentacles, and electrocuted them. Eventually, they disappeared, and Marine shrunk back down.</span></div></div>",

I ran up and kneeled beside him. I laid my ear close to his chest, trying to hear anything. I heard nothing. I laid my head against his chest and nearly cried. Then, a faint sound emitted from his speakers. As it grew louder, the other instruments on him began to play. He opened his eyes, and smiled at me. I hugged him, and I heard clapping. Wilfre was clapping sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How touching\" he said. \"But we have a battle to complete. And this time, I'm choosing first. Frostbite, Giant Robosa, you two are up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrostbite flew to the main field and Giant Robosa walked. The water battlefield solidified in the center to serve as a platform. Stumpy and Scrapper walked forward. I made a bridge connecting the two areas, and they crossed. I gave Stumpy his Snow Shooter, a white gun with a black spiral on it, and gave Scrapper his slinger, a large gray metal ball with a black decal on it and attached to a chain. Once they crossed, the bridge dissappeared. A pillar of snow topped stone formed under Stumpy, and several more came up as well. The water turned to lava, and the stone lengthened. Frostbite flew up to Stumpy, and Giant Robosa sank in the lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There are two battles now, I got to try and watch them both.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrostbite breathed icy wind, and Stumpy jumped to another pillar. He fired his Snow Shooter, and hit Frostbite. I turned to Scrappet, and he was doing good as well. He was dodging the attacks very well. Giant Robosa was having a very hard time attacking. Wilfre waved his scepter, and lava columns spewed out. Scrapper got distracted, and Giant Robosa knocked him up. Scrapper knocked into Frostbite, and bounced off and hit Stumpy. Both Stumpy and Frostbite were falling into the lava. Frostbite fell in, but Stumpy was flailing. I saw Scrapper extend his legs across some pillars, and then extended his arms. He grabbed Stumpy, and slowly brought him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See how extra limbs can be useful?\" said Scrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer to have what I got\" replied Stumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed on the stone column, but Giant Robosa stood up. He breathed in trying to suck them up, but Scrapper implanted his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scrapper! Stumpy!\" I yelled. \"Let the Robosa inhale you! Once inside, find it's heart and destroy it! That will defeat it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw them both nod, and Scrapper let go. Giant Robosa inhaled them completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good luck...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed inside of the Giant Robosa. Stumpy fell flat on his face, but he was alright. I recovered my Slinger, and Stumpy found his Snow Shooter. For someone with only one arm and leg, he can sure manage well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm ready\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good \" I replied, \"Now, according to Taylor, we can destro the Robosa if we destroy the heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ran down the only hallway, filled with moving gears and lava flowing. This machine must use the lava to function. After a while, we came into what appeared to be the center chest area. In the center of the room, was a metal heart shaped object. It had a few feats attached to it, and was beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$5 says that that is the heart\" said Stumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe wandered closer, but an alarm went off. Some missile launchers appeared and aimed at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you have a projectile weapon\" I said, \"You aim for the heart. I'll cover you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and we jumped into action. Missiles fire, but I spun my Slinger to keep the missiles occupied. Stumpy had a clear shot. But when he fired, the snow melted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too hot in here\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switch positions\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fired at the missiles, which exploded on contact. My Slinger made several dents in the heart until it finally went through. The heart exploded, and then the entire room shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Giant Robosa had a shocked look on his face, and he screamed. Lights enjoyed from him, and he exploded.</span></div></div>",

Scrapper helped him up, and Stumpy smiled. Wilfre was furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! Why does everything end bad for me!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his scepter, and the battlefield changed. \"Deadwood, Council Defences, get in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeadwood sunk into the ground and popped up somewhere else. The tank rolled up and began to power up. TreeBark spreaded his wings and his Acorn Laucher appeared. I focused, and Bot's ship appeared. His ship looked like a round UFO, with two satelitte dishes on each side. The dome on top was clear. A yellow ring was across the middle of it. He hopped up, opened the hatch, jumped in, and inputed his one hand inside the control panel. The ship started up and began to hover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" asked TreeBark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note: Bot cannot speak properly, He can only speak in bits.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ca ake tota ontrol of my ip with m arm\" Bot replied. \"Atch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ship raised, spun around quickly, stopped, and his satelitte dishes moved. TreeBark smiled, but he was interupted by missles. They each flew in, then a black fog blocked my view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Wilfre!\" I exclaimed. :What's with the fog?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You helped the last two teams out\" he replied, \"But your not helping this one out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to just see the black smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke behind us blocked our view. Taylor could not help us now. It was probably wilfre. I turned to Bot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we are on our own\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let do is!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI believe he said \"Let's do this!\" Bot was kinda wierd, but he was pretty nice. I had to think a little more to understand him. Deadwood was accompanied by the tank. Shadow Bats flew out of his branches, and headed towards us. I raised my Acorn Launcher, but Bot took the first shots. I fired my weapon afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha ill at o?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for it\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single acron hit a bat at the front, then the acorn split into fragments. More bats were destroyed in the process. Deadwood yelled, but more came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There has to be a way to defeat him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the branches, and saw pinecones. They each had a face on them, and matched Deadwood's emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bot, I have...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed his ship against me. I looked to the side, where a lazer fired. I looked down, and saw that tank. Before a lazer forms, a light shines in place of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bot, we need to get to Deadwood's branches\" I said. \"If we take out the pinecones on his branches, then we can defeat him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrigh\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Shadow Bats flew all around us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old on!\" said Bot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug my roots into part of the ship's hul. Bot looked mad, but he continued his plan. The two dishes began to move rapidly, and the entire ship began to fire. I just noticed that the ship shot blue orbs of energy. The bats were quickly defeated, and a loose ball of energy hit a pinecone and destroyed it. Deadwood screamed in pain, and the entire room shook. We looked at each other, and nodded. I flew off to get the pinecones, Bot went to distract the tank. I managed to get rid of two more, until I saw the light. I moved before it fired. I saw the last pinecone, and the light again. I flew in front of the pinecone, and waited for the lazer. At the last second, I flew away to get out away from the lazer.</span></div></div>",

However, I hit a hard sheet of metal. I turned and saw Bot with his ship. He smiled at me but a loud scream filled the air. Deadwood was screaming in terrible agony with his mouth wide open. The bottom of his mouth and his eyes were no longer visible. A small alarm sounded in Bot's ship, and he looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...going...on...?\" I managed to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBot just pointed to Deadwood, who's mouth was open. One of the leaves that fell from my damaged wing fell off and quickly sucked into his mouth. I saw the tank having trouble moving. The ship itself was being sucked in as well. I hung on for dear life as we entered his mouth. Everything was black at first, but something sparked. It was the remains of Bot's ship. Bot was beside it, looking very sad. Everything inside Deadwood was hollow. I saw that the tank started back up again and aimed at us. Suddenly, the entire room shook. Tentacles made of shadow formed all over the edge of Deadwood's body. It entangled the tank and completely destroyed it. A shadowy figure crawled on the top and then slammed on the ground. It had two arms, and a long curled tail that it used to stand up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilfre...corruption...darkness...\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....Deadwood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lunged at us but both of us managed to dodge it. My left wing was still damaged, so I couldn't do much. For some odd reason, Deadwood was only attacking Bot. He had no weapon either. I grabbed my Acorn Launcher and threw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bot catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBot jumped high with his spring leg and caught it. He rapid fired at Deadwood, hitting everytime. Deadwood started to fade, and Bot kept firing. Deadwood moaned in pain, and disappeared. A gust of wind blew us out, and the entire room shook. Deadwood's body glowed brighter and soon exploded. The dark mist cleared and everyone was revealed. Wilfre looked steamed.</span></div></div>",

Now that he's closer I can see a few details. He's about 5\"6\" and totally covered in what looks like a black, stealth, combat suit with a few pockets all along the body. <br>\r\n\"You think you can kill me!\" Wilfre laughs mocking this man. He didn speak, he just crouched in a ninja stance and ran at Wilfre and while running he pulled his short sword halfway out, jumped in the air and pulled it out, and swung at Wilfre who blocked with his staff. <br>\r\nStrangers point of view: What is this guy? He thinks, then Wilfre shoots sharp threads of shadows at me.

I pull out a syringe and inject a srum in my neck, a combo of nanobots and vital nutrients to give me a boost.

Than just in case we have to fight more...\"Gerel extends his arms outward as suddenly portals appear where his hands disappeared and pulled from them two black pistols with a blue to white bolt design on them. He hands the guns to Dante saying,\"I know they aren't Ebony&amp;Ivory but I think these are still your style. And this too.\" Then Gerel sticks his arms together outwards and pulls out a Crimsion red sword with runes on the blade and light black with red outlines to the handguard and hilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is shocked or surprised and Sierra asks,\"What did you just do?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, in my quest to return home or to other previously visited worlds my studies of space, time, portals, and other variables helped me include some of it in my powers. Like making a pocket dimension to store things. And in serious circumstances, a prison or battlefield to keep the target in and everything else out. Because of things like a pocket dimension I also try to; One, collect extra of everything and; Two, try to duplicate more unique things if possible.\" Gerel explains. <br>\r\nMale Taylor claps his hands once,\"Well! Now that that's out of the way, what do you guys say to us finding the room prisoners belongings should be in?\" Everyone nods and mutters in agreement and proceed to make their way up the castle. </span></div></div>",

Let's see just who wins this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to see this battle. Shadow and Spectra had gelatious bodies, meaning that they could change their shapes. Shadow could hide in anyone's shadow and take it over if it has a weak will. Spectra could shape his body into anything, like a sword or shield or something. The entire room cleared up, and the battlers took the stage. Scorpion threw his claws towards Shadow, but Shadow used his powers and hid in Scorpion's shadow. Wicker charged some lightning within his cloud and aimed it at Spectra. Spectra put out his hand and a small mirror formed. The lightning reflected off of the mirror and hit Wilfre. Wilfre looked even angrier when he recovered. Wilfre swooped down but Spectra jumped by turning his feet into a spring. He then changed into an anvil and slammed straight through the cloud. A large splat was heard, and black ink flowed underneath Spectra. Spectra got up and saw Wilfre. His scepter laid on the ground a few feet beside him. He slowly inched his way over there, but I walked over and picked it up. It grew to my size and I kept it. Wilfre's scorpion soon laud beside him with a large cut in it's head. Shadow had his sword out, but put it away when he returned to us. The cage around our friends disappeared, and we all met back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congradulations Master\" said Slice n Splice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilfre won't be a threat anymore!\" said Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so...uh....fast...\" said Wilfre.

The beast roared in absolute pain as breaking bones were heard. The creature grew, grew greater than what he was before. Its claws became misshapen but menacing, its stinger growing large. Four white eyes formed onto the now black armor. I backed away in horrid fear, others doing the same. \"I-I don't this received a Rated E for Everyone!\" I tried to joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Games have changed...\" he spoke in what was a deeper voice. \"In fact...its time to really show my power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scepter that was in my hands glowed a hot white, I had to let go. The scepter released seven different streams of what looked like steam. However when they settled, they were small ghostly incantations of the other bosses. They all looked surprised that they were there. But then, their faces took upon a look of fear. They were soon all sucked into Wifre's body. He roared in pain as his body went through more changes. Objects began to stick out of his body, parts growing and becoming misshapen; everything was horrid. \"Everyone get out!\" Luckily it didn't decide to take them long at all. However, the door was soon smashed by a giant black tendril; leaving me, Sierra, and all eight of my creations behind a wall of rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see the source of the tendril, and I regretted my decision. The black mass looked like a horrid mix of all of the bosses. I think I overheard Sierra puking. However, soon the mass ceased and reshaped. Four giant robotic legs formed from its base as it rose. Black shadow still swirled around the legs like wiring. A long tail snaked out, but he end of the tail looked like Frostwind! Only this version seemed to be black scaled and more menacing. As its body grew, dark wooden armor began to grow around it. Two arms stretched out, ending with black and evil versions of Angler King. Its shoulders gained laser cannons, similar to those found on the King and Queen ships. Its back sprouted two large branches, ending with a large collection of leaves. A ghostly aura formed around the monster as its head formed. It resembled the scorpion, but Wilfre's four eyes appeared in it. He roared, \"I AM THE ULTIMATE CREATION!\" His eyes glanced down at my creations as they charged. He chuckled loudly, \"You heroes are INSECTS to me!\" His large leg smashed the ground, throwing most off. His Blackfrost tail exhaled black ice, which froze Spectra and Shadow. The laser cannons made quick work of Bot's ship. The other heroes were soon defeated. It was then that the beast looked to me, \"WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY DO NOW?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn and bolted, hoping to escape. However soon a giant tendril grabbed me. I tried to fight as much as I could, but the tendril had me good. I was soon face to face with the beast, \"Surrender...and become my new slave, or I shall DESTROY YOU'RE FRIENDS!\" I looked to my creations, and then to the angel Sierra. She looked fearful, but I was not sure of what reason; the monster or my deal.</span></div></div>",

If everything that has happened today truly happened, then what was going to happen next would not fail. \"You may be the ultimate creation, but I am the Creator!\" I put my hand towards the ground. The scepter flung into my hand. The beast looked completely surprised. I focused my energy, and soon all of my heroes healed and floated before him. \"You're not the only one with an imagination!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swirled the magic scepter, my heroes lost their forms and soon joined together in one mass. I had to think long and hard to what went where. Soon, my creation began to take form. First thing formed was the body, which was Stumpy's body. But instead of a blob, it was a symmetrical armor-like body with a more detailed spiral in the center. Next, the legs. A sturdy wooden leg with vines growing in and out of it formed to his right, while a bulky mechanical leg formed to its left. The arms soon came, a multicolored right arm formed while a aquatic scaled hand formed. His shoulders were placed with two large subwoofers, a few other instruments forming on his back. However those were not the only things on his back. Two large bat wings, each with a sinister eye on the webbing, formed. Then, his head. The head appeared like Bot's, but of course, way more incredible. The beast looked startled. I jumped out of the tendril and landed on his shoulder. \"Say hello to the Creation Knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right arm formed into a rainbow sword before clashing with the beast's armor. The UC (Ultimate Creation) roared before charging. The two clashed, each trying to overpower each other. The branches of the UC shook, releasing hoards of Shadow Bats. However the Creation Knight fought back, using his speakers to blast the bats away. Blackfrost breathed his horrid ice, however the wooden leg caused vines to grow up and block it. \"ENOUGH!\" Both me and my creation was tossed back. When I looked up, I looked in horror. All parts of the beast's body was glowing, preparing a final attack. I do not think he could stand it. Before the beam fired, I was soon covered up. The blast was heard, but it was never felt. I was soon released, and found that we were behind the creature. UC turned and roared in anger, \"HOW DID YOU SURVIVE THAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't let him know the truth, so I winged it. \"The power of imagination will always prevail for good, not evil. Next time Wilfre...come up with something original!\" I focused my scepter, the hero merged into it. Then, with one fell swing, a giant beam of multicolored energy flew out. The beast roared in pain as it exploded. Energy surges destroyed the castle like it was made from building blocks. Light poured from all over. I was blinded by the massive amount of energy. When my vision cleared, I was...</span></div></div>",

They're gonna make me blow my fuse if I don't get a full nights rest. But, I shouldn't get mad or I'll end up like that Bombette chick. She blew up right next to Black Koopa and got put in a cage. Poor girl.<br>\r\nWe all got up (Well, technically we were already up, since we can't lay down) and walked single file down the hall to the outside of the fortress. There, standing right in front of us, was King Bowser! He looked as horrifying as everyone had said, and more! He had red fur and eyebrows. His shell was green and covered and spikes. His wrists and ankles had spiked braclets on them, along with his neck. His teeth were overbite and sharp. He was yellow and had two large horns on his head. Standing next to him on his left was Bowser Jr. On his right was nonother than the sorceress, Kammy Koopa.<br>\r\nBowser Jr. kinda looked the same, only his fur was in a pony tail. He held a paint brush and wore a bib with a monster's mouth on it. His braclets had no spikes on them, and the only place with braclets was his wrists.<br>\r\nKammy wore a purple robe and witches hat. She also wore glasses and rode on a broom with purple on the end. She held a golden staff with a red jewel on the top.<br>\r\n\"Alright! We're in buisseness with the top guys now everyone!\" Bowser yelled.<br>\r\nEveryone was quiet.<br>\r\n\"Which means you get more work!\" Kammy joined.<br>\r\n\"Yes, so-\" Bowser started. Before he could finish, one of the Bom-ombs set of and ran at Bowser. He bumped into him and Bowser picked him up. He turned the poor thing around and faced it towards himself and squished it in his mighty claws. It fell from his clutches and landed on the ground and clattered like a piece of metal. Everyone gasped, even the Koopa Bro.s. That was pretty heartless. Even for a bad guy.<br>\r\n\"So, I see you all like my new strength,\" Bowser said sinisterly. \"Why don't I demonstrate for you, just how much more powerful I am,\" he snarled. He walked by and stopped at a near by Bullet Bill launcher. He wacked it and out popped a Bullet Bill. He grabbed it and squeezed it. It popped due to all the pressure and Bowser flung it at the machine. It blew up. In all of this, I got somewhat interested in the destruction, so I walked out of line to get a better view. Kammy looked at me and shouted.<br>\r\n\"Bowser, looks like we have a wanderer!\" she shouted.<br>\r\nI quickly looked over to see her pointing at me. I ran into line and knocked over a few Bom-ombs and Koopas. Bowser marched up to me and glared at me with a sinister grin. He grabbed me and breathed on me.<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling generous right now,\" he whispered. \"But you are releaved of duty,\"<br>\r\nHe wound up his arm and flung me. Flew across the sky for sevral hours. It felt nice at first. Feeling the wind in your whick. A Bom-omb could get used to this... But It got boring. The sky started out bright and blue, but eventually it grew darker and darker. I eventually landed on the hard ground and was knocked out cold.</span></div></div>",

I looked around and saw that there was a huge crater around me.<br>\r\n'How did this happen?' I thought to myself. The memories flooded back to me after a while of thinking.<br>\r\n'Bowser...' I thought bitterly. I looked up and saw the changing of the sky from black, to violet, to pink and orange, and then the starting of blue. It was very pleasing to see the sky change colours again. It was even beautiful I guess, since I had been in that fortress for years, working nonstop, except to eat and sleep. However, my view got interupted by a pesky mushroom. Wait... Two? No, five! Twenty?! These aren't mushrooms! They're toads! I'm in Toad Town! I started frantically kicking and wobbling, trying to get out of there, but it was no use. I was in there deep. Three toads slid down into my crater and looked at me. They giggled and looked at eachother, then back at me.<br>\r\n\"This is our new favorite game!\" One of them said. They started kicking me!<br>\r\n\"Stop it! Knock it off! Don't think that just because you're kids I won't bomb you!\" I yelled.<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" Another yelled.<br>\r\nPLINK.<br>\r\nI fell on top of my head and rolled onto my face. I pushed all my wait to my back and pushed up onto my feet. I lit my whick and chased after those brats. Or, I would've if something hadn't stopped me. I took a few steps to start off, but after four steps, there was an awful screeching sound. It was so loud, it echoed throughout the town and everyone covered their ears, even those dasterdly little rats. I couldn't, cause I don't have arms or hands, but I could hear ringing in my head! It was awful! I started to run again, but that screeching sound came again, only this time my back felt like it was getting pierced by knifes! I looked behind me and saw something that any Bom-omb would see as a death sentence.<br>\r\nMy wind key was broken! Part of it was missing and what was still there was bent and shaped almost like a hook. My black paint had been scrapped off where the key had scrapped me and where Bowser had handled me. I felt like I was gonna throw up, if I had a mouth. (We Bom-omb's eat gun powder. You just unscrew us from the whick and pour it in) I collapsed on my side and started bawling. I wasn't sure if it was from the pain, or from the fact that my life was over. I could tell that the toads were focused on how to deal with a bom-omb ruining their town, but something grabbed me and carried me away. My eyes were so swelled with tears that I couldn't see who it was, but they told me to calm down and rest. After resting awhile, I opened my my eyes to see-</span></div></div>",

When we came out, we were at Toad Town. I got a little nervous, since those kids could be anywhere. Any who knows what kind of trouble I'm in for wrecking the center of town. Luigi just kept pushing me along until we made it to a sign the had the towns name on it. Before we left, a man garbed entirley in blue came running towards us.<br>\r\n\"Luigi! Luigi!\" He shouted.<br>\r\n\"What, Merlon?\" Luigi responded in shock.<br>\r\n\"I have for seen something in my crystal eye!\" The guy named Merlon gasped.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Something starnge is going on with the cosmos. The stars tell me that the universes are colliding and quarelling. They told me to tell you! For you have something they want!\" Merlon huffed.<br>\r\n\"What?! What's wrong with the universes?!\" I yelled horrifyingly. This was scary! I thought there was only one universe, the one I lived in. That's it. Nobody else. Just the little Mushroom Kingdom.<br>\r\n\"You!\" Merlon gasped as he pointed at me. \"They wanted you!\"<br>\r\n\"Me?!\" I choked.<br>\r\n\"Yes! The bomb with a broken key!

I'm just a cute little bom-omb! See?\" I said shakily. I started walking around, but the key scrapped my back again. \"Owwwww!\" I screamed.<br>\r\n\"Do not lie! You have a goal! And the only way to accomplish it, is to help restore order!\" Merlon said.<br>\r\n\"Okay! Fine! I'll do it!\" I cried. This guy is wacko. But, it would explain Bowser's strength without having the Star Rod...<br>\r\n\"That's all I have to say. Good bye,\" Merlon said as he left.<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Luigi sighed. \"That was weird...\"<br>\r\n\"Yea... Let's go...\" I suggested as we left Toad Town. We walked down a path until something caught my eye.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Luigi, do you see that?\"<br>\r\n\"What? Oh that...\" He replied.<br>\r\nIt looked kinda like a flat Blooper, smash from the top of his head, with really skiny and small tentacles. It was purple and black with white specks.<br>\r\n\"Bosst me up there, would ya?\" I asked. Luigi picked me up and set me on the ground up there. The shape was sucking things in like a weak vaccum. Leaves and dirt were getting sucked in to it. It looked pretty cool. I kicked a rock into it and it never came back so I got a decent sized tree branch and kicked it in. Same results.<br>\r\n\"What do you think it is?\" Luigi asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" I replied. It started getting a little smaller.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Its shrinking!\" Luigi exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"Let's go in it!\" I suggested excitedly.<br>\r\n\"Nuh, uh! No way am I going in there!\" Luigi stated. He stepped back.<br>\r\n\"Then I guess I'll see ya later!\" I said, as I jumped in. It was cold. And dry. It was very windy as well. I opened my eyes and saw things zooming all around me. Everything was moving. Even me. It was creepy. But finally, I swirled around and landed on my old friend, the ground. This time, I landed head first, so everything was upsidedown. I looked around and saw something really, really scary. WATER!<br>\r\n\"Ack! Help!\" I shouted. No one responded. \"Hello?! Help?!<br>\r\nThis time, someone did respond.

Bomb?\" Meta Knight said as he examined me.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm a bomb-omb from the Mushroom Kingdom!\" I shouted as I stepped back next to Sailor Dee.<br>\r\n\"A 'Bomb-Omb'?\" Meta Knight repeated, his eyes turning green.<br>\r\n\"Mushroom Kingdom?\" Tuff asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"That's right... I'm not from here... You wouldn't know about it...\" I sighed. 'Man... This place is just full of idiots...' I thought to myself.<br>\r\n\"Tell me about this 'Mushroom Kingdom', Boomer,\" Meta Knight said.<br>\r\n\"Well... Its ruled by a pretty princess named Princess Toadstool, but she prefers to be Princess Peach. She has servants called 'Toads' that serve her, and also live in Toad Town. But, my old boss, King Koopa, also known as King Bowser, uses his minions to kidnap the princess. I, uh, sorta did something wrong and got fired from my job...\" I explained.<br>\r\n\"What happened to the Princess?\" Tiff asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh! There are these plumbers called 'The Mario Brothers' that go on adventures to save her from Bowser's clutches. I was 'lucky' enough to meet one,\" I added blankly.<br>\r\n\"Boomer... What happened here?\" Meta Knight asked as he fingered my key.<br>\r\n\"Ow! Please, don't touch it!\" I whined. \"King Bowser broke it!\"<br>\r\n\"He broke it? What's it for?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know... I think its there to help me walk or something... But now that its broken, I can't run,\" I explained saddly.<br>\r\n\"That's terrible!\" Tiff cried angrily.<br>\r\n\"So that's why I'm on a mission to destroy Bowser!\" I growled.<br>\r\n\"Revenge is no way to act,\" Meta Knight said wisely.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, keep telling yourself that, fluffy, I have a King to kill,\" I said. \"C'mon Sailor Dee, let's go,\" I instructed as I walked off.<br>\r\n\"Bye' guys!\" Sailor Dee chirped.</span></div></div>",

It's doors were covered with red drapes and had three blue flags over top. Inside were many tables. Kirby happily jumped up and sat in one of the chairs. I sat next to him, and Tiff and Tuff hurried in. They were panting hard. Once they caught their breath, they looked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirby! You took him here first?!\" exclaimed Tiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do want to make a friend or make him sick?!\" exclaimed Tuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sick!?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's here?\" asked a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough some doors, a orange creature wearing chef attire walked in. He was carrying a tray full of dumplings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well hello Kirby\" he said. \"And who might this be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Chef Kawasaki\" said Tiff. \"This is Denjaa. He's new here and we were giving him the grand tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well have a snack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set down the tray of dumplings, and Kirby reached for it. Tiff and Tuff held him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirby, let him try some first!\" exclaimed Tiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to eat some before Kirby gets to them\" said Tuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped on that. I can eat, it just wasn't like them. A grabbed a dimpling and threw it above my head. The dumpling went down, and I saw everyone stare at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry\" I said. <i>I hope they don't recognize me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay\" said Tiff. \"Everyone is different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is it?\" asked Kawasaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tasted the dumpling, and it wasn't that bad. Better than what I usually get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" he replied. \"Someone other than Kirby that actually likes my food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the others, who looked like they knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone likes Kawasaki's food\" replied Tuff. \"But Kirby loves it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Kirby inhale the rest of the dumplings in a matter of seconds. I said my thanks and I toured the rest of the town. The town had nearly everything; a hospital, a library, a gas station, even a fossil place! I learned that the creatures were called Cappys, and everyone greeted me kindly. No one seemed to recognize me at all. Kirby seemed excited to show me the next place.</span></div></div>",

are caught in it.<br>\r\n\"So,why did Darth Vader try to attack me?\"I asked,pointing behind me.<br>\r\n\"The villains don't care about people.They are planning to hurt anyone that gets in their way,which means nobody is safe out here,man!\"Luigi said,shaking like a child who wet his pants.We both heard some kind of boo like cry,which sounded like it came from behind me.<br>\r\n\"Oh good...\"I was being sarcastic...which a big flock of boos,following a one big boo.This big boo was wearing a giant crown on the top of his body,which I quickly recognized as King boo!<br>\r\n\"Oh good!What the heck is this!?He's not in any video games!\"I yelled.<br>\r\n\"Uh...did you ever play a game called Luigi's mansion.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\"As soon as I said that,king boo went transparent...WHAT!?He had my boomerang inside it.<br>\r\n\"Hey!Get back here!\"I yelled,dashing towards the flock of boos.How did he get my boomerang?I probably dropped it,when I snatched onto Luigi...FUDGE!!It didn't take long,before I caught up to the boos,which I caught onto the tail of one of them.<br>\r\n\"Hello...thanks for the lift!\"I pulled myself onto of the boo,which he started flapping his arms,while we were both going downwards.<br>\r\n\"Get off!Who are you!?\"The boo asked...which for some reason...sounded female...<br>\r\n\"Oh...since when was a boo a girl?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Since we first appeared!Why do you think there's so many of us?\"<br>\r\n\"Well,I didn't really mind,I have a big stealer to catch!\"I then jumped off the boo,and onto another one,which I continued to do it,until I finally caught up,and onto the tail of King boo.He was completely unaware of my existence.<br>\r\n\"Hey,buddy...hello...HEELLLOOOOO!?\"I yelled,poking him...which wasn't doing anything.<br>\r\n\"HELLO!!\"I punched him...which still didn't make him stop,so I decided to climb up to his face...which he soon looked down at me.<br>\r\n\"Oh,hey,you don't know me,and I know you...but,you have something very important that is rightfully--\"He came to a complete stop,which sent me flying into a wall,with my back,breaking the fall...oh wait...<br>\r\n\"You dare touch King boo's face!?\"He asked,trying to scare me his with scary face...with his tongue sticking out.<br>\r\n\"I touched your face,because you need a breath mint.\"I said,pulling out an breath mint.Really,his breath does stink.I heard many boos laughing behind him.<br>\r\n\"GRAHHHH!!\"He pulled out his tongue,which I saw my opportunity...<br>\r\n\"Okay,I know that you're mad,but I have something that will calm you down.\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n**************Smack**********<br>\r\nHa!Surely fooled him!I pulled out his tongue,and let it go,which made him hit himself in the face with his tongue.The hit was able to knock out my boomerang,but...at a cost for having the whole flock of boos chasing after me.<br>\r\n\"Ha-ha-haha-ha!\"I mocked,sticking out my tongue,right before I turned a corner,and into an alley,which all the boos flew past the alley,some of them were screaming to get me.<br>\r\n\"*Idiots...why do I feel like i'm in a cartoon all of a sudden?*\"I thought.I peeked out from the alley,look left and right,then walked out of the alley,with my chest puffed out.<br>\r\n\"A sudden tough man,I see...\"That sounded like that girl boo from before,and she was right behind me.<br>\r\n\"Huh?I thought you were with the boos.You're not gonna call them back,are ya?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"No...in fact,I wanna say something.\"She said,as she floated around in a circle.<br>\r\n\"Look,I know that you're just a boy,and that you probably don't know what to say,but...may--\"She was interrupted,when a giant tongue shot out and grabbed her around her mouth,and most of her body,which the tongue pulled back...and into the mouth of Belome...that freakish eyed creep from Super Mario Rpg.<br>\r\n\"Blah!Too sweat!\"He said,as he stuck his tongue out in disgust.I couldn't believe he ate her in one go.<br>\r\n\"Hey,four eyes!\"I called,which he turned all of his eye into my direction.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,you.I suggest that you let go of my friend,before things get real ugly.\"I cracked my knuckles...but all he did was laugh.<br>\r\n\"I mean it!\"I added,which he laughed even harder.He was laughing so hard,he actually fell on his back,with a loud thud,and I could practically see tears coming out of eyes.I took the opportunity to jump up onto his stomach,while he was laughing,which he didn't even notice it.<br>\r\n\"Hey,boo,can you hear me?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes!Just get me out of here!It's really hot in here,it's like i'm inside a factory!\"She screamed.Belome was still laughing,which made me worry,if he's that easy to fool.I stood up,and quickly stomped on his stomach,as hard as I can,which he quickly stopped,and I could see one of his eyes drop a tear.<br>\r\n\"Ow!That really hurt.\"He whimpered,which I stomped on his stomach again,which he coughed up the boo girl,right into my arms.<br>\r\n\"Ew...\"She and I both said,right before I started running with her in my arms.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe,you actually came back for me.My name is Boo,by the way.\"She said.<br>\r\n\"Eh...not even a villain should do that do another person.\"I said,picking up my speed,but then I was stopped mid-way,for the tongue of Belome wrapped around my waist.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!He's gonna eat both of us...uh...um...\"<br>\r\n\"Blaze.\"<br>\r\n\"Blaze!What are we going to do!?\"Boo seemed really jumpy,in my arms...but,for some odd reason,he let go,with his tongue flailing.<br>\r\n\"EW-EW-EW-EW-EW!!\"Belome screamed,patting down his tongue with his stubby arms.I tasted that bad?<br>\r\n\"Uh...okay.\"<br>\r\n\"Blaze,now's our chance.We need to get him.\"<br>\r\n\"But,i'm not good or bad,i'm just a normal boy.\"<br>\r\n\"You are?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey!That's my meal.\"Belome stuck out his tongue,which I was certain he was after Boo.<br>\r\n\"Chance over...run!\"I yelled,which I was running at blazing speeds,with Boo following behind me.</span></div></div>",

Sora, Donald, Goofy, Riku, Micky, Roxas, Ventus, Aqua, Terra, Axel, Kairi.... That's all of the mostly good guys I can think of without using other shows the games use or using the bad guys. Some baddies are pretty much all of Organazation XIII, Malifcuent(even though she's from a movie) you could be a heartless or nobody or unversed but because they're pawns I wouldn't recommend it. Finally there's the Finally there's Xehenort who takes over Terras body and becomes Ansem in KH1 and Xemnas in KH2.

What they both don't realise however, is that Kora is really a glitch in the 'nobody' system. When Roxas and Namine were created, this glitch happened, forming Kora (<u>K</u>-airi. S-<u>ora</u> = Kora). She looks almost exactly like a female version of Roxas and instead of wielding a Keyblade like most other characters, she has the power to turn Heartless to her side. There is a limit to this power however. She can only control about 5 Heartless at a time, and it also weakens her for the next few hours. Later on, after the whole 'relationship with Roxas' thing, she turns bad, but I haven't got the plot for what happenbs there yet so bear with me. If you like the character Kora, I have a Twitter account for her, @KandyHeartKora. Please stick with the storyline and don't do anything stupid. I'll start her story off and then it's up to you.

I hadn't really thought the storyline through at first but now I have the whole thing planned out so I need to make a few changes clear. Firstly... She doesn't turn bad. Something else happens to her but I'm writing it in my fanfic and I want it to be a surprise. Secondly, I've changed the amount of Heartless Kora can control from 5 to 10. Also, I need to get a few character traits straight. She's quite shy at first and to someone who doesn't know her, they would think she is a giggly, childish, and cute girl. However, once you get to know Kora, you'll find she also has a very determined and compulsive streak. If you want to see the whole story as it is, then go to my portfolio to the file that reads 'Reflection - A Kingdom Hearts Story', or something along those lines anyway. Be warned though, I'm trawling through that <i>veeeeeeery </i>slowly, as I have like... 3 or 4 fanfics on the go at the minute, and I'm trying to complete my Star Wars fanfic first. But anyway, I'm gonna start this after Kora has met Roxas, Xion, and Axel and they've all become friends. This part of the story will be on a hot summer's day when Roxas has been spending the past two weeks at Castle Oblivion on a secret mission from Organisation XIII, seeing Kora only once or twice in that time. But today, he has completed the secret mission and he's ready to surprise Kora in Twilight Town, where she is sat, drawing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>{Roxas' POV}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a huge surprise for Kora. I hadn't seen her in ages and I felt I owed it to her to give her something for the trouble. I looked down in my hand at the handmade ice-cream charm for her beloved charm bracelet. I hoped she'd like it.  I stopped in my tracks and scanned round for Kora. She was usually in this area, but today I couldn't see her. Where was she? I carried on walking round, feeling thoroughly confused. There must be something important on for her to not be in her usual spot in Twilight Town. Maybe she was a t home. But why? I spotted Hayner and Olette across the square. I walked over to them, feeling thoroughly depressed.<br>\r\n     'Hey, has any of you guys seen Kora?'<br>\r\n     Olette shook her head slowly, but Hayner seemed to be doing some thinking.<br>\r\n     'You know, I think I saw her earlier. She looked like she was busy though, so she took off pretty quick.'<br>\r\n     My heart leapt, 'Do you know where she went?'<br>\r\n     'Uh...' Hayner looked around, 'Somewhere that way I think,' he said, pointing in the direction of the ice-cream van.<br>\r\n     'Thanks.'<br>\r\n     'No problem. Hey Roxas, I have to ask you-'<br>\r\n     But I had already shot off in the direction of where he had pointed. Sure enough, Kora was sat precariously on a ledge, drawing something. I had planned to sneak up on her, but it seemed that my mere presence had somehow alerted her. She looked up before I had even taken two steps towards her. A huge grin had spread out on her face. She seemed positively glowing. She dropped the sketch pad she was holding and skipped over to me, her hands behind her back.<br>\r\n     'Roxy!' she said childishly, hugging me. I hugged back gratefully.<br>\r\n     'Kora! I've missed you!'<br>\r\n     'I missed you too! Life has been dead without you. What was it that you were doing at C.O anyway?'<br>\r\n     I tapped my nose playfully. She sighed and shook her head, but she was still smiling.<br>\r\n     'Anyway, I have something for you!' she said, digging in her black satchel.<br>\r\n     I raised my eyebrows, 'You do?'<br>\r\n     'Yep!' she brought her hand back out of the bag and opened her palm, revealing a red, white and black frienddship bracelet. I looked closely at it, shockingly, I realised the black and white pieces of thread had the miniscule initials 'K + R' printed into them, in the opposite colours. I looked at it in awe.<br>\r\n     'Kora. H- how did you know what my favourite colours are?'<br>\r\n     Her face seemed puzzled for a split second, but the confusion cleared as soon as it appeared, 'Intuition. And... they're my favourite colours too,' she said, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n     'Awww. It's beautiful.'<br>\r\n     She looked at me worryingly, 'Do you want it?'<br>\r\n     I was stunned, 'Of course I do!' <br>\r\n     She smiled and wrapped it round my wrist, before tying it delicately. She looked pleased with herself.<br>\r\n     'Oh hey, I have something for you too!'<br>\r\n     She looked at me shyly, 'Aw, Roxas. You didn't have to.'<br>\r\n     I opened my palm again to reveal the little charm. Kora's face was full of delight.<br>\r\n     'Oh Roxas! Did you make that yourself!?'<br>\r\n     I just smiled as I handed it to her. She took it carefully, and attatched it to... a friendship bracelet exactly the same as mine. I looked at her, stunned. She blushed.<br>\r\n     'I- I just wanted our friendship to be special is all...' she trailed off, blushing furiously. I was blushing too. She seemd to be looking for something else to say.<br>\r\n     'So... ice-cream?'<br>\r\n     I grinned widely, 'Now how can I refuse that?'<br>\r\n     She giggled cutely and linked arms with me as we headed towards the ice-cream van. I saw Hayner and Olette again and waved, but they didn't wave back. In fact, they looked quite worried. I probably should have been worried too, but I wasn't, as at the ice-cream van, were Axel and Xion. I smiled as I realised Kora had planned all this. I smiled as I realised how lucky I was to have friends like them. Unfortunately, I didn't listen to the little, niggling worry at the back of my mind. If only I had...</span></div></div>",

Xion was the first to run up to Roxas. She leapt into his arms and he twirled her round. They were both laughing. I hid my jealousy. I knew Roxas couldn't feel love, but still...<br>\r\nAfter the giggles had subsided, Roxas let go of Xion and walked up to Axel. They gave each-other a brotherly hug. They pulled away and Roxas looked at me. He seemed completely content until he suddenly looked at me curiously.<br>\r\n     'Kora? What were you drawing earlier?'<br>\r\n     Oh no! The sketch pad!<br>\r\n     I cursed loudly and quickly ran to get it. Luckily it seemed no-one had tampered with it. If anybody saw what was in there... I began to flick back to the picture I had been doing but Roxas came round the corner.<br>\r\n     'Kora!?'<br>\r\n     'Sorry. It's just important this doesn't go missing.'<br>\r\n     His face spread into a mischeivous grin. He put his hands behind his back and sidled up to me.<br>\r\n     'Whyever not?'<br>\r\n     I blushed, 'It's private.'<br>\r\n     'Lemme see!' he said, trying to snatch it playfully.<br>\r\n     'Nooooo,' I laughed. 'Roxas don't!'<br>\r\n     He laughed with me, 'Aww. You're blushing! You look cute when you blush.'<br>\r\n     If possible, I blushed even more. He laughed.<br>\r\n     'Okay then. Let's go.' He linked his arm in mine again and led me back. I realised Hayner and Olette for the first time that morning. They were looking at me suspiciously.<br>\r\n     'Roxas? What's with Hayner and Ol-'<br>\r\n     'Kora!? Where did you go!?' Xion ran up to me and tackle-hugged me. I nearly fell over with the impact.<br>\r\n     'Woah! Calm down Xi! I was jsut getting my sketchpad.'<br>\r\n     'I wanna see!'<br>\r\n     Roxas grabbed her outstretched hand, laughing, 'That's a no-go zone Xion. She won't even let me see it.'<br>\r\n     'Oh.' Xion looked downcast. I giggled and looked at Axel.<br>\r\n     'You've been pretty quiet lately. You okay?'<br>\r\n     He looked at me, 'What? Oh, um. Yeah. Fine. Why do you ask?'<br>\r\n     I shruged, 'I dunno. You just seem away with the fairies.'<br>\r\n     He laughed, 'I always loved that saying.'<br>\r\n     I put my weight on one leg, 'Yeah... but you love everything about me anyway. No, wait. Eveyone loves everything about me.'<br>\r\n     It took Axel a moment to realise I was joking. He laughed and ruffled my hair.<br>\r\n     'Hey!' I said, pouting and pushing his hand away. 'You know I don't like it when you do that!'<br>\r\n     'I know. I just wanted to annoy you,' he said, laughing again. Roxas cleared his throat.<br>\r\n     'Kora? Where's my ice-cream?' he said, pouting.<br>\r\n     'Aww. Does ickle Roxy want his sugar rush?'<br>\r\n     He nodded, 'Yeah.'<br>\r\n     I laughed and dug in my pocket for my munny. I ordered 4 ice-creams and paid the woman at the ice-cream van before handing them out. It was then I realised something wierd. Roxas looked at me.<br>\r\n     'Kora? What is it?'<br>\r\n     'I may be wrong. But I could've sworn I just saw a blue person go down that alleyway...'<br>\r\n     Roxas laughed nervously, 'I think you need to lie down.'<br>\r\n     'No seriously. I just saw this blue dude go round that corner. I swear.'<br>\r\n     Roxas sighed, 'Well, if you're so sure. I guess we can go check it out.'<br>\r\n     That was all I needed I ran down towards the alleyway and... nothing.<br>\r\n     Roxas came up behind me, 'Told ya.'<br>\r\n     'But...'<br>\r\n     He put his arm round my shoulder, 'Come on Kora. Let's get you home...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As Roxas led Kora away followed by Axel and Xion. A naked blue man peered round from behind a trashcan.<br>\r\n     'That was close... Now. Where is Ansem?

As Bailey sat cross-legged on the floor of Lexaeus' old room, she tried to remember everything that had ever happened between them. Yet all she could remember, were those last, ironic words he had spoken to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku had killed him. That much was certain. She had heard the news from Xion a few nights ago. Xion usually came to check on Bailey. As Bailey wasn't allowed in Castle Oblivion, it was now Xion's job to make sure Xemnas didn't find out. It had been two nights since she's heard from her though. She probably figured since Bailey was upset, she didn't want to disturb her. Bailey stood up slowly and made her way over to the window. She used to come up to his room this way. He'd always be waiting for her. But not any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey placed her hands on the cold windowsill. The chill made her hands numb, but she didn't care. As far as she was concerned, nothing mattered any more. She stared out at the night sky, and a tear rolled down her cheek. She missed him. As she closed her eyes slowly, a new mwmory flashed across her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If I had a heart, it would belong to you...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had happened five days ago. When neither of them had any idea of what was to come. At the time, Bailey had imagined herself staying with Lexaeus forever. Even if they did argue. Sure, Lexaeus wasn't perfect. But who was? Truth was, Bailey loved him. Even though she promised herself not to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was their fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey sighed, her breath misting up the window. She turned round and walked over to Lexaeeus' bed. Bailey stared at it for a while. Remembering every memory they had ever had. And then. She cried. Really cried. Bailey fell to her knees and sobbed uncontrollably, her fists clutching the sheets, trying to bring back everything she had lost. After her tears had subsided slightly, she slowly climbed into the bed and cried quietly. As Bailey's tears slowly began to lull her to sleep, she made herself a promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I will never love another person again.'</span></div></div>",

Bailey and Lexaeus had split up various times because of Namine's jealousy. Bailey finally made her way to the door. A million speeches crossed her mind. But she didn't choose any of them. She flung open the door to reveal Namine sat in a corner, drawing as usual. She looked up slowly, and she couldn't hide the slight worry on her face. She knew what was coming. Bailey strode across the room and grabbed Namine by the hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What did you do!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamine whimpered, 'I- I...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey dragged her across the room, towards the window. The view went out to the area where Lexaeus had died. Bailey pulled Namine up and made her look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Look Namine! Are you happy!? Are you happy that he was put through so much stress, that he got angry and fought Riku!? This is your fault Namine!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey dropped Namine, fuming. Namine sat in a heap on the floor, looking scared. But Bailey wasn't finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't even have a heart! You never even loved him! I hate you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo any other person, this scene would have seemed deadly ironic. There wwas the girl with the blonde hair and white dress, cowering on the floor. While the orange haired girl clad in black skintight jeans and matching strappy top stood over her, fists clenched. While the real situation was, Bailey was the victim...</span></div></div>",

She could hear the hum of the ship, but she soon stripped away its fixtures, finding her companions thoughts within the spectrum.  As always, she could see their bonds to her, but oddly, Atton's seemed thinner than usual.  She focused upon him, intent on finding the source of this.  As expected, he had his barriers up, not keen on letting her into his thoughts.<br>\r\n<i>Please, Atton...  I need to know...</i> Meetra huffed lightly, trying to find a weak point in his barricaded mind.  There seemed to be nothing but anger and worry present.  There was no where she would be able to access entry to his thoughts, so she sadly decided to move along.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She went along to the one whom she had the strongest bond with; Visas.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Visas was not asleep, but meditating.  It had not been long since they had been aboard the Ravager and defeated Darth Nihilus, and Meetra was glad to view that Visas was at peace with what they had done.  Her bond with Meetra was one of respect and loyalty, and left the Jedi with a sense of happiness.<br>\r\n<i>How she continues to push forward is a mystery to me</i> erupted from Visas' thoughts.  <i>I can tell she is hiding something from us.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meetra furrowed her brows, slightly bitter that Visas was catching onto her.  She decided to move on to Mira.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mira was asleep, her thoughts and dreams floating on through the air.  It had been some time since Meetra had seen anything containing a thought of Hanharr, which brought her sheer delight, though, along with Visas, Mira had doubts for her.<br>\r\n<i>She's bound to break at some point.

It was true.  She had been dealing with a ton of stress.  She had destroyed 2 planets, Peragus II and Malachor V, and killed her mentor, who had literally and admitted to have been using her.  Not only that, but having visited Malachor V brought her unwanted memories and nightmares.

Luckily for him, he was almost finished and unlike all the other inventions that he had created so far, the one he was working on could help change the world for the better. That's what Tails thought anyways. He had managed to create a metal cube with a shiny red button on one of the sides of the cube. It also had a contrapment which allowed to put a small object inside the cube. The only thing that was missing however was that rare starman material that was rumoured to be in other universes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tails, whatya doing?\" Sonic asked as he entered the workshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just creating as usual.\" Tails replied, \"Need anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I found this weird purple diamond on the ground and... uh... I'm wondering if you know anything about it.\" Sonic handed the object to Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails examined the diamond carefully but he couldn't find anything. Curious, he tried putting the diamond inside his metal box and before he thought about it, he pressed the red button. Suddenly, the room started spinning and within a few seconds, the both of them passed out.</span></div></div>",

Apart from bats, spider girls and anyone having the occasional late night ice cream snack, it was uncommon for anyone to be out at this time. However, if one were to take a right at Scuttle town and take hours of hiking through sense jungle, one would find a being more then just up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRisky smirked as she slashed away at the underbrush, her arms not even tired. Her pirate hat was safely stowed in her scam to keep from damage, leaving her purple hair and red bandana out in the open. \"Just a little farther.\" She thought to herself. \"Those falls have to be around here somewhere.\" Normally, Risky tried to keep personal action to a minimum but tonight was a special night indeed. Tonight was the culmination of months of planning and years of story interpretation. Well...that and most of her Tinkerbats were too imcompitent for the task at hand. \"That half-genie brat might have ruined my last few plans, but when I'm done...ohh she will be at my knees.\" Pulling a map from her sack, Risky turned right at a crooked tree and heard the sound of rushing water. Upon this, she picked up her pace with an evil grin on her face. Exiting the brush, Risky found herself at the foot of a large waterfall coming from a cliff low enough to have been unseeable from above. \"Ammo Baron really came through on this bet, not only was he dumb enough to have never found this, but that fool gave me this treasure trove for a few cannonball. I'll have to thank that idiotic moron when I rule the world.\" Somewhere in this landscape was a way to gain power unlike anything this realm had ever known, and boy was Risky curious over what it was. Examining the base, Risky saw several slots of orbs cut into the rock. Whipping out her pistol, she shot into each hole, the bullets filling nicely.

However, it seems that I am wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Terra gave a stern, expecting frown. \"Are you talking something severe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Meta Knight just turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It is, isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally answered the question after a brief silence. \"Truth be told, I do not know the severity of these gateways, nor do I know the implications of their existence. The only thing that I do know for sure is that there is some large-scale presence behind this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra paused, and then sighed. \"So you're saying that some hands-on investigation is in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby finally spoke up once again; although usually he was content with just listening, there was one question on his mind. \"So, did you actually direct this gateway's, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not,\" the masked knight answered swiftly. \"However, I did know that it would appear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another question. How long have these been happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About a week. This is the ninth one that I can confirm having existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you can confirm?\" Terra walked up closer to Meta Knight. \"Does that mean that these gateways are--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temporary, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should hurry through this one if we're expecting it to close up!\" The green puff began to rush into the portal, only to be stopped by the masked knight anyhow. \"H-hey, what gives?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, at least listen to everything I have to say. I have one warning, and it is that these portals are VERY unstable. Even if we were all to walk in at once, it is not a guarantee that we would end up in the same place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What's wrong with--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Or anywhere at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quick and blunt answer made Terra remain silent for a long while. Kirby was the first to ask anything about what the knight meant. \"Um, can you explain what you mean...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The void. An area of, essentially, non-existence. There is no time, no direction. It is said that those who are taken in by the void remain there forever, with no way to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining some backbone again to speak, Terra continued the thought himself. \"So you're saying that it's possible that one--or all--of us could end up in the void.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby spoke out what his close friend was very much thinking. \"So what do we do, wait here until they get too troublesome? Plan an evacuation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why I wish to ask you, Terra. What do you believe we should do?\"</span></div></div>",

Was this the being responsible for the disappearances?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Only one way to find out...</i>' Without hesitation, Terra summoned the Rainbow Sword to him, and held it in a heavy guard position, ready for a confrontation. \"What...are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being didn't even give a single word back. It merely floated a good few feet away, readying some form of attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ech...!\" Reacting on a whim, the green puff jumped back slightly and switched to his Ice element, quickly pounding the ground and causing a large wall of ice to come up in front of him. For insurance, he made sure to put his standard Ice Guard up, as well, still holding his blade in a guard position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed, energy-based wings started to materialize just behind the strange being, as the charging began to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra, on the other hand, began to seem impatient. He knew the icy barrier wasn't gonna stay up forever on its own. '<i>C'mon, if you're gonna hit me...!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor better or for worse, the humanoid launched its attack with devastating speed: a shockwave that ruptured all of the buildings around it, shattered the icy wall, and sliced through the near-impenetrable guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-gyah...!\" Not expecting such a devastating result from the attack, the Star Warrior was immediately thrown off his feet, and hurtled straight into some of the rubble behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ergh...\" Despite the strong hit, though, Terra quickly stood himself up once again, now holding the blade in a more offensive position. \"Hmph! Let's see how you deal with my counter...!\" Switching to his Electricity element, the puff shot through in a sprint, at a speed that was difficult to follow with the unguided eye, on a collision course to the being. As soon as he got in range, he shot out even faster, dealing a Supersonic Lunge at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was able to stab clean through the mysterious humanoid, but it didn't even seem fazed...</span></div></div>",

C-c'mon...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the humanoid being summoned an elliptical blade around its hand, and plunged it straight into the Star Warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-YAGH!\" Heavily injured, and struggling to keep his grip on the Rainbow Sword, Terra still wouldn't give in to his pain. Continuing to pull, he finally manages to take the sword out, and uses it to slash the being back, causing him to be freed of the countering blade and fall hard to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-hah...h-hah...\" Continuing to fight against his pains, the green puff stands up, only to see the humanoid before him charging another attack. Realizing this, he switches again to Ice and attempts another Ice Guard, but it's rather certain it wasn't going to block a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the attack was fully charged, the sound of a humming jet engine was heard whizzing by. It was too quiet to be the Halberd taking flight, so what was it? Terra looked up to see the fresh afterburn of a jet having just passed through. '<i>What...?</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and uncertain, the Star Warrior looked back towards the being he was facing to see a laser coming straight at him. Unable to move in his current state, he did the only thing he could manage...protect himself, lower his head, and brace for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrace for an impact, that never came. The laser was still audible, and rang deafeningly through Terra's ears. He could even hear it impacting some object, and yet he felt nothing pushing against him, or even harming him. Confused once again, he raised his head and lowered his guard, to see a certain blue, hexagonal reflector completely negating the laser as if it were nothing. \"What the...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds had passed, the laser finally began to dissipate, and, in reaction, the reflector started to dissipate as well, revealing a strangely human-like fox, clearly with a knack for weaponry and technology that the Star Warrior himself had no familiarity with. First a blue phantom-like human attacking him, and now an anthropomorphic fox saving him? Today certainly wasn't going to be a normal day, by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox, who seemed to come out of nowhere, finally broke the strange silence. \"Huh. Seems I got here just in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Nova's name...?! Who are you, and what are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Fox. Fox McCloud. I assume you must be Terra. I don't have much time to explain, but I'm here to help you guys get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me...?!\" Obviously taken aback by this sudden statement, the Star Warrior began to grow frustrated with this apparent ally he just met. \"I-I demand an explanation as to why!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. That's just something I don't have time to tell you completely, but, it has to do with Tabuu being here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tabuu...is that the name of that thing...?\" Terra once again raised his sword, threatening to turn against Fox. \"How do you know of it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, just trust me! We don't have much longer before it'll destroy the entire place, and us along with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Now</i> will you work with me?! I promise you that I won't hurt any of the three of you, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...! Fine!\" At this point more annoyed than anything else, Terra turned around and, switching back to his Electricity element, started to sprint, before falling flat on his face due to his injuries. \"G-gah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Seeing the Star Warrior in obvious pain, Fox grabbed him, tucking him beneath his arm before running off himself. \"Just tell me where they are. The sooner, the better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right...\"</span></div></div>",

Please, Terra, grant me your trust with this course of action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra groaned in initial response, shutting his eyes and pondering over the decision. He knew Meta Knight had a point. On every account, even. They couldn't even think of combating that entity by themselves, and even if they <i>did</i> believe that they could, they still wouldn't be about to pull it off without gaining more information on that apparition, and Nightmare, like it or not, was their only known source for that information. They had to give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an elongated sigh, the green puff shook his head, finally giving an answer. \"Like you said, I wish we didn't have to, but we obviously do. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. We should be arriving soon, so I suggest you two get ready to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, despite staying completely silent the whole time, Kirby was the first to answer. \"Hah! Thought you'd never ask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth he and Terra raised one arm up, attempting to call upon their weapons of legend, the Star Rod and Rainbow Sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But, neither one showed, eliciting a facepalm from Terra. \"Of course we wouldn't be able to call for them,\" he spoke in a somewhat soft tone. \"They were both likely destroyed with Pop Star!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is the case,\" Meta Knight calmly intervened, \"then we must simply be more careful than we even initially planned. Stay cautious, as we are approaching the base...\"</span></div></div>",

They both seemed similar to one another, although one was clearly younger than the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya!\" the younger one quickly exclaimed, smiling a bit. \"Glad you're awake, finally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-finally?\" Terra cocked his head slightly, still in pain. \"What do you mean, finally? Where am I? Who are you two? Where's Kirby and Meta?! How long have I been--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, calm down,\" the older one cut the green puff off, \"we'll answer all that and more, I promise.\" He hesitated. \"Well, almost all of them. I'm not exactly sure who you mean by 'Kirby and Meta'. Are they friends of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Terra spoke hesitantly. He wasn't very quick to just up and trust everyone he meets, much unlike his 'brother'. \"But can you at least answer my first two questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. The first thing I should answer is who we are. I'm Pikachu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Pichu!\" the smaller, younger mouse added. \"We're brother and sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes, we are.\" Judging from the slight surprise on Pikachu's face, it's clear that he wasn't expecting his younger sister to butt into the conversation just then. \"As for your other question, we were both pretty shocked to even see you open your eyes again. We tried all sorts of berry and seed mixes, and not a single one of them worked even a bit to help you heal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Well, of course they wouldn't work,</i>' Terra began to think to himself. '<i>They'd never be able to work on me...</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we've been housing you for two weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks. The thought of that length of time bounced around in Terra's mind for a bit before it finally clicked, and the reality of that crashed down. \"WHAT?!\" Completely ignoring his injuries this time, regardless of the severe pain, he jumped up to his feet. \"Did you just say two weeks?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, calm down, please. That's not exactly helping...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Terra quickly sat down. \"Okay, fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually surprised, though. You got out almost without a problem. Maybe you'd like an Oran Berry?\" Pikachu shuffled through a bag he had with him, until he finally got a small, plump berry with a blue hue to it out and showed it to the puff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'll pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" the sister once again interrupted. \"It's good for you, promise--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about this, Pichu.\" Pikachu pointed outside. \"How about you go out and play for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" She went hastily outside, without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, at least now I can try to explain everything. I'm sorry you had to deal with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra simply smirked at the mouse's comment. \"I'm more used to dealing with that level of energy than you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, is that right.\" Pikachu quickly shook his head.  \"Well, we'll talk about that stuff some time later, um...\" He then blushed lightly, embarrassed. \"Sorry, but I don't think I actually caught your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" The puff stood himself up once again, although he started to cringe in pain, and held out his hand. \"Th-the name's Terra,\" he stammered through clenched teeth. Now that the small adrenaline boost was over, he was once again feeling that harsh pain that was forcing him to stay lying down before. That didn't keep him from trying, though, as he extended his hand towards the small yellow mouse. \"A pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu hesitated for a while before finally extending his own forepaw to Terra and shaking hands. \"Right. Nice to meet you.\" He then quickly made a motion as to tell the puff to sit himself down. \"Seriously, though, you need a bit more rest. What's the rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-I still don't know if Kirby and Meta are okay...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Pikachu asked a similar question. \"How did you get yourself so hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a sudden attack. Our attacker...we have no clue who it was. It appeared out of nowhere, and took me out as easily as anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds kinda nasty...and I'm sorry for your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'd be happy to help you, then.\" Pikachu then managed a small smile, trying to comfort Terra.</span></div></div>",

Stop your bluffing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I\u2019m fine\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse just sighed heavily. \u201cWell, whether what might come along is your problem or not, you\u2019re not going to be able to fight them alone if this is your condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I see I can\u2019t dissuade you two.\u201d Terra sighed slightly as well in response. \u201cHopefully, I\u2019m wrong, and I\u2019m safe here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, so let\u2019s not worry about all that nonsense,\u201d Pichu answered, speaking up and putting on a rather innocent smile. \u201cSo, what\u2019d you guys need me for, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d Pikachu gave a quick nod. \u201cWe need a little bit of help in getting Terra here to blend in a little better. Think you can do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the fellow sibling\u2019s seeming lack of confidence, the young sister nearly gave a scorn, instead turning it into more of a standard frown. \u201cC\u2019mon, bro, of course I can do that! This is an easy one! I\u2019m pretty sure I even have something ready for what you\u2019re probably thinking of!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do? Let\u2019s get back home and get it set up as quickly as possible for him, then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the three began to rush back, hoping to get this disguise done before Terra causes any commotion.</span></div></div>",

Carson is a supergenius all around and excels in making smart weapons that follow his lead in battle. He also can make robots out of even the most rediculus things. Steel is by far the stronger one, and has the ability to take metal parts and mold them into the things he needs. The can also make his weapons move on their own but it is taxing on him. They both are linked telepathically so they know what is going on with eachother.<br>\r\nPersonality: Steel is more laid back and fun to be around. He smiles even when he fights so he is really hard to read. He is not stupid and likes going in with a plan. Carson is alot more cold and calculated, but he has his own sense of humor that his brother understands. Of the two Steel is more willing to flight and neither belove that they are stinger than the other. If asked, they will say that a fight between the 2 of them will end in stalemate because they are evenly matched.<br>\r\nLooks: Steel has gray hair and gray eyes he usually dresses in black and orange themed clothes. His hair is somewhat longer and is undergroomed. Carson has the same hair, but his eyes are piercing blue. People don't like looking at his face because his eyes are too scary but he has a kind heart. His clothes are usually business like and are dull.<br>\r\nGoals: They bothwant to find their real family and are both good guys they will protect each other and their friends.<br>\r\nChoose these 2?</span></div></div>",

These two warriors stood there just staring each other down as the battle raged around him\u2026but the square was the calm eye of this raging storm. Unbeknownst to either man there was a third lying prone on the roof of a building surrounding the square\u2026he was targeting the man in the black armor, he was breathing slowly, and on his exhale of breath he\u2026rolled out of the way barely dodging the powerful slash of a murasama. The man looked up to see a man with long silver hair wearing a long black leather coat.<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u2026Magoichi,\u201d the man taunted preparing to slash him in two\u2026but his attack was intercepted by another man with one eye and wearing a Japanese helmet with a golden crescent on it\u2026Date Masamune\u2026the one eyed dragon of Oshu.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you run along Sephiroth,\u201d Masamune taunted him\u2026but he did not notice the man in the red leather jacket leap onto the roof from the other side of the square a longsword with a hand guard held tightly in his hand.<br>\r\nAs the man approached Masamune another figure appeared on the roof intercepting the man in red\u2019s attack.

Cloud swung horizontally at Dietrich but he simple ducked to avoid the attack\u2026Cloud swung three times but each time Dietrich evaded them but on the last one he back flipped away\u2026Royal Guardsmen flooded into the square hoping to finally capture Dietrich\u2026but as they approached him the sound of gunfire ripped through the square\u2026Shinra troopers had been hiding in the rubble and began gunning down any and all enemies. Cloud was shielding the wounded Link from the gunfire to the best of his ability but many bullets were hitting dangerously close to his downed ally\u2026but then Magoichi rushed in with several of his renegades to provide fire support for the trapped Guards\u2026and to extract Link and Cloud\u2026all while this was going on Dietrich just stood there completely unfazed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the city Wu forces led by Sun Jian were closing in on a small group of PSICOM soldiers protecting several strange rings\u2026as the Wu forces closed in on the PSICOM forces one of them began tapping buttons on his gauntlet which caused the rings to glow brightly\u2026all of a suddenly beast leapt out of the portals\u2026they looked like deformed wolves that had been armored in technologically advanced armor\u2026but they were just as dangerous as they began shredding the now panicked Wu forces\u2026Sun Jian was attempting to maintain order and bring his soldiers back in line but then the largest portal began glowing and from it leapt a huge beast that was almost as large as a ship\u2026it was armored from head to toe and on its back was a set of gatling guns which it began firing\u2026Sun Jian then lost complete control of his army at this point and seeing the battle was lost ordered the retreat\u2026the PSICOM forces let out a cheer and the large behemoth reared back on its hind legs and roared\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArumat and the White Knight were standing in the throne room their weapons drawn\u2026Arumat was wielding a purple scythe with a green laser blade\u2026the White Knight was wielding a common Broadsword...they were here to protect the princess who was sitting in her throne girded for war and a bare Rapier was sitting in her lap\u2026the sounds of combat could be heard in the hallway\u2026the clang of swords connecting with shields\u2026the screams of dying men\u2026and then silence\u2026the battle in the hall way was over\u2026the doors to the throne room were thrown open and in marched knights in white robes adorned with a black cross with black steel gauntlets, and horned helmets\u2026the legendary Teutonic Knights\u2026and the soldiers sent here to capture the princess.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready kid?\u201d Arumat inquired a small smile crossing his face, \u201cBecause they aren\u2019t about to wait for us.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that Arumat charged the Knights quickly cutting down two of them as the White Knight appeared next to him and cut down two more\u2026this battle would be to the death\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the City Wei Forces led by Cao Cao were engaged with evil Warlord Dong Zhou.

We both charged at each other locking our weapons together.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s you,\u201d I whispered, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to fall today I\u2019m glad it\u2019s at your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSame here,\u201d he whispered back sadly, \u201cbut I still don\u2019t like this\u2026why are you fighting us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause\u2026if I don\u2019t then nothing will be done,\u201d I stated calmly, \u201cShe is lazy and childish\u2026maybe my betrayal will inspire her to action.\u201d<br>\r\n-Present Day-<br>\r\n\u201cI gave up my wings and my body to aid them,\u201d I sighed gazing up at the moon, \u201cMy new form can\u2019t sustain my magical abilities but it can prevent me from dying now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Arumat knew?\u201d Genesis inquired.<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt it\u2026dragons are rare and I doubt the queen is foolish enough to mention that she misused a dragon\u2019s talents\u2026the people would jump ship in droves,\u201d I smirked, \u201cHow was he supposed to know that he swore an oath of brotherhood with a dragon\u2026but that is for another time\u2026we go to battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotes-<br>\r\nDietrich-<br>\r\nRace-Human (Dragon)<br>\r\nBio-He is a dragon that gave up his true form to aid the princess\u2026she is the only one who knows his true form\u2026but when she underused his talents he sought to lead an uprising but his human form is unable to unleash his most powerful abilities without destroying his current body but if he should somehow die he can use his draconic spirit energy to possess a new body and change it to his original human form or recreate his original human body\u2026he is unable to obtain his dragon body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The White Night was running along down the corridors, following Arumat and the princess. However, his mind was elsewhere. Not only was he worried about the princess, but Arumat was bleeding pretty badly. His mind started to wonder. Where were they going to go? How were they going to keep the princess safe? Were Arumats wounds fatal? Finally he asked the question that everyone was thinking.<br>\r\n\"Does anyone know where we're going?\" he said, stopping in the middle of the corridor.<br>\r\nThe other two paused and turned to look back at him. They turned to look at each other. Before Arumat answered \"I may not know were we should go, but I know a place were we can be safe. I have a friend who operates his own sanctuary. He lives alone and runs the place by himself, and he should help us.\" <br>\r\n\" If he remembers you,\" the Knight continued.<br>\r\n\"I sure hope he does, because if he doesn't, and he thinks we are enemies, he can be force to be reckoned with.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then, lead the way my friend,\" the knight said, a bit of anxiousness in his voice. <br>\r\nWhen they got out of the corridor and above ground, they to a nearby stable and took three horses and all the appropriate supplies. On the way out, they qll left more than enough money to pay for everything.<br>\r\nIt was a full days ride, and when they got there, they were tired and hungry. The first thing they noticed was the perfect squaring of everything. The entire outside wall was made of perfect three foot by three foot blocks of what appeared to be stone bricks. The doors were in a similar faahion, but whith blocks of wooden planks. Arumat walked up to a very square wooden button and pushed it. The sound they heard sounded synthesized. The button wasn't pushed often apparently, because what could then be a heard was a yell and crash, like someone falling off of scaffolding.<br>\r\nThere was then the sound of moaning. \"Hold on. Hold on. I'll be there shortly,\" the apparent source of all the commotion said.<br>\r\n\"Oh, and just a warning, he can be a little bit wacky,\" Arumat wispered.<br>\r\nOne of the great doors opened, and the thing that appeared before them confused both the white night and the princess. It was a creature made entirely out of blocks. He was six feet tall and appeared to be a machine. His primary colors were blue and silver, with  a silver eye rite in the middle of his face. He had silver shark-like fins on the side of his head.<br>\r\n\"Hello strangers,\"the thing said.\"The name's Verb.\"<br>\r\n\"Good to see you again old friend,\" said Arumat.<br>\r\n\"Good to see you too,\"said Verb, giving Arumat a firm handshake. Despite being made of blocks, Verb could move just like a human. <br>\r\n\"May we come in,\" asked Arumat.<br>\r\n\"Certainly. Come in, come in,\" Verb said with great haste.<br>\r\nEveryone huried in and Verb closed the door. What was on the inside was even stranger than on the outside. It was a huge zoo. No ordinary animals, though. This zoo was populated with everything from dinosaurs to a giant flying blue and black squid in a giant glass bubble.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my humble abode,\" said Verb, a slight hint of playfullness in his voice. He had no mouth. But his eye was flashing with every sylable. <br>\r\n\"Yes, well, it certainly is lovely, but we have more pressing matters to attend to.\" Arumat said, with a slight sense of urgency.\"Oh yes, before I forget. These are my associates, the white night and the princess.\"<br>\r\nVerb took a look at both of them. If he had had a jaw, it would have dropped to the floor. \"Oh my goodness. Pardon my memory, your majesty, for I didn't recognize you immediately,\"he said, bowing to the princess.<br>\r\n\"We have no time for these trivialities. Please, do you have anywhere safe and secure that we can talk,\"asked the white night asked urgently.<br>\r\n\"Of course I do,\" Verb replied, a little insulted.\"Do you think I am an idiot,\"<br>\r\n\"My apologies,\" The night said. \"Can you take us there now please.\"<br>\r\n\"Most certainly,\"Verb replied, leading them off through his park composed entirely of creatures maxe of blocks.</span></div></div>",

Alright we're off to the video game world to save it.\" Princess Sierra said while she was chanting something unintelligible as a blinding beam of light transported both our hero and heroine out of the castle and away from Mauricio's home territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the two eventually ended up arriving at...</span></div></div>",

It is a simple prophecy, and it is displayed countlessly in various forms. It is the prophecy of the hero, the victim, and the villain.  The hero has immense power; though, the hero doesn't necessarily have to be considered \"good\", they are just merely there at the aid of the victim.  The victim is under siege of the villain and seeks the aid of the hero; a victim usually has something or can do something worthwhile that encourages the villain to seek them out.  The villain is at war with the hero, trying to maintain control over the victim; not all villains are \"evil\", they are just against the hero and seek to exploit the victim to achieve some greater purpose.<br>\r\nI am Princess Sierra.<br>\r\nYou are our final hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RULES</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>Video game characters and manga/anime characters are allowed</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>Fan Characters and Original Characters are allowed; Self inserts are encouraged</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>Romance is allowed; no erotica</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll add more rules if necessary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add, rate, and comment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><b>NOTES</b></div><br>\r\nUpdate: We reached 200 chapters on August 1, 2011<br>\r\nUpdate: We've had our first anniversary!
