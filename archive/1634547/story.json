As Ashoka strode deeper into the temple she noticed writing on the walls. It looked very much like the few pieces of physical writings that existed in the jedi temple that she saw before order 66. Ahsoka makes out something about a creature with endless hunger and a constantly growing mass. It may have something to do with why there's no life on the planet. Her belly gives an ominous gurgle. As she rubs it, it changes from a gurgle to a growl. \"Oops. Guess it's time to eat.\" She'll mutter to herself. With that statement, lights turn on, temporarily blinding Ahsoka as she hears machines running deeper in the temple. \"Come in further, this plenty for you to eat inside.\" At this point</span></div></div>",

Ahsoka was about to say something when she felt a tingle in her belly and coming to her butt. She then saw the town and people right behind her butt and she knew if that cart were to hit them they would be blown away or die because of the smell. So she turned her butt around to an open area and let it lose. Ahsoka felt the cart and to her it sounded normal but she silenced people in fear and pain because of how loud and destructive it is.

She remembered being scolded by Anakin once for ignoring orders, only to have Obi-Wan to comment wryly that she was learning more from her master than he perhaps meant to teach.  She'd always been proud to have the same independent streak as Anakin -- to be like him in so many ways --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid that mean that somewhere, deep down inside her, was a Sith?  A traitor?  A merciless killer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Forgive me.... Ahsoka,\" the voice in her head whispered.   \"But you <i>must</i> eat.   And you will find little to appeal to you on this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I shouldn't do what it says</i>, Ahsoka thought.  On the other hand, it was telling her to eat.  She could hardly refuse to ever <i>eat</i> again!   And she was ravenous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she should leave the holocron here, but -- well, it wouldn't do for someone unwary to stumble across it, would it?   She scooped it up and carried it to her waiting ship.  When she opened up the storage locker, she found a nasty surprise inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master An -- I -- I mean -- Anakin -- \" she stammered, before she realized the specter in front of her wasn't a Force ghost at all, but merely a recorded hologram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Snips.  Sorry I was too busy to see you off.  I'm going to ask one of the droids to slip this into your locker so I can wish you luck.   Hope you manage to find that thing.\"  The blue image of Anakin grinned.  \"Bring me back a souvenir, would ya?  A real authentic ... well, I guess all they have is rocks, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe features distorted as Ahsoka grabbed the hologram generator.  She felt hot blood pulsing in her temples and along her lekku, and pain in her throat.   She didn't know whether she wanted to lay her head against his shoulder and weep or drive her lightsaber through his heart.  <i>Had you already decided to betray us when you recorded this?  Or hadn't you made up your mind yet?</i>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crushed the little generator in her first, feeling the tiny components crumble through her fingers.  Something deep inside her told her this was wrong, that letting rage roll over her like this was exactly what she <i>shouldn't</i> be doing... but she was so angry.  Angry ...and horribly, gnawingly hungry.   Her stomach felt like it was eating itself alive.   <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nI just need something to eat</i>, she thought, rubbing tears from her eyes, <i>just a little something and-- and then I'll be able to think clearly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" said a little voice in the back of her head, almost too softly for her to hear.  \"All you need is a little snack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she'd first entered the restaurant, cloak drawn tightly around herself, the breathlessly repeated rumor had been that Anakin was dead, cut down in single combat with Obi-Wan.   Hearing that had twisted Ahsoka's stomach into knots as grim satisfaction warred with grief.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't true, however -- not if you could trust the holonet news, which was reporting now that \"Lord Vader\" had survived the \"cowardly murder attempt\".   Apparently the press knew which way the wind was blowing.  The names of the dead Jedi were reported as if they were criminals cut down fleeing the scene of the crime.  Master Luminara, dead.  Master Plo, dead.  Master Windu, dead.  Master Yoda -- reported dead, but no body had yet been recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Meaning they didn't get him</i>, Ahsoka thought when she heard that.  At least there was one bright spot in the litany of horrors.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted in her seat.  In the grip of misery and that strange, all-consuming hunger, she'd gorged herself on a mountain of junk.  Now that the cravings had receded, she felt bloated and sluggish.   Not good.  She was a fugitive, now, after all; what if she had to defend herself?   Right now she didn't even think she could <i>move</i>, she was so heavily distended with gravy and starch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No one knows where you are,</i> the voice said.   <i>Eat your fill!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ahsoka had had more than her fill already, and the thought of more made her want to throw up.  What had possessed her to eat like this?   It was so... undisciplined.  Not the Jedi way at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess I'd better learn the non-Jedi way to do things, hadn't I?</i> she thought miserably.   She'd never been so alone in her life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not alone,\" said the little voice.  \"You've got me.\"</span></div></div>",

Chancellor Palpatine had granted himself supreme power, power allowed by a corrupt senate of incompetent politicians.The Jedi Order had been eradicated, few had survived the culling. The few that did were being hunted like animals across the galaxy. Ahsoka knew she was in grave danger, that every moment she spent in Republic space could be her last. The voice seemed to disagree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you worry for your life child? You slipped through the cracks, the Empire cares not for! Live the life you have been so graciously granted, enjoy it for what it's worth. This meal is delicious is it not? You should have some more.\" said the voice in her head..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Urp* \"Ugh...no more.\" Ahsoka thought, the cramping in her stomach worsened at the mere thought of another bite. \"I can't just sit here and gorge myself like this, I'm not safe. All it would take is one Clone Trooper to recognize me for it all to end. Why can't you understand that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was silent. Ahsoka liked to think it was because she had a point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of the survivors? There has to be a few, the Jedi are too tenacious to just be taken out like this! I'm one of the last of the Order, it's my duty to come to their aid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet if they do survive, they seem not to care for you?\" The voice finally replied. \"The Order is full of selfish fools, and narcissistic hypocrites. They care only for their own lives Dar-I mean Ahsoka. They created the Order to give themselves a fixed amount of power over the Galaxy. Even to the very end they were concerned with holding onto as much power as they could muster. Even to the very end they fought for the sake of a corrupt ruler, if only because that was the easiest way of continuing their own existence. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wrong! The Order has helped billions across the galaxy, we are selfless in our actions! I know what you are, a scheming Sith, trying to turn me from the Jedi path. You hold no sway with me, I will seek out the remaining members of the Order, and we will combat this evil that has swept the galaxy. No matter how much you want me to just sit back and stuff myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka contemplated where to go next. It was obvious that she needed to leave Republic space as soon as she could, but where? Ahsoka weighed her options. Tattooine was far outside of Republic control, but the memories of Anakin were tied heavily to that scorched rock. She had heard tales of Jedi Adepts who had long left the order, making their home in the Shadowlands of the wookie homeworld Kashyyyk, but recent radio chatter had spoken heavily of a war being raged between Empire Clone Troopers and the Wookie natives, she would be putting herself into too much danger to seek out Jedi who might not even be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Nar Shadaa! Eureka!\" Ahsoka said aloud, attracting the attention of the diner's patrons. \"Uh...ignore that everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNar Shadaa was perfect, a sprawling metropolis of low-lives and thugs, a planet entirely out of the Empire's control and directly under that of the Hutt syndicate. The Hutts never tolerated Republic interference and it had managed to stay entirely out of the Galactic War because of it. It was the perfect place to lose yourself in, to become another faceless entity in the crowd. Even the most skilled force adept would find it near impossible to pick out a Force User in the sea of bodies. The perfect place for a Jedi to hide themselves, and the perfect place for a Jedi to be found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Nar Shadaa\" the voice said perking up, \" I see we are on the same page then. Hutt planets are known for their delicious and fattening foods afterall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not listening to you!\" Ahsoka thought intently.</span></div></div>",

Her thoughts kept drifting to everything and everyone she'd lost, but she forced herself to be vigilant.  A lone girl on Nar Shaddaa could be a tempting targets for thugs, thieves, and worse.   Not that she had much to fear from garden-variety lowlives; in fact, she almost hoped someone did try something.  She could use the exercise.  After all that time in the pilot's chair, she felt soft.  Sloppy.  She knew it was mostly her imagination, but she wanted to <i>keep</i> it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of her shone the bright incandescent lights of the Meltdown Cafe, which a few subtle inquiries had indicated was the best place to find a bounty hunter.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a bite to eat,\" the voice suggested.  Ahsoka frowned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No food.  I'll need every credit to hire someone decent.\"   The former Padawan was well aware that a bounty hunter capable of tracking down a Jedi in hiding wouldn't come cheap.  If she skimped and hired some musclehead meat-wall, she might as well throw her money down a garbage chute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No food!\"  said the voice.  \"Don't be ridiculous.  You need your strength.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka shook her head.  She'd already spent a good deal of money on fuel, and eaten her way through a lot of the rest of it.  She just got so <i>hungry</i> sometimes.   She was aware the voice was messing with her head, and scared that it was getting better at it.  The first few times she'd binged, she'd eaten until she was close to vomiting -- now, instead of leaving her feeling bad, the hunger tapered off when she was pleasantly stuffed, and her system flooded with soothing endorphins.   Food was becoming a dangerously seductive drug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of rich, meaty dianoga pie fresh out of the over hit her like a Force push as she walked through the cafe door, covering the smell of the air and, mercifully, the cafe's other patrons.  Her mouth flooded with drool at the thought of sinking her teeth into the flaky crust.   \"Just a slice won't hurt -- bounty hunters don't cost that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka shook her head.   That wasn't her!  It was the voice!  And it only went to show exactly how much she needed to find another Jedi -- someone who could guide her, who could help her face up to this mental intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scanned the section of the room where the bounty hunters discreetly plied their trade.  She sensed little enough skill from most of the current crop -- the aforementioned meatheads were plentiful -- but from two possibilities, she felt something more.  Something stronger.    At one of the tables, a pair of fierce-looking Wookiees sat, nursing mugs of krayt milk and snacking on a basket of wookie-ookies.   And at the bar, she spotted a slender -- relatively, of course -- young Hutt surrounded by a bevy of chubby Twi'lek girls.   Making sure her hood was drawn low over her face, Ahsoka took a deep breath and approached --<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tenacious, natural born hunters with instincts and skills honed by the coming of age ritual known as the hrrtayyk ceremony, all Wookies had natural aptitude towards hunting and survival. Ashoka knew that if anyone could track a Jedi through the city, it would have to be them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you approach us.\" the Wookie howled. \"Turn around.

Weak. You are fit only to feed a starving Bolotaur.\" the Wookie growled, looking back to his drink and ignoring the young Torguta.\"Turn around. Walk away.\" added the Wookiee once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka backed away slowly. It didn't seem like she was going to get anywhere here. The voice in her head chimed in. \"Why do you allow others to push you?

With the outstretch of her hand, the wookie was sent hurtling into the wall, caught off guard by the unassumed power of the young girl. The patrons of the cafe did not look away from their tables, all to use to the hourly brawl to pay it much attention. The remaining Wookie, shot to his feet, pulling out his bowcaster and began to take aim. Effortlessly, Ahsoka pulled into the force, ripping the Bowcaster from the Wookie's grip and into her own. She leveled it at his head. \"I offered you credits for your service. You will take them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A force adept. The price on your kinds head is high.\" said the Wookie as he sat back down, taking a sip from his mug. His brother brushed himself off the floor and did likewise. \"We do not seek profit.

You were not what we expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am looking for remaining members of the Jedi Order.\" Ahsoka said as she unclenched in relief. The whole intimidating act was more exhausting than she thought. Or maybe her blooming belly was just weighing her down. \"I believe that anyone who survived might be lying low on this planet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jedi.\" the Wookiee growled. \"I have smelled their stench on this planet.\" His brother chimed in. \"They are good game, a target worthy of being stalked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We accept.\" they both added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are learning.\" the voice said approvingly.  \"Would you not say you have earned a reward? Those credits must be burning a hole in your pocket. That dianoga pie smells good does it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...maybe just a slice or two...\" Ahsoka thought to herself as she called the attention of the waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It was also of the largest size. As big as her head, \"What The?\" Ahsoka thought to herself, \"That is your dessert,\" the voice told Ahsoka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter gave Ahsoka the rest of her meal, as he did so her jaw stayed dropped the whole time. It was lucky for her she was wearing a cloak and the waiter couldn't see it. The appitizer was a cream of Fleek Eel half the length of her arm, a thick Besh-Leth-Trill sandwich for the main course, a small yet large for Ahsoka sized bowl/pot of Creamed Rishi Corn soup for a side dish and a pitcher of Krayt Milk for a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsolka was also lucky in the light that the other patrons paid no attention as they cared only for themselves. Such is all too common in an atmosphere of a place like Nar Shaddaa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too shocked at the immencity of her meal Ahsoka began to argue with the voice in her head, \"I can't eat all this! I'd explode!\". The voice responded in kind with it's usual calming demeener, \"Pace yourself then if you can't all at once but you simply must eat to obtain more power from the force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka ignored the voice signing it off as rubbish, and began to think of the problem in front of her she then notifced that her waiter was a Dug, and he asked her, \"Is this for here or to go?\" Ahsoka rememberd how mean dugs can be from the story Anakin told her about how used to pod race against 1 named Sebulba. Ahsoka quickly chose to leave, \"To go.\" she told him. The dug waiter then insulted her in the manner standard to his species, \"That will be 4 Truguts Hutt-Face poodoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis obviously made Ahsoka angry. Despite the common knowlege she and everyone else in the bar/diner knew that dugs are the rudest species in the galaxy, that they insult everyone even each other, and that they couldn't be nice to save their own skins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka knew that punching a patron or 2 was tollerable in these slums but to kill a waiter would only cause her more troble then she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger problem was that she didn't have enough credits to pay the amount he demanded. \"Why don't you just use Mind Trick on him?\" the voice asked, \"I don't know how to use that force power.\" Ahsoka yelled with her mind at the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a breif demonstration by forcibly taking control of her hand Ahsoka as a breif puppet of the voice then used mind trick on the Dug. He then took the remants of her money and put her meal in a metal box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was small enough for Ahsoka to be able to carry it by herself, unfortunatly it was also too big for her to hide it under her cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then left the diner/bar and kept walking away from it for some time until she could see it no more behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then came upon a ledge to sit on, and did so. With the box next to her and various land speeders whizzing by almost too fast to see far below, Ahsoka took out the triangular pyramid of the Lisal holocron from her pocket. And asked it a question about a detail she didn't realize about until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you keep calling me Darth Phega?\" The voice then revealed it's answer as it shined from the dark transparent red glass,\"That was the sith who built me. When you picked me up I assumed you were her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka then began to think about what to do next before she should find herself a suitable lair on Nar Shaddaa...</span></div></div>",

She practically ripped the cover off, and began stuffing food in her mouth.  <i> I just need something in my stomach -- just something -- so I can think straight!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfying her hunger was like trying to fill a Sarlacc with an eyedropper, but she eventually made headway.  After half the sandwich, all the soup, and a good part of the milk, she was cogent enough to berate herself for being stupid enough to back into an alley in this rathole without first checking it for nasty surprises.   She really shouldn't have scraped the box against the walkway, either; if it had made a mark, it would have been like an arrow pointing right too her.  Fortunately, the Vertical City was built for rough treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka reduced everything but about half the pie to a mess of scraps before she was too full to eat any more.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you.  Let's talk.  And don't even think about making me hungry again, because the cargo hold is full up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ... you have done well.  You have indulged yourself to repletion,\" the voice said, \"and your power will grow as you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka frowned.   She'd made another misstep, she realized with annoyance.  She hadn't meant to gorge herself again.   That had been practically a week's worth of food!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want power at that cost!\" she snapped.  \"Not if it comes from the Dark Side!\"   <i>And not if it's going to make me fat</i>, she added mentally.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish,\" the voice whispered.   Then the holocron went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hey!  We're not done here!\" Ahsoka hissed, shaking the little device.   <i>Damn it! </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unable to get any response.  Groaning as her muscles flexed around her tightly packed stomach, she stood up.  Her body felt sluggish and overstuffed, but her connection to the Force <i>did</i> feel ... stronger.  More responsive.  She positioned her hand over the metal box and it flew up into her hand with barely a thought.   Easy as -- ugh -- pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she should embrace this power -- just for now.  Just until she could track down another Jedi.   She needed help.   The thought of what these binges were going to do to her body if they continued... no!   The quicker she found someone else, the better.  Even if she had to use powers tainted by the Dark Side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling grateful for the concealing cloak which hid her distended middle, she left the alley and resumed her search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The target is an elderly human woman living somewhere in the slums,\" said Snoova, looking carefully at his data pad.  \"Reports indicate that she was last spotted at the Orange Lady tavern here in the Corellian Sector.  Intel about her appearance and abilities is lacking, but I'm confident that <i>you'll</i> be able to help us sniff her out, <i>Master Jedi</i>\".  As he growled out that last remark, he briefly glared in Ahsoka's direction before turning to face the other Wookiee again.  \"We move now; if we wait, our quarry is likely to escape!\"  At that, the two gathered up their gear and headed off toward the nearby speeder park, while the younger brother at the rear of the pack motioned for Ahsoka to follow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all piled into large, scuffed up-looking airspeeder and began flying toward the target area.  The young Jedi tried to keep her mind off of her burgeoning hunger by watching the many glowing skyscrapers as they flew past them, but soon enough, the malevolent voice in her head began to speak to her once more.  \"So, it looks like you're getting closer to your goal,\" it said to her, sounding as smooth and seductive as ever.  \"But what will you do when you find this lost Jedi?  Surely, even together, you wouldn't be able to stop the Empire...no, you would require <i>far</i> greater power for that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm <i>still</i> not listening to you,' the former Padawan thought in response, though she herself was having a hard time believing it.  Even though she had just stuffed herself practically to bursting, she could feel a powerful hunger gnawing at her once more.  \"Oh, that's just not fair...\" she moaned plaintively; luckily for her, the sounds of the city drowned out her voice.  'Just a little further...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half of a standard hour later, the trio arrived at the Orange Lady.  Shouldering his bowcaster, Snoova turned to Ahsoka and barked, \"Follow our lead, child.  We do not wish to be conspicuous.  Just keep to the rear and tell us when you sense the Jedi, understood?\"  The Togruta nodded silently, her mind still fixated on the holocron's voice and the growing empty feeling in her belly.  They soon entered the cantina, and Ahsoka tried her best to focus her Force senses to find the Jedi hiding within.  It was difficult to sort out any individual signatures from the melange of life forms present in the bar, and her growling gut didn't make things any easier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything yet?\" asked the younger Wookiee.  Ahsoka simply shook her head.  \"Ugh...okay, let's try splitting up.  Brother and I will search the front, you check out the back.  But don't <i>look</i> like you're checking the place out!  Just...walk casual, okay?\"  The former Padawan giggled slightly at how nervous the seemingly-fierce Wookiee had become now that he was on the job, before proceeding toward the rear of the room and walking up to the bar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I gets youse?\" replied a voice from behind it.  A surly-looking Chiss bartender rose from behind the counter, focusing his fluorescent, red eyes on Ahsoka.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Ruby Bliel, I guess...\" she said, scratching the back of her head nervously.  Ahsoka had never really been into alcohol, no doubt due to the stodgy attitudes of the Jedi Order.  Truth be told, she didn't even want the drink; no, right now, she was far more interested in ordering another extravagant meal for herself.  But to do that would be to appease that wretched voice from within the Holocron-- Ahsoka hoped that a drink would fill her stomach somewhat and make her feel less hungry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...you seems a bits young to be drinkings, little ladies\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your job to serve drinks, or to ask questions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Good points\".  At that, the bartender turned and grabbed the ingredients for Ahsoka's drink.  As he worked behind the counter, Ahsoka leaned against the bar and spoke again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you think you might be willing to help me with something,\" she asked, trying to sound casual.  He paused to look back at her, still busily mixing drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...depends on exactly whats you needs helps with...\" he replied cryptically, shooting her a smug grin.  Ahsoka was in no mood for games, though, and proceeded to pull out of one of her lightsabres and slam it down on the bar in front of him.  \"Oh!\" he exclaimed, stepping back a bit.  \"Jedis...that's, uh, different.  I'd be happies to helps!\"  He placed her drink on the counter, carefully staying clear of her sabre.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no Jedi, got it?  I'm just a girl who's looking for one...\"  The young Togruta maintained her intimidating facade, though she couldn't help but wince for a second as she took a sip from her bitter drink.  \"You know anyone around here who might fit the bill?\"  At this, this bartender looked around nervously, shaking a bit as he pointed one blue finger toward a table in the back corner of the bar.  A hunched figure in a black, hooded cloak sat at alone the table, their face concealed in shadow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...but peoples, they talk about the ones in the back there.  They say she carries a laser swords, like yours, and that she knows all kinds of old Jedis stories...but you didn't hear it from mes, understand?\"   Ahsoka turned her Force senses toward the old woman in the corner, and while her signature was weak, it was indeed stronger than anyone else's in the bar.  She smiled, before grabbing her drink and standing up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be enough...thanks a lot for the 'drinkses', stranger,\" she said confidently, striding over to the corner while the nervous bartender knelt behind the counter and began fiddling with some buttons...meanwhile, Ahsoka had already sat down at the would-be Jedi's table.  Before she could say anything, though, the old woman spoke to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vima knows why you have come, youngling...\" she uttered in a weak, croaking voice.  She raised her head to face Ahsoka, and the Padawan had to stop herself from screaming upon seeing her hideously wrinkled and scarred face; the woman looked to her more like a freshly-exhumed corpse than a living Human.  \"She senses the dark power emanating from that Holocron you possess...Vima may be old, and her connection to the Force weak, but she knows the Dark Side when she feels it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You...you know about the Holocron?\" Ahsoka replied breathlessly, briefly clutching her stomach as another painful wave of hunger washed over her-- the Dark Side presence that had taken up residence in her mind was clearly reacting to the presence of another Jedi.  \"Then you must know how to help me!  Quick, come with me; let's get out of this dump and find a safe place to--\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!  Were you not listening?  Vima no longer feels the Force as strongly as she once did, and she would be helpless if someone found us...please, relax for now.  Sit and tell Vima of your troubles.\"  Not having any better ideas, Ahsoka sidled up closer to the ancient Jedi and began explaining what had happened since she acquired the Sith Holocon from Lisal.  All the while, the voice continued taunting her from within her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...you think this wizened old fool can help you, Darth Phage? (A/N: Hope you don't mind I messed with the spelling a bit; I thought this variant helped highlight the pun a bit better)  Or, rather, Ahsoka...not that it matters much what I call you.  You'll succumb soon enough either way...your <i>hunger</i> for power will be all-consuming...\"  </span></div></div>",

It is stronger than it tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>tastes</i> strong enough to knock the teeth out of a rancor,\" Ahsoka muttered, making another face.  \"Listen, I've been looking for another... for someone like you for a while.  I think we can help each other out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just how is it you think I can help you?\" the old woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka kept her voice low.   \"There's a <i>certain man </i>who wants us dead, a man who it would be in everyone's best interests to stop.  I can't do it alone, and -- and I can't do it without guidance, training -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped talking suddenly, realizing that the room had gotten strangely quiet.   Dozens of pairs of eyes were on her; a scores of hands, claws and tentacles reached for blasters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a very bad feeling about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down!\" she said, pushing the old woman under the table with one hand and drawing her lightsaber with the other.   With practiced ease she deflected the first few shots.  A Rodian in the corner slid to the ground, brought down with his own pistol.   Ahsoka's head swam from the sudden movement.  <i>Damn drink!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounty hunters seemed stunned by the turn of events.  Most likely none of them had ever faced off against a Jedi before.  Before they could recover, Ahsoka grabbed the old woman' arm and practically dragged her through the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer spirits fell.  What she'd thought was a way out was just a back storeroom.  But there, near the ceiling - a tiny window.  An escape route!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why run?</i>  said the voice.  <i>It would be so easy to stay and cut them down.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible -- and it would draw even more attention to us, anyway,\" Ahsoka snapped, pushing the old woman through the window.  The scrawny bag of bones went through easily, and Ahsoka lifted herself to the sill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her head had always been the part of her hardest to get into a small space -- humans had always laughed at her for that.  Them and their infinity smushable \"hair\" -- why couldn't they understand that a growing girl's lekku needed room to, well, grow?  With a grunt, she forced her head through, and hauled herself to freedom--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought.  Halfway through the window, she ground to a halt at the sill slammed into the top of the round cushion of pudge sticking out from her middle.  Helplessly, she pushed against the wall with her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Arrgh</i>, she moaned to herself, <i>I can't be</i> this <i>fat!  Can I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sucked in her stomach as far as she could and managed to scrape through the window, heart momentarily leaping with elation, only to find herself wedged even tighter as her rear ear bumped into the opening.  No matter how she twisted and turned, it was too big to pass through.   She was caught.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nPlease don't let it end like this!</i> she begged in her mind.  Death was bad enough.  But to die because her butt was the size of Alderaan?  It was <i>humiliating!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, youngling,\" the old lady said from beneath her.  \"Think about what you're doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka shook her head, trying to clear out the fear and hate and find a calm, cool center.  At least she could die with dignity, holding her lightsaber high and proud--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's it</i>, she realized suddenly.  She whipped the blade around her in a well-practiced, well-trained circle, a shape she'd drawn with the blade of light so many times she could do it with her eyes closed.   A circle of wall slipped easily away from the main body, and in moments Ahsoka had popped herself out.  She was still stuck in the window -- but the window was no longer stuck in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!  Now move,\" Ahsoka barked, \"before they follow us back here!\"  And two Jedi fled into the glittering lights of the Nar Shaddaa night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I sell my bounty hunters, rather then loan them out. She's your problem now.\" The Hutt then burst into a low laugh, and pressed a small button next to it. It's small throne retreated into the recess of the wall, the Twi'leks following him, leaving Ahsoka all alone with the Twi'lek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twi'lek smiled shyly at her. \"Hello. My name's Layla.\" she said. \"I'm actually surprised you picked me, due to my... weight issues.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka smiled in return. \"My name's Ahsoka. I hired you because I need your help... do you think you can find a Jedi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weird smile crossed Layla's face. \"Let's discuss it over lunch.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" grinned Ahsoka, pleased to have made a new friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair sat down at the bar. The waiter, a dark haired human, walked up. \"Can I take your order?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka opened her mouth to speak, but the voice actually stopped her from speaking. The voice had picked Layla because the voice could manipulate Layla into getting Ahsoka to eat more. Layla told the waiter, \"2 whole dianoga pies and 2 Red Spritzers.\" The waiter nodded, and retreated to prepare their order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka opened her mouth to protest, but was suddenly hit by a wave of exhaustion. She could barely move, let alone speak. \"Why am I... so... tired...\" she thought to herself. The voice answered, \"That is the price of my powers, Ahsoka. I can teach you all of my secrets, but if you don't eat, it will strain your body.\" Ahsoka was about to respond, but the voice cut her off. \"Finish this meal and send the bounty hunter off on her mission. Then all shall be explained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka was so tired, but managed to lift her head and take a bite of the pie that had been placed in front of her. Both her and Layla were totally silent,  consuming their respective meals. As Ahsoka ate more and more, and her stomach bloated out, she finally started regaining energy. She took a sip of the drink, Red Spritzer, she had heard it called, and was hooked. She chugged 2 or 3 and finished her pie, her stomach bloating into a small paunch that rested on her lap. Finally, her and Layla both finished. \"So, you want me to find a Jedi, yes?\" asked Layla. \"No problem.\" she said, picking her teeth. \"But you have to tell me why.\" she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka looked at her. \"I am a Jedi padawan, and I need to finish my training.\" she said bluntly. \"But at the same time, I also want to build a strike team to get rid of Vader.\" she continued. \"You happen to be the first member.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla smiled. \"Sounds interesting. Very well, I'll find you a Jedi. But it might take a while, so here's a com link. Establish a base for us and I'll meet you there.\" Layla then slid off of her bar stool and walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka, full to the bursting, decides to... </span></div></div>",

How were you created? How was Lisal destroyed? Can you teach me about the Force? Why am I so hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice chuckled. \"Easy, Ahsoka. I will answer your questions in order. My purpose was to remain on Lisal and teach the first Force Sensitive that stumbled across me the ways of the Force. I was created by the sacrifice of 100 obese females of a variety of species. Lisal was turned into a wasteland by the person that created me, Darth Phegia. Since I assumed you would follow in her footsteps, I deemed you the same. She destroyed it by using gluttony, the ultimate Sith power. You see, the more fat your body contains, the more Midiclorians it can contain, allowing for more Force power and greater control. Eventually, Darth Phegia became so powerful that she wanted to build a monument that would last forever. She used the greatest Force Power of them all, Force Consume. It channeled all of the life on Lisal into Darth Phegia. However, Darth Phegia wasn't as powerful as she believed, and the excess energy destroyed her, leaving Lisal a lifeless wasteland for the rest of eternity. As for teaching you the Force, I can do that, but only if you indulge yourself. You don't have to stuff yourself to the brim, but make sure you are full at meal times. As for why you are so hungry, I cannot say.\" finished the Voice, then it went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka took in this new information and nodded. Everything sounded right. But gluttony being the ultimate form of Sith? Maybe she should try a Jedi version, and use that to defeat Anakin. Now to find a base...</span></div></div>",

However, for whatever reason, she felt that her connection to the Force was stronger then ever, just as Pirasmos had said. Ahsoka had just begun waddling towards the door, to avoid upsetting her stomach, when the waiter approached her, saying, \"Ma'am! You forgot to pay your bill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka nodded, and reached towards her credits bag. \"Alright.\" she said. \"How much was it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the waiter began, \"The cost for 4 dianoga pies, 8 Red Spritzers, and a Party Package, costs 1500 credits.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka looked at him. \"Well, first off, I only purchased 2 dianoga pies, and what the heck is a Party Package?\" she said, disputing her bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your friend, the Twi'lek, ordered 2 pies to go, and a Party Package is a 1250 credit special that includes unlimited food, drink, and the use of one of our more talented... dancers.\" he said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never ordered a party pack!\" Ahsoka exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The men in the corner said you were paying for theirs.\" said the waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka looked to the corner. 5 thugs sat their, waving and grinning. Ahsoka glanced back at the waiter, ready to pay the bill, when Pirasmos exclaimed, \"Use Mind Trick! Don't pay for those fools' meals! Then go and teach them some manners!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka silently agreeing, mustered all of the knowledge Pirasmos had given her, and spoke, \"We have no need to pay. Leave.\" and waved her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter bowed and repeated, \"You have no need to pay. I shall leave.\" and walked back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka didn't realize that Pirasmos was slowly manipulating her into making  dark sided decisions, and went into a rage. \"Who do those men think they ARE, trying to make ME pay for THEIR food? I'll show them! I'll teach them some decent manners!\" Ahsoka turned towards the men and quickly took in the sight: Three burly humans armed with vibroswords, an Aqualish with a blaster rifle, and a Twi'lek with a shock stick. Ahsoka called to the group, \"Hey bantha brains, trying to get me to pay for your meals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the humans got up and replied, \"Watch your mouth, little girl. You don't want to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka called again, \"You schuttas! It's apparent you haven't gotten your asses whooped in a long time, allow me to provide.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that stinging remark, the 3 men charged, and the Aqualish pulled out his blaster rifle and aimed at Ahsoka. Ahsoka got in tune with the Force and was about to push the men away when Pirasmos whispered, \"You are bloated. This allows me to lend my assistance.\" Ahsoka was suddenly aware of Pirasmos teaching her a variety of skills. Ahsoka, stuffed from her meal, used one of the powers Pirasmos had just transferred to her and unleashed it: It was Force Lightning,  and it sprayed from her hands through the 3 men, electrocuting them. Turning to the Aqualish marksmen, Ahsoka then used Force Pull, and plucked the rifle out of his hands. Ahsoka then used Force Throw to throw the Aqualish onto the Twi'lek's shock stick. Ahsoka then turned to the Twi'lek and took a step forward. the Twi'lek got up and ran. Ahsoka then turned around and walked out of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka walked into a hotel. She had wandered Nar Shaddaa's Corellian sector for hours, but had found no suitable place to stay. Finally, she had decided to get a hotel room. Walking up to the main counter, she said, \"Hello. Can I get a room, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, a busty human female, replied cheerily, \"Of course, dear. Would you like a suite or a regular room? The suite comes with unlimited room service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka replied, \"I guess the suite, would that work for 2 people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman answered, \"Yes! In fact, it's recommended for 2 to 5 people. Is that it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes.\" said Ahsoka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then. 1000 credits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can stay for free.\" Ahsoka said, waving her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay for free.\" the woman repeated. \"Here's your room key.\" she said, handing Ahsoka a card key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka took the card key, got into the lift, and took it to the 4th floor, where her room was. Going into her room, she sent Layla a com telling her where to go. Ahsoka, exhausted after her long day, laid on her bed and fell asleep. When she wakes up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment Ahsoka drifted out of sleep, she had one thought on her mind: food. She had a ravenous pang of hunger shooting through her somehow-still-hungry stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Obviously from that damned holocron</i>, Ahsoka thought, but the idea was quickly displaced by an almost automatic reach for the room's wall-mounted comlink. She pressed a small button, calling the hotel's kitchen while simultaneously projecting the menu into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, room service?\" Ahsoka spoke into the comlink's speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is room service. Whaddya want?\" replied a gruff voice, most likely the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to order, hmm... twenty dianoga pies, five gallons of blue milk, three dozen nerfburgers, and eight boxes of hubba chips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rather shocked chef continued, \"Whoa. Uh, okay. You're lucky we just got in a new food shipment. It'll be done within half an hour. What's your room number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling him the number, Ahsoka checked the scale in the bathroom, out of morbid curiosity. She regretted it almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"215 imperial wight units?!\" she gasped, then proceeded to check herself out in the mirror. The scale definitely didn't lie. Her stomach had grown into a rather large potbelly, accentuated by several small love handles. Her fat was spilling slightly over the top of her pants, and a quick turn revealed that her butt and thighs were quite a bit larger, at the verge of bursting out. To top it all off, her breasts seemed to have doubled in size, and the beginnings of a double-chin were noticeable. Then, Piramisos' voice seeped back into Ahsoka's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, perfect. You are on the way to acquiring the power to defeat Vader. Show no restraint! You are still a flea on a gundark. Weak. Powerless. Hungry...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny thoughts that remained in Ahsoka's head concerning Piramisos or her new figure were quickly displaced by the ding from the door. She quickly answered it, stared as two carts were wheeled in, convinced the server it was \"on the house\" with a mind trick, then dug in. She ate, ate, and ate some more, shoving all the food she could see down her gullet. When she finally felt full, she had barely eaten a quarter of it. Suddenly, a strange feeling crept over her. A sudden warmth, almost... fattening. Ahsoka noticed her stomach deflating, but becoming flabbier. She actually felt herself rising up slightly as her ass expanded, along with several minor rips and snapping seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here is my gift to you, Phegia. You are now free to consume once more, and you shall find that you are much more... voracious.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, don't call me that- <i>uungh</i>!\" Ahsoka said to her mind, before a rippling wave of hunger shot through her. Almost mechanically, she resumed shoveling food into her mouth, without hesitation, or even thought. During her binge, she failed to notice Layla creeping in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahsoka, I- uh...\" she stammered, but Ahsoka was absorbed in the plethora of food around her, of which a bit over half remained. Suddenly, a voice echoed through Lalya's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hush, child. Do not disturb her. Do you not wish her to grow more powerful?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla, filled with fear and confusion, asked, \"Who are you? And why are you in my brain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am a... friend of Ahsoka's. She must grow more powerful in order for her to succeed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should I help her, exactly? What's there for me to gain from this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have the potential to become powerful in the Force, child. Ahsoka might be able to train-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so if eating increases one's Force connection...\"</span></div></div>",

How would that affect me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPirasmos lowered her tone even further. \"Because, young one, there is a sliver of the Force in you. If Ahsoka becomes more powerful, she might just be able to awaken you to the Force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla looked shocked, but slowly a grin spread on her face. \"What do you need me to do?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later, Layla had hooked a suction tube onto a bucket and put the other end in Ahsoka's mouth. Layla filled the bucket with an assortment of grease and lard that the hotel had leftover, and it was a simple matter to buy it from the hotel. Turning the suction tube on, the grease/lard combination worked its way into Ahsoka's awaiting stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka woke up and glanced up blearily to see Layla shaking her shoulder. \"Ahsoka.

Take the fat one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Ahsoka thought, so she told the hutt. \"I'll take that one.\" While pointing to Shindala, The Hutt had an expression of delight on his ugly face and spoke to Ahsoka in huttese, \"With pleasure!\" He then used his tail to whack Shindala over to Ahsoka. Shindala fell over, got up, walked over to Ahsoka and bowed. As her way of saying, \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's your problem now!\" The hutt spoke with as much arrogance his would be able to convey, \"Don't even bother returning her. She was the worst boutny Hunter I've ever had. The only reason I didn't kill her was because she was too valuable as a slave, she's your slave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLearning these details only made Ahsoka very mad, she clenched her fists and thought, \"I wonder how long it would take to make a hutt starve to death?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the holocron's voice was wise enough to delay her vengence, \"There will be plenty of time for that later. For now we must find shelter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn agreement, Ahsoka merely turned around and escorted Shindala out of the cantina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the streets of Nar Shaddaa were not any better, Ahsoka spent some time walking away from that place with Shindala close behind, after the voice asked her to sit down on the boxes in the back alley they were going through for she was burning too many calories for the voices liking. Ahsoka asked it, \"Did you know she was a was a slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In addition to her being a bounty hunter?\" the voice responded, \"Does it matter? You could just free her if you have a problem being a slave owner. Besides you already freed her from an abusive hutt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka consented to yet another good point the holocron had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the nearest small box and Shindala asked with confusion, \"Why did you stop here master? Is this your... fortress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a fortress. I'm a new arrival...\" Ahsoka began to explain with what ever was left of her honesty. Before  she could speak more, Shindala interupted her, \"Then where is your ship?\" Shindala asked as though eager to flee Nar Shaddaa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka told her the truth much to Shindala's dissapointment. \"I sold it to be dismanteld to spare parts to a junk dealer. And don't call me Master!\" she then pulled down her hood, revealed her face to Shindala, and told her, \"I'm a Jedi on the run...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n35 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining to Shindala what she knew about how the republic had become the empire. And how and why she had come to purchase her.<br>\r\nShinalda was now sitting down next to Ahsoka equally devestated by the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't come to clense this retched place of corruption?\" Shindala asked, unaware of the details Ahsoka left out of her story, namely the holocron and her discovery of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I figured this place would make it too difficult for the empire find me.\" Ahsoka responded. Despite being 10 years older then Ahsoka, Shindala was not quite as smart as Ahsoka was. But that was only because of being raised a slave more then anything else. But at least the more time Shindala spent talking with Ahsoka the smarter Shindala got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was on my back to Coruscant when I heard the news.\" Ahsoka lied, much to the holocron's approval. Despite that Ahsoka did not lie just so she could please it. Ahsoka then asked Shindala about her slave life. \"How can a slave also be a bounty hunter?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShindala answered, \"I was a slave first 1 day a drunk bounty hunter gave me his gun and I shot him and tried to escape, I obviously failed, they only reason they didn't gun me down was because my master Baccuda... that was the name of the hutt you bought me from... never really liked the bounty hunter I killed anyway. He made me a bounty hunter because he was impressed with my will to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka asked another question,\"Why didn't you flee on your 1st job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShindala answered with some fear on her face. \"When ever I did go out as a bounty hunter made me wear this collar, he said it would explode if I left the planet or I didn't return to him when he wanted me back or if I didn't give him all the money I made from the job. I don't know why I wasn't wearing it when you bought me,  or why he didn't give it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was probably saving it for his next slave, maybe that other Twi'lek you were with?\" Ahsoka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that was Layla she was never a slave to begin with. She was always a bounty hunter.\" Shindala replied, the duo then heard their rotund bellies growl with hunger. Although Ahsoka's was the only one that knew she ate had eaten a big meal no more then 3 hours ago, she didn't want to reveal how the holocron made her begin to get fat. Let alone that she had one Ahsoka just went along with the act and asked. \"Is that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShindala only looked down at her big red round belly poking out of her barely fitting black padded armor, and held as if she was pregnant, though they both knew she was not.\"I got that bad rep because as a slave girl I was always hungry we never are given enough to eat so whenever I had job I spent most of my time out on the jobs stealing food eating as much as I could until Baccuda began to lose patience, and I ate even more when I got the money.

It was a squad of clone troopers, fencing off a cantina, and the smell of blaster gas and burnt flesh singed the air. As they moved closer, the pudgy pair noticed medics rushing to the aid of troopers with what were definitely lightsaber wounds. And then, on a hover-stretcher, some clones were pushing out the laser-riddled corpse of an old woman, who could only be identified as such because her face was relatively intact. In her hand was a Jedi lightsaber. Ahsoka managed to notice a clone trooper had a scanner out, using records appropriated from the Jedi Temple. The device identified the charred body as Vima-da-Booda, but also picked up another Jedi's face in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no... RUN!\" Ahsoka yelled, just managing to dodge a barrage of blaster fire. The duo ran through the alleyways, getting stuck on more than one occasion, and they took a 10-second break. When Shindala was too tired to take another step, Ahsoka just unlocked the nearest door with the Force, pulled her chubby compatriot inside, and locked the door behind her. After the silhouettes disappeared, the pair turned around, and they realized they were in paradise! It was an abandoned, but <i>very</i> large food storehouse; despite being mostly empty, there was enough food to feed a few hundred people for a month. Since the food was designed to last for months on a space freighter, all of it was perfectly edible! The duo had found a base, and they were going to use it to the fullest (until they were at their fullest)...</span></div></div>",

As Ahsoka woke up from another food coma, she was shocked at how big she had become. Her gargantuan, perfectly spherical belly, rather full, but layered with a thick coating of blubber, covered her enormous thighs entirely, protruding at least two feet. As she struggled to get up, she heard a <i>riiip!</i>, which was definitely her pants. As she turned around, she noticed her now-exposed rump had grown into two <i>very</i> massive balls of flab, right below a muffin top that looked like she was wearing a thick orange-red skirt of fat! her neck had disappeared between several chins, and her cheeks had become balls of blubber. And to top it all off, her breasts, now barely contained by her strained top, were almost as big as her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShindala hadn't fared much better. Her potbelly had grown into several rolls of lard, flanked by a pile of thick love-handles. Her ass had grown almost as wide as she was tall, with thighs that rivaled her stomach in size. With arms that looked like pillows, and legs that resembled man-sized bags of gelatin constantly pressed together, she looked almost like a bright-red Hutt! Her neck had turned into five rings of blubber, and her enormous breasts, long having burst out of her outfit, hung on either side of her gut. When Ahsoka looked at her bounty hunter, covered in food stains, stuffing her face, she felt... aroused. The Jedi made her way over, and they started talking. Then they started feeding each other. Then there was cuddling, with massive stomachs and rolls rubbing against each other. Just before things could get any more serious, their guts groaned loudly in unison. The doughy duo then started breaking open food containers, stuffing their faces with any food they could find. They were thinking, but with their stomachs the entire time. They had only one motivation: hunger. A primal urge that caused them to continually stuff their faces for a <i>long</i> time. The only time that Ahsoka came to her senses was when they ate up all the food in the nearby crates. Ahsoka's stomach had almost doubled in size, being at full capacity. Her rear was a bit larger, as evidenced by more burst seams. Shindala's stomach was tight as a drum (if you could feel it beneath her blubber). As the bloated buddies almost drifted off into a food coma, they heard the sound of a door being unlocked and people trying to enter. Just as Ahsoka started to panic, the Holocron's voice returned to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Use the Force, you fool! Since you are this large, the Force shall be much stronger with you! Lock the doors to delay them, fix the food crates, and cloak yourselves to their minds!</i> Ahsoka did all those things with rather surprising ease. As a group of workers poured in, mostly Duros and humans, people started loading up the food crates, with the obese Jedi picking up snippets of conversation like \"it goes bad tomorrow\" and \"bring in the new stuff.\" As they watched with growing glee and growling guts (despite having just binged for several hours), the workers brought in giant boxes of food, meant to be stored until needed (or until too many looters and vagrants sneaked in). After about an hour of work, the entire warehouse was packed with food crates, ripe for the picking. Ahsoka and Shindala were like kids in a candy store! The moment the last worker left, the two waddled through the just-wide-enough rows, until they found the mother of it all: a shipment of fresh pies and meats, filling two containers twice the size of clone gunships! Ahsoka used the Force to rip the tops off, and lifted herself and Shindala to the also just-wide-enough catwalk. The Holocron then proceeded to speak to her one more time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Go on, jump in. You will become so powerful, you would be guaranteed to defeat this Vader of yours, Darth Phegia. Show no restraint. Gorge yourself like a pig. Become bigger than you thought was possible. Also, your fat friend could be happy as can be. Once you conquer the galaxy, you could make her your personal slave...</i> Suddenly, Ahsoka remembered why she was even on Nar Shaddaa. Ahead of her, the gateway to pure excess, gluttony, and power, but also the Dark Side. If she turned around, she might be able to accomplish the goal she had originally started out with, and avenge the Jedi Order. She was about to turn around, when she felt her massive stomach growl, knowing that there was food...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ahsoka remembered why she was even on Nar Shaddaa in the first place. \"I have to find another Jedi and stop Vader.\" When Ahsoka tried to walk (or waddle) away, she was drawn closer and closer to the open food container, as if her legs were working against her. If she could see the Holocron right now, it would have been glowing a brilliant red, with little wisps of energy flying out. She looked to the left, where Shindala had gleefully jumped in and was stuffing her face. Before she could react, the obese Togruta fell in with a loud <i>plop</i>! Suddenly, without her doing, her fat arms were mechanically shoveling food into her mouth. Ahsoka was surprised how rich and sweet it all was. Eventually, she stopped trying to fight her uncontrolled binging, and soon was doing it willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the former Jedi shoveled food increasingly quickly into her insatiable maw, She failed to notice changes going on. For instance, all the food she consumed seemed to be instantly turned into fat. The well-stressed rag that was once her top snapped like a piece of string, letting her growing, red-orange, twice-the-size-of-her-head breasts flop out. Behind her, her back became so encumbered in fat, it looked like ten slabs of dough stacked on top of each other. Below, her gigantic ass had totally burst out of her pants, becoming large spheres of lard that were almost the size of her stomach before. Ahsoka's legs looked like well-fed Hutts from a distance, resting on a cushion of ass flab, but the biggest beauty was her gargantuan stomach. It had at least <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">five</span> six humongous rolls of blubber, each two times wider than a Wookie is tall. Below the first two was a cavernous belly button, large enough that one could stick their head inside of it! Above the sea of dough were two breasts now the size of her ass beforehand, and atop that was a head that would not stop eating. Ahsoka was hardly recognizable, mostly due to the fact that topping a wobbly sea of chins was two blobs of cheek fat, a mouth that had almost magically tripled in size, and some horns. If you did some prodding, you could see a nose  and eyes. Ahsoka was covered in sweat and food stains, her mind just reduced to one thought: More food for me. Her arms had somehow maintained enough mobility to continue shoveling food into her mouth. Despite all this weight gain, this immobile blob of a Jedi had only managed to have eaten less than five percent of the food tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver in the other food tank, Shindala was having the time of her life. The Twi'lek had always had a fat fetish, so she ate, ate, and ate. She had abandoned all her clothing a long time ago, and was simply basking in her hugeness. In front of her was a bright red stomach, covered by almost half a ton of fat, and behind her, most of the other half was stored in two humongous ass cheeks. Hanging on either side were two massive breasts, each large enough to have housed her before this adventure. Behind those were two legs that were like sacks of lard as tall as a woman. Above those were two arms that looked like slightly smaller sacks of lard. On the very top was a head that, like Ahsoka's, was almost impossible to notice some facial features. Hanging behind were two lekku that were approximately the thickness of a man's thigh. Shindala was covered in grease, stains, and sweat, but she didn't mind. She loved the feeling of being huge, slobby, not concerned about weight or appearances. The blobby Twi'lek then got back to stuffing herself silly. After all, she had only eaten .9% of the tank's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a mysterious change swept over Ahsoka. It was something... odd. The holocron's voice crept into her mind once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, yes... Perfect. Everything is going according to my plan. You are almost at full power, and then-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what, more food? I want food. I want to grow big and fat. Fat is sexy. I want to never stop. I want more food,\" Ahsoka interjected mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Um... yes. You will get all the food you want, Darth Phegia. Or should I say, Darth Pig-gia?</i></span></div></div>",

Her skin, once a vibrant red-orange, had shifted to more of an orangey-brown, then to a mottled brown-green. Her head had slowly grown wider and wider, with her neck disappearing. Her tongue turned pinkish-green, and she used it to try and stuff more food into her mouth. The ever-expanding, taller-than-a-Wookie globes of fat that were her ass began to fuse to her legs. If one had examined her feet, they would find that there were no toes, sole, or ankle, just two little stubs of brown-green flesh. Ahsoka's stomach then began to start secreting slime, while the rolls of fat re-positioned into a smooth greenish globe, still retaining her belly button. Her breasts, now larger than she was before jumping in to this, began to fill. Her nipples, once small and taut, elongated and flopped around, not unlike tiny slugs, and started oozing slime. Also, during all of this, she got bigger. Not in just weight, but size. I mean <i>big</i>. Ahsoka's fat, green body towered out of the food container, even though her stomach touched the bottom. Her legs had transformed into a giant, oozing tail, the only sign of it once being anything non-Hutt was a rather large \"bump\" which was once her ass. Her massive, blobby stomach was now almost the height of the food container. Ahsoka's head had become wide, with her nose vanishing into her skull, and her mouth continued to grow. When she was \"done\" growing, it would be impossible to guess that she was never a Hutt at all. She was at least 40 feet tall, oozing slime everywhere, with a long, fat tongue dangling from a mouth large enough to eat a landspeeder, a gigantic sphere of a stomach that would have been able to hold a regiment of clones, and a tail long enough to whack a gundark into orbit. The only old thing that remained on Ahsoka were a pair of brown-green horns protruding right above her forehead, followed by two slimy lekku that resembled her tail. After this all had occured, Ahsoka the Hutt looked at herself with a look of minor interest, unleashed a 10-second-long belch, then went back to stuffing herself. Then, the Holocron spoke again to the Hutt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did I ever tell you about the night my master died? I was there for the whole sordid affair.

He had great knowledge of dark magic, enough to change my function. While I was meant to give power, he made me into a tool for death. When Darth Phegia tried to use me, I was forced to over-concentrate the energies into her, and she exploded. She was a Togruta, too. Just like you were. She had planned to take that power and, using the Force, reshape the galaxy. She never got the chance. So, when you were kind enough to free me from my chamber, part of me took pity on you. Why?

But, I wanted to neutralize your threat of being a Jedi. So, I searched your mind. It was easy, if you were created by a very powerful Sith lord. Buried deep inside your subconscious, I found something. A longing. A fetish. A desire to be as big as you could possibly be, to be sweaty, dirty, lazy, the ultimate slob. So, I decided that once you had enough Force energy, I could manipulate it to make you the greatest Hutt that had ever lived.

She looked like any other Hutt, except she had two short, but fat tails, a *very* disproportionately large, flabby stomach.

First off, her skin had turned from a reddish-orange to a reddish-pink, then to bright pink eventually. Her feet, just barely sticking out from a sea of lard, hardened, and her toes began to fuse. Her arms, continually shoving food into her waiting maw, grew a bit shorter and chubbier, but this was only a minor inconvenience to reaching the food. Also, her mind had changed. It was starting to degenerate into something non-sentient, only concerned with two things: eating and getting fatter. If you were to look at her face right now, her nose would have seemed wider and upturned, not unlike a pig's snout. Her chin and lower jaw had started to jut out a bit. Her eyes would have appeared slightly more spaced apart, a bit deeper-set, and beadier. Also, her ears had grown significantly wider and pointier, and had moved up a large deal on her head. As Ahsoka continued to binge, these changes became more and more apparent, until she had a bright pink face, with her small, beady eyes separated by a giant pig's snout, with two large, pointy ears sticking out the top of her head. The only thing different than most pigs was that she had a couple disproportinately small horns, coupled with two lekku that looked like hanging blobs of blubber. Her hands and feet had turned into hooves, connected to very fat, stubby limbs that were wider than her gut was before jumping in. Ahsoka had gone from sitting on a mountain of flab, to laying down on her belly, like a giant, doughy blimp, with a fat face sticking forward, sucking food like a vacuum. Her massive breasts had become filled with enough fat to become three times the size of her fattened self. Her ass cheeks were more than twice that size, and each had a large pile of rolls that flowed down to her legs, which were three four times the size (but half the length) of Jabba the Hutt. Ahsoka's hooves had become buried in the sea of lard, all four of them. However, in between those four massive balls of flab, was her gargantuan gut. It was wide enough to be able to smother thirty people, with more than twenty rolls of fat, each twice as large as the largest Hutt. It was constantly expanding, groaning, filling, yet never seeing full. It looked like someone took a cylinder, then layered pile after pile of blubber over it. Ahsoka, whose vocabulary was reduced to grunts, squeals, snorts, the occasional \"more\" or \"food,\" and plenty of belches, stuck her head into pile after pile of food, slobbering all over it as she binged. By the time she had finished every last morsel of food in the tank, she had totally outgrown it. Her breasts were now the five times the size of Jabba the Hutt, her ass cheeks fifteen times the size, with slightly smaller thighs. Her stomach flab stretched out for at least 100 feet, while her neck had turned into several chins the size of a Hutt. And sticking out from the end, was a pig's snout, covered in food stains, right between two beady eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUURP! Snort, snort. Belch! urp. buuuuuurp.* 'Where food? Need food. Hungry.

How about that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Belch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I figured.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this occurred, Shindala, whose gorging had stopped for the moment, had looked over and saw a mass of pink flesh slowly expanding. Suddenly, all the food around her floated away, and to the other end of the gargantuan mass before her. However, she was somehow picked up, too. As she looked to where exactly the food was going, she saw it all flowing into the waiting maw of... Ahsoka?! Shindala struggled, desperately trying to roll away from certain doom. With just a little more effort, and... she was free! She wouldn't die! She was... falling! Unfortunately, the blobby Twi'lek failed to consider the fact that no matter how fat you are, falling sixty feet and landing headfirst on a durasteel floor <u>will</u> kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the big Sith pig ate, and ate, and ate, until she then doubled in size. All her memories were gone, all thoughts, all sentience, consumed and displaced by the phrase \"More food.\" The pig, however, did have some vague memories, of a funny little black triangle, something about a Phegia. Does it taste good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The End...</b></span></div></div>",

Her skin and internal organs began to become more translucent and gloopy. Her head had slowly grown wider and wider, sinking over her neck. She seemed to be adsorbing the food she was funneling into her mouth. The ever-expanding, taller-than-a-Wookie globes of fat that were her ass began meld along with her Endor-treetrunk sized legs. Ahsoka's stomach then began to reveal the food dissolving in her, while the rolls of fat re-positioned into a smooth orange globe, still retaining her belly button. Her breasts, now larger than she was before jumping in to this, began to fill. Her entire body was beginning to ooze out.  Also, during all of this, she got bigger. Not in just weight, but size. I mean big. Ahsoka's fat, jelly-like body towered out of the food container, even though her stomach touched the bottom. Her legs had melded into a large tail, sorta like a hutts.. Her massive, blobby stomach was now almost the height of the food container. Ahsoka's head had become wide,with several rippling chins, and her mouth continued to grow. When she was \"done\" growing, it would be incredible to see her blobbiness. She was at least 40 feet tall, oozing slime everywhere, with a mouth large enough to eat a landspeeder, a gigantic sphere of a stomach that would have been able to hold a regiment of clones, and a tail long enough to whack a gundark into orbit.  After this all had occured, Ahsoka the Hutt looked at herself with a look of minor interest, unleashed a 10-second-long belch that caused her whole body to ripple, then went back to stuffing herself. Then, the Holocron spoke again to the slime woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did I ever tell you about the night my master died? I was there for the whole sordid affair. She tried to consume all the energy on the planet of Lisal. I was meant to be the channel. All the energy would flow through me, into her. However, a Jedi sabotaged it. He had great knowledge of dark magic, enough to change my function. While I was meant to give power, he made me into a tool for death. When Darth Phegia tried to use me, I was forced to over-concentrate the energies into her, and she exploded. She was a Togruta, too. Just like you were. She had planned to take that power and, using the Force, reshape the galaxy. She never got the chance. So, when you were kind enough to free me from my chamber, part of me took pity on you. Why? Mostly because you reminded me of her. Of course, you were much thinner than her when you found me.

Buried deep inside your subconscious, I found something. A longing. A fetish. A desire to be as big as you could possibly be, to be sweaty, dirty, lazy, the ultimate slob. So, I decided that once you had enough Force energy, I could manipulate it to turn you into a force that could devour anything you wanted. By the time you polish off the rest of that food in the container, you'll be the fattest, most ravenous blob in this galaxy!

Get something to eat already before you Collapse!\"  It acted as if she was skin and bones when in fact her belly only shrank by 1 and half inches and was still very bloated from the meal they had before the search. \"Shut up!\" she screamed in her mind at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet Ahsoka knew all too well of the power it would occasionally get over her and stuffer her ever ballooning belly even further to the gills. (Whilte that might be taken literally in the star wars galaxy Ahsoka's species the Togrutas do not have gills.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered how much longer she could keep it at bay before it would take over and make her eat almost to the point of bursting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the sun began to set and the darkness of night began to engulf the surface of Nar Shaddaa Ahsoka and Shindala hid in a narrow alley about 6 meters wide sandwiched between 2 giant buildings they couldn't see the tops of one brown on the left one blue on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shindala began to become anxious, \"We don't have a roof over our heads and we have found nothing, furthermore...\" she was about to say something when her stomach loudly growled with hunger, and as Shindala placed her hand on her fat belly as if she was pregnant she realized she needen't explain any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll call off  the search for now we need to find some where to hole up for the night.\" Ahsoka is unaware of the day/night cycle for Nar Shaddaa but she did know that the streets of slums become exponentially more dangerous at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The night on Nar Shaddaa lasts  over 43 hours there's no way were going to be able to stay cramped inside a building without supplies.\" (yes that info is accurate look it up on the starwars wiki wookieepedia)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have the money to stay at a hotel room.\" Ahsoka told Shindala which made them even more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could just use mind trick like we did before.\" The voice of the Holocron spoke inside Ahsoka's mind, \"That's only a temporary solution and too risky to overuse. It might get them to turn us into the empire when they catch on, besides some of the patrons just might be species that are immune to it.\" Ahsoka thought thinking it over to her side... for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where else can we go?\" it asked rhetorically. This made Ahsoka get angry with it then she heard the sound of Shindala screaming and falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming it can only mean a thug or worse clone troopers Ahsoka drew her Lightsaber but didn't deploy the blade she wanted to save it for after she found out what the trouble was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instead found an open exhaust port on the side of the alley that was beneath the brown building to the left. it was pitch black the port but it looked large enough for Ahsoka even with her bloated form to fit inside then she heared Shinala scream her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be Quiet!\" Ahsoka yelled back before holstering her Lightsaber and going prone on the ground to use the port as a sound amp. Even with her cloak covering her belly the ground still felt like sandpaper. \"What happened?\" she whispered it worked well enough that they could both hear their answers without the risk of alerting eavesdroppers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for a way to the nearest Cantina when I fell in here!\" Shindala answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka then looked up and noticed that the cover was missing. making it easy for someone to fall in if they were careless enough. She then decieded to go inside and after standing back up (no easy feat with her bloated form she had to use the force to do so) and looking around certain that no one was watching she used the force again  to pick up nearby debris (sheet metal trash the whole city was almost literally a garbage dump they were that dirty) large enough to cover it behind her after she went inside and heavy enough that it would take a vehicle the alley was too narrow for or a force user to remove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka then deployed the blade of her light saber to use as a lantern as she does not know of any force powers that could do this. She found Shindala unhamed who then told her. \"This place looks like some kind of basement.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But to what?\" Ahsoka asked Shindala was unfamiliar with the area they were in above. Luckily they were able to find a light switch and with that Ashoka holstered her Lightsaber and then asked Shinala to take out her blaster an old SE-14 pistol. (Yes she has one she stole it from a separatist droid that was a body guard her a  techno union member former hutt master made a deal of a sort with when no one was looking she didn't use it to kill the hutt because she knew it wasn't strong enough. And the hutt took away her weapons after each job and gave her none when she was traded to Ahsoka. Who found out about it during their girl talk.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was basically empty nothing but generators with broken pipes that were supposed to seal shut the exhaust port, but didn't they were cold to the touch and have not been used in along time the power must be coming from the occupied floors above. Ahsoka could hear the noises of animals coming from the other side of the only door in the 20 square meter room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened the door and went in 1 at a time the scene that greeted them wasn't pretty they found 3 human skeletons lying on the ground the room was crowed with poisonous Morps (a pest animal from Degobah look it up) \"Watch out!\" the voice screamed at Ahsoka in her mind. One swung by and almost bit her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't talk long for Ahsoka and Shindala to kill all 20 of them, Shinndala used her blaster as Ahsoka used force Lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room had everything 3 cots for beds a bathroom, a trash compacter and a Bonfire pit and it was huge of about 60 cubic meters in volume. But it was next to empty This was no squatter nest, this was a hideout! But how did these Morps get so far from their home world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka found a note on the door that lead out to the main building and read it out loud. \"Your debt remains unpaid we warned you twice before there will not be a third you have 13 hours.\" The paper was old but no that old this happened somewhat recently the skeletons were stripped clean of meat but the morp must not have eaten in days. No wonder they were so aggressive, despite their meek fatness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShindala then saw the note \"That emblem at the bottom belongs to the Hutt you bought me from! He killed these poor people.\"  This made Ahsoka even more determined to kill that Hutt then she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can wait till the... morning.\" the voice of the Holocron spoke to Ahsoka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Spent the next hour extracting the poision from the Morp with what they could find then they cooked them for a meal before bed...</span></div></div>",

She brought up a small holographic display, asking her what food she would like it to dispense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What to choose, what to choose...</i> she pondered momentarily, moving her hand towards the 'energy bar' button. Suddenly, something clicked inside her mind, and Ahsoka's hand darted down the list towards 'Carbohydrate and Protein booster.' She furiously pressed the button multiple times, until the dispenser tray was full of vacuum-sealed bags of energy paste. Without thinking, Ahsoka took them, ripped off the tops, and shoveled them into her greedily waiting maw. They tasted like lard mixed with bread crumbs, and that was what it basically was. They also contained assorted digestion and metabolization aids, meant to give clone troopers in the heat of battle boosts of energy. However, due to the fact that Ahsoka was not of the same height, weight, build, or even the same species as the average clone trooper, there were some rather unintended side effects. Firstly, they were digested almost instantly, meaning that she now had approximately 10,000 extra calories in her system. Oddly enough, they manifested themselves mainly on her breasts, rump, and thighs. The next thing Ahsoka knew, it's that her clothes were all suddenly a lot tighter. After overcoming the shock, she stood in front of the reflective front of the food dispenser, checking herself out with a dirty smirk playing itself across her face. She shook her booty for a bit, and once the fact that she actually had a little jiggle wore off, Ahsoka decided to go and grab some more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ahsoka walked towards the ship's storage bay, she put an emphasis on swaying her now-wider hips, and occasionally slapping her butt just to feel the jiggle, reveling in how sexy she had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe after they stop hunting the Jedi, I can become a stripper, maybe on Malastare, Nar Shaddaa, Courascant...</i> As she mulled over the concepts of showing off her breasts for money, the velvety smooth voice returned to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, Darth Phegia, yes... you would be the most fabulous stripper, you could simply live the rest of your life in hedonism and debauchery... but don't you think that your assets are a bit, um, small?</i> Ahsoka nodded her head, and found that she was at the door already. She slid it open, and stepped into the cold, climate-controlled air. She walked over to the nearest food container, pressed a few buttons, yanked off the lid, and indulged. More of those protein/carb energy boosts. She scarfed them down like she was possessed, and, by all accounts, she was. She stopped after several rips, stood up, and checked herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka's ass was probably twice as wide as before, with two nice, large cheeks the size of dinner plates, with orange flesh oozing out of the rips along the seams. These tapered down to well-padded thighs, oddly thick calves, and feet that had grown as a side effect of the chemicals in her choice snack, and were begging to burst out of her Jedi-issue boots. moving upwards, her ass rested on two voluptuous hips, a round, bulging gut that made her look seven months pregnant. Two large, round breasts, bursting out of a woefully inadequate top. her arms seemed a bit longer, and her shoulders seemed a bit broader, but Ahsoka didn't mind. Her neck seemed a bit thicker, but also longer. Her face seemed unchanged, except that her lekku seemed longer and fuller, the presence of a devilish glint in her eyes, and that her teeth looked a bit more like fangs. Overall, Ahsoka's skin seemed to be a bit redder than normal, and her body looked ridiculously hourglass-shaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka, looking at her reflection with a devilish grin, started to do a dance that would make most professional strippers jealous. As she got lost in the rhythm, the motion, the feeling of her ass swinging like a giant club, the Holocron tried to communicate to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Phegia, are you not hungry? do you not wish to continue your binge, and grow more beautiful? I mean, you-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, shut up,\" Ahsoka moaned, before grabbing it and shoving it down into her rather large cleavage and resuming her dance. Then again, it did have a point. Ahsoka stopped. She looked at the food stores, and wondered if she could continue to indulge in the protein/carb boost slime, or should she try to consume the pretty large tank of lard in the corner?</span></div></div>",

However, this was accompanied by some internal pain, almost as if her bones were shifting. When the pain subsided, Ahsoka once again admired her looks in a reflective surface. First off, her skin was more reddish-orange, having darkened as one of the side effects. Her hips were wider, and now more high up and forward on her body. Her torso seemed a bit shorter and rounder, but her neck, now almost as wide as head, was longer, so there was little height decrease. Her shoulders now seemed wider, and her arms longer and thicker. Her hands were large for any humanoid creature that's not a wookie. Ahsoka's perky breasts were the size of her heard, with two-inch-long, taut, red-orange nipples being barely contained by a tattered strip that was once her top. Her breasts rested atop a globular gut almost a meter wide, adorned with a bellybutton that popped almost an inch outwards. Her enormous hips seemed to rest under her belly itself, rather than at the base of her spine. Ahsoka's ass surpassed her bust easily in terms of size, and how much they destroyed her clothes, but this time, were wider apart and higher up on her back, halfway sticking out of the belt that she had once considered waist-high; they still had more jiggle than ever. Her thighs were a bit smaller than her ass cheeks, suddenly tapered down to her knees, and then her calves were almost as big again. Her feet were very large, having burst out of her boots long ago. The fact that she now had giant paddle-sized feet didn't bother Ahsoka; she felt that they would give her better traction for pole-dancing. The lekku on her head were now taking on a reddish tint, and were now much longer and thicker. Her red-orange face seemed to be a bit \"fuller,\" and her eyes a bit redder, but she had what most would consider a paragon of beauty, with fat, red lips, high cheekbones, and a set of pearly white <u>fangs</u> teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ahsoka looked at herself, and reveled in her voluptuousness, she heard what sounded like a ship landing outside. A small pinging noise was coming from her comlink, which she quickly crushed with her giant foot. As the sound of footsteps on the ship grew louder, Ahsoka felt scared, and divisive on what she should do. </span></div></div>",

All those chemicals from the protein/carb energy paste bars and the side effects certainly did a number on her. Her main feature was a large, globular, bright red gut, over <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">four</span> five feet wide, with a bellybutton bigger than most people's fists popping out. Extending from the bottom of her gut were two very short, very thick legs, ending in a pair of gargantuan two-toed feet. A set of very long, muscular arms seemed to jut out from the top of the gut, ending in freakishly large hands, which Ahsoka used mainly to help walk, not unlike a gorilla. A big, fat set of ass cheeks were set on the back of her gut, constantly wobbling whenever she took a step. Two big, jiggling breasts sat right above the gut, as big as her ass, with very large, constantly erect nipples. Her gut tapered into a long, fat-wrapped neck, topped by two chins, and a pudgy red face. Ahsoka had two large, gleaming, yellow-green eyes, a set of nice, pearly white, razor-sharp teeth (perfect for chewing large quantities of food), and was adorned by two very fat red and black Lekku that almost touched the floor. She had adorned her corpulent body with black tattoos, making her look like a Sith who she could vaguely remember at times between alcohol-induced blackouts. Also, to help sever herself from her former life, she adopted \"Phegia\" (much to the Holocron's delight) as her stripper name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very long day of shaking her big, red, chemically-altered tits for money, Phegia gathered the worn bag containing all her belongings (i.e., her pulverized old clothes, some loose Imperial credits, some bottles of alcohol from who-knows-where, a familiar small black-and-red pyramid, and her lightsaber), threw on a cheap garment, and headed out onto the streets. She grabbed a random bottle from her bag, started chugging, and felt a groan as the alcohol was almost instantly metabolized into fat. Another side effect of OD'ing on those chemical-laced energy paste packets a while back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where will the fat go today?</i> Phegia pondered as she tossed the now-empty bottle into an alleyway. The ripping sound just below her long neck confirmed her thoughts. <i>Yep. My boobs. Well, that may help me get more tips at the club-</i> her lewd thoughts were interrupted by a whistling from the other side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man, check out the piece of ass on that one! I mean, she's literally all ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that's just... c'mon, man! She's bright red! Ya wanna end up with more STDs than uncle Jim when he was a pilot? Plus, is she even, ya know, compatible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, she's exactly what I want in a woman. And shut up about your goddamn uncle, Kirk. I mean...\" Phegia stepped in to shut the two up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clone troopers, I see. New armor. I still hate them all the goddamn same!</i> The words that silkily flowed from her mouth reflected the exact opposite. \"Excuse me, gentlemen, but are any of you interested, in, umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trooper on the right took a step back, saying, \"Oh, you mean my friend here? Yeah... it's him you want. Heh heh heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the left took Phegia by the arm, and she asked him, \"So where do you wanna go, baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked into the nearby motel, Phegia nudged his arm. The trooper begrudgingly opened a small compartment on the side of his armor, and handed over a few credits. The moment he had the key, she gestured for him to go on ahead, then did a subtle hand wave towards the concierge, muttering, \"Give me the credits back. The room is free.\" Phegia smirked as she shoved the cash into her cleavage and went on. Once they were in the room, they hopped in the bed, and began slowly undressing. The trooper had blond hair. Seems the Empire is trying to wean itself off clones onto good old-fashioned conscription. When her top came off, her  bright-red breasts sprang forth after being released from their fabric prison, and the trooper certainly seemed awestruck. Suddenly, a feeling washed over Phegia, one she had not felt in a long time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Are these men not your enemies? Those who have tried to kill you? And yet you sleep with them?!</i> the Holocron's voice echoed through her head. Phegia, overwhelmed with anger, grabbed the stormtrooper's head and stuffed it into her gargantuan cleavage. As his muffled screams faded, she felt a sudden rush of empowerment, almost giddiness. This was the first kill she had in months! Her person-sized stomach rumbled, and she realized that it had been almost an entire day since she last ate, and she needed to maintain her figure! Phegia stared at the still-warm body, hungrily... Shaking her head, she then put it out of her mind. She may be a stripper, outlaw, hooker, and murderer (among other things), but eating people wasn't her style. Out of the corner of her eye, Phegia noticed the dead trooper's discarded armor lying on the floor. She sprang from the bed, pulled her worn dress back on, and popped open the storage compartment. There was quite a bit inside: several hundred credits, a standard issue comlink, some extra blaster magazines, and a few rations. Phegia's eyes grew wide at one of the items: a packet of the energy boost paste, with a small sticker that said \"Extreme energy dose\" in large, friendly letters. She held it in her hand, wondering if she should eat it. Phegia thought of the side effects, but were they really all that bad? She pulled in more money than the other strippers in the club. She had nothing to lose, right?</span></div></div>",

It was digested and metabolized almost instantly, and she fainted from the near-orgasmic burst of energy, and the pain shooting through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Phegia awoke, she felt totally different, and checking herself out in the reflection of the window confirmed it. Her gut had become at least two feet bigger all over, and felt taut, like a red and black balloon, with a belly button sticking out twice as far as before. Her hips had mostly been absorbed into her gut, and her feet seemed much, much wider, with her toes now the size of the average foot. Her arms, now even wider and longer, seemed to have lost a major portion of muscle mass, but also felt taut like her gut. Her hands had grown to rival the size of her feet, and it seemed she now only had three fingers! Turning around showed that her ass had doubled in size, shaking furiously at the slightest provocation. When Phegia looked down, she never realized that her breasts were so high up- only to notice that she had grown an extra pair! All fours' nipples were very large, and almost orgasmically sensitive. Her freakishly long neck was now even longer, almost as wide as her globular gut. Atop that sat a face that seemed incredibly fat, with large, full cheeks, and a larger mouth to compensate. The additional increase in the size, weight, and thickness of her lekku was almost unnoticeable compared to the rest of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhegia, noticing the size of her hands and length of her arms, tried walking on them, not unlike a Dug from Malastare. They were much more efficient than using her short, fat-draped legs, and were much faster.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Phegia walked around the room with her hands, rather odd changes occurred. Her arms became a bit longer, and a lot thicker. Her hands widened to the point of being closer to giant feet. Meanwhile, her actual feet had started growing even bigger and wider. The weirdest goings-on were with her gargantuan stomach. It started expanding like a giant balloon, with her already massive shoulders widening to help hold it, and her tree-trunk arms and hands rapidly growing to support the weight. Phegia's massive feet had continued growing, until they were absolutely massive, and constantly smelled worse than an astromech droid in the desert with a small man crammed inside it. Her gut, and by extension her arms and hands, continued to expand until they threatened to dominate the room. The giant red boulder was as tight as a drum, continuing to get tighter, and her bellybutton had become three times the size of her head. When everything stopped growing, her massive midsection seemed to almost contain two separate, equally large bulges, and that was correct. Phegia's uterus had been converted into a second stomach, which then managed to grow and dominate her lower half. A side effect of this was the fact that she would be in a constant super-orgasm, and she didn't mind. Another effect was that a new intestine, liver, etc. had to form, and so Phegia spent the next half hour or so continuously farting and burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time, that was over, Phegia tried to figure out movement. It was no major problem, considering how her arms had adapted into giant legs. Her original feet, however, had ended up right near her gargantuan bellybutton. They could perform basic functions like stomping, grabbing, crushing, and climbing. As Phegia tried to leave the motel room, she found it was fruitless. So, she burst through the transparisteel window, landed on the ground with a crash, and took off running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Phegia realized that she forgot the Holocron with her bag, she felt a familiar weight inside her ample quad-cleavage. Satisfied, she continued towards the nearest spaceport, she hopped right inside the door of a massive cargo freighter. As she settled down for a long nap, the Holocron spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are certainly enjoying your new form, it seems. It reminds me of my former master. But forget that, you have a ful<b>filling</b> day ahead of you. Sweet dreams...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the cargo ship was attacked by space pirates, and crashed on an unidentified planet. Phegia stumbled out of the wreckage into the blinking sun, looked around, and realized that this place was perfect! Besides the beautiful fields and meadows, there were plenty of huge, fat, slow, quite delicious animals wandering everywhere. She ran wild, grabbing every single edible thing with her feet, and shoving it in her eager maw. Eventually, her body became encumbered with giant rolls of lard, but her giant arms would always adapt, causing her to continue on her quest to one day become too fat to move, somehow constantly have sex, become pregnant, and create a harem of fat women to constantly pleasure her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phegia, motivated by the deafening grumbling in her globular gut, decided to hold off on the energy bar, and tossed it and the trooper's other belongings into her bag. She stuffed the credits into her cleavage (the only real safe place for her to store something), dumped the body in the room's hydrobath, turned on the water, and waddled out of the room. On her way out, Phegia waved her hand at the motel's concierge, saying, \"The man drowned in the bath. It was an accident. No need to alert the authorities,\" then walked out into the night. She walked for at least a few minutes, seriously wearing her out, and her giant feet were aching and swollen from the tremendous strain. Right as she stopped to take her 7th breather, her yellow eyes looked up, and lo and behold, there was an all-you-can-eat buffet across the street! Phegia hurried in, her fatigue replaced by ravenous hunger. She slammed a few dozen credits down on the hostess' booth, demanding \"Sorry for no reservation, but get me the biggest chair in the house.\" A light purple Twi'lek waitress, who clearly let working at a buffet get to her, led Phegia to her seat, which was usually reserved for the occasional Hutt. The waitress's ass was... inticing to Phegia. She considered squeezing or slapping the two jiggling, purple globes, but she wasn't willing to get thrown out of the restaurant for harassing an employee. After getting settled in and browsing all of the menu, she told the waitress, \"I'll have two of each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what two dishes do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you misunderstood me. I meant not two of entrees, or two of each special, but two of <i>everything</i>. Okay?\" Phegia then politely asked, \"Also, can you please put me down for the buffet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay, ma'am, right away!\" and the waitress hurried off. Satisfied, Phegia got up, headed over to the buffet line, grabbed the largest plate she saw, and started piling on as much food as it could hold. When it was full, she set it back on her table, then filled up another plate. This continued until there were eight or nine plates filling her table, each piled high with assorted greasy and fried entrees. She sat back down, pulled a plate closer, and started digging in. Phegia didn't give a damn about utensils, manners, or anything else, just shoveling it in with her hands. When she finished the food, she shrugged, and tossed the plate in her mouth, too! The moment the food hit her stomach, her metabolism went to work, digesting it and storing it as fat near-instantaneously. As she finished the first dish, Phegia heard a loud rip and a thunk. Her dress had almost been completely destroyed, and the table in front of her was dominated by two red and black, gargantuan breasts, each about half the size of her stomach before starting the meal. Looking beyond that, her midsection was a good foot wider, and seemed a bit taller. Her bellybutton popped out farther, and seemed a bit bigger. A quick turnaround showed that Phegia's ass had definitely grown to be a bit bigger than her breasts, but mostly seemed to be wider instead of bigger all around. The initial shock from this wore off after about two seconds, and she returned to messily devouring her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, the Twi'lek waitress from earlier walked back to the table where Phegia was binging, and tried to interrupt her multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, ma'am-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hork* *gulp* *om nom nom*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, your foo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ump* \"BUUUURP\" *slorp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, excuse me! Answer me, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHUF?! Whuf isch if?\" Phegia blurted through a half-chewed rost nerf sandwich, \"Ah'm troingf tuh eat! <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Bisch...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress coolly responded, \"Ma'am, I was just trying to tell you that your food arrived. Where would you like me to put it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shorryf. Jusht schet if all un that tchable.\" The waitress pulled up the nearest table, which was meant for 6 people, and several chefs brought out tray after tray of assorted dishes, completely covering both tables. They even had to rest a couple on Phegia's giant breasts. She managed to give a somewhat apathetic 'thanks,' before resuming her ungodly consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Three hours later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhegia awoke from a food coma, and groggily looked about the area. The restaurant was mostly empty, and all the remaining patrons had seemed to move to the other side of the restaurant, and she didn't need to guess why. Looking down showed that every square inch of flesh between her mouth and her bellybutton was covered in a myriad of spilled sauces, stains, and assorted scraps. Her large hands were equally messy, and checking out the rest of herself wasn't exactly a paragon of cleanliness, either. Phegia's gargantuan globular gut seemed to be at least 11 feet wide, and almost as tall. Her neck had seemed to be almost completely absorbed into her stomach, so it looked like her head and a few thick chins were right . Her breasts were a good five feet across, with foot-long, constantly erect dark red nipples sticking straight in the air. Piled up on her stomach, she could barely see over them! Behind her gut, Phegia's gigantic, very jiggly ass was a good deal larger than her breasts, almost pinning her to the ground. Her arms seemed to have lost a good deal of muscle mass, and could barely reach down to her bellybutton. All over, her fat seemed to start accumulating in rolls, with more love handles lining her flanks than an amateur climbing wall. Her entire body was covered in food stains and sweat, and frankly, she smelled disgusting. Phegia didn't mind, however. She found it all nice, somewhat enjoyable. When the waitress came back, she debated her course of actions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I hope the food was good. So, are you all finished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhegia replied, \"Yeah, I'd- *UUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP!* Sorry about that, I want...\"</span></div></div>",

The blob of a Togruta's eyes almost fell out of their sockets when she saw the total! Quickly thinking, Phegia waved her grease-coated hand, saying, \"Can you find a discount for me?\" The waitress monotonously replied, \"I can find a discount, one minute,\" and ran back. A minute later, she returned with the bill, which was much lower. Phegia reached between her gargantuan breasts (hey, more storage space!), and pulled out the several hundred credits she owed. Noticing the spilled food caking them, she licked it off, and handed it over to the waitress. The Twi'lek gingerly accepted them, and hurriedly walked to the kitchen with a look of disgust on her face. Phegia finally worked up enough energy to stand up, and slowly began walking on her huge feet towards the exit. After half an hour of lumbering across the restaurant, her head bumping against the ceiling every painfully slow step, 10-foot tall, spherical belly and ass cheeks sliding along the ground. After what seemed like an eternity, Phegia made it across the room, and squeezed through the giant doors. She eventually realized that there is no way this is going to work for her in the long run. Thinking of what to do, she remembered the office of a Chiss surgeon who she visited for some boob-jobs (before her metabolism became altered enough to do it all on its own). He didn't ask questions, wasn't incredibly pricey, and had some, ahem, less-than-legal genetic splicing equipment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the first rays of sunlight began to pierce through the smog, Phegia arrived at the oversized loading door for the doc's aged building. She pressed the intercom button, and a slightly haughty voice, with hints of 'I can't believe I'm low enough to do this for a living', answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc? It's Phegia. Ya' know, the stripper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one? I service a lot of clients of your nature...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bright red, black tats everywhere, <i>was</i> a Togruta, gigantic stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes! You! Are you alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, come on up. I'm pulling up your file.\" A confirmatory buzz later, the large durasteel door creaked open. Phegia began her slow path to the service elevator, and her even slower ascent to the office's level. By the time she arrived, the doctor had opened the secondary, larger door to his dingy office (he had to accommodate for a lot of alien breeds). A all, middle-aged yet strikingly handsome Chiss was standing there in a white lab coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile gawking at the fact that a 13-foot tall, totally nude, food-coated, red-and-black big-bellied beast, the doctor said, \"Why hello, Phegia, I- wow. What- no, I don't even want to ask. Too much trouble for when the authorities eventually raid this place. So, what did you want? Doesn't look like you need another breast implant...\" he inquired, his initial surprise fading into apathy, before pulling out a holo-tablet and jotting down notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've done the tests, you know how my metabolism is, and I recently went to an all-you-can-eat buffet, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and all those calories were converted into excess adipose tissue nigh-instantly. Seems to be mostly distributed around the abdomen, mammaries, and buttocks...\" he continued, taking a slightly-too-long peek at Phegia's massive breasts. Gesturing towards what looked like an oversized airport metal detector, the Chiss asked, \"Would you mind walking through the bio-scanner?\" As the massive, red-and-black blob squeezed her way through, her readouts were streamed to the holo-tablet in the doctor's hand:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Name: Phegia, (N/A)<br>\r\nSpecies: Togruta<br>\r\nSex: F<br>\r\nHeight: 12' 9\"<br>\r\nWeight: 4,507 IWU (Imperial Weight Units)<br>\r\nBlood Pressure: 190/110 (<b>WARNING: DANGEROUSLY HIGH</b>)<br>\r\nHeart Rate (BPM): 127 (<b>WARNING: DANGEROUSLY HIGH</b>)<br>\r\nChanges (from last scan): Arm lengths +98%, Brain size -17%, Foot size +366%, Hand size +308%, Heart size +45%, Jaw size +109%, Leg lengths - 88%, Liver size +137%, Lung sizes +82%, Pelvis width +695%, Stomach size +2694%,</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chiss read Phegia's results over with about as much interest as if they read \"perfectly normal in every way.\" Turning to his corpulent client, who managed to get her  fat ass stuck in the bio-scanner, he queried, \"But you never answered my earlier question, Phegia. Why exactly are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreeing her naked butt while inadvertently breaking something in the bio-scanner's frame, Phegia started, \"Well, doc, as you can probably see, I can't exactly move as well as I used to with all my blubber-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was wondering...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you could do something about it, ya' know?\" accompanied with an I-don't know shrug (if you could see her shoulders under her fat).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you imagine I do to address the issue present concerning your corpulence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

Do you have any bugs or recording devices hidden on you? Hell, the police could hide an entire camera crew under your flanks. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Not like they wouldn't suffocate in there...</font>\" He held his hand onto an innocuous-looking wall, typed a few digits into a hidden keypad, and pushed open the secret door. Inside, there were assorted medical machines, a shelf burdened with piles of vials, and a few very sharp syringes. Phegia squeezed in barely, and lumbered into the center of the room. She plopped down right in the middle of everything, and the doctor started wiping her arm with some alcohol in preparation for any injections. Eventually, he asked her, \"So, what do you want me to enhance for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of pondering, Phegia responded, \"I'd like...\"</span></div></div>",

I'll assume you want some Hutt DNA. It'll take me a few moments to isolate the particular genetic sequences you desire. Don't worry about your legs, either; I'll tweak them to be like a secondary set of arms,\" while selecting a few vials from the shelves and inserting them into a large device. After about 30 seconds, there was a nice little *ding!* and the Chiss pulled a vial out from the machine's other end. He walked up to Phegia, strapping on a few IVs (with long needles), vital sign monitors, etc. Grabbing a large and scary-looking syringe, he reassured her, \"Don't worry. This is just the sedative. Without it, the process would be... <i>uncomfortable</i>.\" As the needle slid into her arm, Phegia's vision became fuzzy, then eventually faded to darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Four hours later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhegia slowly woke up as the sedative wore off. Something about her felt... different. Trying to turn her head, she found she couldn't, as if her neck had disappeared. Her lekku had become a lot thicker, lower on her head, and were the same red as her skin. Next, an odd feeling arose in her mouth. Sticking out her tongue, she noticed it was a good foot longer, and somewhat slimy-looking. To accompany this, her mouth seemed a bit wider. Glancing down between her now somewhat-bigger breasts, adorned with giant nipples thicker than someone's waist, showed that her belly seemed a lot taller and wider, and fuller in the front. Her belly button seemed to be almost as large as her gut before that binge at the buffet. Just underneath the fat, she could see her gargantuan secondary hands, resting on the reams of fat lining her base. Phegia managed to look behind her, and resting just below her 10-foot tall ass cheeks, there was a bright red, overstuffed-looking Hutt tail that was about 25 feet long. For fun, she tried wriggling it. It moved perfectly. She tried moving on it. She slid along as if she had been doing it for her entire life. As she was enjoying herself, the Chiss walked back in through the secret door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good, you're awake. So, about the payment, were you thinking cash or credit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Phegia rumbled, her voice sounding a bit deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor continued, \"I require payment, you know. I hope you saved all those tips from your brothel...\" and strained to hand up the holotablet with the bill. Phegia glanced at it, and her eyes looked like they were going to fall out of her head! \"I- I- I don't know if I can pay this off, doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a malevolent gleam in his red eyes, he murmured, \"I figured as such. Maybe we can work something out...\"</span></div></div>",

As soon as Ahsoka got of the phone she immediately felt a wave of exhaustion, and decided to have a quick nap while she waited. So getting up with a great effort from her new weight. Carrying her swollen she went into her room and fell fast asleep. As she slept her weight again began to disperse through her body. Much of it went into her already large breasts causing them to swell and rip open her top, having grown four more sizes. Her belly grew a lot as well now sticking out six feet. Her butt was know six feet wider on each side, also causing her pants to completely rip open causing her to be completely naked under the blankets. She then woke up a few minutes before the delivery guy was set to arrive. She went into the bath room to see her new features and loved them. She rubbed her self all over then went over to the scale to see her new weight. It was hard for her to see the scale but finally was able to make out over her belly the numbers. 557 pounds. \" Wow\" she said \" in a span of less then two days I have gained over 650 pounds.\" Then she heard someone knock on the door. \"Hello i have your pizza\" said the delivery boy\". \" Hold on just a minute\" she said. Quickly she she walked (or rather waddled) to her bed room and searched for something that would cover up her now massive size. She got on her biggest top and pants that both barely able able to cover her up. After 10 minutes of fuss she got it on and quickly went down stairs opened the door and got her food from the impatient delivery boy. Then went inside and began her next feast. <br>\r\nShe began to gorge her self on the food. After about half way into her pizza she heard a loud rip coming from behind her she turned and saw nothing. Then she looked down and saw that a big tear in the rear of her pants, which was the last pare that would fit her. I need to go get some new clothes.

So she is now heading to the mess hall and is going to eat. She learned that when she ate, she didn't feel guilty and it put her nerves down. She went into the kitchen and got everything you could eat off the menu and ate. After eating half of the food her belly had grown and it was pushing back the table she was eating from. After finishing eating all the food, her stomach was about the size of a bear and her hight had grown as well, she was now 10 feet tall and she walked right back to her room and fell asleep without even noticing the changes to her body.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts were the size of watermelons and she touched them. They felt soft and hard at the same time, it felt like someone could use them as a pillow. She then looked behind and saw her butt was now humungus. Ahsoka can feel the power her buttocks have and her bed was shaking from the weight of ahsoka's butt and if that ass was to hit anybody they would be knocked out in one shot. She tried to look at her legs but her belly was so big that she couldn't even see them. She got up which took a lot of evort and she saw that her hight had increased because her head hit the ceiling. Ahsoka thought: oh no! What am I going to do, I can't let anybody see me like this, I... I have to find a way to reverse this.

Ahsoka started walking to Barriss room and after what felt like an eternity she finally reached Barriss room and looked st how small the door was now.

Ahsoka belly was huge blocking his view of her face, he moved up and saw that her breast had grown bigger, about the size of watermelons and then Ahsoka woke up. Hello master, Ahsoka saw her masters face and asked what's wrong, um Ahsoka what happened to you. Ahsoka gave a confused look and he pointed to the front and Ahsoka was face to face with her big orange blob of a belly. It was massive, as if she ate someone of Anickans size and her breast were bigger than her head. Ahsoka got up and stood up only to realize she towered over Anickan, then she looked at a mirror and saw that her butt was huge, she touched it and it was soft and powerful at the same time. Ahsoka what happened to you, master I may have been eating a lot to calm my nerves but I didn't know this would happen I'm... Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrppppppppppppp pppppppppppppppp. Ahsoka let out a large bleach in Anickan face which sent him flying into the wall. Ahsoka eyes went wide and she looked at her body again. So much power in my veins Ahsoka thought. Well Ahsoka you won't be able to fight like this so I'm going to send you to a secret base where you can live and I can find you a cure. Ahsoka agreed and went into the ship only for her butt to get stuck. Come on Ahsoka groaned and tried to wiggle and jiggle her butt free but she couldn't.

When she was young, all she wanted to be was a jedi, if she could talk to her younger self, she would giggle at her and tell her she was crazy. She was beyond any jedi or Sith now, now she was a Gigantic goddess who ate planets, protected the universe and most of all protected innocent people. </span></div></div>",

Whenever Ahsoka wasn't being fed by the guards, escorted for a quick bathroom trip, weighed by FD-9 or taunted by Ventress, she was reflecting on the changes made to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once flat stomach was a massive belly that looked like it belonged to a Hutt. Her now giant ass jiggled every time Ahsoka waddled around the huge fortress she was in. Her arms were so big, she was convinced she could crush a Super Battle Droid with them. Ahsoka's chunky legs shook the ground each time she took a step and her now enormous breasts could feed a family for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of Ahsoka's clothing had been ripped apart by her weight gain, the only clothing that she was wearing being her panties. Everything else had slowly been ripped apart, exposing a lot more than skin than Ahsoka felt comfortable showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being allowed breaks to go to the toilet while being escorted, she wasn't allowed any showers, leaving her to smell like a Hutt, as well as look like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress also started visiting after each of Ahsoka's feeds just to gloat at Ahsoka. She would usually do this by taunting Ahsoka for thinking she was going to be rescued, calling her <b>Ass</b>oka or showing off the Togruta's lightsabers which she'd taken from her when she captured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka had just finished her most recent feeding, when FD-9 ordered her to be brought for her weigh in. She stepped on the scales and after a few seconds of waiting Ahsoka's new weight displayed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"300 lbs\" read the weighing scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" said FD-9, sounding as close to happy as an emotionless machine could. \"You will be transported to his excellencies' palace tomorrow. For now, you will return to your cell and rest. You have a lot happening tomorrow\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke the two guards began to lead Ahsoka  back to her room, as she waddled along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached Ahsoka's cell, she was chained back into position by the guards. As they began to leave, Ahsoka noticed a bald, white-skinned assassin walk into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Assoka!\" Ventress mocked. \"Aw, what's the matter? Did you finally realize how you're never going to be rescued?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't have to worry about that. After tomorrow, they'll never find you. Oh, but don't worry about your precious master. After you've been successfully delivered, I'm going to pay him a little visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress then began to laugh maniacally, before leaving the Togruta Padawan alone with her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka, knew that tomorrow would be her only time for escape and so had come up with a plan on how to get free and escape. She hoped that it would work because she didn't want to be force-fed anymore (even though she slightly liked it, though she'd never outright state it).</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ahsoka was now walking down a long corridor to the starship that would transport her to Urado. Behind her were her two guards (one of which was had the keys yo her cuffs) and in front of her were FD-9 and Ventress. Ahsoka  felt embarrassed from how much of her was exposed to everyone, but she also felt confident. Confident in not only herself, but her plan as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka's recent weight gain had resulted in her becoming a bit gassy especially after her feedings or if someone touched her belly. Due to this Ahsoka had found out quickly, that if she concentrated hard enough, she could use the Force via belching. It was the only way she could use it as her cuffs still prevented her from using the Force with her arms. She had only used small amounts of the Force, when practicing it, for if she had used more she knew someone would notice. Her plan was finally ready and it was now time to enact it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka stopped walking (or waddling) forward, causing the guards behind her to bump into her as they had spent having a conversation. Ventress, noticing this started ordering her to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Ahsoka? Move. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me move!\" Ventress said slightly louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka still didn't move, concentrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress, starting to lose her patience, started prodding Ahsoka in the belly \"I know you heard me you overgrown bantha, now move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Ventress stopped talking, Ahsoka let out a massive burp so powerful it threw FD-9 and her down to the end of the hallway. Ahsoka meanwhile got sent backwards from the force of the burp onto her two guards, knocking them out as she landed on top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka got took the key her guard had, got up as quick as she could and unlocked her handcuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress had just started getting up, looking furious at the plump Togruta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll end you for that, Assoka\" she roared, charging at her and igniting her lightsabers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever before she could reach her fat foe, Ahsoka having removed her cuffs used the Force to pickup FD-9 and toss it at Ventress, who was knocked out. She used the Force to pick up one of her lighgsabers, that Ventress still had and used it to cut up FD-9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka took a moment to celebrate before taking both her two lightsabers and Ventress's as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider that revenge for turning me into a fat slob\" Ahsoka said before letting out a small fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed for a moment and began to walk off when she noticed a large door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening it, she entered an even larger room filled with tanks of the same goop she'd been fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is where it was all being kept.\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went up to one of the tanks and saw her reflection in the glass. This was the first good look Ahsoka had got of her new body. Looking at her body, Ahsoka had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka started feeling her new body, fondling her massive tits, touching her mountain of an ass and jiggling around her huge belly. Ahsoka LOVED her new body, but she hated how she got it and what this meant for her future. She knew her life would never be the same. It'd be impossible know to lose all this weight and she'd only gain more ad time passed. She wouldn't be able to participate in massive full scale fights because she knew she'd be a walking target. All of these thoughts went around Ahsoka's head and she thought of who was responsible for this: Ventress and Urado the Hutt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scowled. She could deal with Ventress now and she could \"introduce\" Urado to his new slave girl, but she didn't know what to do with Ventress yet. Thinking of Ventress, she looked around the room she looked at the gallons of the goo that had forced her into a Hutt with legs. Suddenly Ahsoka had a brilliant idea to give Ventress a taste of her own medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took Ventress to the room she'd been chained up previously and chained her up. Then she brought several barrels to her cell before leaving her to put the unconscious guardsmen in another prison cell. She decided to have a quick shower, just to get rid of her stench after she took a wiff under her armpit and threw up in her mouth from the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Ahsoka had spent some time combining her lightsabers and Ventress's to make a larger lightsaber that she could use. She remembered hearing them called \"Lightclubs\" back at the Jedi Temple. They were a type of lightsaber that was used by larger aliens or fat Jedi. She had combined the crystals from both her and Ventress' lightsaber making the blade a dark brown. After testing it out and swinging it a bit, she started to hear Ventress yelling to be let out. Grinning Ahsoka walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for my next plan \" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress was not happy having been chained in place, she had started yelling and cursing, demanding to be released. When she saw Ahsoka, she pretty much exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU! I'LL END YOU WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS YOU BRAT!! she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka however paid no attention, choosing to focus on opening up all the barrels of goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME YOU FAT OAF?! WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you\" Ahsoka said speaking in a level headed manner. \"But first Asajj I want to thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" the bounty hunter in question asked in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For giving me this glorious new body of course!\" Ahsoka said happily hugging her new body. \"I never looked better not to mention I feel so soft and warm inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you kidding me?!\" Ventress shouted incredulously. \"I kidnapped and forced you to become a fat shell of your former glory... and your happy with these changes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know you are Ventress. I know you've been looking at my tits, whenever you see me and feeling my ass when you think no ones looking\" exclaimed Ahsoka with a smug look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress became incredibly flustered, looked away from the plump Padawan and became as red as her lightsabers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-shut up you-you slob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka smirked before continuing \"Anyways as I was saying, I wanna thank you for helping me become such a beauty. The thing I want is to give you a token of my gratification, but I couldn't think of anything\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress's eyes widened in horror when she pieced together what Ahsoka was saying and began struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then, it hit me. You gave me a gift when you captured me and allowed me to gain this beautiful bod. So I figured I should return the favor\" Ahsoka was now smiling, just like Ventress had when she had her in that position two weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the tables had turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Ahsoka please don't do this to me. I'll do anything. I'll give you money, I'll kill Urado for you, hell I'll turn myself in just! ANYTHING!\" screamed Ventress. She seemed just like a skinny, Togruta Jedi that had been in this position previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ventress, but you know what they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka had begun collecting all the goo from the barrels, using the Force to hold it up above its respective barrels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ahsoka shot the goo out at Ventress's face at an alarming speed. Before she could even say a word the goo had begun to go into the ex-Separatist's mouth and was know being forced down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress was now extremely worried not just about the possibility that she'd blow up. Ventress didn't want to die. She had to survive. For her fallen Nightsisters she had to, but right now she didn't feel very confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress looked down at what was once her body and she couldn't believe what she saw (or rather didn't want to).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once slender torso now had a quickly gaining potbelly and her boobs looked like two thermal grenades. Her small, petite bottom was now being replaced with two growing ass cheeks that were quickly filling out her costume, while her legs and feet were quickly making her quite uncomfortable in her leather boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Ventress heard the sound of tearing. She looked at her quickly expanding bottom, finding the source of the noise. The clothing around Ventress's ass and waist were tearing up considerably. Ventress was horrified at the idea of having her enemy see her undergarments, but there was nothing she could do. To her immense horror clothing covering her behind and waist had ripped off revealing a set of black underwear, causing Ventress to turn a darker shade of red than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes had passed and Ventress's torture was continuing. Her potbelly was now a full on gut, that could fit a Droideka in. It along with her two enormous tits that were each the size of a baby Hutt, had ripped open showing off more of her new torso's body and the former assassin's black bra. Her bra quickly met the same fate as her top becoming useless fabric on the ground with the rest of her clothes. This caused her to turn even more red. Her legs meanwhile, looked like they belonged on an AT-TE Walker that tore apart Ventress' boots, relieving Ventress of the pain, they were causing around her feet. It was the only clothing she was alright with tearing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress had finally finished off all of the goo that Ahsoka had brought, leaving her out of breath and with a big stomach ache to boot, but she was just happy to be done with the goo and alive. She let off a large fart before continuing letting out a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" said Ahsoka sounding genuinely impressed. \"You actually ate it all. I gotta admit, I didn't think you had it in you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka had begun walking around Ventress in a circle, just like the bounty hunter did when she taunted Ahsoka. She stopped at Ventress's massive buttocks, that looked like it could  smother somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh no wonder they call you <b>ASS</b>ajj Ventr<b>ASS</b>.\" Ahsoka joked, slapping Ventress's huge rump and causing the already blushing assassin to turn as red as Darth Maul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention this awesome belly\" she continued, putting her fingers around Ventress's hulking gut and jiggling it about causing Ventress let out a massive burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bout that. Plus how could I forget these girls?\" Ahsoka said before walking around to Ventress' front, grabbing both of her boobs and began to fondle them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm please...stop...\" Ventress weakly breathed out more out of pleasure than pain as the mixture made the breasts of its consumers rather sensitive to touch when first eaten though it eventually stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right!\" Ahsoka said before pulling back her hands \"Sorry, I know that feels really uncomfortable. Don't worry though, let me make it up to you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentress didn't know if Ahsoka was being truly honest or not. It sounded like she did but before she could think anymore on it, Ahsoka kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. Asajj felt her face heat up like lava on Mustafar and her legs turn to jelly, but she loved it. It was the greatest thing that had happened to her, but sadly all good things must end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive rumble emerged from Ahsoka's belly, killing the mood and ending the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Sorry about that. Tummy's rumbling.\" Ahsoka said also blushing, whether from her belly, the kiss or both was unclear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll going to go now and have something to eat. Oh, before I go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka got close, Asajj hoping for another kiss, but was surprised when Ahsoka instead used her arm to wipe some blood off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have gotten a nosebleed during our kiss. Wait - why did I want her to kiss me again? I-I-I mean it's not like I love her right?! RIGHT?!\" Ventress thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going now. I'll see you tomorrow, Ventr<b>ASS</b>.\" said Ahsoka. However, when she said it ,she made it sound more like a playful nickname, than an insult but Ventress still blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ahsoka exited she began thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I flirt with Ventress?! She's my enemy! To be fair, she does look quite sexy, b-b-but I can't. She'd sooner kill me. Plus it's forbidden by the Jedi! But that kiss was something spectacular...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka shook those thoughts out of her mind before waddling off to find some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what I should eat I think I saw a cafeteria earlier, wonder if there's anything there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time, she wanted to try out more of that goo she'd been force fed. It tasted sweet, almost like some type of honey.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a long awkward moment nobody said a word, Anakin and Luminara could only stare at the two obese Padawans with mutual baffled and stunned expressions. Ahsoka and Barriss simply went back to eating. Ahsoka having decided to forget about getting her boots off instead reached out with the Force and brought disk # 351 to her and proceeded to happily gorge herself once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin glanced over to Luminara, having broken out of the trance first. \"Are you seeing what I'm seeing?\" he hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That our Padawans have become nearly cartoonishly fat since we last saw them in what couldn't have been more then an hour ago, and that they both seem to failed to even knowledge our presence since stepping into the room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good so its not just me then. So what do you think we should do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously we have to start by getting their attentions.\"  \"BARRISS! AHSOKA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Amazingly enough both girls stopped eating and turned to face their masters, each with a slight glassly expression in their eyes. \"BES BASTRE?\" (Yes master) they asked together with their mouths full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuminara cringed. \"First of all swallow what you have in your mouths.\" The girls did as ordered. \"And second would you PLEASE explain both Master Anakin and I what happen to you two since we last met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Barriss and Ahsoka now looked confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Master?\" asked Barriss \"Ahsoka and I simply came to the cafeteria to get something to eat, just like we told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea Skyguy,\" Ahsoka chirped in, \"We told you where we were going so why are both you and Master Luminara making such a big deal out of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin sighed, \"Funny you should mention the word big Snips, look at how much food the two of you consumed within the past standard hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls glanced at the piles of plates before them and were shocked. They couldn't had eaten that much together in one sitting could they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So we went a little overboard Master.\" Ahsoka stammered with a bush across her face. \"That's still no reason to get so upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin at this point smacked the palm of his hand to his face and let out a deep sigh, \"Ahsoka look down at your stomach. Barriss please do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ahsoka and Barriss glanced down and were shocked by what they saw, the latter was stunned speachless like her Master had been but Ahsoka... \"HOLY SITHSPIT!\" the words that then came out of the young Togruta were a near standard minute long stream of swears and curses ranging from Basic to Huttese, stopping only because she ran out of breath. This left everyone stunned once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuminara gave Anakin a cold glare. \"Skywalker...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me!\" he said defensively, hands raised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarriss could only prod her bulging belly with a mournful look on her face. Her robe was now ruined, the tear she had noticed early had grown to the point where a large amount of her green skin was now showing, much to her embarrassment. How in the Galaxy did this all get so out of hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the Force did we get so big?\" Ahsoka moaned, voicing Barriss's own thoughts. \"We didn't  become this big when we cleared out the cafeteria on the last ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin gave her a perplexed look. \"Snips, what do you mean by 'cleared out the cafeteria on the last ship'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face twisted into a guilty look. \"W-Well Master Barriss and I kinda... ate all the food the cafeteria had at the moment.\" When she saw her Master's disturbed look she added, \"Although we just ate what was  leftover from Dinner, nothing like not a fully stocked kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuminara sighed and glanced over at Barriss. \"Just tell us how this all started from the beginning Padawan, and we'll see what we can learn from that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Mirialan nodded, \"I'll try my best Master.\" she said trying her best as she could to bow with her newly super-sized stomach. \"It started hours ago when both Ahsoka and I had woke up  sudden and strong hunger pains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt,\" said Anakin. \"But you said at the same time, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Barriss and Ahsoka looked at each other and shrugged. \"Yes Master Skywalker, why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't that strike either of you as odd, that you should both wake up at the same time with unusual food craving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it Master Skywalker... I'll admit that looking back it does seem strange that both Ahsoka and I should wake up simultaneously AND both happen to have hunger pains together. Why it did not cross either of our minds I couldn't say... Either way getting back to the story: We had both woken up and decided to head to the cafeteria, which at the time seemed perfectly innocent enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Barriss had finished all four Jedi were silent in thought. Luminara was first to speak. \"I think I speak for everyone when I say judging from Barriss's story, it be a reasonable assumption that whatever is causing the Padawans bizarre hunger pains as well as their... abnormal amount of weight gaining within the past handful of standard hours is something physical, not Force related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded. If the Force was somehow responsible for this mess, absurd an idea as that sounded, then any of the four of them would have felt SOME sort of disturbance in it. The Force itself felt like it always had, albeit now with a cloak of darkness tainting it somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin turned to his fellow Master. \"So if it is something physical, then we have to take them to the medical droid on board the station.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Ahsoka blushed, \"Do we have to Master? What if someone sees us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin glared at her. \"Would you prefer to stay as you are then snips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, lets get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Barriss and Ahsoka nodded together and struggled for a moment to move their gargantuan guts from the table, and when they finally succeed THUD! Both padawans crashed to the durasteel floor like lead anchors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuminara and Anakin looked at one another, then at their dazed padawans. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We're fine Master!\" called Barriss as she tried her best to Force lift herself from the floor even with her green face a much deeper shade than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin raised an eyebrow at this. \"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sure skyguy!\" Ahsoka yelled, as equally embarrassed as Barriss was. Then with a good strong Force Push both of them were back on their feet, staggering somewhat before getting balanced enough to stand without crashing down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both good?\" They nodded. \"Then let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Waiting for them was 2 women- one obese Cragmoloid adult, and one tubby Abyssin teen. \"Greetings Padawans Offee and Tano,\" called the Cragmoloid master, \"Ready to become fat jedi?\"</span></div></div>",
