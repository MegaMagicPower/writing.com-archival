            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka was a shorter boy standing only four foot ten inches tall at age fourteen, he had the dark skin of the water tribe along with bright blue eyes, and his dark brown hair was pulled back into a warrior\u2019s wolf tail at the back of his head. He was dressed in the standard long parka of the southern water tribe. Sokka was feeling down because he turned fourteen today and unlike most of the men of the tribe he would not be allowed to take his first attempt at iceberg dodging. As a result Sokka had been sulking since he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Sokka it\u2019s his birthday he should be happy.\u201d Nina asks Ten as she watches Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was a taller woman standing at five foot ten inches, although her parka hid it she had a slender body with small b-cup breasts. But she did possess large round hips, a big fat round peach shaped ass, and long shapely lags. Nina was also one of the female hunters, she wears her hair in a long braid and had dark blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen is a woman standing at five foot three and had large E-cup breasts and a mid-sized apple shaped ass. She had her long black hair loose down her back with the exception of hair loopy on the sides of her head. Ten was one of the kelp cultivators of the Western Artic Sea Village. Ten had grey eyes showing that she possessed some air nomad heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSokka is sad because he cannot take his first ice burg dodging attempt. Poor boy he is fourteen and can\u2019t try to become a man.\u201d Ten tells Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there is one other Rite to man hood Sokka could attempted but it is the most dangerous in all three nations, The Rite of the King. But only three former water tribe men have ever partly passed it. The last king chose not to take the throne had passed the rite during the time of Avatar Kyoshi. He also married Kyoshi and had a couple kids with her and one of them was Kya\u2019s great, great, great, grandmother. If Sokka passes this Rite he would become the rightful ruler of both water tribes but if he fails he would die. But there is one thing about one of the king\u2019s rights...\u201d Sing says with a large blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSing was a sea prune farmer who had dark blue green eyes and short neck length brown hair with black highlights. She stood at five foot four inches tall with large round DD-cup breasts, a nice large apple shaped ass, but she had short legs with thin hips. Sing is also one the teachers of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is making you blush Sing?\u201d The two other woman ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the King has some interesting rights one of the being he would be able to  sleep with any woman of the tribe regardless of marital status as long as they are not immediate family. He would also be able to marry multiple woman. But what is really embarrassing is that several woman would take him to a privet hut to not only usher him into manhood but to also teach him how to please the woman he sleeps with. The King of the Water Tribe was said to become one of the most powerful benders in the world. He would also be granted a unique form of bending.\u201d Sing states with a smile but still possessing a bright red blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think it would make Sokka happy to attempt the rite. But we should ask kana before we tell Sokka. But with all that Sokka has been doing for the village these past six months I think he is worthy to take the rite if he is able since there are some qualifications that I do not know about. But since he is a boy still kana would need to give her permission as Sokka\u2019s guardian.\u201d Sing says after calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go talk to Kana then.\u201d Nina tells the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina, sing and ten are all about twenty five years old. They quickly head for kana\u2019s hut. All three woman hoped Sokka could take the Rite of the King. After all Sokka has not only spent the last six months leading hunting parties and going fishing. He also has been handling all the repairs to the village, from fixing the fishing nets to making new hunting tools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also remember when a very large male saber tooth lion tiger attacked the village just after the men left. Several huts were damaged before Sokka lead it away from the village after several huts were damaged. Sokka\u2019s right arm was broken and he suffered four deep slashes across his chest before he managed to kill it with his boomerang. And even with his injuries Sokka was up a dawn the next day working to repair the huts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKana we would like to talk to you about Sokka and if he qualifies to take the Rite of the King?\u201d Nina asks the wise old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wish I could say he did not qualify to take the Rite but I feel my grandson might just be the first to fully pass the Rite. He not only possesses the largest chi stores I have ever felt he has the blood of all three water tribes flowing through his veins. Come let\u2019s go give Sokka the option to take It.\u201d kana says as she stands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Sokka in the village square\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSokka my brave little hunter how would you like to take a different rite of manhood. But before you take it you need to know it is extraordinary dangerous. But I feel you can pass it. Do you want to attempt it?\u201d kana asks Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would I have to do to pass this rite Gran-Gran?\u201d Sokka asks his Gran-Gran.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You would then need to travel to the old capital wearing no warm clothing. After that you would have to head to hall of light and solve the Riddle of Darkness. The riddle reveals the way to the Trial of Chaos. Should you pass trial of chaos the mark would change from the mark of the prince to the mark of the king. And if you obtain this mark you will become rightful ruler of all three water tribes. Do you want to take this rite Sokka?\u201d Kana asks the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and I will do you proud and pass it gran-gran.\u201d Sokka says after thinking about it for a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka fallows Kana into her hut, kana proceeds to paint a simple black spade like on a playing card upon the back of his right hand. Kana then removes Sokka\u2019s parka as Katara gives her big brother a tearful hug goodbye. Sokka then leaves the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes Sokka six days to reach the abandoned city of the southern water tribe. He found it strange that he did not freeze to death in the time. Sokka was now running low on food but he pushed onwards quickly finding the hall of light. He easily salved the riddle of darkness. The answer was to move the stone alter by pulling down six shutters to cover six glowing white crystals. Sokka proceeds to take the reviled stairs down into the darkness. After quite a long walk Sokka came to a large chamber with glowing purple water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a large shadow appears from beneath the water growing larger as it got closer to the surface of the water. When the form finally brakes the water a massive amount of water is displaced luckily for Sokka none of the glowing water splashes on him. From the water rose a lion turtle, but this lion-turtle was different from most instead of the normal tan colors this one was black and white and evil looking. In front of the beast was a stone platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see another has come to attempt the rite of the king step forward to take the trial of chaos.\u201d The lion turtle tells Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I take it do you have any advice?\u201d Sokka asks the sacred beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t give into your anger for it will make your opponent in this trial invincible. Remember that even in the dark there is light from the ones you love and loved. Step forward boy.\u201d The lion turtle says in a feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka thinks on what he says as the beast\u2019s right claw is raised and she places two of  glowing purple claw\u2019s to Sokka\u2019s head and heart. Sokka\u2019s eyes turn black and radiate a purple light as Sokka\u2019s soul is sent to the spirit world.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now let the trial begin.\u201d A black and red squid like spirit says form the tree Sokka was now standing in front of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sokka looks into the squids gold eye looked like a sideways square Sokka vision is filled with his mother\u2019s last moments. Sokka\u2019s anger builds as he watches the fire bender kill his mother over and over. Vaatu did not want to kill this boy for the sensed a part of his counterpart Raava. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Vaatu could corrupted the small amount of Raava\u2019s chi in the Sokka Vaatu could free himself from his prison. With this in mind Vaatu changes the vision to the fire nation soldier grabbing Katara and raping both the little girl and Kya. With each repeat the man was getting more and more depraved with the woman of Sokka\u2019s family. As the darkness corrupts Sokka\u2019s soul and only a small amount of light remains guarding the shards of Raava\u2019s soul passed to him by Sokka\u2019s ancestors. Vaatu smiles as the boy was about to hit the man and when the blow hits Sokka\u2019s corruption would be complete. Vaatu could then take the boy as his avatar.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sokka sees that he would have struck Vaatu\u2019s prison\u2019s barrier had he connected whit his blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And as the darkness reseeds from Sokka\u2019s soul, four shining objects appear by Sokka\u2019s side. As the light fades it takes the form of three woman who stand on Sokka\u2019s left side, and a man who stands on Sokka\u2019s side right. The woman closest to him was Kya Sokka\u2019s mother, still dressed in her blue long parka. Next to his mother was the tallest woman, no person Sokka had ever seen. She wore face paint similar to that of a geisha and a green battle dress with a lamellar chest plate. Next to her was a lovely air bender woman wearing high monk garments. On his left side was a tall broad man in northern water tribe ceremonial armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this Sokka passes the trial of chaos and is granted the ability of dark bending. However this does not mean Sokka can bring evil to the hearts of men, this means he can create dark matter constructs to do battle with. Sokka then turns to face the people who came to help him stand firm against the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth kingdom warrior woman who Sokka knew to be Avatar Kyoshi and the air bender who Sokka knew was Avatar Yangchen approached him. They each give Sokka a hug before stepping back and returning to Aang as both woman had already been reincarnated already. But avatar Kuruk surprises Sokka with his action, Kuruk bows to Sokka as he knew the boy was now his king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKoh I ask that you appear before me.\u201d Sokka says as he grabs the man\u2019s arm before he can leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear your call and appear to you Sokka the one who passed the Trial of Chaos.\u201d Koh says as he appears before Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoh takes a brief moment to bow to his lord, The Great Spirit of Darkness Vaatu. Although Koh is a spirit of darkness he is part of the balance as his function as the Face Stealer balances out the Mother of Faces ability to grant new faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ask you to return the face of Kuruk wife to him so they may be reborn together. My ancestor learned his lesson as he raised his only child by himself.\u201d Sokka asks the old spirit keeping his face free of emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know this will count as your one favor granted to you by a dark spirit for passing your trial, young king.\u201d Koh asks the boy to test him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d Sokka tells Koh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo be it. Kuruk I hope I never see your face outside of one of your future lives. And I hope your truly reborn self is happy with your love. I also hope you are grateful to your new King for I have never released a face before and will never do it again.\u201d Koh says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoh then switches his face to that of a beautiful woman of the Southern Water Tribe. The talons that hold his captured faces in place release themselves and Ummi falls out of Koh body before the dark spirit disappears back to his realm. The woman then runs up to the love of her life and hugs him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you King Sokka.\u201d Kuruk tells Sokka before both he and his wife disappear to be reborn in there next life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then turns to his mother who stood seven inches taller than him. Sokka proceeds to run up to his mother and hugs her as he cries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am proud of the man you are becoming Sokka. Remember that I love you and will be watching over you and your sister for a while longer. Enjoy your entrance into manhood and learn to properly please a woman. But I ask that after your entry into manhood that you only bed woman you feel a connection to. You have several woman you are destined to spend your life with I feel you will know who they are.\u201d Kya says as she holds her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise mother. I love you mom.\u201d Sokka says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I love you my brave king now I bestow you the Mark of the King. Tell your sister and father I love them as well.\u201d Kya tells Sokka as she touches the back of Sokka\u2019s right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple spade changes into the spade you fined on a fancy the ace of spades playing card. Kya ten returns to her place in the afterlife so she can continue to watch over her family until she is ready to be reborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then turns to Vaatu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope this will keep you company.\u201d Sokka says as he creates a pole bear dog out of dark matter, before leaving the spirit world.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He makes one stop before heading home at the library so he can raid it for water bending scrolls. He finds only a basic offensive scroll but Sokka does find a full set of healing scrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sokka leaves the abandoned city he vows to return it to its former glory one day.

It had been a week since Sokka left to take the Rite of the King. Every woman and child in the village just knew he would be returning on this day for some reason. This was strange to them since they knew it would take him at least five more days to return home by foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround noon they saw something on the horizon and at first they thought it was a bird. But as the thing got closer group saw it was a flying man leaving a black trail of light behind him. When he landed outside the gate the village realized just who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSokka your back.\u201d the twelve year old Katara yells as she runs to hug her brother fallowed by the rest of the children of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sokka returns the hug Katara gives him as Gran-Gran approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me the back of your right hand.\u201d Gran-Gran tells Sokka with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka hold up right hand clenched in a fist showing that the back of it was blank.

This is a rite is completed when the girls mother guides their daughters to please a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mothers of the Southern water tribe guide their daughters and the man she chooses to give her virginity to in the ways of sex. This is to insure her daughter can please a man and so the man learns please a woman properly. As a result the men and woman of the Southern Water Tribe are the best lovers on the planet. <br>\r\nMost of the time the man a woman gives her virginity to is the man she will marry later in life. Most of the time the mother\u2019s clothes stay on. If the mother is a widow or single they may join her daughter in bed to better guide the two. Sokka is unique since he can sleep with the woman of the tribe the mother is allowed to get hands one regardless of marital status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was hoping you would accompany my mother and I on a \u2018hunt\u2019 after the last part of your rite is over.\u201d Notai tells Sokka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like fun.\u201d Sokka tells Notai with a confused face, since Sokka was not sure if Notai wanted to him to fuck her or go on an actual hunt with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai holds in a giggle as she sees Sokka\u2019s face since the boy was so fun to tease. She moves her right hand to his thigh to get her point across since there were young children sitting at the table as well and they were sitting at the head of the bone table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are my wolverine fox ribs, the sauce is the same recipe I used to pass the Rite of the House.\u201d Notai tells Sokka as she squeezes his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are some of the best I have ever had, I have said this once and I will say it again I love your brown sea weed sauce.\u201d Sokka tells Notai with a smile, she smiles back as she leans in to whisper into Sokka\u2019s ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I will feel the same about your thick white roster sauce.\u201d Notai whispers into his ear as she cups Sokka\u2019s \u2018roster\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai then blows a small puff of air into Sokka\u2019s ear and giggles as she sees the bright red Sokka\u2019s nose start to bleed. Notai was the boldest girl in the village after all. She has to let go of Sokka sizeable cock as she sees Sokka\u2019s twelve year old sister is coming up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is your face red Sokka? Oh no your nose is bleeding here.\u201d Katara says as she hands Sokka a napkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Katara.\u201d Sokka says as he wipes his nose and hands it back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost forgot I raided the old city\u2019s library before I left. I found you these.\u201d Sokka says as he picks up his wolverine fox pelt pack from its spot by his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka opens his pack and pulled out the box on water bending healing scrolls and the two basic water bending scrolls he found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre these water bending scrolls?\u201d Katara asks excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe box is full of water bending healing techniques and the two lose scrolls are on the basics. And after I figure out how my new bending works I will take you to the north to find a real master Katara. After all I do need to let the chiefs of the north know there is a king now. Consider this an early birthday gift too since your birthday is tomorrow and I will be finishing the last part of the rite of king tomorrow. I want you to have gran-gran supervise your training since there are no masters left in the south.\u201d Sokka tells his little sister with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara proceeds to glump her older brother knocking him off his chair. This would make her the best healer in the tribe. After all she is the only water bender in the South Pole at the moment and Katara chose to take the path of a healer like her mother and Gran-Gran did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Sokka.\u201d Katara yells with a smile before she gets up to show Gran-Gran and the other girls of the village her presents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was sweet of you Sokka.\u201d Notai says as she helps up Sokka who is about six inches shorter the five foot four inch girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how about the day after you are done with your rite we go \u2018hunting\u2019.\u201d Notai tells Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan. And it would be the one of the greatest of honors of my life to be your first \u2018hunting\u2019 partner Notai.\u201d Sokka tells the girl with a smile and a bit of a squeak in his voice before his kisses the girl on her left cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles as the strong girl goes bright red and holds her hand to her cheek<br>\r\nSokka would spend the rest of the feast sampling each of the meat dishes made by the woman of the village and complementing them. As the feast was winding down Gran-Gran approached Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the last part of the rite to be complete. The ladies are waiting for you lets go.\u201d Gran-Gran tells Sokka who gulps at what was about to cum. (lol)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn extremely red Sokka fallows gran-gran to Moons hut.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could not believe how well he has been sleeping well cuddling with the women since he is normally an active sleeper meaning he moves around a lot in his sleep, so he was normally quite tired through the day. He figured ladies laying against him had some form of calming effect on him allowing him to sleep soundly and still. Sokka also enjoyed having the five woman cuddling with him in the mornings. Sokka waits for the woman to wake up he passes his time watching the woman sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of six took a bath together since Moon house was also the village bathhouse. Water tribe villages used a bathhouse to limit the use of heating fuel for hot water. After a rather fun bath Sokka stood before the five woman who were talking amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe feel you have learned all we can teach you about sex. But tomorrow I believe you will be joining my daughter in the last part of her rite of womanhood. Since I am her mother I will make sure that you retained what we taught you. You will receive no instruction and you better fuck her brains out like you did with us if you know what is good for you. Now go spend some time with your sister maybe see how her training has been going.\u201d May tells Sokka with a lustful smirk. This causes Sokka to gulp a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mam.\u201d Sokka tells May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka after spending the past three days with five of the most beautiful woman in the village learned quite a bit about woman in general. Epically since the five woman he was learning form also happen to be the strongest fighters in the village. As a result Sokka lost his sexist ways. Sokka gets dressed for the first time in three days before heading out of the bathhouse. As he leaves he runs into Notai outside of the bathhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Notai what is up.\u201d Sokka asks the lovely hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Sokka how is your training going.\u201d Notai asks with a bit of a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt just ended today so we can go \u2018hunting\u2019 tomorrow if you\u2019re ready.\u201d Sokka says to Notai also blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good, is my mom still inside?\u201d Notai asks Sokka nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes she is I\u2019m sure you will want to inform her about it. I will talk to you later Notai, I\u2019ll be on the ice fields with Katara trying figure out my bending.\u201d Sokka tells Notai with a smile before he impulsively kisses Notai on the cheek again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka did not notice it last time but Sokka felt a pull towards Notai as his lips touch her cheek. Sokka remembers his mother said about how he would know the woman he was destined to be with. Sokka quickly grabs Notai\u2019s hand to prevent her from entering the bathhouse. He feels the same pull as when he kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you like to have dinner with me and the family tonight?\u201d Sokka asks Notai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll asks my mom if she wants to come when I talk to her.\u201d Notai tells Sokka.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I meant it as a date not and family get together.\u201d Sokka tells Notai not looking at her with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like that Sokka.\u201d Notai tells Sokka with a bright smile and a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let Gran-Gran and Katara know.\u201d Sokka says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d Notai tells Sokka before kissing him on the cheek, then she runs into the bathhouse with a bright red blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka heads home I a daze.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are a member of the Amazon clan the best hunting clan and only all-female clan in the whole water tribe, so be proud and strong girl. Now let\u2019s take a bath together well we talk about your rite.\u201d May says with a caring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you momma\u201d Notai says as she heads to the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai and May then proceeds to head to one of the privet baths of the bathhouse. Notai removes her parka fallowed by her trade mark tang top and wrappings. Her large brown C-cup breasts were reviled, showing her large brown areolas and nipples. All Notai had on was her wolf skin thong. Unlike her mother Notai had a large peach-shaped ass. May who was wearing a matching wolf skin thong then proceeds to grab her daughter\u2019s breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems your girls got bigger again honey, looks like you\u2019re going to have big tits like your mother when you\u2019re all grown up.\u201d May tells her daughter with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes Sokka like girls with big breasts mamma?\u201d Notai asks her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet are sweet collective asses he does. He loves to get a tit fuck too so don\u2019t worry about that dear.\u201d May says a she lets go of her daughters tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSokka asked me come over to his hut for dinner as a date and I said yes.\u201d Notai blurts out as she drops her thong showing she has a untamed bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will trim your bush today dear as part of your ritual. I\u2019m glad Sokka asked you out dear I know you have been crushing on him forever. I just wish there was more to do around here for a date then fishing, crafting, hunting, or having a family dinner as a date.\u201d May says as she pulls her matching thong down. The two made the thongs together from the first wolf Notai killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you are a widow and Sokka is allowed to sleep with multiple woman regardless I was hoping you would join us in bed since he will have more than one partner.\u201d Notai is stopped when her mother places her finger to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will join you so you can learn to fuck a woman well your with Sokka. Don\u2019t worry even thought the King of the Water Tribe is destined to have several wife\u2019s I feel you are one of them. Sokka would not sleep until he had satisfied all five of us. So he is able to handle several woman at once and leave them all very satisfied. And I feel he will also take the time to please his destined one\u2019s alone as well he is to honorable not to. Now let\u2019s enjoy are bath. Then we will trim your bush and you all dolled up for your date. After all we may be of the Amazon clan but we can be girly as well. Now would you like to finish your rite tonight after your date or do you want to wait until tomorrow to do it?\u201d May says as her daughter lets her hair down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it tonight momma. I don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d Notai tells her mother with a blush and a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will get dolled up to then. Tell Sokka to come over tonight ok after dinner ok.

You aunt Ten made you something to wear for your rite and I think Sokka will love it.\u201d May tells Notai with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was glade she was not sore form the hard fucking Sokka had gave her. With that the small family enjoy there bath together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I'm a guy so I don't know what girls will do to get ready for a date. so ill leave that up to some one eles.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka sighed as he checked his clothes again. Since he got home from getting cleaned up at the bathhouse and changing at home Sokka had been playing with a blank skull bit. The blank skull bit Sokka was playing with at the moment was made from the saber tooth lion tiger Sokka killed four months ago. Unlike the Northern Water Tribe who just gives a betrothal necklaces to a woman to claim them and that\u2019s it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever in the Southern Water Tribe a man must carve a betrothal charm from a blank skull bit. Then the man must present the charm to the mother of the woman he wants to marry. If the mother approves she will tie a leather cord to the charm then the man can ask for the girls hand in marriage. The father, brother, or uncle may challenge the man to a fight to see if the man can protect the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sokka got home he saw the blank skull bit and started thinking about Notai after picking it up. Notai was four months older then him and they had been friends since he was born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fuck it Gran-Gran says when it comes to love you should go with my heart instead of your pride or head. And I still have an hour until Notai gets home. I\u2019ll present the betrothal charm to May so I can ask for Notai\u2019s hand in marriage.\u2019 Sokka thinks as he grabs his carving knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was not the best with artist with the traditional crafting materials like clay stone or even canvas. But give Sokka some bone or metal and Sokka could create a masterpiece by carving, inlaying, or painting on it. Sokka started carving the skull bit into a spade that matched the spade as his Mark of the King. He finishes just in time to brush the bone dust off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was wearing a parka made from the same saber tooth lion tiger as his skull bit that Sokka made into a charm. The parka was made by the mothers of the village as thanks for killing the saber tooth lion tiger. The parka was big on him at the moment so he had to roll up the sleeves and had to button the bottom so it did not drag on the ground for now. Under that he wore a vest made from the wolf he killed on his first hunt. Then he wore his favorite pair of pants and his favorite pair of boots he just polished to a fine shine. Sokka then left his room to wait to greet his date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou clean up very well Sokka. Is that a betrothal charm I do not see in your hand?\u201d Gran-Gran asks Sokka with knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d Sokka says to Gran-Gran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you took my advice on love dear. I loved your Grandfather very much and he even moved down here from the foggy swamp to be with me. That man also refused to wear pants until the day he died fifteen years ago. But there was a Water Bending Master I fell in love with from my homeland The Northern Water Tribe. His name was Pakku and I loved him a lot. But when my father told me he arranged for me to marry Pakku I let my pride get in the way. The next day after I was forced to except the necklace, I left the tribe during the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you know what I still love Pakku. If he returned to ask for my hand today I would agree. I gave that necklace to your father after his charm was destroyed during a raid, he gave it to your mother, and now your sister still wears this necklace around her neck. Don\u2019t worry she is not engaged to Pakku. Don\u2019t tell your sister this ok. I will tell her when she is ready.\u201d Gran-Gran tells Sokka with a gentle smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t Gran-Gran and thank you for sharing this with me. So did Grandpa really never wear pants?\u201d Sokka asked his grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right dear. Now Notai will be hear soon and you have a bit of bone dust on you.\u201d Gran-Gran tells Sokka as she brushes Him off. Sokka then heads outside to wait for Notai as a proper gentlemen of the Southern Water Tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Notai<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai was nerves as she walked to the wise woman\u2019s hut, she was wearing a parka made from the kill earned her journeymen\u2019s hunting rank last week a dog polar-bear. A smaller less dangerous version of the wild polar dog bears and she managed to kill two of them on her hunt. Her induction into the Amazon clan would be done once she chooses what her A would look like. She chose not ware make up yet. She would save that for latter tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her parka she had on a nice southern water tribe dress which her mother wore on her first date with her father. Under that she was wearing her normal wrappings for now and a cotton thong, she got from a Ba Sing Se trader before her first hunt she killed a wolf. The same wolf she and her mother made thongs from. She also wears a brand new pair of black boots. Notai smiled as she saw Sokka waiting for her outside the hut like a proper gentlemen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Notai I like your new parka, are those new boots too?\u201d Sokka asks Notai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes they are both new. I made the parka from some polar dog bears I killed last week I made journeyman too do you like it.\u201d Notai tells Sokka with a smile as she gives Sokka a little spin to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of you and have you gotten your A yet? It looks very nice by the way.\u201d Sokka asks happy for Notai. She was now the youngest person to make journeyman being only four months after turning fourteen. This broke the old record by six months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have not decided on the design for it yet.\u201d Notai says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I hope I can attend your marking ceremony when you have choose it. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d Sokka asks Notai as he guides her into the hut by wrapping his right arm around her waist with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Notai the stew is ready, Katara and I are going to Granny Lings for dinner, and we will be playing cards for most of the night so have fun you to. Make sure you walk Notai home Sokka.\u201d Gran-Gran says as she and Katara leave the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a surprise but a nice one. Please let me take your coat Notai.\u201d Sokka says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai removes her coat and hands it to Sokka revealing her dress. It\u2019s a formal dress of the Southern Water Tribe.

And I have not done it since.\u201d Sokka says indigently with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because I beat you up the second time you did that Sokka.\u201d Notai says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still have the scar Notai.\u201d Sokka says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Notai moves to sit and Sokka pushes in the chair in. Sokka then goes to get two bowls of stew for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this your grandma\u2019s Artic Wolf Bat Stew?\u201d Notai asks with an excited squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is Notai, I remembered it\u2019s a favorite.\u201d Sokka says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I lose my nerve I want you to know, I decided to have my rite tonight after dinner.\u201d Notai says with a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell theirs know rush so let\u2019s enjoy dinner. Tell me about your rank hunt.\u201d Sokka says as he watches Notai eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two have an enjoyable conversation as they eat. Sokka tells her what he did on his rite besides the sex part. And even gives her a book he got for her from the library on herbal medicine he was saving for Notai\u2019s birthday. But dinner soon comes to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sokka and Notai leave the hut. They then head to Notai\u2019s hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai and May\u2019s hut<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello dear how was your date and hi Sokka.\u201d May says with a smile as she opens the door for the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to use the bathroom before we change mom I\u2019ll you know when I\u2019m done so we can change for my rite, so please have a seat Sokka.\u201d Notai tells Sokka with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Notai.\u201d Sokka says to Notai with smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka waits until he hears the door shut before he pulls out the charm from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like permission to marry your daughter May.\u201d Sokka says as he hands her the fancy spade charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou always do nice work with bone.\u201d May says as she looks over the spade charm. She then pulls a blue leather string form her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI approve of your offer. Ask her when you\u2019re ready Son. I know she will not say no.\u201d May says as she takes the cord and ties it to one end of the with a special loop knot. (You take the portion of the cord and make a hope then slip the other end through it I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called. it\u2019s something my grandfather taught me to do fourteen years ago. so I just call it grandpa\u2019s knot.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you better fuck are brains out tonight since Notai invited me in so I can make sure you retained your knowledge. And just so you know Notai learns best by with hands on instruction. And since you are destined to have many brides Sokka, she wants to learn to please you and the woman you will be with at the same time.\u201d May tells Sokka with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I am just glad you will let me marry her.\u201d Sokka tells May with a happy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom let\u2019s get ready for Sokka now.\u201d Notai yells for her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get undress Sokka that\u2019s are job and your cunt breaker better be the same size it was three days ago when we first undressed you. Notai deserves to get a nice cock slap from you.\u201d May says as she gets up the couch and hands Sokka charm necklace back, she then heads into her bedroom were Notai was waiting. May does however lick her lips lewdly as she enters the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you soon \u2018My King\u2019\u201d May tells Sokka with another lick of her lips before she shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka gulps as he waits patiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just hope I can handle the two of them it took me four hours to fully satisfy may the first night.\u201d Sokka thinks with another gulp.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sokka was not the best cook in the world but his Gran-Gran made sure he could cook a very good breakfast. She always said a man should at least be able to make his woman a hearty breakfast in the morning. He never got that lesson until now, Sokka had also been taught that you only leave a woman in bed alone if it is to make or get breakfast for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bedroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat smells so good Sokka?\u201d Notai asks as she reaches for the boy, only to feel her mother\u2019s large left tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Sokka\u2019s fine ass dear.

I was about to head out to the ice with Gran-Gran to train. I already mastered three of the healing scrolls too. What is your good news and hello Notai, May?\u201d A cheerful Katara asks as Gran-Gran looks at Sokka knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there are two things.

I pass the rite to become king and a bookshelf collapses on me, when I\u2019m looking for scrolls on waterbending for Katara. I catch a large tiger tuna and as soon as I get it off the hook, the hook gets stuck in my thumb, in the bone. Then I get the bright idea to use another hook to get it out and end up getting that stuck and brake my thumb in the proses. The universe loves to keep me humble with pain, I guess that\u2019s a good thing.\u2019 Sokka thinks as he lays in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the hut Notai and Gran-Gran were restraining Katara, who was trying to go out and teach Sokka a lesson about birth control, with her waterbending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay steps in front of the girl and slaps her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down girl, it was my fault I am going to give birth to the first of the new line of water tribe royalty. I forgot to take the pill when I learned Sokka asked Notai out on a date. And no I am not marrying Sokka too he is a bit too young for me anyway, unless of course it\u2019s to get rid of some pent up frustrations.\u201d May says with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGross I did not need to hear that. Well we better make sure Sokka is still alive.\u201d Katara says as the four woman leave the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you calm now Katara?\u201d Sokka asks still lying face down in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am calm now. We need to plan your wedding it should be done before you leave to visit the other villages and I\u2019m going to be an aunt too. Yay\u201d Katara says happy about a wedding and becoming an aunt, now that she calmed down.<br>\r\n\u201cGood plan, we will do planning tomorrow, Notai want to go fishing with me?\u201d Sokka asks with a smile as he stands up from the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan, net, rod, or spear?\u201d Notai asks with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I would use my new bending. I can make shapes depending on thought combine with movement. Let\u2019s go get a couple barrels and go.\u201d Sokka says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what you can do.\u201d Notai says with a smile as the two go the to the village storage building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I might as well go tell my sister I got another bun in the oven.\u201d May says as she heads to her sister Ten\u2019s hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell time to train Katara. Since you blasted your brother, you\u2019re only doing healing today.\u201d Gran-Gran tells Katara with a scary smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Gran-Gran.\u201d Katara says glumly as she fallows her grandmother to the medical hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka would later come in after getting bit by a tiger tuna, the universes once again deflating Sokka\u2019s ego. Sokka also had some good sushi for lunch, he showed that stupid tuna who was boss.</span></div></div>",

The shadow net flew out of the water and to the ice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka seemed stunned he caught a big haul of fish.  There the fish were flopping around in the shadow net as he relaxed and the net returned behind him as his shadow.

When the new king enters the hut he is shocked to find five of the most beautiful woman of the village waiting for him. They were dressed only in long blue robes and matching stocking. They were all also wearing some make up consisting of the southern strait points eye shadow and lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is now time for the other half of the rite Sokka. These woman will teach you how to please your future brides as a good man should. They will also show you the pleasure a woman can give a man. Have fun Sokka.\u201d Gran-Gran tells Sokka as she shuts the door. All Sokka can do at the moment is gulp as he turns bright Hinata red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with Nina Ten and Sing who are relatively young at the age of twenty-six there are two older woman in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the middle of the group is May who at forty was the oldest. She stood at five foot four inches tall. Her long brown hair fell loosely around her shoulders. As one of the hunters she was still very fit and trim. Like her younger sister Ten she had large round e-cup breasts but May had a large round heart-shaped ass to match. She also had wide matching hips and long legs. Like the other woman she wore a shade of blue eye shadow going to a straight line point at the far side of her eye\u2019s (think Eska but not curved) and matching dark blue lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her right was Moon a short woman of five foot one inch tall. She had a slender body with large b-cup breasts and a small heart shaped ass. She did have well round thighs and nice long legs. Despite her relative youth being thirty-eight years old she did have long silver hair pulled into a loose pony tail. (Like Katara\u2019s her fire nation garments.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies let us show are new king the beauty of a woman\u2019s bare body. But first I feel we should remove his clothes so he won\u2019t be unconfutable after we strip.\u201d May says as she takes charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay then removes Sokka\u2019s shirt as she steals Sokka\u2019s first kiss slipping her talented pink tongue into his mouth to play with Sokka\u2019s. Sing removes Sokka\u2019s boots before Nina removes Sokka\u2019s socks. Ten pulls Sokka\u2019s pants down and Moon is the lucky one who gets to remove Sokka\u2019s underwear and gets hit in the face by Sokka\u2019s hard dick. All five woman then step back to take in Sokka\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite just turning fourteen and being short for his age Sokka had well-formed cord like muscle that looked like steel cables. They five women could see the four scars across his right pectoral muscles that were still somewhat red. But what made all five woman drool was the big surprise between Sokka\u2019s legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman did not know it but along with the ability to bend dark matter the Rite of the King also granted Sokka the ability to \u2018bend\u2019 the size of his cock. Right now under a small mass of pubic hair Sokka\u2019s cock was standing fully erect and proud at fourteen inches long and five inches wide around. He also had large golf ball sized balls <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly fuck you have one massive fucking cock My King.\u201d May says what all the woman is thinking as they guide Sokka to the large bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s show Sokka are bare bodies.\u201d May says as she turns around showing Sokka her large covered bubble butt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs one the rest of the woman turn around and bend over they look over their shoulders at sake and drop there robes sowing they only had guarder belts on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shows Sokka there bare well-formed chocolate colored asses, and there wet and tight little cunts. Sokka could just make out a small amount of pubic hair above their hard clits he also saw that May had a stylish an above her ass. The A marked her as a member of the Amazon clan. The Amazon clan was the only clan to consist only of female hunters. May was the wise woman of the clan. She wished the clan was allowed to have a chief but as the clan consisted solely of woman they were not allowed a seat on the council of chiefs do the laws of the last King. The woman all smile as they start to shake there ass\u2019s from side to side for their new King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka takes in there jiggling asses from left to right noticing the difference in size. The first ass he saw was Moons small round ass and despite its small size it had a very nice jiggle to it. Next Sokka took in Ten\u2019s slightly larger small bubble shaped ass as it bounced. Next to Ten was the middle sized apple shaped ass of sing. The next ass Sokka saw of Nina\u2019s big fat peach shaped ass. Finally he took in the massive heart-shaped ass of May\u2019s as it jiggling flesh almost hypnotized Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one the women then turn around to show Sokka there front. The young king saw that they all shaved there pussy hair into the shape of a spade and there carpet matched there drapes. They all had nice flat stomachs that Sokka stared at for a bit since many men of the water tribes had a bare belly fetish. Sokka then took in there boobs. Seeing there kings eyes on their tits the women put their hands behind there back and push them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them had dark brown nipples but Nina and Moon had small areolas the size of a water tribe coin. Sing had larger copper piece sized areolas and Ten and May both had large gold piece sized areolas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I took are kings first kiss who wants first crack at sucking on his massive cock?\u201d May asks the other women.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then smiles at Sokka her eyes glowing with lustful mischief. Sing pulls off Sokka\u2019s cock and gives the head a kiss before she looks into Sokka\u2019s eyes as she swallows all fourteen inches of Sokka\u2019s massive cock in one go. She lets Sokka enjoy the feel of having his cock down her throat as she gives his pelvis a kiss leaving a light blue lipstick mark. Sing\u2019s eyes never leave Sokka\u2019s as she starts to bob her head up and down Sokka\u2019s cock humming a tune as she starts to rub his balls with her right hand. Sing lifts her dominant left hand up to her right tit and starts to squeeze it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka watches in amazement as Sing both bobs her head and starts to pull on her large brown nipple still smiling at Sokka and looking into his eyes. Sing then opens her left hand as she trails it down her flat tummy giggling a bit as she does. Sokka watches Sing hand slides down her brown spade before her rubes her hard clit with her index finger and lets out a moan on Sokka\u2019s cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Sing speeds up her bobbing as she starts masturbates shoving four of her short fingers into her soaking wet cunt. She starts to talk dirty as she pumps her fingers and bobs her head not that Sokka can understand her but it does turn her on more. She soon screams a muffled fuck as she cums first. She never stops sucking on Sokka\u2019s cock as she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to cum soon.\u201d The women are surprised that Sokka holds on long enough for Sing to cum first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSing smiles as she pulls all but the very tip of Sokka\u2019s cock from her throat as he releases his first shot of cum into her mouth. He gives so much semen that she has to pull off his tip. She grasps Sokka cock as he finish on her face and tits covering her in his sticky white goo. Sing plays with the seeming in her mouth for a bit before she opens her mouth. She shows Sokka the cum she has in her mouth before she closes it and swallows, she then opens her mouth showing Sokka it\u2019s empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have better fucking tasting cum then my husband. Holy shit you\u2019re still fucking hard as steel.\u201d Sing says to Sokka as she licks the last bit of cum off his cock head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell since are King is still hard who gets to he should get a tit fuck next. since I got to steal his first kiss ten you can have his first titty-fuck and by the way you should clean up there Sing.\u201d May says to the cum covered woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka watches as Sing wipes the cum form her face with her left hand and brings it to her mouth. She proceeds to loudly lick it off. She repeats the process until her face is clean. She then bends her neck and raises her double d\u2019s to lick them clean. She makes sure to give her nipples good suck when she gets to them. Sokka stares at Sing with his mouth open hanging open and cock painfully throbbing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a Chief Hunter you are the best hunter of your village and corporate with other chief hunters and the High Chief which is the leader of all the villages in the tribe.

She then said to him, \"You must go on a hunt by yourself and slay three predators of the Ice.  Not arctic hens or snow camels, predators.  Then you must go to the city of the floes, Atlara.  It is a city that dwells in the underwater caves of the Ice Floes.  There you will find the talking Abominable Lynx Gorillas, the rumored cousins of homo sapiens.  It is said that the Lynx Gorillas have a similar Rite that they hunt a human and the one that does presents it to the Lion Turtle to gain the ability to command all Lynx Gorillas and talk.  Thus only that Lynx Gorilla can speak.  You are to slay the one in command of it's tribe, the Yeti.

To leave him and the Yeti alone for combat with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka got ready as he walked out of his hut and saw two people waiting for him.

He was nearly out of seal jerky as he decided that he needed to saddle up on food.  So, with that decided he stalked into the cave as he pulled of his back his boomerang.  The flickered off it as he threw it with a heave and a hoe.  The boomerang flew inside as it snapped at something and from the cave irrupted several Arctic Wolf Bats.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw Sokka as he grabbed his bone club and went into combat.  Ducking he let one of the wolf bats fly over him.  Snapping up the club he struck one of the wolf bats in the belly as it let out a cry of pain.  From the soft belly came guts as he then moved the club in an downward arch on the skull of the crashing wolf bat.  The beast was dead as Sokka's clothes were stained with blood as he looked at the wolf bats that were left with a killer instinct.  There were six left as he readied himself for combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six were about to go on the attack until a loud roar was heard.  Sokka's eyes widened immediately at the hearing of the roar.  He recognized that call, it was the call of a Polar Bear Dog that was about to eat well.  Sokka looked down and then at his clothes remembering the first rule of the Ice.  Warm blood travels fast and it is delicious by all it's inhabitants standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka took his club as he went on attack as he ran forward.  He figured if he was going to meet his mother and the ancestors of the Ice today.  He'd do it in style as he ran and saw the Polar Bear Dog charging.  It roared as Sokka moved to the side as he dodged a swipe of it's right claw just by the shirt worn on his body.  Landing he threw his club at the jaw of the Polar Bear Dog in a spin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe iron ball made the speed of club spin at a faster speed than the animal desired.  The club hit the lower jaw of the animal as it groaned at the breaking of it's bottom canines.  The beast then roared as it attacked him angrily.  Sokka knew that a hungry beast plus rage at losing some of it's teeth equalled soon to be death of hunter or beast.  It was a fifty fifty chance as Sokka moved into a roll as he kicked it's chest after rolling under it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the beast groaned Sokka listened to the cracking of ribs.  He then fell back on the snow and rolled to the side as the animal attacked where he used to be.  Sokka was panting as he saw his club and slowly stood up.  The beast looked at him with a low growl as he jumped at the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe club was gotten as Sokka felt a pain as he screamed in pain.  His lower back was relieved of some flesh.  He hit the ground as he was in pain.  But luckily his adrenaline pumped ferociously as he opened his eyes. He rolled as he felt the cold on the back with the snow.  Sokka swung up the club as it smacked into the neck of the beast snapping it.  The sweet sound of it's death sank into Sokka's ears as the beast's eyes seemed to glaze over.  The falling of the beast was fast as it laid in the snow breathing, the body was trying to still do it's job while the brain could no longer send the signals to continue their work.  Sokka went into the cave as he fetched his boomerang and pulled the beast over.  It was the honorable thing to do on the Ice, kill it before patching yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

From the water came a great mass that was an animal that Sokka had never seen before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the legendary beast of the ocean the ever rare Sleeper Shark Plesiosauria.

He was shocked by what he found in the wrapped in the seal skins. Both his grandfathers had been chiefs of the southern water tribe. His paternal grandfather came from the foggy swamp and inside the skin were his iron bark chest body armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body armor had a wolf head carving on the chest. Iron bark can be repaired by infusing it with raw iron and heating it in a forge. The iron oak would absorb the iron to repair itself. iron wood also carved like normal and could be folded like normal wood using steam until it made contact with fire then it became as hard as iron. It was one of the few natural wonder materials found in the Foggy Swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His maternal grandfather was from the Southern Tribe and his warriors leggings made from the shell and sinus of an artic turtle wolverine crocodile and the hide of a rare and fearsome wolverine-tiger was in the skins as well. And finally there was a pair of blue water tribe steel braces, the first bracers Sokka\u2019s father Hakoda made. He used a skull bit from his journeyman kill a wolf-ox to harden them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Gran-Gran.\u201d Sokka says with tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew this was Gran-Gran\u2019s way of believing in Sokka. Sokka changed into the armor. He then grabbed his club and carefully dried the iron ball to make sure it did not rust before slipping it into the slot in the iron bark armor. Sokka then removed his steel boomerang and dried it off. He then pulled out his wen stone, and some rare artic lion flower oil after noticing the edge boomerang was dull. Sokka also fell into a meditative state as he began sharpening the edge of boomerang. This boomeranged was the only steel weapon Sokka could use right now until he passed this rite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has never needed to be re-forged in the four thousand years since its creation. It had been passed down from his mother\u2019s line from father to son and was the cause of the spit of the water tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamily legend states that the boomeranged was made from iron sand taken from La and Tui\u2019s pool which was the magnetite scales the two spirits shed. His ancestor Taka competed against another forger family for the hand of the current princess of the Water Tribe in marriage. This was also the time of the second King of the Water Tribe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaka spent a week carefully choosing each grain of sand using an iron rod to find only the purist iron since all water tribe iron sands are magnetic. The purer the iron the stronger magnetic force they exert. Then Taka removed the slag by smelting the iron into twenty five coins, then he took the coins added some powered Sea Serpent teeth that he had ripped out from one of the great beasts himself and smelted it again. In the end Taka only had a small one pond ingot. He then spent the rest of the month folding this ingot into boomerang. In total he lovingly folded the steel over a million times to make boomerang. He then quenched the boomerang in a mix of frozen sea serpents blood, imported dragons blood, and water from the oasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other forger a man named Hinaka made a simple ten pound hammer with a short shaft making it more of a tool then a weapon. The steel was subpar and the inlay work was just silver. The handle was made from ash-oak the most common wood in the world and the leather wrapping was made from an artic ox the most common leather in the north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all the boomerang should have won but Hinaka had a very wealthy father that bribed the judges with many skull bits to pass his son. As a result the Water Tribe split. The King let the princess who he knew was in love with Taka leave with him. Legend also had it that Taka and the Princess had three children. The oldest was a boy who would return to the Northern Tribe to become chief. The youngest a girl would settle with some of people who found the foggy swamps warmer climate better and settled in the foggy swamp and she became its first chief. Finally the youngest a boy was the first child born in the Southern Water Tribe. Sokka was related to all three of those children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka came out of his thoughts as his boomerang was honed back to a razors edge. Sokka always found the fact that boomerang\u2019s lost iron reabsorbed back into itself. Sokka place the boomerang into a slot in his armor. Armor was only allowed when hunting the most dangers beasts with thick armored hides. Some of the beasts were the great artic turtle wolverine crocodile, sea serpents, the rare but still living frost dragons, and finally Lynx Gorillas since they wore armor made form bone. No Lynx Gorilla has been seen since the start of the raids and even before that they were quite rare after Southern Lynx Man War. Sokka stretched to get a feel for the armor he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then headed into the cave like city of Atlantra, Sokka admired the Hei Bai crystals. Sokka thought the South Pole had no Hei Bai crystals. Sokka found it strange that he no longer felt cold but was not hallucinating like he should be from hypothermia, since he knew it was still very cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka makes his way to the center of the ruined city to find two guards standing in front of an ice gate wearing armor made form ox turtle shell. Lynx Gorillas were surprisingly thin, stood mostly upright, and looked like a man cat with hands for feet. (Think a stocky khajiit from the elder scrolls games that is partly hunched over but still stand mostly upright with feet hands too.) The taller of the two was definite female standing at six feet and war a loin cloth like bottom and shell gloves for boots. The smaller one was male at five feet nine inches and ware armored pants with leather boots. The female proceeds to release a loud roar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka moves his hand to his club but does not draw the weapon. A few minutes later the gate opens and an eight foot female wearing armor made form artic turtle wolverine crocodile shell. Her armor had pauldrons made from human skulls along with human skull knee guards. She wore a red loin cloth like skirt and glove boots. Strapped to her back were two machetes. Sokka knew form his Gran-Grans stories that Lynx Gorillas were a matriarchal race, meaning they were led by females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo another man has come to challenge me for the right to be King of the Water Tribe. At least this time it will be from a man of the Southern Tribe. I can pay your tribe back for the damage your human war with the Fire Nation has caused my people.</span></div></div>",

We will call up Sif, the great lion turtle that has given its wisdom to my people. I am the latest Yeti and I have lived a hundred years and killed fifteen of you Water Tribe men. Now fallow me so you can be my sixteenth kill, boy.\u201d the Yeti says as she walks into the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka fallows the Yeti as the gate shuts behind him. The two combatants walk to a large pool. A alter was in front of it, the pool was in the center of the once great city. Sokka could not help but notice the many huts around the pool and the wreckage of the once great city. The huts reminded him of his small village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother female was standing a next to a gong witch she rung. Sokka sees a little girl run up to the Yeti and gave her a hug. Sokka looks at the pool as he sees a massive shadow rises form the pool and a female lion turtle is reviled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Sif we called you because a human man came to fight for to challenge the matriarch for the rite of the king.\u201d Yeti tells the lion turtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFight with honor and remember the rules of hunters of the ice boy.\u201d Sif says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne or two weapons?\u201d the Yeti asks Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo and may I asks for your name before we battle mam, I am Sokka.\u201d Sokka says as he bows to the Lynx Gorilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no need for it, for you will soon be dead Sokka.\u201d the Yeti says as she draws her blades and leaps at Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka draws his club with his left hand and boomerang with his right to block the weapons. The force of the blow from the Yeti\u2019s blades slice right through Sokka\u2019s club and severs his left caller bone. But boomerang held strong cutting through the machete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will make a good trophy boy.\u201d Yeti tells Sokka as she slashes at him after switching her machete to her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka doges to the left throwing boomerang at the cat woman. Sokka knew she would doge it and doge it again on its return trip. Sokka grabs the bone handle from his left hand and throws it at the head at the woman. The handle connected with the unsuspecting woman. Sokka then dives between the woman\u2019s legs as his boomerang returns at the low angle as he expected it to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaching boomerang Sokka slashes the back of the woman\u2019s guards, boomerang easily cuts through the bone guards slicing the woman\u2019s hamstrings. Sokka then rises slicing woman\u2019s left armpit severing the tended there. The Yeti falls as Sokka stabs into the woman\u2019s right shoulder preventing her from fighting back. Sokka proceeds to kick the woman onto her back so he can look into her eyes when he kills her. Sokka yells a victory scream as he raises boomerang above his head so he can deliver the final blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the small Lynx Gorilla that hugged Yeti jumped on Sokka\u2019s fallen foe to shield her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill my mommy.\u201d The young girl cry\u2019s as she covers her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet Yumi out of here Soma.\u201d The Yeti yells at a male Lynx Gorilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes love.\u201d Soma tells his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka suddenly sees Katara and his dead mother instead of the Yeti and her child. He looks around as Soma walks to grab the child who just clings to her mother, looking around Sokka only counts seventy-five Lynx Gorillas standing around. The law ice was unforgiving but the Water Tribe did have one unbreakable rule, if the predators pack was small let them have the chance to grow and produce strong and worthy pray by avoiding there lands. Sokka looks at his hand, instead of seeing the blue paint of his steel gauntlets, he sees the black of the Fire Nation soldier who killed his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI refuse to be like the man who killed my mother, end my life and live Yeti. Just make sure my sister this gets that back.\u201d Sokka says as he then places his boomerang into the still somewhat working right hand of yeti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake it quick.\u201d Sokka says as he closes her hand around boomerang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Yuka and you pass the final test of the rite of the king, the test of a hunter\u2019s true self.\u201d Yuka tells Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best hunters can kill anything and everything. But the greatest hunter of all time only takes what he needs, killing only the sick injured and they leave the rest. He will never overhunt a species. Sparing my life makes you the first to truly pass since the first King of the Water Tribe. Soma please help me up.\u201d Yuka tells her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI give you the power to control the gift Lady Sif will grant you. Soma places my right hand on Sokka\u2019s forehead and my left on his heart. He is special his heart is on the wrong side.\u201d Soma does as his wife and leader asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuka\u2019s eyes glow red as she copies the gift of speech to Sokka. This will allow Sokka to talk to animals and give him an edge on hunting. The gift will also prevent him from becoming a mindless beast when he transforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can your daughter talk?\u201d Sokka asks after the deed is done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is next in line to lead the tribe and I have been teaching her to take over. She has already received the gift I gave you. Don\u2019t worry Soma is a good healer, he will fix me up so go stand before Sif boy.\u201d Yuka says as Soma calls some water to his hands to start fixing up his wife with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any scrolls on waterbending Soma?\u201d Sokka asks already knowing he can understand the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not a bender why do you want them?\u201d Soma asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not a bender this is true, but my sister Katara is the last known human bender in the South Pole. We have no one to teach her so I was hoping you have some basic scrolls for defense. She also wants to fallow in her mother\u2019s footsteps and become a healer so I was hoping you I could get some on water bending healing too.\u201d Sokka tells the Soma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo receive the gift it will heal you. My daughter will go get the scrolls for you.\u201d Soma says as he waves Yumi over as Sokka walks over to the altar in front of Sif.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are as worthy as the First King who shares your name young Sokka.\u201d Sif says as she reaches up her left claw. Her middle claw\u2019s red energy forms a crystal that she pierces into Sokka\u2019s chest. Sokka\u2019s eyes glow dark reds as the knowledge of his new powers enter his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnow this your energy forms can be hybridized but only the light and dark can give you the power to do this in your beast-man and full beast forms. The mark of the king will appear when you will it on your right hand.\u201d Sif tells the boy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are there others of your race.\u201d Sokka asks the older man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes like the four nations of man there are four tribes of the gorilla-lynx. We have been out of contact with are sister tribes since your world war started.\u201d Soma tells Sokka looking grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will try to get ahold of some of them when I head to the Northern Tribe around next year. I do need to tell both the other southern Villages, the northern tribe and the Foggy Swamp Tribe, that there is a new king.\u201d Sokka says with a serious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that boy.

Your village is two days in that direction. Safe travels boy.

She smiled at him, the only thing about her that would ever displease someone would be her nose's born angle pointing 'up' as it were. But, the curves, great deep eyes, the complex of her skin, the silky shiny hair and that wonderful smile. Oh, those outweighed the nose any day of the week! Then again, Zoraphina, was deemed the curviest girl in the entire tribe.  She was the tribe's first journalist, she did not want to be a hunter like her father and she never knew what he mother did as she died during child birth.  So, she at the age of 9 decided that her frail and weak body would be best to writing.  She did do work around the village and that built her up to not being a frail girl, but she was always a journalist at heart.  One who would research and write journals on hunting, war events, local news and other things that mattered to her heart.  She did pass her rite of house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka heard her speak to him, \"Hello, Sokka how are you doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grinned as he replied to her, \"I'm doing good and how is your writing going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling with a blush she then said to him, \"Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

So, that their minds do not falter from those they have left here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka commented to her, \"I'm sure that they would not try to falter.  But, this is a good idea.

Nina, Sing, and Ten, young wives with only two children between them, were also silent in deference to the tribe's wise woman and sage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of thought, during which Sokka became visibly anxious, Kanna finally spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a dreadful ordeal,\" she said slowly, her voice scarce above a whisper. Her eyes were dark, and her face was stern. \"I can count on one hand the number of times that the Rite of the King has been invoked in the last thousand years of our Tribe's history. It is a dire task, one which only the bravest and most daring of our people have ever undertaken. Not for six generations has anyone survived it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's eyes widened. He gulped, and his hands seemed to be trembling inside his heavy mittens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... is it really that hard...?\" he asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever heard of the Water Tribe having a king before?\" his grandmother replied sagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no. I <i>haven't</i>,\" said Sokka quietly. He had a look of sobered understanding on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you begin to understand how daunting this task truly is. To become worthy of being called King, in the Water Tribes, is to prove yourself as standing above any other man in the North or South. You must become the living embodiment of our tribes' ideals. A king is more than a chief. He must be wise, and brave, and cunning, and strong. Not only a warrior, or a hunter, but a healer and a builder and a craftsman and a merchant.\" Kanna spoke with force and conviction, her eyes boring intently into her grandson. \"You must become everything that a man of the Water Tribe can be, then surpass yourself and become even <i>more</i>. There is no simple task to undertake, Sokka, to prove yourself worthy. If you choose to take the Rite of the King, you will be driven to hardship like none other. You will suffer, and you will tremble in fear and beg for death. Only in facing the most dire challenges, and triumphing, may you even begin to prove yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was quiet. He looked anxious, but there was a hint of contemplation in his eyes. His jaw was set, and he stared into the eyes of his grandmother, the Sage of the Southern Water Tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is something big,\" he murmured half to himself. \"I don't know... How am I supposed to believe that I can do this? If it's really as hard as you say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't believe,\" said Kanna simply. \"To be King, you must pull yourself above your fellow man. You must realize your own limits, and the limits of those around you. You cannot simply <i>believe</i>. You need to <i>know</i>. If you accept this rite, I cannot promise that you will succeed. You will very likely die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grimaced, but there was a glint of conviction in his ocean blue pools. \"I can't expect to become King if I let something like death scare me off from trying,\" he said. \"Right, Gran-Gran?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanna smiled. \"That is the first step,\" she said. \"You cannot be mastered by the fear of death. Not if you wish to come through this alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded, to the surprise of Ten and Sing and Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" he said. \"I'll take the Rite of the King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three young wives and mothers gasped, somewhat astounded by this proclamation. Though they had been the ones to initially suggest it, they were still a little shocked to hear Sokka agree so readily to doing this. Kanna, though, did not look the least bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are brave, Grandson,\" she said with a small smile. \"Brave, but not foolhardy. Perhaps... perhaps if anyone can complete the Rite of the King, it will be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka gave her a lopsided grin. \"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Gran-Gran.\" He then stood up straight, and looked around somewhat quizzically at his surroundings. \"So... um, how do I start?\" he said, a little uncertain now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanna smiled. \"First,\" she said, \"you must...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is just to give you some ideas and how I will be doing it in my route the only rule is that Sokka must get a mark on his body some kind before taking the rite of the king<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start at age nine a member of the southern water tribe will chose the path the want to take. At age thirteen they make their hybrid weapon biased on the path the took. Hunters and brother hood members make a whale tooth scimitar, healers make a knife with an iron handle and sharp curved bone blade since iron does not hold an edge since it a bit too soft. Cultivators do the same but with strait blades (cultivators are the harvesters and care takers of kelp, sea prunes, grain seaweed which can be fermented to make alcohol or make flower and handle the artic hens.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt fourteen males can either take the iceberg dogging write or if there is no king the write of the king (in king by his own hand). Females take the rite the house which covers weaving sewing and cooking. After they pass they receive a steel version of there weapon to signifies adult hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the take the rite of their chosen profession: the rite of the Healer, hunter, Cultivator, Hunter or Brotherhood. There are also the some optional chooses after they pass them. There is the rite of learning if some on wants to teach the basics, the rite of the apprentice for those who want to pass there trade. The rite of the forge for those who want to work with steel, the rite of the brewer if they want to make antiseptic or either beer or spirits (there are many different ways to make booze. I learned this well looking up whiskey to learn the differences since I don\u2019t touch the stuff.) The rite of the spirit for those who decide to become either a nuns or priests (No vow of no-sex in the water tribes but they cannot get divorced). The rite of the trader is for the people who want to sell goods. The rite of the carver is for those who want to make honor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll jobs have four ranks apprentice, journeymen, elite and master. Each rank achievement is gain differently depending on the job. And for hunters rank advancement is achieved by hunting a more dangerous animals. Fishing is done by everyone in the tribe as a hobby with a fishing pole or spear and cultivators are the ones who use nets. Gill nets are not allowed to prevent over fishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there are two special rites one for men one for girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is the right of the chief held to decide who the best man for the job is when one chief dies. There is the rite of high chief a combat torment to decide who is to become high chief when the high chief dies. This position is later given to the chief of the north after the 100 year war. It\u2019s mostly to decide who is best suited to lead the water tribe in times of war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the woman has the rite of the wise to determine who will become the wise woman of the village when the current one passes away. The rite of the sage to determine who will lead the woman when the men are away at war. Kana is the current sage of the southern water tribe and wise woman of the western sea village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonor is the currency of the water tribe and was originally Camm\u2019s creation but I like it for the water tribe and this is how it is made in my route<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonor is made by stamping three different sized bone bits carved into different shapes and have the mark of the maker as the heads side and the rank of the maker on the other. (Stamping takes a lot less time than carving is why I chose this for honor) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkull bits are the size of gold pieces but shaped like a flat crystal like shape with flat points. Skull bits are the most valuable honor and are made only from pieces from the skull of an animal. Only masters have the skill to segment and carve a skull bit by hand since no template can be used to make these valuable coins. Skull bits are worth 100 predator pieces. The skull of the anima must be big enough to make at least two skull bits to be made into skull bits since a master always keeps one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext are predators pieces made vertebra and are made by elite and journeymen crafters. They have a hexagon shape and the size of a half dollar of us currency. They are worth 100 hen coins. Fish gill covers are used to make these as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there are the hens coins witch are made from the ribs of animals and are oval shaped. These are made by all ranks of honor makers but are also the only kind an apprentice can carve since they just cut the ribs to make quarter sized coins.<br>\r\nFor each rank achieved a two steel stamps are cast for the honor maker. And an honor maker reserves a small steel hammer when they pass their first rite. To pass to the rank of journeymen an apprentice must make 2000 hen coins. Then a journeymen must 200 predator pieces for elite. An elite must make 100 predator pieces without a template and carve size perfect skull bits from wood called practice bits before he can\u2019t try it with a skull. The first two skull bits are passible then one is stamped for the hunter and the other is made into a master medallion for the carver. No hunter can be a carver. The wood practice bits are burned to harden the final set of stamps.<br>\r\nThe excess bones are used to make weapons and other crafts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shavings left over from making honor is given to the hunter if it\u2019s from a dangerous beast so they can have weapons of steel made from the beast so there spirit might live in there weapon. If they choose to do this there old weapons are melted down to free the spirit of the kill they used to make their old weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a hunter dies there weapons ritually killed before they are melted down to send with the hunter in the afterlife. If a master hunter dies they are cremated and then half of their ashes are scattered to fortalice harvesters fields to add there strength to the rest of the water tribes and the other half is used to fertilize a new tree so they can protect the boats and homes of all the southern water tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two types of trees the water tribe use are fast growing oak/bamboo hybrids that produce thick branches after ten years that quickly grow back. The oldest trees are cleared once every ten years to make room for new ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire nation stays away from these islands out of respect and fear since it is holy ground for The Southern Water Tribe. It was said that once the Earth Kingdom settlement that was on whale Tail Island burned the trees down from Warrior Island. The Southern Water Tribe responded by attacking the island and killing every one over the age of 18 in response to the destruction of there sacred trees. Every kid 8-17 was sent to the earth kingdom and the rest were taken in by the southern tribe. The dead were surprisingly properly barred by earth kingdom customs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was four thousand years ago two thousand years after the great split of the water tribes. Since then no one has harmed the trees on both Warrior Island and Hunters Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouses are made from wood, fur, and bone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Attention authors who are members of other fan fiction sites you can use chapter one as a start point for your own version as long as you list your other fan fiction sites and your handle and your stories title on my new forum on fanfiction.net I have already made an example for this story. Check my profile on fanficton.net to get to my forms my handle on the site is Soulhope the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are making my story one story your own you can only use the first chapter of the story to make your story. You most also leave a different author as one of your first choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 1. No yaoi with Sokka involve in this story, Sokka can only be involved with up to a harem of girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 2. Sokka after his first time with a girl (if she is a virgin) can be submissive to make it all about her. afterwards he can be more domineering to his girls but he is never to rough with them unless there masochistic and he can be submissive if the girl he is with likes that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 3. No Sokka Katara stuff in this. And Toph with the duke since the boy has a crush on her and I like them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 4. Choose your favorite girls to add to Sokka\u2019s harem if he has one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 5. Sokka cannot rape a woman as it is dishonorable in the southern water tribe and punishable by death in the tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 6. Fire nation and the Southern Water Tribe have rape illegal and one of the few capital punishments in the both nations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. The Earth kingdom has no anti rape law. And allows captured females do be broken using rape. Sokka will asks the Earth King to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Check the guidelines if you\u2019re going to make your own rite Sokka has to pass and make sure to leave a spot for someone to make their own should they chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. To  to make a cannon reserve mark (meaning this is your vision) place cannon and your name heres mine for example: wolf99 cannon. When you post a new chapter you can rename the chapter and make a new mark for the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Please respect cannon reserve marks. Or the chapter will be deleted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. State when you are finised with your postings so others may continue the story if they wish. they cannot use your work as their own and post another site so don't worry. End your last post as your handle last cannon this mark is not to be changed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. If you\u2019re going to do smut it must be stated in chapter name. You must make the second choice skip smut if you want to do some smut but must continue to do the story for after the smut on the skip smut choice so readers who just want to read the story can get to the next chapter if its done. that way you can do a long smut seen with many options . <br>\r\n13. Use the skip smut option to continue the story without actually posting smut. That way you don\u2019t have to have the sex seen done until you\u2019re ready to post your next chapter on a different site<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">14. The Golden Rule: Have fun with this story.</span></td>",
