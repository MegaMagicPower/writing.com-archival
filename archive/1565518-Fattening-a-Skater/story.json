            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A beam of sunlight peaked through the partially open curtains of Nick's bedroom and shined directly on to his closed eyes. The boy let out a sleepy moan as he turned away from the light . He rubbed the sleep from his eyes while letting out a loud yawn. The bedroom was warm and Nick kicked off his blanket sometime during the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on his bedsheet clad in only a pair of loose plaid boxers, Nick reached and grabbed his phone that was charging on his nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saturday, June 2nd 11:32am,\" the screen read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was probably the only advantage of working at Williams &amp; Williams: Nick was gauranteed to have Saturdays and Sundays off. Every weekday, however, filled with same stale tasks: Load the trucks, unload the truck trucks, move these boxes, get yelled at by that boss. When Nick thought about it, perhaps the lack of drug testing was another perk to the job. Nobody seemed to mind when he would come into work a little bit stoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the phone back down, Nick turned on the bedsides lamp, illuminating his messy room. Dirty clothes lay in a pile in a corner, various junk food bags were scattered around, several skateboards in varying forms of construction and deconstruction were on the side of the room, his dressers were a mess, and sitting on top of them were a couple of bongs and marijuana paraphernalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing was on the docket for Nick today.  Drumming his fingers on his bare, hairless abdomen, he thought about how to spend his Saturday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other side of the wall opposite to him, Nick heard someone moving around and surmised that his roommate Diego must be up. Diego might have the day off too, Nick thought, and he could spend the day chilling out with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was supposed to be a bright and warm Summer day, so he could take advantage of the good weather and hit up some of his favorite skating spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps he should pull himself out of bed and grab something to eat. Nick has never had much of an appetite, so he'd have to get a little high if he wanted to keep something down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...or just get high and go right back to bed. The past couple of weeks at work had been pretty rough. Maybe spending a little more time sleeping would do his body good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick contemplated what to do with his day, one of his hands slowly works its way down into his boxers. The skater noticed his semi-erect member and realized it had been a at least a couple of weeks since he got laid. He could hop on one of his apps and see if there's anyone around to play with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting in the living room wearing only a pair of shorts and munching away on a bag of cookies, Diego was watching a reality show when Nick stumbled into the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin',\" Diego said as he shoved another cookie into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Nick replies. \"Just got back from work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'bout an hour ago,\" Diego said, his eyes not turning away from the television. The best friends used to be coworkers until Diego quit his warehouse job and landed a job working at Sonoma's, an artisan bakery not too far away. Diego worked in the back helping bake all of the breads and cakes and cookies and other bakery staples they sold. The position paid well, though the downside was that Diego had to wake up at the crack of dawn to get to his morning shift. But what made up for that was him being able to take home loads of day-old baked goods, such as the cookies he was eating right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he had been working there for a few months, Nick noticed the impact all the sweets had on his best friend's waistline. Diego was never as skinny as Nick, but his stomach always was flat. Now, a roll of tan skinned pudge was blooming on his abdomen, the beginnings of a belly. His whole body had lost definition. His arms, legs, chest, and even his face looked softer, rounder. Maybe Nick guessed that Diego had put on around 15 pounds thanks to all the sweets he got from work for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got anything exciting planned for the rest of your day?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Numph,\" Diego said shoving another cookie into his mouth. Crumbs cascaded down onto his bare torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, wanna hang out today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, and do what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick thought for a moment. They could just chill out at the apartment today, watch television and play video games. He hadn't eaten anything today, so he could ask Diego if he wants to go out and grab a bite. Or maybe there's a good movie playing in theaters. It's been a while since Nick actually went to the movies. It was also supposed to be warm today. Their apartment's AC wasn't the best, so they could chill out at the mall, literally. But then again, Nick could just ask his best friend what interested him.</span></div></div>",

I need to get something from the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego got up and wandered into the kitchen as Nick paused their fighting game. This wasn't the boy's first trip to there. Over the past few hours, Diego would frequently get up and grab a snack from the pantry. And now the coffee table was littered with tons of junk food wrappers, all of which was now sitting in Diego's gut and looked considerably more swollen than it did a few hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego plodded out of the kitchen. This time he was chugging directly from a 2L bottle of cola. The curve of his belly stuck out prominently as he drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick didn't know what had gotten into Diego. His best friend was snacking and eating way more than Nick had ever seen. And it was having a noticeable effect on Diego's weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy plopped down onto the couch and let out a burp as he cleared away a spot on the messy table for the soda bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick thought about asking Diego about his sudden eating craze or his growing belly. But then again, Diego seemed like he was enjoying himself. Why should Nick interfere with that?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dude, you should cut back,\" said Nick as Diego took another healthy swig from the large soda bottle. \"You're really starting to pork up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh, no, I'm not,\" said Diego shortly before letting out a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick reached over to the couch and pulled up Diego's shirt, exposing the swelling mound of pudge growing on his midsection. Diego slapped Nick's hand away as he pulled his shirt back down over his belly. \"I don't remember that gut being there!\" teased Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, maybe I put on a pound or two. It's no big deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know it's only a pound or two? When was the last time you weighed yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...maybe, like half a year ago?\" Diego replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, maybe it's time to get your chunky butt on the scale! Come on, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the two boys were in the bathroom. Diego's clothes laid crumpled in the corner as he stood on the scale glad only in his black briefs. Nick didn't mention that they were starting to ride up his friend's plump butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego gulped as he read the scale. \"Uh, it says...183! That can't right! There's no way that I put on over thirty pounds in a few months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can believe it!\" said Nick as he pinched a roll of Diego's flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, man!\" Diego yelled. \"At least I've got some meat on my bones! We can't all be skeletons like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a skeleton!\" Nick shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, then why don't you hop on here and see how little your skinny butt weighs!\" Diego yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine!\" The skater then undid his pants and yanked off his shirts tossing both onto the floor, keeping on his boxer briefs. His friend's eyes widen as he saw how truly thin Nick was. There was virtually not an ounce of fat on him. His body was flat as a board, and Diego could easily count his ribs. The skater's legs were incredibly boney, and he had no butt to speak of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" Diego said as he got off the scale. \"I never thought I knew anyone who was actually skin and bones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Nick retorted as he got on the scale. \"Uh, it says...122?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, man. I didn't know you were that skinny!\" Diego said. Nick knew he was on the thin side, but he didn't realize that he was so underweight. Looking down at his body, he seemed to finally take in how skinny and frail he was. Years of skateboarding burned off pretty much every single calorie he ate. And this left him with a body that appeared to be grossly malnourished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't realize I was...so small,\" Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you kinda look sickly,\" replied Diego. \"You could have gained thirty pounds and still be underweight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit,\" Nick shot back. His best friend was completely right. The skater looked emaciated, sick, literally skin and bones. Putting on a few pounds might be good for him, not just in terms of appearance but also health. There's no way it can be good for him to weigh so little.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The scale flickered to life as Nick stepped on it one Tuesday morning before work. For the past couple of weeks, Nick had made a conscious effort to eat more. Dinners were a bit bigger, he'd brings snacks in at work, and he took a couple extra trips to fast food restaurants. That being said, Nick didn't feel or look too different. Though he wasn't too worried about it. Whatever pounds he did pound on wouldn't be that obvious considering how thin he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick glanced at the number the scale produced. \"122,\" it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damnit,\" Nick muttered as he walked out of the bathroom dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably your damn metabolism,\" Diego suggested. That evening, the boys went out to BurgerVilla, a nearby burger joint, for dinner. Nick had taken nibbles of his burger and fries, still despondent over the lack of any sign of progress. Diego, on the other hand, had devoured his two burgers and fries in record time. His eating had not slowed down at all in recent weeks. And Nick would have criticized him about it if he wasn't already too distracted by the inability to put on a single pound. Besides, any attempt by Nick to judge Diego's body would be met with immediate comments about Nick's rail-thin frame which was already taking a toll on his self esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" Nick asked as he munched on a fry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so.\" Diego took a sip of his large vanilla milkshake. \"You've been skating for years and barely eating anything. Probably, your body naturally burns off every single calorie instantly because that's what its been trained to do. If you want to put on weight, you need to grind it down to a halt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how would I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overload it with calories?\" Diego offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's what I've been doing. Like, I've even started bringing a second sandwich with me to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean really overload it.\" Diego said. \"Like, not just a few hundred extra calories. I'm talking thousands or even tens of thousands of extra calories. So much that you're body will have no choice but to convert them all into fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" replied Nick. \"And how the hell am I supposed to eat that many calories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego gestured to the burger and fries in front of Nick. \"Hey, there's a couple thousand calories right there. Fast food is dripping with loads of extra calories. Maybe it's time to be a BurgerVilla regular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater's stomach churned at the thought of consuming so much grease and salt and sugar. Sure, it may be effective, but there's got to be a healthier way. \"Ugh, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, I dunno, don't bodybuilders have something to bulk up with? Some kind of powder or something? It might be good to look into those,\" Diego offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an option,\" Nick said. \"It sounds easier on the stomach than burgers for every meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe just keep on with what you're doing. I mean, its got to impact your metabolism eventually, right?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Heh, back again, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high schooler at the register of BurgerVilla had recognized the skater who came in earlier in the day and ordered a large bag full of burgers and fries. And here he was again, ordering just as much fast food. This time, though, he looked visibly ill. Unbeknownst to the guy at the register, Nick's belly was stuffed to the brim with the incredible amount of food he ordered just hours ago. Bloated and nauseated, he approached the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, *urp* still hungry,\" Nick blurted out. He wasn't actually hungry. Quite the opposite, in fact. The boy was painfully full, but that was the natural state he was in for the past few weeks. Taking Diego's advice, Nick had taken up gorging himself of highly caloric fast food. Actually, he had replaced every meal with fast food of some kind or the other. Breakfast, lunch, dinners, he even snacked on that kind of junk food. So Nick's stomach was in a nearly constant state of digesting greasy burgers, deep fried burritos, and thousands of ketchep-laden fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Nick, all that fast food wasn't having much of an effect on his waistline. When he went to weigh himself in the morning, the scale jumped between 123 and 124. But he dismissed the meager gain; he still felt his stomach digesting the mountain of pizza he devoured the night before. Instead, his new diet only left him bloated, gassy, and feeling greasy inside and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bacon cheeseburger, another large order of fries, and a large chocolate shake was what Nick brought back with him to his apartment. As he opened the front door, Diego was sitting on the couch halfway through another bag of chips. His weight had continued to balloon and was approaching 200 pounds, if not well over it. Diego's belly spilled out from under all his shirts which were barely able to contain his swelling gut and moobs. None of his jeans could be buttoned, and most of the time in the apartment was spent pantsless, showing off his chunky thighs and plump butt. Because Nick was gorging himself on fast food all the time, Diego was taking advantage of the situation by accompanying his best friend when he went out to eat. And while he wasn't eating nearly as much fatty food as Nick was now, his burger intake had increased considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick plopped down on the living room couch next to Diego who was wearing loose boxer briefs and a tank top that barely contained his flabby stomach. He opened the bag from BurgerVilla, unwrapper the burger, and began lazily eating it as his stuffed belly groaned and creaked in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you didn't bring me back anything?\" joked Diego. Nick only rolled his eyes as he took another bite of the burger. It was his fifth for the day. Oh, relax. Have you put on any weight yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. I mean, my pants don't fit very well but that's because I'm so God damn bloated all the time,\" Nick moaned as he shoved the burger into his mouth. \"Man, I feel gross all the time now. I'm like a grease sponge because of all the fat I'm sucking down. I'm thinking about quitting this. I'll figure out a way to put on weight that doesn't make me feeling so awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on. Keep it up for a little bit longer! I'm sure you'll break through and start getting some pounds on you,\" Diego reassured Nick. \"Just try it a little longer!\"</span></div></div>",

It took another few weeks of nothing but fast food, but it looked like Nick was finally winning the war against his hyperactive metabolism. Nine new pounds now stuck to his frame. He hopped off the scale and checked himself out in the mirror. The gain wasn't too terribly noticeable. But his arms and legs were less boney and his chest was no longer so thin that each of the skater's ribs were visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all the fast food was having other impacts as well. With all the the grease and oil Nick was sucking down, the skater was constantly feeling lethargic and was easily fatigued. He frequently felt bloated and gassy most of the time. Diego usually had to kick Nick out of the living room whenever he devoured a ton of fast food because his flatulence afterwards made sitting with Nick unbearable. His skin was getting oily, and the skater's skin was breaking out in places. But none of this really bothered Nick now that all his efforts were paying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a victory burger...\" he grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan slid the heavy tray onto the table in front of Nick. \"The usual?\" the boy asked. Nick nodded as he unwrapped his bacon cheeseburger (with extra bacon, extra cheese). BurgerVilla was Nick's top choice when it came to fast food. Not only was the food reasonably priced, but it was only a few blocks away. Having gone to BurgerVilla at least once a day for the past couple of months, the staff saw Nick as a regular. In particular, Ethan saw Nick as a regular. More often than not, he would be manning the cash register whenever the skater would walk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle by little, Nick had gotten to know Ethan over the months of eating at BurgerVilla. He was about 5'7\" with short block hair and green eyes, a handsome face with distinct cheekbones, and weighed in at around 140 pounds. The boy was 18 years old and had graduated from one of the area high schools earlier in the summer. Without the burden of school, Ethan took a bunch more shifts at BurgerVilla to save up money so he could attend the community college in a couple of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, enjoy! I know you always do!\" Nick grunted back at Ethan as he walked back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick sucked down his greasy burger and fries, he saw the receipt for his order and remembered how tight money was getting. Eating out breakfast, lunch and dinner was starting to add up. If he kept this up, he would have to seriously cut back unless he wanted to miss paying his rent. He sighed. Just when he was starting to really make progress on his weight, money was becoming an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea occurred to Nick. Ethan works here and definitely get an employee discount. On top of that, he's heard the boy talk about getting to eat any of the mistake orders or anything made extra for free. If Nick could befriend Ethan, then he wouldn't have to worry much about the cost of eating. Ethan could be his source of many, many burgers.</span></div></div>",

Nick and him were friends for a couple of weeks now and after Nick told him, what he was up to, Ethan offered to bring the leftovers after work every day. They would normally spend the evening watching TV with Diego and stuff their guts with so much fattening food, that they were barely able to move later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, Ethan was holding several big bags full of fast food in his hands. Nick rubbed his belly. \"Nice, I was getting hungry and judging by his complains in the last hour, Diego is only minutes from starving to death.\" Ethan laughed: Yeah, ne too. I've really worked up an appetite, since we started hanging out.\" He patted his gut, causing his new little pot belly to jiggle slightly. The boys entered the living room, where Diego was sitting on the couch, as usual. He got even fatter. His belly layed in his lap, almost able to cover the fact, that his pants, he bought last week were unbuttoned. His shirt was way too tight and riding up over his bellybutton. \"Hey, Ethan. Thank God, you arrived. I'm starting.\" \"Looks like you're far away from starving.\", said Ethan and grinned. \"It's only a couple of pounds. I'll prove it. Diego heaved himself off the couch and walked into the bathroom. Nick and Ethan followed him. When they entered, Diego was already standing on the scale and was looking pretty shocked. \"What does it say?\" asked Nick. \"268 lbs. Guess I'm a little bigger than I thought I was.\" \"Maby more than a little. Alright, my turn\", said Nick and hopped on the scale. \"Not bad. 175.\" Nick patted his pot belly, causing it to jiggle and stopped of. Now it was Ethans turn. He stepped on and the scale showed 172. \"Wow, I gained 30 lbs in just 4 weeks. Maby Diego and I should go on a diet.\" Diego, still in shock, nodded. \"Starting tomorrow\", he said when they were back in the living room. They decided to have one last feast. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, all thoughts about dieting were gone. Diego, Nick and Ethan continued to stuff themselves for another two months. Eating tenths of thousands of calories each day did have a huge impact on their bodies. Nick was no longer anything close to being skinny. He had a huge gut, boobs and a double chin. Everything wobbled, when he moved. Diego was even fatter. The two boys had trouble sitting on the couch together. Also Ethan got pretty fat. They were sitting in the living room together as always and eating. Diego came back from the bathroom, already out of breath from the short way. He sat down next to Nick. The couch cracked under his weight, before giving up completely under their weight. While Nick and Diego looked pretty shocked about that, Ethan busted out in laughter. \"Looks like you two got to fat for the couch.\" \"We should check our weight. I can't believe we just destroyed a couch.\" Diego said. He tried to get up, but failed. After three unsuccessful tries, he was completely out of breath, same as Nick. Ethan stood up from his chair, not without trouble and helped the two boys up. They waddled to the bathroom. Diego got almost stuck in the door. After they all squeezed in, Nick was the first one to climb on the scale. Ethan had to read out the number. There was no way, Nick could see it over his fat belly. \"286\" he red out. Nick patted his belly and stepped aside. Ethan was next. \"346\" said Nick \"Wow, more than 200 lbs since we met.\" \"Yeah, guess you two have a bad influence on me.\" he said grinning. Next up was Diego, the by far fattest of the group. The scale cracked under his weight. Nick's and Ethans eyes widened \"Wow, 489 lbs. Bro, you should go on a diet, before you get too fat for the doors.\" Diego just shrugged his shoulders \"I don't need a diet. I'm far too fat for that now and you two aren't that skinny either. Maby the problem is, that you are still to thin, not that I'm too fat.\" With that he squeezed back through the door and placed his massive body on the broken couch and started eating again. Nick and Ethan followed his example. </span></div></div>",

Well, we get a ton of orders of them, so you're going to be quite busy. Now, let's start with the basics...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's mind wandered as Ethan explained all of the ingredients and measurements for the dozens and dozens of milkshakes BurgerVilla offered. He wasn't too interested in the prospect of being a shake jockey. What the skater had his mind on was all of the super fatty foods that he'd now be surrounded by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping hints at Ethan about being unable to afford eating out at BurgerVilla all the time, the young man suggested that the skater apply for some part-time, weekend shifts there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The manager recently fired the last guy the other day,\" he explained. \"I could put in a good word for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nick wasn't too thrilled about working another job, BurgerVilla did have a great perk: Employees, even part-timers, eat for free. Sure, the skater would be sacrificing his free weekend since he'd also need to work his usual weekday job, but Nick figured it'd be work it if it meant being able to suck down greasy burger after greasy burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead! Try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick snapped back to reality. Ethan was holding up what looked to be a chocolate shake in a medium sized paper cup. \"Give it a taste!\" he said. \"So you know how it should turn out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the cup and took a sip, then a glup, and then another. Ethan watched, his eyes bugged out, as the skater slowly but surely chugged the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, that's good...\" Nick said, wiping his upper lip clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, my milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard!\" joke Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure as hell could bring this boy to your yard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan started to blush. \"Anyways, let's show you how the ice cream machine works...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling into his apartment one Saturday nights, Nick quietly shut the front door behind him while juggling two enormous milkshakes. He made his way to his bedroom and pulled off his tight pants and work shirt, tossing them into a corner with all of the rest of his laundry. The skater collasped naked on to his bed as he did so many time after his shifts at BurgerVilla, with his belly full of grease and oil while trying to pound down more milkshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shifts as BurgerVilla were doing wonders to his waistline. Nick was practically inflating, having put on ten pounds in under two weeks. And while the was just as bloated and gassy as ever, Nick was enjoying feeling himself fill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, he might not be the only one enjoying it. Many of his shifts had him working with Ethan. And there had been many times the skater caught the young man glancing at his belly, checking out his ballooning rear, and watching him eat. Maybe there was a way to find out for sure that Ethan was into seeing Nick fatten up.</span></div></div>",

Things were slowing down and now was the time to restock items for the morning crew. Nick was nearly finished, only having left to replenish the cookie dough his station. When he got to the walk-in freezer, he found Ethan inside there, pulling something away. Figuring that they'd be alone for a little while, Nick decided that would be the best occasion to drop some obvious hints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, have you?\" Ethan asked nervously, his eyes briefly darting towards his expanding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah. All these burgers and shakes are blowing me up like a fucking balloon,\" he said while opening a box of cookie dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan swallowed hard. \"Y-yeah. Food here is pretty good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick pulled up his shirt, exposing the tanned, round curve of his gut, still bloated from his break meal of a couple of burgers which he ate not long ago. \"God damn, look at me! So fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man chuckled bashfully, his cheek burning red, taking in the sight before him. \"Eh, y-yeah, I guess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been working here, Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like, there years or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, if I worked here that long, I'd be a quarter ton by now!\" Nick said, giving his gut slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah...That'd be pretty big!\" Ethan replied. Nick could see the growing bludge in Ethan's pants. The skater smirked upon seeing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotten so soft and flabby. Feel!\" Nick grabbed Ethan's hand and pressed it into the moderate layer of pudge forming on the skaters stomach. The younger boy's hand sunk into the fat. Shocked at first, Ethan's other hand reached for Nick's gut. He looked astonished as he started massaging the skater's belly. Nick groaned in pleasure as the boy went to work caressing and kneading his belly. He could feel himself getting turned on but didn't care if Ethan saw the bludge in his own pants. </span></div></div>",

Part of Nick's responsibilities was to make sure everything was cleaned and filled at his station for the people working the day shirt tomorrow. When he stepped into the large walk-in refrigerator, he found Ethan there putting away bottles of ketchup and mustard. This, Nick thought, would be a perfect opportunity to drop some less than subtle hints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've noticed,\" replied Ethan sternly. \"You're certainly making a little piggy of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was taken a bit off guard but decided to keep going. \"Uh, yeah. There's just too much good for here! I can't help myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure can't, pig-boy,\" the younger boy said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, heh, yeah. Better not get locked in here tonight. Might not keep myself from eating everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you wouldn't, fat fucking Pig,\" Ethan shot back, giving the skater a look. Nick was shocked at whst he said, unaware that inexplicably his loins started to stir to life. The younger boy grabbed a fistful of cooked bacon strips laying on a pan in the fridge. Dangling one up in front of Nick's face, he said \"Eat up, Pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater looked at the strip, then at Ethan before nervously biting at the bacon. Ethan smirked as he chomped down on the strip, feeding Nick another then another then another. Nick ate piece after piece, unaware of the raging hard-on in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, does Piggy want more?\" asked Ethan after Nick choked down the last slice. The skater just nodded slowly. \"I figured as much, Hog. Let's go back to your place, Piggy, so I can give you a proper feeding.\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, a junk food diet or chugging down shakes might work, but he didn't think they were the healthiest options. By eating just only a fair bit more than usual, Nick thought that it would be a sensible way to gain weight without wrecking his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he stood on the scale, he was shocked to see that not only had he failed to gain any weight, he was in fact losing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! I don't know how that happened!\" Nick said astonished by what the scale read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've been doing what you've been doing, right?\" asked Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I mean, I can understand not gaining weight, but how did I lose any? I don't understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, maybe it's time to see a doctor about this. If you're losing weight and you're skinny as you are, there might be something wrong with you,\" Diego suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I guess you're right. Besides, it's been a while since I've gone to the clinic anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rubric stepped into the examining room carrying a stack of papers with him. Nick sat nervously as he waited to hear from the doctor if anything was wrong with him. \"Good news and bad news,\" the greying middle-aged doctor said as he sat down across from Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad news first, please,\" Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad,\" Dr. Rubric reassured him. \"Judging by lab results, I think there are some issues with your thyroid. Your blood work suggests that it's functioning, but only sporadically. This can lead to hormonal problems and it matches up with not only your concerns about your weight, but also other issues you've complained about. You said to Nurse Clayton that you were having trouble sleeping and were getting easily fatigued, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But I just thought that may have been from stress and work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be, but like I said, your lab work shows classic signs of a problematic thyroid. This is where the good news comes in! It's pretty easy to treat. I'm going to write you a prescription for Thyroxotin. This is one of the best drugs to treat your condition. There are a few side effects, such as heart palpitations, trouble breathing, and night sweats, but they are extremely rare in young men like yourself. Just take one tablet twice daily on an empty stomach with water. We can schedule an exam in a month or so to see how it's working. Now, about billing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Nick exited Parker's Local Pharmacy with a small bag with a bottle of pills it in. It was getting close to the evening, so Nick thought he should take one now. Yet the moment he decided that, his stomach grumbled loudly. Because of one of the lab tests he took that morning, he couldn't eat anything before going to see the doctor. Now his stomach was calling out for food. On the one hand, Nick should follow the instructions for his medication exactly. However, he was incredibly hungry and it was the first time in a while he had much of an appetite. Not following the pill's instructions once couldn't be that bad, right?</span></div></div>",

When Nick agreed to put on a little weight, he also suggested that Diego go on a bit of a diet. At first, he complained. But when faced with the realization that he'd end up enormous if he kept swelling up thrity pounds ever few months, Diego was on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing that Nick was the one who pestered Diego to trim down, he felt that it was his responsibility to keep his friend on track whenever he could. When Diego would come back from grocery shopping, Nick would pick through his bags and take away any junk food Diego tried to sneak into the apartment and hide it in his own room usually to devour later. When they would go out to eat, Nick would force Diego to make healthy choices while eating to his own heart's content. And when Diego would spend his day off in the couch, Nick would kick him out of the apartment for a few hours and make him go out on long walks as he would take Diego's spot on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says...179! I lost four pounds!\" Diego said excitedly. Although it was hard to tell at this point, Nick had noticed the slight weight loss. Diego's shirts were fitting a bit better around his stomach and the boy jiggled less as he walked around the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job!\" Nick said as he patted his best friend on the shoulder. \"My turn now.\" Nick hopped on the scale eager to see the numbers. He had noticed that his body looked more filled out. His ribs were disappearing under flesh and Nick's arms and legs were starting to appear less boney. \"Holy shit, 130? Eight pounds? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Nick. What the hell have you been eating?\" joked Diego <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. But whatever it is, it's working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was absolutely thrilled about his progress. He was well on his way to getting to be a healthy weight and was beginning to like what he saw in the mirror. But deep down, the skater wanted more progress, more results. He felt a bit impatient and wanted to see the numbers on the scale go up higher and quicker.</span></div></div>",

Unless you want those four pounds back on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, once again, was pestering Diego to get off the couch and do something physical. This usually meant talking long walks around the neighborhood. The skater wasn't typically this pushy, but Diego yielded. He put on his shoes, grabbed a bottle of water from the refrigerator, and stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego would be gone for a couple of hours, at least. This would give Nick the alone time he wanted. Waiting about fifteen minutes in case Diego came back for something, Nick was assured that he would now be by himself for some time. He quickly rushed to the refrigerator and reached in far into the back. Hours ago, Nick stopped by a corner store where he bought a liter of whole fat milk. Uncapping the bottle, Nick eagerly raised it to his lips and easily swallowed a third of the container in a matter of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the milk jug on the counter, Nick walked over to one of the cupboards and pulled out a large half-eaten jar of peanut butter. Pulling a spoon from a nearby drawer, he stuck it in, scooped up a huge glob, and began eating. A few scoops of peanut butter, a couple of swigs of the milk, Nick worked his through both over the next hour. Lucky for him, he had devoured the last of the peanut butter before he finished off the milk. Sucking down the last of the liquid, Nick tossed both empty containers into the trash, stuffing them in deep so Diego wouldn't find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hand gently rubbing his stuffed belly, Nick plopped down on to the living room couch to watch television while the thousands of calories he just consumed in so short a time were being digested. Whole milk and peanut butter, Nick had learned during an evening of research on several body building forums, were a super cheap and easy way to get loads of calories. They were a staple for guys wanting to bulk up. And, he reasoned, Nick was trying to bulk up after all. He just needed to figure out a better way of disposing of the evidence before Diego spotted the half dozen plastic containers in the trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, 141? What have you been eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smirked as he saw the reaction on Diego's face. Another two weeks passed and the boys were checking in on their weights. The skater, no doubt thanks to his super caloric snacks, had put on nearly a pound a day. And as he examined his body, Nick liked what he saw. In general, he looked more filled out, healthier, no longer boney or sickly. Most noticably, a thin layer of softness covered his abdomen and puffed up his flat pecs. Admittedly, he enjoyed poking and pinching and jiggling the tiny bit of pudge on him especially as he laid naked in bed at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm making up for lost time eating!\" replied Nick and he gingerly stepped off the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego stepped on and saw his weight. \"173! Another six pounds lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick started doing some math in his head. At this rate, he's putting on two pounds for every one Diego is losing. Pretty soon, Nick will be the heavier of the two. He didn't know quite how to feel about that. After all, Nick felt like he was the one actually pushing Diego to eat less and move more. Maybe if Diego wants to keep losing weight, he'll have to really do it on his own.</span></div></div>",

Yet Nick, citing his best friend's diligence and weight loss success, convinced him to splurge just for one meal. And what a meal it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta make up for all those burgers I didn't eat!\" Diego said as his bit into his second burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Diego, Nick was making sure that Diego was having far more cheat days than he realized. He left out loads of cookies and treats for Diego to mindlessly snack on throughout the day. Nick's fast food orders would always \"accidentally\" include something extra that he didn't order which he readily offered to Diego. And he wasn't pushing his best friend to exercise anymore. Without the constant reminders to get up and move, Diego ended up spending most of his free time sitting on his butt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick scooted out of the booth, brushing the crumbs off of his shirt and grabbing his empty soda cup. \"Gotta get a refill,\" he said. Diego gave him a thumbs up as he shoved a handful of fries into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel his blossoming belly bounce as he approached the soda machine. Ethan, a cute, trim, and young man with short black hair who frequently manned the cash register whenever Nick stopped by to stuff his face, was refilling the straws and plastic lids and the skater filled his tall cup once more with soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything good?\" asked Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always,\" Nick said after stifling a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, cool.\" He then turned his head back towards the table where Diego, belly filled to the point that it was strecthing his shirt, was unwrapping his third burger. \"Heh, that your boyfriend over there?\" he said in a hushed tone to Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick chuckled to himself. \"Nah, that's Diego, my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, he's not seeing anyone, then?\" he joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed again. \"Not to my knowledge. But I'm not sure if he's into dudes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can't blame a guy for trying. Wait here a sec.\" Ethan dashed back behind the counter and out of sight. Moments later, he reappeared holding a large milkshake. Chocolate, by the looks of it. He handed it to Nick who was waiting for him at the soda machine. \"Here, give this to him. Tell Diego it's, uh, on the house...\" Ethan gave Nick a wink before turned around and heading to the back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Nick checked out the shake. The shake itself seemed fine. But scribbled on the side of the cup was Ethan's name and what Nick presumed to be his phone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the table, Nick sat the shake down next to his soda. \"Got a shake, too?\" Diego asked before taking a healthy bite of his burger.</span></div></div>",

And almost immediately Diego's waistline ballooned back up to where it had been many weeks ago before he went on a diet. Probably with a pound or two extra on top of it. Though it didn't seem to bother him, and it certainly didn't seem to bother Ethan. Nick saw the younger boy cradling Diego's belly while they cuddled on the couch and squeezing his swelling lovehandles when they embraced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, too, continued packing on the pounds though at a much slower speed than Diego. It makes sense, he thought. He didn't have a boyfriend who could hook him up with cheeseburgers all the time. But the skater was proud of breaking through 150 pounds, the roll of pudge that was his belly now starting to swell out into a genuine gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, Nick was chilling out on the couch when there was a knock on the front door of the apartment. Before he could get up and answer it, Diego sprung out of his room dashing towards the door, his moobs and belly jiggling along the way. Ethan was at the door, and the two hugged and embraced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you think I could take a quick shower before we go?\" asked Diego. \"You don't mind waiting, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I won't mind. Go ahead and get clean.\" Ethan patted Diego on the rear as made his way to the shower. He plopped down on the opposite end of the couch Nick was sitting on. \"So, how's things?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going alright. And you? How's things going between you and Diego?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good, I'd say,\" Ethan replied. \"Thanks for passing along my number to Diego a while back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. And smart idea writing it down on a milkshake cup. It was bound to get his attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Boy sure does love his food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I know it,\" said Nick. \"Diego's packed on all the weight he lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. And you can, uh, expect to a see a lot more of him soon, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smirked at Ethan. \"I figured you were up to something. How big are you planning on making him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have decided yet,\" said Ethan. \"But let's just say that he's far, far too skinny now.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick's phone buzzed as the skater watch television alone in the living room. It was Saturday night, and Diego usually spent it over at Ethan's place, giving him the whole place to himself for the evening. As such, he lounged around the place wearing a loose pair of boxers. A thick roll of fat spilled out over the front, budding lovehandles peaked out over the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking his phone, he saw that Ethan had sent him a picture message. Nick eagerly opened it. The photo was of Diego, passed out alseep, mostly nude, with what looked like ketchup staining the side of his mouth. He was lying on his side; the boy's fat belly spilled out onto the bed and his moobs sagged due to gravity. Silverly stretchmarks covered his gut and chest contrasting with this dark brown skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...\" Nick whispered to him. He felt his cock stir to life seeing what he and Ethan were doing to Diego. When Nick first torpedoed his best friend's diet, it was just because he thought it would be fun to watch Diego plump up again, to see if he would continue losing weight without Nick's help. But since Ethan revealed that he was intentionally fattening Diego up, and since he agreed to help the young man, Nick discovered the raw sexual excitement he received watching his best friend blimp up. Every photo Ethan sent of his boyfriend's chubby body drove Nick mad. This photo was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: <i>fuk Diego's getting fucking huge</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan: <i>yep. Were getting him massive ;)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: <i>do you know how much he weighs these days</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan: <i>dunno. Over 220? At least</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: <i>fukkk we're turning him into a blimp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan: <i>such a sexy blimp to</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: <i>lucky. you get to fuck him and I just have to jo to his pics</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan: <i>lol is that what you're doing now? Leemme see. ;P</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smirked. He turned on the camera to his phone and snapped a pic of the tent in his boxers due to his hard-on, sending it off to Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: <i>not yet lol</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan: <i>unf yummy. Sexy little belly you've got too. ;P</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: <i>filling out is fun. what can I say? ;P</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan: <i>how fat are you these days</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: <i>let me checm</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: <i>172. fuck no wonder I'm exploding out of my clothes.

At least three or four nights a week he was going out running for about an hour. Thanks to the added exercise in addition to Nick's persistence, Diego was slimming down even faster. All of his clothes fit better, he had more energy, and he was eating considerably less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, however, was doing quite the opposite. He would have the apartment for himself whenever Diego went out running, and the skater (if he can even be called that anymore since it had been some time since he actually went skating) took that time as an opportunity to absolutely pig out. Junk food, fast food, whatever he craved Nick engorged himself on it. And by the time Diego came back from his run, Nick's belly would be swollen and bloated, digesting thousands (and sometimes tens of thousands) of calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"161? Guess you're the fat one now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stood on the scale wearing only a pair of white briefs. A considerable belly had grown on his abdomen and was now sagging over the waistband of his underwear. His pecs puffed up to into two pillowy mounds of fat. The boy's thighs we're now padded out with lard; they tended to jiggle when he walked around the apartment. And his butt was ballooning up to the point that his underwear was always riding up and giving him a wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego had weighed himself right before and he tipped the scales at 159. He was now lighter than Nick. His belly was almost gone, and strong muscles were developing on his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get to the gym, eh?\" Diego said as he poked one of Nick's plump butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he wasn't sure that going to the gym was something he wanted to do. Over the past few months, Nick was actually liking what he saw in the mirror for the first time in his life. He enjoyed his body becoming soft and plump, how he was filling out, how his body was changing. It felts so right to Nick. He felt attractive. He felt sexier. He felt like he wanted to be fatter. No, he <i>needed</i> to get fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick bit his lip as he stood there in the bathroom with Diego. He considered telling Diego his plans to get larger. After all, he'd eventually notice Nick getting much, much fatter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The snacking continued for the next several weeks. Whenever Nick would see Diego, the boy would usually be surrounded by a pile of empty junk food wrappers and soda bottles. On top of that, Nick noticed that the meals Diego was making for himself were getting larger. Always a healthy eater, Nick's roommate was now making lunches and dinners that would easily feed a small family. For instance, he made enough spaghetti just for himself that it filled a salad bowl and covered it with an insane amount of cheese. With a fork and a loaf of garlic bread in tow, Diego took his dinner and ate it in the privacy of his bedroom. Nick didn't see any leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the additional calories Diego was consuming easily plumped him up another fifteen pounds, Nick estimated. The new weight went entirely to Diego's gut, now a sizeable mound of doughy flab that he didn't make any attempt to hide. His shrinking shirts showed off every curve of his belly as well as the dent of his bellybutton. The mass wobbled and shook whenever Diego plodded around the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys had been friends for years. And while Diego's weight fluctuated from time to time, Nick had never seen his friend this pudgy before, let alone devouring so much food on a daily basis. If Diego kept this up, he'd be double his size by this time next year, Nick calculated. The skater thought about addressing this with his roommate. Even if Diego didn't mind or care, Nick would feel a little better knowing that Diego is at least aware of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, Diego might be defensive and not want to talk about how fat he's getting. Nick may need to snoop behind Diego's back and try and figure out if something is going on with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr Nick just might want to leave Diego. So what if his best friend is getting a bit porky? It's not like it's having an impact on Nick's waistline.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The stomping of Diego's heavy footsteps and the characteristic squeak of the shower knobs let Nick know that his roommate would be busy in the shower for a little bit. The skater poked his head out the door of his bedroom. The bathroom door was shut and drizzling water could be heard from outside the door. No doubt Diego was letting the warm water spray on his painfully stuffed belly. Nick had seen Diego waddle into his bedroom an hour ago with a couple of bags of Mexican food from a local restaurant and he guessed that it was all now digesting in the boy's belly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over to Diego's bedroom, he saw that the door was open ajar. Nick carefully creeped out of his own bedroom and slowly nudged open his roommate's door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Nick noticed was all of the plates and wrappers and whatnot covering Diego's room. Normally tidy, his room was uncharacteristically messy with all of the remains of Diego's past conquests. Nick merely observed his best friend's room. He didn't dare touch anything unless Diego would notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiptoeing around, Nick peaked inside the garbage can by his computer desk. Inside were a few empty cartons of heavy whipping cream. Nick never saw those in the refrigerator. So Diego must have taken them directly into his room...to do what? And why? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's train of thought was interrupted when he saw the webcam mounted on Diego's desktop monitor which he didn't know his roommate had. He wasn't the kind of guy to Skype with anyone, so why did Diego now have what appeared to be a pretty high-quality webcam on his computer?l.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of short buzzes came from Diego's nightstand. The boy had left his phone behind, and now the light flashed on his phone, indicated that he just received a new text.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What the hell is...Expandr?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nick had turned on Diego's monitor, he saw that one of the many, many internet tabs that was open was for a site called Expandr. The skater was familiar with loads of weird website, but he had never heard of this one. He clicked on it and it brought up the home page for Expandr. It featured cartoon drawings of incredibly large men, many of whom had smaller, skinnier men touching their bellies or feeding them. \"A site for gainers, encouragers, and anyone who loves growing men!\" At the bottom of the page was a sign up button and a sign in button. Nick clicked the sign in button and two fields appeared: One asking for a username and the other asking for a password. The password field was blank, but the username field was autocompleted: doublindiego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Nick could look any further into this, he heard the shower turn off. Quickly, he minimized the window and shut off the monitor before quietly sneaking out of the room, doing a double-check to see if he left anything out of place. Assured that Diego wouldn't notice, he dashed off to his room and shut the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Nick was on his own computer searching Expandr. The site wouldn't allow non-users to enter, so he made up a blank profile (sk84lyf) and looked at the member's page. The first thing he saw were status updates from many of the users of the page, many of which were accompanied by thumbnails of photos of bodies ranging anywhere between skinny and obese and super muscular. Nick read through some of them as he scrolled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ntwink2twunk: <i>this butt is to big and too beautfil not to be played with right now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\njimrat: <i>need an obinent pig to worhsip these muscles</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\ndoughbroy: <i>anyone want to see me in my old wrestling singlet? had it before i blew up!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\ndoublindiego: <i>off to the shower! can't wait until i'm too big to fit it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing that last status update, Nick clicked on it. It was the same profile name he had saw while on Diego's computer. He was sent to doublindiego's page where there was a large profile photo of a deeply tanned torso with a chunky, soft belly and growing moobs. Nick skimmed through the profile's photos. One was of a pile of empty heavy whipping cream containers, another of a belly posed next to a salad bowl full of spaghetti, another photo of two very slender bodies next to each other, arms around each other's shoulders and cropped off below the neck. Nick clicked that photo, its caption read: \"From two years ago! Beach with the bestie! Too skinny!\" If Nick needed any more proof this was Diego's profile, this was it. Nick instantly recognized that the photo was of him and Diego from a summer trip they took with a group of friends to the beach a couple of years ago. Even if both of their faces were cropped out, he recognized his own body and the swim trunks he was wearing in the photo. Nick still had them somewhere in one of this drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the profile page, Nick saw that there were stats that Diego put up. Location: New Porthampton. Age: 21. Height: 5'9'. Weight: 173. Underneath the stats was a brief description Diego had written:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hi guys!! I'm Diego. I found this site a few months ago. I've always been fascinated with big guys, but now i realize I want to be a big guy myself! I don'tknow what my goal weight is, but its definately over 300 pounds. Probably way bigger! Feel free to message me!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lot for Nick to take it. First, he didn't know his best friend was into guys. Or maybe he's into guys too. The skater always had a suspicion that his friend wasn't entirely straight. But Diego apparently likes big guys too. A quick search through the list of member he was following including some absolutely massive guys, the biggest was 575 pounds! And Diego wanted to be one of them? This certainly explained why he was suddenly eating way, way more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sat at his computer, unsure of what he should do. On the one hand, Diego should be free to live his life as he wants to, even if it means getting massively fat. He seemed more than happy about putting on weight. On the other hand, maybe Nick didn't want to see his best friend eat himself to the point where he's a total blob. Diego couldn't possibly be happy if he's too big to get out of bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>doublindiego: <i>cant wait to hang out with pandapudge tonight! gonna get stuffed!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego had added that status update to his profile that morning. The day prior, he had mentioned to Nick that a friend of his was going over the next evening. \"Is it anyone that I know?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, he's...a friend from work,\" said Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Do you guys need the living room, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. We'll just hang out in my bedroom.\" Nick didn't ask anymore questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now he knew that Diego was meeting up with someone from Expandr. Nick had been secretly following his friend's profile for the past few weeks. His weight had bumped up to 185, and Diego had uploaded many more photos of his new girth. This included a photo of him in a shirt that was now skin tight on him and showed off his prominent belly. However, this was a sight Nick was used to. His roommate had gotten into the habit of walking around the apartment in ill-fitting shirts that did nothing to hide his belly which now jiggled significantly and stuck out far enough to droop over the waist of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 7pm, Nick was sitting alone in the living room watching a game show on television when Diego walked out of his bedroom to the front door. Nick got a peak of a love handle spilling out from under his shirt. Diego opened the door. \"Ty! You made it! Come on in! Glad you found the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked Ty, one of the heaviest guys Nick had ever seen. He was just about as tall as Diego, was Asian, and had pale skin and jet black hair that was a bit unkempt. But this boy was easily twice the size of Diego. His gut looked to be the size of a beach ball with two melon-sized moobs resting on top of it. His arms were pillow soft and his hands both were swollen with lard. The boy was wide enough that one of his flabby flanks brushed up against the door frame. Ty's enormous thighs fought to make their way past each other as he waddled into the apartment. Nick worried that the stomping of this enormous boy would anger his downstairs neighbors. Ty was dressed in a grey, tent-like shirt that hung over his belly and sweatpants that looked like they were struggled to stay around his wide waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy plodded into the apartment carrying a stuffed grocery bag in each of his pudgy hands. \"Take one! They're heavy!\" he said as he heaved one towards Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty, this is my roommate Nick. Nick, Ty,\" Diego said as he relieved him of one of the bags. Ty looked Nick up and down before giving him a silent nod. Nick noticed that he had a cute face, even if it was buried under chubby cheeks and a thick second chin. Nick nodded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, my room's this way!\" said Diego as he lead Ty down the hallway. As Ty waddled away, Nick caught a glimpse of his buttcrack before he reached behind and hoisted his enormous sweatpants back up his bulbous behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only several hours later when Nick was in his own room getting stoned that he heard Diego's bedroom door open up and the stomping of Ty as he made his way down the hall and out the front door. A few minutes later, he went back onto Expandr and looked up Diego's profile. A couple of new captioned pictures were posted including one of a piled of junk food wrappers (\"tonights conquest!\"), one of them rubbing bellies together (\"uff so hot!\"), and one of them standing side-by-side, with backs to the camera, Diego showing off his plump butt next to Ty's own rear which looked like two balloons filled with cottage cheese (\"before and after? i hope!\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photos were tagged, and Nick clicked on the link to Ty's own page. There, Nick found photos of Ty from various sizes. There was a photo of him, thin as a rail, on the bench next to a pretty girl who could have been an old girlfriend taken two years ago, there was a photo of him after his first hundred pounds gained in a ripped button up shirt, another with him eating an entire cake while on all fours, and another with Ty drinking a thick creamy substance that was being funneled into his mouth. Looking at his general profile, Ty's last weight update put him at 412 pounds. The only thing written in his profile was: <i>current weight: not big enough</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt compelled to message Ty over Expandr. He knew was he and Diego were up to. Maybe Nick could let them know that he's aware? Or maybe just general knowledge about what they're into? Or perhaps it's better to just leave things ago. Ty might go to Diego and tell him what's what.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Friday night and Ty stood at the door to Nick's apartment. In each of his meaty hands were two full bags of goods bought from the nearby grocery store. This was now a fairly common sight. For the past month or so, Ty had been over to the apartment at least twice a week. And each time Diego would answer the door, Ty would be there with loads of food, and the two of them would disappear behind Diego's bedroom door. If it wasn't already obvious to Nick what was going on behind the door, Diego's Expandr profile made it clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the week, Diego updated his weight. He was now sitting at 201 pounds, and it showed. Not only had Diego's gelatinous belly ballooned up even more, but his rump was swelling up into two considerable mounds. In celebration of the landmark, Diego uploaded a video to his profile. It was clear that Ty was the one behind the camera, and it featured Diego dressed only in a tight pair of briefs as Ty jiggled the boy's belly, pinched the growing moobs, slapped the widening butt, all while Diego was becoming viably excited. Ty, too, had plumped up. His weight was now at 421 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ty,\" Nick said when he answered the door. \"Diego's out of town for the weekend. There was a death in his family and he had to leave for the funeral. It was his great aunt, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn,\" said Ty, who was still huffing from having to haul his massive body up the stairs. \"I guess that's why he hasn't been texting back much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it happened Wednesday night. But I think he'll be back by Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright,\" the morbidly obese boy sighed as he tried to catch his breath again. \"Thanks for telling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you want to hang out around here for a little bit, I'll be cool with that. I'm just watching TV. They're playing Knives of Justice II.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Cool! Thanks!\" Ty trundled into the apartment. Setting the bags onto the coffee table, he lowered his massive body onto the couch, easily taking up two thirds of the space. The skater swore that he heard the couch creak under his weight. Ty then started unpacking the bags and setting out their contents. He had brought with him loads of deli items from the grocery store: Chicken strips, potato wedges, fries, corn dogs, deep fried burritos, and plenty ranch dressing for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sat down on the couch next to Ty. \"Hey, dig in. Anything you want is yours to eat!\" he said right before dosing a chicken strip in ranch and shoving it into his mouth. As the movie played, both boys ate silently. Nick was comfortably full, but Ty was going to town. He had pretty much eaten the entirety of all the food he brought with him by the time the film finished. As Ty shoved the last of the greasy burritos into his mouth, he left out a low, rumbling belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry,\" he apologized as he rubbed his stuffed belly. \"Normally I have Diego to help me take all this on. The boy's a champion eater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, yeah, I bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. Gettin' fat too, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's cheeks blushed when Ty said that. \"Uh, yeah, I guess. It's hard not to notice. He's pretty much, uh, exploding out of his wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy smirked. \"I guess I'm rubbing off on him, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is, um, that what happened to you?\" Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, kinda sorta,\" Ty began. \"Used to be super skinny. Met this girl, smoking hot. Turns out she liked big guys. Really big. She'd bring food into the bedroom and wouldn't let me finished until I'd stuffed myself. I blew up like a fucking balloon around her. 200 pounds in just over a year. Imagine how big I'd be if we were still together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's mind boggled at the idea of gaining that much weight so quickly. \"Why did you two break up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She left me for another guy. Super skinny guy, too. I imagine she's fattening him up too. Seems to be her thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you try to shake off the weight after you broke up?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did for a little bit, but then I stopped. I realized I loved being a big boy! It's amazing. Furniture breaks under me, I eat in one meal enough to feed a large family, I just take up so much space. There's just something so sexy and powerful about being this huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, you must be, like, three times my size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three times, going on four,\" Ty replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus! How big are you going to get?\" Nick said astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. 500 pounds minimum. I like the sound of Quarter Ton Ty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, that's massive!\" Nick said, practically picking his jaw up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's the point.\" Ty patted his massive gut before letting out an earthshaking belch. \"Ugh. Mind if I chill out here for a while? I think I need some time for all that food to settle.</span></div></div>",

He remembered his friend talking a few weeks back about one of his managers at Sonoma's who was also named Katie. Was this the same person? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading through more of the text exchanges confirmed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego: can't come in to work today. too fat to move :p<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie: not yet you are! Waddle your fat ass in here! Allie called in sick and we're short-handed today! I'll make it worth your while. I've got a cake that was made extra that ive set aside for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the exchanges were like this, mainly talking about Diego and his expanding waistline. He had also sent Katie many photos usually of his belly usually when it was stuffed to the brim. One photo, though, was of Diego showing off his backside which had ripped apart of his pants. This, apparently, drove Katie wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick heard the squeek of the shower knobs twisting. Diego was done and he'll be back in his room any moment now. Quickly, Nick the phone down, checked to see that everything else was still its place, and dashed off to his own bedroom shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it looked like Diego had caught the eye of one of his managers. And she's plumping him up. That would explain why Diego had been really packing it on recently. The boy hadn't been that successful with the ladies, and Nick had no problem believing that he would do something for a girl who liked him, even if it meant getting fat. But how fat? Nick worried that this Katie girl is taking advantage of Diego. After all, they talked about Diego getting absolutely massive, insanely obese. He needed to talk with Diego about this. Sure, he'll be mad that Nick looked through his phone. But he doesn't want to see his best friend being manipulated into getting grossly overweight because a pretty girl wants him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Nick thought about investigating things further. Maybe this isn't what things appear to be. He could drop by Sonoma's, strike up a conversation with Katie, and get her general vibe.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The conversation did not go well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego was absolutely furious that Nick had snooped in his texts. Whenever he would try and get a word in edgewise, Diego would steamroll over him saying that it was a violation of his privacy. Nick didn't even get a chance to talk about Diego's weight gain or the fact that Katie wants to get him massive. Diego seemed to be dodging the topic altogether, and always shifted the argument back to Nick's wrongdoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Friday evening following, Diego left the apartment with a small suitcase in tow. He slammed the door to the apartment behind him; he hadn't told Nick where he was going and when he'll be back. First, Nick wasn't too worried. Diego probably needed some time alone. Saturday passed, and Diego was still not back. It was only until Sunday evening rolled around that Diego returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was sitting in the living room as he heard the clinking of keys and the sounds of the front door unlocking. Diego waddled into the apartment, and Nick immediately noticed that his friend's gut was more pronounced, wobbled and jiggled more than before. Diego's jeans were unbuttoned but held up by his thickened waist. His tits appeared to be larger and stretched the torso of his shirt. The skater wondered what the hell Diego had been up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey. Where were you all weekend?\" Nick asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie's.\" This was the one-word answer Diego gave before plodding off to his bedroom for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego was still extremely mad at Nick. Even though he felt like he had good reasons to spy on Diego, he began coming around to the idea that he was wrong and that Nick ought to do something to make it to Diego. Maybe he could meet Katie, talk with her, and see if she could help the situation. But Nick still thought that he had good intentions. And if Diego wasn't willing to see his side of the argument, why should Nick apologize?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick and Diego gave each other the silent treatment for the following months, each only talking to the other when it was absolutely necessary. Diego was still furious at Nick, and Nick thought that Diego was too obstinate to see why he did what he did in the first place. Their friendship was certainly at an impasse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat gave the skater relief were Friday nights when Diego would leave carrying the same small suitcase with him each time. He'd be gone for the weekend, presumably at Katie's, and returned Sunday night. Nick enjoyed this time. It gave him the freedom to roam about his own apartment without worrying about bumping into Diego or having to ignore his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single weekend Diego spent at Katie's, Nick saw he was perspectively fatter. When Diego returned the previous Sunday, he came waddling into the apartment in sweatpants having given up on jeans weeks ago. They clung to his pillowly thighs and ass, an ass that looked like Diego shoved two large melons in the back of his pants. His belly was now the size of a medicine ball and appeared doughy. It was now starting to sag over the waistband of his sweats. His moobs were now at the point where they would make most girls jealous of their size. And Diego's boyish face had filled out; a second chin was sprouting. Nick guess his best friend was close to 250, nearly a hundred pounds piled up on his body since meeting Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Sunday, Nick is getting ready for bed. As usual, Diego went off to Katie's place on the Friday before, but it was getting really late on Sunday and he hadn't returned. Nick knew that Diego worked the next morning. Since both he and Katie worked at the same place, he figured that Diego probably spent another night there and was planning on going in with her the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nick came home from work that Monday evening, there was no sign that Diego had come home either. He went to Diego's bedroom and knocked on it. With no reply, he peaked inside to see that his best friend wasn't there. Nick began to worry. He grabbed his phone and dialed up Diego. It went straight to his voicemail. He tried again several times but with the same results. Any texts that Nick tried to send weren't going through either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Nick was panicking. His best friend might be in some serious trouble, and he felt a sense of duty to help Diego, even if they were no longer on speaking terms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater thought about what to do. Obviously, Katie was a person of interest. He knew she worked with Diego at Sonoma's and could stop by there tomorrow to ask if she knew anything about Diego. But if she had anything to do with Diego's disappearance, then she wouldn't tell him anything useful. Although it got him in trouble last time, Nick considered searching Diego's room for clues. There might be something in there that would tell Nick where he might be. Or maybe Nick is overthinking things. Sure, Diego hadn't come back yet. But he's an adult and doesn't need to check in with Nick. He could give Diego a few more days and, if he still hadn't returned, start searching for him.</span></div></div>",

His room remained untouched; his food in the fridge was uneaten. Every call Nick made went straight to voicemail and all his texts bounced back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sat on the living room couch thinking about what to do next. His best friend had been gone for nearly a week without letting him know where he was going or how long he would be gone. He assumed Diego had went to Katie's place like he had all the previous weeks before. But he had no clue where she lived. He knew where Katie worked, but if she had anything to do with Diego's disappearance then Nick would get no information anyways. He'd have to use some detective skills to figure out where she lived and find out if Diego was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how embarrassing would it be to break down the door to Katie's place only to find Diego is perfectly fine, or that she was up to nothing at all.

At least, that's was the investigators told Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it had been a week and a half since he last saw Diego, Nick realized that it was time to finally take action. He called the police and told them what had happened. A missing persons report later and cops were at the apartment looking for any hints as to what happened to Diego. Nothing stood out. Even searching through his internet history and phone records told investigators nothing useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Nick was interviewed by the police, then many of Diego's coworkers. According to the detective working the case, Katie absolutely lost it when they told her Diego was missing. Yet again, nobody produced any valuable information that would help investigators figure out where Diego was. Posters went up, news segments aired, but still nothing came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks eventually turned to months. During that time, Diego's family came by and picked up all of his things from the apartment. Nick felt obligated to help the distraught family as they boxed up their missing sons possession. Eventually, Nick was forced to move out since there was no way for him to cover rent on his own. His parents welcomed him back and gave him a place to stay while he worked, saved up money, and searched for a new place to live all while keeping the hope alive that one day Diego would return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hope faded years later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears? Years. It must have been years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the only way he could tell the passage of time was with the help of the television mounted to the ceiling above his bed, he reasoned that at least three years have passed. Three times have the programming on the channeling slowly transitioned over to Christmas movies and holiday episodes, many of which he had seen during his childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe usually left the television on the same channel. The remote sat on a table next to his king-sized bed, but just the effort to raise his arm and reach for it was exhausting. His arm, heavily laded with lard and atrophied to the extreme, was almost too much of a burden now even for that small of a task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least that now means the ropes weren't necessary. He hated them. They rubbed and chaffed against his wrists and ankles. But when it became obvious that the sheer girth of his limbs was enough to pin him down to the bed, the ropes became superfluous.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe glanced over to the door, the only exit to his room. Had doors ways been that narrow? Would he even be able to fit through it, even sideways, if his legs weren't so useless?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frame of the bed started to creak slightly. This was happening more and more. He was told that eventually his matress will just have to sit on the cold concrete floor. He hated that idea. His enormous body was already spilling over the sides of his mattress and he didn't want his flanks touching that freezing cold surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed frame creaked again. It was reinforced, he was told. It was supposed to be able to handle at least a half ton. He couldn't be that gigantic, could he? He wished he could tell. But at his size, nearly all scales would shatter under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door squeaked opened and he saw her strutting towards him. Sexy, as always, clad only in her panties. She was as hot as the day they met. The sight of her sultry curves got him hard. It would take some digging and maneuvering but she could eventually find his manhood under the folds and rolls to satisfy his needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the room was ice cold, there was no need for her to wear anything at all. Were she cold, all she needed to do was mount his mountain of flab and sink in. His large body emitted more than enough heat to keep her warm. She spent many nights using his chest as two huge pillows and his flab as a blanket during colder winter months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached his bedside, cupping one of his comically rounded cheeks in her hand. With the other hand, she detached a hose from a mount hanging on the wall behind the bed. The hose reached up to the ceiling of the room and disappeared. He didn't know where it went, and he didn't know what it always held. It always was a thick, creamy concoction. Yet sometimes it was chocolatey, vanilla other times, strawberry if he was good, and an indescribable greasy taste if he was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the noozle of the hose and held it up to his mouth. \"Feeling hungry, Diego?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always, Katie.\"</span></div></div>",

He had just gotten off of work and rode his way over to the boutique bakery to see if he could learn more about Katie and figure out if she had any bad intentions for Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell rang as Nick opened the bakery door. Even though many of the display cases were empty, the air inside lingered with odors of freshly baked bread and sweets. At one of the counters was a woman Nick guesses was either in her late 20's or early 30's. She had short brown hair she kept tied back, and skin that was slightly tanned. The woman had a pretty, tomboyish face. She was lend, small in the chest yet had wide hips that flared out which gave her a kind of bottom heavy hourglass shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was filling out paperwork with stacks of bills and coins in front of her. Hearing the bell, she looked up, her bright green eyes meeting Nick's blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I'm sorry, sir. We actually closed twenty minutes ago,\" she apologized. \"I guess I forgot to lock the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's alright,\" Nick replied. \"I was just stopping by to check out the place. My, uh, best friend works here and I've never been. He told me I should come by one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Who's your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diego Hernandez. He started working here a few months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face lit up. \"I love Diego! He's such a hard worker! Well, except when he's trying to sneak tastes of the frosting. Are you...Nate? No, Nick? Diego's talked a lot about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it's Nick!\" He reached across the counter to shake her hand which was silky smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Katie! I'm one of the managers here, typically looking over the afternoon shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you don't work with Diego?\" Nick asked. \"He works the morning shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see him a few hours during the day. He's usually getting off not long after I get on. I've been trying to steal him from the morning crew. I need a reliable guy like him working the daytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's good to know he's doing a good job then,\" Nick said. He glanced at the counter and saw the paperwork she was working on. \"I guess I should leave you to your work then. Don't want to distract you for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it. I'm nearly done here,\" Katie reassured Nick. \"Maybe you should stop by sometime when were open. We got tons of tasty stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should,\" Nick replied. \"Diego sometimes brings stuff home, but I only get a taste before he eat it all himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie chuckled. \"Yep. Sounds like Diego. In that case, are you a fan of strawberry?\" Nick nodded vigorously. Katie disappeared to the back, reemerging several minutes later with a large white box. \"Here, take this and hide it from Diego when you get home! Someone ordered a strawberry cake for a birthday but we had to remake it because we iced the wrong name on it. Did you know that there are some people named Kevin who spell it with a Q, and they expect other people to just know that? Crazy, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's... bizarre.\" Nick took the box from Katie. \"But yeah, I'll be sure to get a slice before Diego gets at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully more than just one slice,\" Katie said as she quickly eyes Nick up and down. \"And maybe I'll be seeing more of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego was napping in his room when Nick got home. He set the box on the kitchen counter and pulled out a small plate from the cabinets and a knife from a drawer. Lifting open the lid, Nick saw the white and pink cake, a distinct aroma of strawberry coming off of it. Nick eagerly grabbed for the knife but noticed a scrap of paper in the box with something scribbled on it. It had Katie's name and number on it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sat in the living room eating a large slice of the delicious strawberry cake as he wondered what to do with the number. Katie seemed nice enough, and she was extremely cute. But Nick still wasn't quite sure what she was up to fattening Diego up. Or why she had gave him her number in the first place. He could send her a text talking about Diego and perhaps she'll drop some clues about their relationship. But maybe that was too obvious.

The moment they walked inside, Diego made a beeline for the food court and was now walking with a large chocolate milkshake in one hand and a couple of absurdly large cookies in the other. His stomach was bloated to the put that his white shirt was riding up and exposing the button of his pants which now looked ready to burst apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Diego passed by Chapman's, a discount clothing store in the mall. \"Oh! Oh! I just remembered!\" Diego piped up. \"I need to pick up some more work clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, having seen how tight Diego's pants were, had no reason to doubt that. \"Alright. Do you just want to get what you need and we'll meet up here later? Does an hour sound like enough time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does. I already pretty much know exactly what I need.\" Diego disappeared inside the store. Nick resumed lazily strolling around the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an hour to burn, Nick figured that he might pop into a store and look around. He had no intention of buying anything, but he figured there would be no harm in window shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was GamePortal, a chain video game store. Nick hadn't gotten a new game for his console in a while. It might be worth it to stop in and see what has come out recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also Decksters. It was a decent skateboard shop. Nick didn't care much for it since their actual skateboard decks weren't that great, but it was a pretty good place if you needed something basic in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a new nutrition store that just opened up: GMD. They sold various nutritional supplements, powders, vitamins, and whatnot. As Nick walked past, he saw two hulking guys talking over enormous jugs of protein powder.</span></div></div>",

He was never much of a big eater, but weed always gave him the appetite that he lacked. Today, though, Nick was absolutely starving. The skater's stomach groaned and gurgled has he tore through the cupboards, pantry, and fridge for something to sate his voracious hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the counter was a long white box with a familiar logo on it. Doughnuts, and lots of them. Diego had gotten a new job at a local artisian bakery called Sonoma's a couple of months ago doing prep work in the back. He and Nick used to work together, but Diego took the new job since it paid considerably more. The downside, as Nick saw it, was that Diego had to wake up at the crack of dawn to make his shift. Nevertheless, the job came with its unique perks, and Nick was looking at one of them. Every once in a while, Diego would come home with various day-old goods they couldn't sell. Peaking inside the box, it looks like the had a whole bunch of doughnuts they didn't sell and Diego got to take a bunch of them home. Nick knew that Diego was napping and probably wouldn't mind if he took one...or two...or ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through the kitchen cabinets, Nick saw several boxes of Mac and Cheese. The last time he went grocery shopping they were on sale and he went a little crazy and bought half a dozen. Perhaps this was a good thing since a giant bowl of cheese and pasta did sound good right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick absentmindedly rubbed his bare, flat stomach as he glanced into the freezer to see if there was anything to cook up. There wasn't much there except bags of frozen vegetables and cartons of ice cream. He thought about absolutely destroying one of those for breakfast and kept that in the back of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging from the fridge by magnets were loads of coupons from some neighborhood restaurants. Nick noticed that there was an offer for some dirt cheap pizza from DeNiccilo's, the Italian place down the street. They deliver, so he could order something from there. Or maybe Nick was in the mood for Chinese food from the Jade Panda. It had been a while since he had any.</span></div></div>",

Nick's lips were covered in crumbs and sugar, his belly swollen considerably. Seeing the carnage, Diego shoved his roommate awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I guess I did,\" Nick said. \"I figured you would mind that much. But they're so damn good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mind,\" Diego replied. \"I mean, I was going to have one or two for breakfast, but I'll find something else.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Opening the door to his apartment after a long day at work, Nick walked in and spotted a familiar box waiting for him on the kitchen counter. It was a white box with the Sonoma's bakery logo on it in black ink. The skater smiled as he picked up the picked up the box. Heavier than usual, he peaked inside to find that this time, the large box was filled to the brim with doughnuts. At least a dozen and a half were crammed in there. Nick happily shut the lid and took his treats with him into his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch began what was now a routine for Nick. At Nick's request, Diego was bringing home any day-old doughnuts from the bakery when he came back from his morning shift. Diego didn't mind, and management were happy to see him take them home rather than having to throw them away. He would leave the box on the counter for Nick, occasionally taking one or two for himself but mainly leaving most for the skater. Nick would then come home from work, grab the box, and take it into his room where he'd chill out, get stoned, and devour the delicious treats usually as a pre-dinner snack. The actual amount of doughnuts Diego brought how varied from day to day, but it was always at least a half dozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however, Nick hit the jackpot. This was the most Diego ever brought back for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick pulled off his shoes and shirts then yanked his work shirt over his head. He reached down to unbutton his pants and sighed in relief. His work jeans were starting to get unbearably tight, and each morning he fought to clasp them up with the soft growing mound of pudge that was appearing on his midsection. Nick was largely oblivious to the changes to his body, the belly that was sprouting, how his butt was filling  out, and (least obvious him) how the thousands of calories worth of sugar and butter he was consuming each day was grinding his metabolism to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the jeans to the floor, Nick, rubbed the bright red marks on his waist from his pants clinging tightly to him. He  prepped his bong, smoked a bit, then plopped down his bed, his tummy jiggly slightly as he did so. Laying the box next to him, Nick opened it up and grabbed the first doughnut he saw and became greedily eating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours laters, the box was empty and Nick's belly was fully of the surgery treats. He threw the box onto his desk where, instead of skateboard decks and trucks now lie a pile of empty doughnut boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull, but not stuffed to the brim, Nick wanted something savory to eat to counteract all the sweets he just inhaled. He found a pair of loose shorter and a shirt which clung tightly to his bloated stomach and put those on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Diego was fixing himself something to eat for dinner. He couldn't help but notice the distinct curve of Nick's belly as his best friend searched through the kitchen for something to eat. Undoubtedly a result of all the treats he was bringing home from work, Diego didn't say anything about Nick's recent growth. Instead, he had an interesting piece of news for Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my manager has caught on to all the day-old doughnuts I've been bringing home,\" said Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh?\" Nick replied as he looked through the pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing bad. It's actually good. They asked about it and I told them I was bringing them all back for my roommate. Doughnuts haven't been selling as well, so my manager to glad to hear that someone was enjoying them. You know, because it doesn't mean we're making a nasty tasting product. And because they can't stand to see good food go to waste. Anyways, they asked me to tell you that you're welcome to stop by anytime so they can properly thank you.\"</span></div></div>",

The skater rubbed a hand careful over his bare belly; he had discarded his pants and shirt long ago and was lying down in bed in just his boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had made an ungodly amount of Mac and Cheese. Seized by his hunger, he ended up cooking there entire boxes and added loads of chesses. The end result was a mass of cheese and carbs which nearly filled up an entire salad bowl. At first, Nick though about ending only some and saving the rest for later. But that idea was scrapped as his fork scraped the bottom of the bowl just one hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Nick was in bed, pinned down by the food churning away in his belly. The boy was so full that it was painful for him to even roll on his side. He had never been this bloated and full in his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other side of his bedroom door, Nick could hear his roommate Diego stirring from a nap. It would be embarrassing, but he could call for his friend to somehow help him in this situation. Or, if Nick could make it to the bathroom, a hot shower might soothe his belly. But that required movement and Nick wasn't sure he was capable of that. Maybe his best solution would be to try and nap it off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dude, what the hell did you do to yourself?\" Diego asked as he glimpsed Nick impossibly bloated belly. The skater was clad only in his underwear pinned down to his bed, his belly appeared like a tan basketball attached to his thin frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got high and overdid it in the kitchen,\" Nick moaned. \"I'm so full it hurts! It feels like I'm going to explode! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. I'll see if there's any medicine that I might have that'll help.\" Diego disappeared for a few minutes to return with a glass of water. Two white tablets were bubbling and fizzing in the liquid. \"Okay, I think this ought to help.\" He sat down on the bed next to Nick, who propped himself up on his elbows as best as he could. Diego brought the glass to his friend's mouth as Nick took tiny sips. As the skater drank the liquid, Diego could hear his belly groan and creak in protest as it was being filled up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the glass, Nick collapsed on the bed moaning. Churning and gurgling could be heard from his bloated belly as the medicine went to work. Diego eyed his friend's belly and wondered how the boy hadn't popped. Never before had he seen a belly so stuffed full, and never before had he been a stomach so round and big on a guy so skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought entered Diego's mind. Carefully, he reached out his left hand and gently rested it atop of Nick's engorged belly. The skater hissed slightly in pain for a moment. Diego gently began rubbing the swollen mass that was Nick's belly, who moaned as fingers softly caressed his spherical stomach and encircled his bellybutton. After a few minutes of rubbing, loud groans sounded from Nick's abdomen, and shortly thereafter a loud, earthshaking burp erupted from Nick. The skater sighed in relief as more smaller burps escaped him. Diego could feel the boy's belly deflating slightly and feel brave enough to press his fingers deeper into the mound which evoked deeper moans from Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour had passed, and Diego continued rubbing his friend's distended gut now with both hands. Nick said nothing. The only noises that came from him were stifled burps. Eventually, the skater fell asleep and started to snore softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared that Diego's job was done; his best friend was no longer is terrible pain. He quietly got off the bed being sure not to jostle Nick awake. That's when he noticed the tent that formed in Nick's boxers. Apparently, Nick enjoyed the belly rubs way more than Diego realized. He never thought that a belly rub might make someone so aroused, let alone someone like Nick. Diego noted what he saw, wondering if Nick had been aware of what was stirring below his waist the whole time before exiting the bedroom to let Nick rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of awkwardness hung in the apartment. Nick felt embarrassed that he had eaten himself into the situation he was in last Saturday. But Nick was also feeling embarrassed about the belly rubs. No doubt, they felt amazing on his stuffed belly. Yet the moment Diego placed his hands on Nick's inflated abdomen, his manhood became instantly erect. He had hoped that Diego didn't see anything, that his boxers hid his excitement somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed as he was, the whole experience did excite him in a way he had felt before. All throughout the following week, Nick's thoughts drifted toward getting incredibly stuffed, being so full of food, and then getting rubbed down, having a set of hands on his gut be they Diego's or anyone elses. And usually these thoughts caused Nick to be quite aroused again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind began scheming. He wanted that experience again. Just once more, just one more time to feeling that mix of intense pain and euphoric pleasure. Once more, and Nick would be sure he'll be over it. Diego seemed fairly willing to caress Nick's gut the last time. Maybe he could figure out a way to get him to do it again? But if Diego really saw how excited Nick got, his best friend might be too weirded out to be so helpful once more. Then again, maybe he could plan something with another friend, or maybe a coworker, someone else he can trick or persuade to rub and caress a bloated gut. However, Nick realized, this was a bizarre fantasy. He should just push it out of his mind before he creeps out someone else.</span></div></div>",

His doughy belly and saggy moobs stretched out his polo shirt, and his black slacks looked as if they were painted on to his thunder thighs and tremendous rear. When Nick opened the door, he guessed the delivery guy was well over twice Nick's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, question,\" the delivery boy said. \"Did you go to Clarfield High School?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did,\" replied Nick. He handed back the receipt as he took the medium pizzas from the driver. One of the coupons on the fridge was a 2-for-1 deal and Nick wasn't going to pass that up. \"Graduated a few years ago. Barely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I remember you. Were in Mr. Montgomery's English class senior year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, physically I was there.\" Nick scanned his face and tried to remember if he recognized the guy. He didn't remember any guys quite as big as him in his English class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt Boomington, remember? We were assigned to do a few group projects together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder Nick didn't recognize him at first. Upon reflection, he did recognize Matt. But sometime between graduation and now, he must have ballooned up. Back in high school, Matt had been pretty trim and muscular having spent a couple of years on the wrestling team. Nick remembered occasionally checking Matt out when he was too bored with the lesson. Matt was certainly easy on the eyes, and Nick did enjoy seeing him pick something up off the ground so he could sneak a peak as his thick butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, however, had seriously let himself go. His firm pecs were now flabby moobs, a soft sphere of pudge covered his once-flat abdomen, strong quads were now jiggly tree trunks, and his formerly firm, round butt looked like two volleyballs made of jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh yeah,\" Nick said. \"Sorry, it took me a moment to remember you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries,\" Matt said. \"I mean, I do look a bit, uh, different than I did in high school.\" He lightly patted his gut for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you said it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled. \"Yeah, blame it on DeNiccilo's. I started working there after I graduated. My aunt owns the places and needed help getting it off the ground after she bought it from the previous owners. Let's just say that she padded out my paycheck with pizza more times than a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. But you're still delivering pizzas?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm actually the assistant manager now. I'm filling in for one of my drivers who called in sick today,\" explained Matt. \"It's nice to get out of the restaurant every once in a while.\" Suddenly, Matt's phone went off. He stuck his plump hand into his pocket and pulled it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\" Matt said after reading the text. \"Parsley emergency. My aunt needs me to make a quick run for more. Better get on that. Oh, and hey.\" He took out a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbled his phone number on one of the pizza boxes. \"Shoot me a text sometime! I've been meaning to reconnect with people from high school. Got to go!\" He quickly turned around and waddle down the hallway. Nick watched as the two globes of fat that made up Matt's butt wobble as he moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: dude the pizza was gr8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater hit the send button as he swallowed down the final slice of the second pizza. The entirety of his day had been spent devouring the greasy slices while lazing about in his underwear in bed while watching television on his laptop. Specks of orangish grease dotted his chest, mouth, and painfully full stomach. Nick didn't intend to eat both pizzas. But as he mindlessly ate slice after slice, he was unaware of how much he had consumed until he grabbed the final slice. His flat stomach was so bloated that it seemed as if he was a few months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt texted him back a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: i know, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: first month working had a large every night for dinner. by myself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: i dont blame you. iwoild too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: already ate bth pizzas<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: Jesus, really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: didnt think a skinny guy like u coud eat like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: we should hang out and you can show me how you pack it all in;p<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick:</span></div></div>",

You don't look so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing the final piece of pizza crust into his mouth, Nick leaned back onto the couch, moaning as he gently rubbed a hand on his swollen stomach. Matt's eyes widened as the skater pulled up his shirt, exposing the tight, tan-skinned globe it had become thanks to the pizza he gorged himself on. The previously flat abdomen was now quite spherical and looking as if Nick had swallowed a basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days ago, Matt had invited Nick over to his place to hang out and catch up. Apprehensive at first, Nick was persuaded to come thanks to the promise of DeNiccilo's pizza. More than enough for both of them, Matt assured him. Tuesday was one of Matt's nights off, so the skater agreed to come over after work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour enormous pizza boxes sat on the coffee table as Matt showed Nick into his home. Managing a success Italian restaurant paid well enough for Matt to afford a modest home of his own where he lived by himself. Hence why he answered the door in very causal attire: A black tank top that clung to every roll, curve, and fold of his flabby torso and midsection, and a pair of green gym shorts which had their high school emblem on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I held onto them after I graduated,\" Matt said when Nick pointed out the logo. \"They've got a lot of stretch in the waist.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not in the back,\" Nick thought to himself as he followed Matt inside. The shorts were tight against the former wrestler's wide rump leaving little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to think of it, they let me keep a lot after I left,\" Matt continued. \"I think I still have one or two of my singlets around, not like I'll be wearing those anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSat in the living room, the two boys talked about their lives since high school while the television played in the background. Soon, however, they talked less and focused more on eating. Nick wanted to show Matt that a skinny guy like him (maybe with the help of a little weed) can still pack it away. Besides, Nick remembered how impressed the wrestler was when he texted him about eating two pizzas in one sitting, so he figured he needed to show Matt this in person. When Matt caught on, he too picked up the pace and began devouring the pizza at a rate of two slices for every one Nick consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe informal eating contest ended when Nick snagged the last remaining slice from the fourth pie and stuffed it into his mouth, unaware (or unconcerned) with how incredibly full he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now there he was, moaning as his belly creaked and groaned as it struggled to digest the thousands or tens of thousands of calories currently sitting in his gut. Matt, who was no doubt full but not as much as Nick, cautiously leaned over and placed a plump hand on Nick's bare stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, hey sir, when's the baby due?\" he asked jokingly. Nick lazily slapped Matt's hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I think I'm going to burst,\" Nick whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look so great,\" Matt began. \"I have no problem if you want to crash on my couch tonight and sleep all that off. It doesn't look like you're well enough to head home on your own anyways.\"</span></div></div>",

Sliding a hand over his stomach, he still felt somewhat bloated from the night before though he appeared to have deflated considerably. Nick rubbed his eyes and glanced out the living room window and saw the bright sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked, he grabbed for his phone. The clock on it read 11:32am; Nick should have been at work over two hours ago! His phone had been flooded with missed called from his boss, and a new voicemail was waiting for him telling Nick that he was fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fired?\" ask Matt as he began frying up an entire package of bacon for him and Nick, who sat at the kitchen table looking despondent. \"For being late once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it may have been twice,\" Nick replied. \"Or four times. I think I lost count. I dunno. I'm just worried now because rent's due next week and I don't know if I'll be able to find another job in time to cover share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt thought for a moment, his hand reached under his tank top to scratch his pudgy belly. \"Now that I think about it, I do know a place that's hiring and needs help fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Where?\" Nick asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DeNiccilo's!\" Matt replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I can't work there. I've never worked at a restaurant before. I don't know how to cook or be a waiter or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have to. We need someone to work back of house. Doing simple prep work, dishwashing, restocking the kitchen, stuff like that. I can even have you start tonight if you want. All you need to do is fill out some forms and that's it. You're a shoe-in. You know the manager, after all.\" Matt then winked at Nick as he began piling up cooked bacon onto a plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lucky strike for Nick, going from unemployed to being offered a job in a matter of hours. And it's at DeNiccilo's, so he'll be around delicious food all the time, which is certainly a perk. However, he might be able to find a better job if he looked first. Hopefully, Matt's offer with still be good in a few days.</span></div></div>",

The skater didn't have anything planned for his free Sunday evening, so he accepted the invitation. Matt texted him when his shift was up, and Nick waited for outside his house. Being the manager of a successful Italian restaurant paid well enough for him to afford a modest home he lived in by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSat on the stairs to the front porch, Nick was playing a mobile game on his phone when Matt pulled up. Out of his car he pulled out a few pizza boxes that Nick offered to carry as the larger boy opened the door to his house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I'd change after getting home from work, but I'm so hungry I don't want to wait!\" Matt took off his jacket, kicked off his shoes, and turned television in his living room on. He was wearing a white button-up shirt and black slacks, no doubt formal attire was needed when managing a place like DeNiccilo's. The moment Nick set the boxes down on the coffee table, Matt opened one up and tore into a slice. Nick soon joined him, and both boys watched television as they munched away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling the effects from the night before, Nick didn't go crazy on pizza. This left plenty for Matt, and he plowed through one box, then another, and worked on the third after making sure Nick had his fill. Out of the corner of his eye, Nick watched Matt stuff himself silly. Even though he was on the other end of the couch, Nick saw that all the food in Matt's belly was causing it to swell up massively. His shirt, which wasn't very loose to begin with, was stretched against Matt's stomach. Patches of pale flesh could be seen between the buttons that were struggling to contain his girth. The button on his slacks was being tested in equal measure. Oblivious or apathetically, Matt continued on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA satisfied smirk appeared on Matt's face when he devoured the final slice of the last pizza. He sighed comfortably as he patted his belly. Just then, the button on his slacks explodes off, sailing off to the opposite end of the living room. The flaps of his pants spread apart as the boy's gut sunk down, forcing the teeth of his zipper apart. Matt glanced over at Nick to see if he noticed. The wide eyed expression on his face showed that he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops...\" Matt said, he cheeks started to blush. \"I guess that was bound to happen. I've been meaning to get some bigger pants for some now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And some bigger shirts, too?\" asked Nick, his eyes on the overworked buttons on Matt's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, shirts too.\" Matt partially unbuttoned his shirt, relieving pressure from those buttons and exposing more of his belly fat. \"God, I really overdid it, didn't I?\" He gestured to the empty pizza boxes, much of which he consumed on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you did, Matt. Why did you bring so many home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you'd eat way more. Wouldn't feel guilty about eating a pizza if you're eating two.\" Matt let out a heavy sigh. \"God, I need to get control of myself. Get my fat ass back to the gym. Get on a fucking diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be good,\" Nick said. \"Have you tried dieting before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once. About a year ago. Lost five pounds, went on a cheat day and never got back on it. Safe to say those five pounds made it back on.\" Matt slapped his gut for emphasis. It jiggled, but only slightly on account of being so full. \"I haven't even been on a scale in over a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's time to hop back on it then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point? I'll see what a fatty I am and go back on a diet then eat all the junk food in the house and be right back to square one.\"</span></div></div>",

It was of him at the gym. He was posing in front of one of the walls of mirrors wearing stretching grey shorts and a black sleeveless shirt that showed off his flabby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: cool. now get that fat ass on the treadmill<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: okay, yessir. :p<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving the last of the candy into his mouth, Nick crushed the wrapper into a ball and tossed it in the direction of his garbage can. It bounced off of the wrappers and bags that was overflowing in the bin and landed on a pile of DeNiccilo's boxes. The candy bar, the boxes, the can full of wrappers, these were all conquests from the incentives Matt gave Nick to help keep him motivated while on his diet. The former wrestler purged his kitchen of any and all junk food and gave it over to Nick. It amounted to five large grocery bags. Chips, cookies, snack cakes, candy, and the like. Additionally, each evening Matt would send over one of his delivery drivers to Nick's apartment to drop him off a meal. Nick never asked for food, but he took whatever Matt was charitable enough to give. \"It's either I eat it or you do!\" he reasoned. Some days, Nick got a sizable pizza. Other times, it was a pasta dish or two. All of these would eventually make their way into the skater's belly. Nick had occasionally offer Diego some, but he passed. Diego had never been much of a fan of Italian food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: and dont forget the squats<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sent the text and dragged himself into the kitchen again. Another candy bar sounded good right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says...339...No, wait...340...Uh, it's bouncing between the two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood in his red boxer briefs as Nick checked the scale. His belly was still to large for him to read the numbers on his own. But when he heard how little progress he made, he looked dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? I didn't even lose a pound?\" he said exasperatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you may have lost, like, half a pound,\" Nick reassured Matt as he tugged down on his shirt. The weeks of carbs and cheese and sugar was bloating Nick up. His flat abdomen now had a distinct curve to it, and his pants were getting tougher to button up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I did everything that I should do to lose weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything?\" Nick inquired. \"Exercise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Went to the gym at least three times a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stopped eating at work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. That's why I've been sending you all those meals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut back on junk food?\" Matt stayed silent. \"Did you cut back on junk food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, maybe?\" Matt replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick let out a heavy sigh. \"Alright, let's go to the kitchen then.\" He followed the bulky boy as he waddled downstairs and into the kitchen, his bare flab wobbling as he moved. Matt threw open several of the cabinets. Inside were loads of chips and cookies and much of the same things that Nick had taken off Matt's hands weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I slipped up a little!\" Matt pleaded. \"I got a hankering for some cookies, so I bought a box. It was one box! The next thing I know, I'm back at the grocery store filling up a shopping cart with all this junk again!\" Another heavy sigh came from Nick as he closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. \"I'm sorry! Please don't be mad! It was one slip up! I promise! I'm entitled to one screw up, aren't I? I'll give you all this crap food! And whatever more you want from DeNiccilo's!

Instinctively, the skater reached over and muted the call. Minutes later, the phone buzzed again. He groggily reached again for his phone and looked at who was calling him at this late an hour. It was Matt who was calling him. Once more, Nick hit the ignore button as he laid back in bed, a hand resting on his stomach which, now that he wasn't stuffing himself full of junk food and free meals from Italian restaurants, was now back in its usual flat form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly half a year had past since Nick quit helping Matt on his weight loss journey. Sure, he had slipped up once but wasn't all interested in being someones dietitian. So when Matt got busted cheating on a diet he convinced Nick to help him with, the skater quit. Matt was extremely upset and yelled at Nick until he left the house. There had been radio silence between the two since then. And Nick was fine with that. Matt wasn't really a close friend, more of an acquaintance. He had no problem dropping people who would behave so hostilely when experiencing the consequences of their actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Nick's phone erupted. Text after text after text was being sent to him. The first included a picture. In it, Matt was standing nude in front of a bathroom mirror. His belly was noticeably larger. Stretch marks covered it as it hung far down covering up most of his manhood. Girthy rolls had formed along his flanks, and his moobs sagged and drooped over his gut. Nick was bad a guessing weights, but it would not surprise him if Matt was now well over four hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the photo, Matt's face was flush and had an odd look on it. Nick surmised that he had been drinking heavily. The texts continued coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: fuck you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: fuck you nick<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: 416 you fuck<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: such a fat ass. yd quit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: fucjin enormus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: sknnyfuvk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: shunda reemed you when i had the chanc<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: showd yur skinnny butt what<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: mad u a fat as like me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: skiny bithc<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick screenshot the texts and image, saving them to his phone just in case he needed them in the future. He then blocked Matt's number from his phone. The texts stopped immediately. He returned the phone to the nightstand and rolled back into bed, hoping to catch a few more hours of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drifted off back to sleep, he reflected on giving up on Matt. Perhaps he really should have given him another change. Maybe he rushed to judgment. A guy who nearly doubled his weight in a few years probably wasn't going to just give up junk food cold turkey, and he should have seen something like that coming. He could have done a lot of things differently. But then again, Matt could have too.</span></div></div>",

He texted her back expressing a similar sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nick and Jen were eager to see each other again, especially after a night like last Sunday, the skater wanted a little space and not push things too far too fast. It was a good thing that Jen and him had, so he didn't want them to get burnt out on each other. Nick offered to have her over in a few nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the interim, the two added each other on Facebook. Nick wasn't too incredibly active on there, but she friend requested him and he felt there was no harm in accepting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and it gave access for Nick to look up all her photos. This was a privilege he was taking advantage of as he laid in bed, feeling frisky with one hand slowly gliding up and down in his underwear while he scrolled through Jen's photos on his phone. Perhaps there was a hot photo of her in a bikini, or maybe one that really showed off the curves of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater finally struck gold when he saw an album she uploaded a while back. \"New Porthampton beach day w/ Ty 2017!\" Ty, he figured, was one of Jen's ex-boyfriends. She had mentioned him while they were texting last week when they were talking about being cheated on. Her and Ty had dated for nearly two years before Jen broke up with him after she discovered he had another girl on the side. Obviously, this trip must have happened before she found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrolling through her photos, Nick found a couple that would be perfect material to get off to. As he worked himself up to climax looking at a photo of Jen's trim, beautiful body, his thumb slipped and accidently brought up the next photo in the album. In this one, Jen was leaning up against a guy, planting a kiss on his cheek. But the guy she was kissing was absolutely huge. He was Asian with pale skin and black hair that matched Jen's which was cut and trim. But he looked easily three times the size of Jen. Her arm was embracing his beachball sized gut that had two flabby moobs that sagged on top of it. He looked like he needed a bra more than Jen. A pudgy hand with sausage-like fingers was resting on her hip. Each of his thighs looked twice as big as Jen's and touched nearly all the way down to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick checked the tags for the photo. One of them was Ty Nguyen. This must have been the ex she was talking about, but Nick never figured Jen would date someone so grossly obese. He clicked on Ty's profile. Since they weren't friends, Nick didn't have access to all of this photos. But he did find one from 2015 that looked like right when he and Jen started dating. In it, he was skinny, almost as skinny as Nick. Grabbing onto his thin, narrow waist was Jen who was playfully holding up a cookie to Ty's awaiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stared in shook. He never would have guess that Jen could be attracted to a quarter-ton blob, let alone a guy who let himself go so quickly. Ty turned himself into a blimp in only two years. How could anyone stick around with someone who would do that to themselves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were questions Nick had about Ty. He was interesting in knowing what the hell happened to him, or at the very least why she stuck around. But then again, maybe there was no point in asking. Jen is with Nick now and that's what matters the most.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two naked bodies of Nick and Jen lay intertwined on the former's bed. The pair had climaxed not too long ago, and both laid on their sides, Jen behind Nick as her hand lazily rubbed his bloated stomach. He had invited her over and she surprised him again with a massive dinner. Nick was worried that his painfully stuffed gut would complicate things in the bedroom. However, Jen was skilled in such a way that she was able to get them both to orgasm without  jostling the boy's belly too badly. In fact, Jen incorporated sensuous rubs along Nick's gut as she bounced up and down on his pelvis. All he needed to do was lay back and enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feat was particularly impressive considering Jen's own bloated belly. Not as full as Nick, her usually flat abdomen did have a distinct curve to it having also devoured a considerable amount of food alongside Nick. He would feel the curve of her belly press into his back as they cuddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the routine for many of their nights tonight. Jen would come back after her shift at the restaurant with a ludicrous amount of food with her. The two would then get stoned and stuff themselves to the brim before Jen would push Nick onto his bed and mount him. The skater felt like he was being treated like a king, a thought that always came to mind as her mouth went to work below his waist while he munched on cookies she would bring for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the summer evenings ended this way. By the time Fall started to roll around, his metabolism had started to grind down due to the tens of thousands of calories he was consuming on a regular basis. A noticable roll of pudge was building up around his abdomen, his arms and chest lost definition and softened, his thighs plumped up a fair bit and his butt, formerly small and trim, now jiggled slightly and was stretching out the rear of most of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these changes were ignored by Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't ignore, however, were the changes in Jen's body. She had been a very thin girl with a small chest and equally tiny butt with hardly any fat on her. But now Jen had considerably plumped up. Her breasts had grown a bit, and her stomach curved out as well. But it was her ass and thighs that thickened up the most. Her thighs were like two pillows and, though bigger, were just still small enough to not be touching quite yet. The skater enjoyed feeling their softness when she would straddle his face. Her butt had ballooned up into two pale, wobbling mounds that spilled out of Nick's hands whenever he grabbed her rear. The girl's pants looked skintight on her; Nick guessed she would be needing to size up very soon, and up several sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, Nick laid nude in bed as Jen returned from his bathroom. As her naked body walked across the bedroom, her new chub jiggled and wobbled. She slid back into bed, her butt wiggling against his crotch. She was ready for Round 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grabbed her from behind, his hand squeezing her pudgy butt. As he began kissing Jen down her neck, he thought about her recent weight gain. He had liked the change; Jen was pretty but Nick thought she was far too skinny. Now, she looked healthier; he could no longer see her ribs. However, he might want to say something in case she didn't notice and kept plumping up. Then again, it might not be wish to talk about her weight. Jen might be very self-conscious about it. </span></div></div>",

He packed the bowl of the bong with strand of weed Nick never tried before: Nirvana Kush. His connection sold him on it saying that it'll give you the perfect balance between the brain high and the body high. Nick felt adventurous and decided to buy a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the weed hit Nick hard, and the moment he finished smoking he felt extremely tired and ready to fall asleep right where he was. Before any accidents could happen, Nick placed his bong back on top of his dresser and tossed himself onto his bed, passing out immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nick came to, he was lying on his back on his bed. Starting up at the ceiling, he noticed how heavy and lethargic his body felt. No doubt this was an effect of the weed, Nick thought. He tried to muster the will to bring his hand up to aching head, but his arm felt as if it was being pulled down onto the mattress. Confused, Nick looked down at his arm to see what was the matter and was stunned to see his scrawny arm covered in layers to plump fat so massive that rolls were forming around his wrist and his fingers looked liked sausages. He panicked as he checked his other arm to see it was just as flabby. Nick gasped as he looked down, or at least as best he could with a thick roll under his chin. His flat chest was now a pair of pillow-sized slabs of fat with two silver dollar size nipples, and his non-existent belly looked like a overfilled beach ball...and was getting bigger? It was getting bigger! Nick was blowing up like a balloon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater tried flailing around as his belly swelled wider and wider. Nick's gut blocked more and more vision of his room. The skin on his abdomen creaked and groan as his bed cracked under his weight. Nick screamed hoping that Diego would storm in and help before it was too late. He was getting big, too big, so big that any second now he'd p-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick woke up in a puddle of sweat and panting. The first thing he did was pat down his body. Skinny, skinny as it always had been. It took the boy a moment to come to his senses and realize what he witnesses was a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he calmed down and his breath slowed, he noticed that he was sporting a throbbing erection that was tenting up the front of his boxers. This didn't shock him too much; that tended to happened whenever he hadn't be laid in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain hit Nick's stomach hard making him clutch his midsection for a moment. Then, a long, low gargling noise came from his belly. Nick was overcome with hunger pains. This made sense to the skater; getting high always spiked up his appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weed certainly was powerful stuff, though. Nick checked on his bong and saw that there was still a bit left in the bowl. Maybe he should light up again. It would be a shame to waste perfectly good weed. Or if Diego was still in the apartment, Nick could offer a smoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nirvana Kush was powerful, but Nick never just passed out so hard from smoking, let alone having such a weird and incredibly vivid dream. Nick thought about checking in with his dealer to see if what he experienced was normal.</span></div></div>",

The two had known each other for years, but that would be awkward even for their friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater yanked down his boxers and grabbed a bottle of hand lotion from his bedstand drawer. Nick squeezed out a decent amount into his hand and started going to work as he load up some of his favorite adult videos. After nearly ten minutes of stroking, Nick didn't feel any closer to climaxing. He shrugged it off. Maybe he's just bored of the usual videos; he tossed his phone to the side, shut his eyes, and began fantasizing. He imagine having sex with hot celebrities, fooling around with girls and guys he had the hots for from high school, all of his typical dirty thoughts. Again, nothing was getting him over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fantasizing was interrupted by another stabbing hunger pain in his belly. At this point, he just wanted to get this over with so Nick could get something to eat. Pleasuring himself was becoming a chore at this point. His mind drifted to that bizarre dream he had after he passed out. It all seemed so real. He felt pinned to his bed by a body so monstrously large, barely able to do something as simple as move arm. The dream made him feel helpless, trapped in his own body, but a much fatter body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was still working his member as his thoughts then drifted to the latter part of the dream. He had imagined that he was blowing up, literally swelling like a balloon. The skin on his belly really felt like it was stretching tight as he grew bigger.  He remembered the groaning of his belly, the creaking of his breaking bed, th-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Nick erupted. He was caught off guard as he sprayed all over his chest and belly while wave after wave of pleasure surgef through his body. His hips bucked as he gasped in pleasure until it finally faded leaving Nick a quivering mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater panted as he collected himself. He had pleasured himself many times before, but never did it felt that great. And never to such bizarre, surreal fantasies. How did a weed dream that he had not long ago bring about such extreme amounts of pleasure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't spend too much time thinking about that since he had a situation to clean up. A few minutes later, he had wiped his belly, torso, and hands clean with tissues, and rinsed everything off in his personal bathroom. The boy splashed some cold water on his face to bring himself back to reality. As he patted dry, his saw his skinny nude body in the mirror and couldn't help but think of the enormously fat body he had in that dream. Arousal arose in him once more and he started to get erect again.  This surprised Nick; just thinking about that weird fantasy was getting him hard despite having just finished getting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet those thoughts were interrupted by the return of the hunger pains which now felt like shape knives cutting into Nick's stomach. He needed food, and he needed it now. But the skater also felt he needed to once more deal with his arousal, feeling himself stiffening up at the mere thought of that dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, maybe I can take care of both at the same time?\" Nick mused out loud.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thoughts of swelling bellies, enormous moobs, tree trunk thighs, and asses like two beach balls pressed together filled Nick's mind as he worked himself up towards completion again. The skater fantasized about beds breaking under him, couches groaning under his weight, and his flabby flanks brushing up against both sides of hallways. Never before had Nick gotten off to these ideas. He had only had thought of fatness, let alone extreme obesity, as gross and disgusting. But something altered his mind, and now he was climaxing again not just to the thought of absurdly fat bodies, but also of him being absurdly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next week, the same fantasies ran rampant in Nick's mind. No longer had his usual fantasies of sleeping with sexy celebrities or fooling around with boys and girls he knew were hot brought him to orgasm anymore. Quite the opposite, in fact. Now, if Nick wanted to satisfy his urges, he absolutely needed to be thinking about fatness and exclusively about fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it wasn't just his personal fantasies that were different now. Nick was also checking out morbidly obese people. Whenever someone massively overweight waddled past him on the street, the skater was compelled to seek a peak of their gigantic butt. Just the sight of one such fatty was enough to get Nick hot and bothered these days. This wouldn't be bad on its own if it wasn't for James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had started working for Williams &amp; Williams about half a year ago. He used to working in the shipping department alongside Nick. However, shortly after starting, he was transferred to do work in the office. This suited him better as James was easily one of the fattest guy in the company. He stood at 5'6\", and Nick guessed that he tipped the scales somewhere around 350 pounds, with a cute face and a mop of slightly curly brown hair. A year or two younger than Nick, James' entire body was covered in a thick layer of flab. His entire body wobbled and jiggled uncontrollably at even the slightest moment. It appeared as if the boy's entire body was made of jelly. Nick recalled seeing loads of bright red stretch marks when James was working in shipping whenever his ill-fitting uniform rode up his gut or love handles. Such stretch marks had become part of Nick's fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a treat for Nick whenever James would waddle out of the office. He'd watch the boy's blubber oscillating as he trundled along, leaving Nick hypnotized in fantasy as he imagined his own body not thin and skinny but encased in as much blubber as James'. Perhaps more. Perhaps a lot more. Fairly often, Nick would have to rush off to the bathroom afterwards to address the growing bludge in his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get this monkey off my back,\" Nick sighed as he once more finished getting himself off to his fat fantasies. This newfound obsession with obesity was completely dominating Nick's mind and he needed some greater release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had been a subject in a load of his recent fantasies. If Nick spent some time around that tub of lard, maybe he'll get over this obsession. Seeing what a real fat ass is like in real life may be enough to shut up whatever part of his brain is making him think fat is sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps he needed to do something more than hang around a fatty. Nick thought that if he hooked up with James, the fantasies will stop once he gets a view of a naked fat boy. Though he didn't know if James likes guys or not, Nick didn't hear James talk a lot about his love life. The guy might appreciate an orgasm regardless of who it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Nick thought that maybe putting on a pound or two will calm down that part of him that yearns for fatness. It'll let him play out a little bit of the fantasies. Besides, Nick reasoned, he could stand to put on a little weight being as skinny as he was.</span></div></div>",

Just heading home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you live nearby?\" Nick asked as he walked alongside James. The sun was just starting to set and streetlights were flickering to life on the empty road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I live in the apartment complexes half a dozen blocks away,\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice.

Or out of anything, for that matter.\" Nick then snuck a hand across to James and gave his plump ass a hearty pinch. James squealed as he slapped the skaters hand away. \"What? Don't like when your butt gets touched? I definitely need to change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Wha-, uh, I mean, I have a girlfriend!\" the obese boy stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she doesn't need to know,\" Nick said with a smirk. \"Besides, I can do things to you that I bet she can't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames continued to stutter as Nick wrapped his arms around the fat boys shoulders. Glancing down, Nick saw the tent forming in James' pants. The skater was ready to seal the deal. All he needed was something to push James over the edge. Maybe Nick could use the boy's obvious love of food to his advantage.</span></div></div>",

Chocolate icing caked the boy's mouth, and he moaned while chewing away. When he swallowed, he started stroking himself more furiously than he had before as he rubbed his full belly. Moments later, he erupted all over his bed, a cascade of his bodily fluids spurting out over his bedsheets and the dozen empty plastic wrappers that littered the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the final wave of pleasure shot out through Nick's body, it took him a second to collect himself and realize what happened. Never before had he gotten himself off like this, by frantically stuffing himself as he played with his manhood. Certainly, Nick had filled his belly to the brim before, but this is the first time it had ever brought him erotic pleasure before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater brushed the icing and crumbs off of his body. He then picked up all the wrappers and tossed them into the garbag can. Nick yanked off the sheet and threw it into the corner on top of loads of dirty laundry, then walked his nude body to the bathroom and ran the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hot water ran down his body and over his distended belly, Nick thought about what had just happened. Never before did he have urges like that. And never before did the thoughts of eating and overeating made him so aroused. He pondered as to what to do about that next. His horniness made his go out and get stuffed. Maybe the opposite is true? Would being filled to the brim get himself worked up again? Or maybe Nick should look this up online. Is this a thing other people are into? Getting off by getting full?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy shook his head. He had to push these thoughts out of his mind. Sure, what he just experienced was hot, but it was weird. There's no way he should be getting hard over the idea of gorging himself. Nick felt like he needed to exercise some self control and resist this.</span></div></div>",

Over a hundred ounces, I think somewhere around five thousand calories. Thanks again, and here we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater stroked himself as he watched the video. Shot from the neck down, it featured a chubby man, probably edging close to 300 pounds wearing only skin-tight briefs, as he chugged down all four massive chocolate shakes he had showed to the camera. Nick watched as the man's flabby belly ballooned out with each gulp, the soft mound of flab turning into a solid sphere full of calories. The man finished the last shake about fifteen minutes into the video. The rest of it was devoted to him rubbing his gut, belching, lifting the mass up and letting it drop. The man thanked the audience once again, slapping his gut before shutting off the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been an interesting few hours online for Nick. He plugged in various terms in to search engines to see if he could find any more information on this new interest of his. It wasn't until he typed in \"bellies stuffed full hot\" that he found a link to a PornTub account for a man with the username inFATuation. All of his videos featured him stuffing his gut full of thousands and thousands of calories. The account had been up for some time; a glance back at earlier videos showed that he wasn't always as big as he was now. Immediately, Nick got himself off on one video, then another, then another. His manhood was feeling chaffed, but Nick was still shaking in arousal as his new find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErupting once more, Nick panted as he watched the video end. \"COMMISSION DETAILS IN THE DESCRIPTION\" a caption at the end of the video read. Curious, Nick opened the videos description panel. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now accepting commissions for videos! Want to see me stuff myself to the point of popping? Send me some cash on VenPal and I'll make a video for you! Message me for further details!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's mind raced with idea. He could pay him to eat loads of burgers or maybe a few pizzas, anything as long as he forked over the cash. The skater was getting worked up again just thinking about was of making that guy's gut swell up enormously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Nick had an idea. He certainly liked the idea of getting himself stuffed full. And it's clear that there are people willing to pay him to do it. A simple video is the least he could do for someone who'll treat him to loads of food. Why not make an account of his own, and start doing his own videos?</span></div></div>",

He then lifted the bottle to his lips and started to chug. As he drank, his bare abdomen swelled into a distinct curve. Fighting the urge to burp, the skater kept drinking. Tears began forming in the corner of his eyes as the last quarter of the bottle entered his stomach. He was relieved when he realized the bottle was completely empty. Placing a hand on his bloated gut, he posed for the camera, standing sideways to it to demonstrate how pronounced his gut was while being careful not to show his face. A few minutes of belly rubs and Nick ended the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the fifth video he uploaded to his new PornTube account. All of his previous videos features him stuffing his gut full, usually with some combination of food or liquid. While he got a decent amount of views of his videos considering how new his account was, nobody had reached out to him yet. But after uploading that fifth video, two new messages appeared in Nick's inbox the following day. The skater was excited, and eagerly check them. The first was from a user named frmrrick:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hot vids, man. I'd pay to see you eat a cake off the ground. all fours. snorking and oinking at the camera like the piggy you are. ;)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had never thought of doing something like that, and the idea certainly interested him. However, he was hesitant about part of it. The guy wants Nick to look at the camera while doing it. He wasn't sure about showing his face while doing this. Somebody may recognize him and it'd all be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second message was from a user by the handle of encouragerawr:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Love your videos. Can you do one for me? I can send over a bunch of fast food to your place (You pick!). I'd just like you to eat it on camera, forget your boxers. ;) show off that hot ass and cock ;)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother commission, but again Nick was hesitant. He always wore at least underwear in his videos. And sure, while it didn't always hide the fact how aroused he was making them, Nick shyed away from going fully nude in his videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these are his first two submissions. He should probably do one of them. Hopefully when other users see what Nick is willing to do, the commissions will flood his inbox.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next two months, donations for Nick came pouring in. Every week, at least three or four guys would hit him up with commissions. Most of them revolved around Nick eating on his hands and knees, oinking at the camera, squeezing his nipples while squealing. Not only did people want to see Nick eat like a pig, they wanted to see him act like a piggy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>oink oink, what a cute piggy</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>so hot. Such a hot face. Gotsa turn you into a prized hog</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>piggies getting chunky!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was skimming through the many comments on his last video. In it, he was paid to lay out a bunch of burgers out on a plate on a floor and devour them without using his hands. He thought he looked silly by the end, his face covered in grease and ketchup. But it got attention. The last comment, Nick noted, was spot on. In the months since doing videos, he has put on weight. The skater estimated he put on twenty pounds or so. This wasn't too terrible for the frail boy. It felt nice actually having some meat on his bones instead of looking so sickly. Nick didn't even mind the roll of pudge forming on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Friday night, Nick got home and immediately went to PornTube. He wanted to set something up so he could do a video on Saturday. He'd select a commission, arrange money to be sent, and figure out what the payer wanted the video of. A couple of messages had been sent to him. He glanced through them, but his blood turned to ice when he saw one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Subject: Nick Stein</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater's hands started to shake. He knew it was a mistake to show his face on camera. It was a risk he knew when he first took that commission, but he looked past it. And now it appeared that Nick was getting his just deserts. The boy nervously opened the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Subject: Nick Stein<br>\r\nFrom: aaabbbbbcccc5<br>\r\nMessage:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi Nick,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recognized you the moment you showed your face on camera. Didn't know you were becoming such a little piggy. Little Piggy Nick has a ring to it, I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've downloaded all your videos. In a heartbeat, I can send them to pretty everyone you know. I've already got a list of everyone you friended on Facebook. They'll see how you love being such a hog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are your rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No more commissions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) You will only do videos for me. Don't worry, Pig. I'll cover the cost of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) When I tell you what to each and send the money to your account, you make the video in 36 hours. Any later, and I send your videos to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGot it, Pig?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely<br>\r\nYour New Master<br>\r\n </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater was shaking. Whoever knew who he was was now blackmailing him. Nick wasn't sure what he should do. He just wanted to delete his account and pretend like nothing happened, like he never posted any videos of himself eating and stuffing himself like a pig. But if he did that, whoever this person was would release all his videos. Or not. Maybe Nick could call their bluff. But if Nick went along with this, he might be able to coax this person out. And if he found out who's blackmailing him, that'd be one step in the right direction.</span></div></div>",

The photo was a screengrab of one of his PornTube videos. He's looking at the camera, cake smattering his lips and cheeks, and Nick appeared to be in the middle oinking. Even with all that cake on his face, anyone could tell it was Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: lol wtf? OINK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick tossed his phone to the other end of his bedroom. He had been receiving texts like that all week. The moment he read that extortion message, he deleted his PornHub account hoping that whoever was blackmailing him would have mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey, unfortunately, did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours after deleting his account, his Facebook network exploded with his friends sharing parts of the video and tagging him in it. He panicked, untagged himself, pleaded with people not to spread it around. But that did nothing. In a matter of days, hundreds of people had seen it, including coworkers and family members. Nick was a laughing stock. He'd get called Piggy at work, friends would text him like Jeremy did. The skater just wanted to bury his head in the sand and hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick collapsed on his bed. He covered his face with a pillow and screamed into it. He didn't feel much better. There was nothing left for him to do with ride this out and hope that one day people will forget this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil then, he'd just be Nick the Piggy.</span></div></div>",

Heavy whipping cream, peanut butter...and uh, chocolate syrup...so, here goes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised the pitcher to his mouth. The concoction was slimy and sickly sweet. The peanut butter and chocolate syrup was meant to mask the cream but it only made things worse. Luckily for Nick, he was getting used to the substance. This wasn't the first time he drank the stuff for his \"Master\". He practically got the stuff in his belly in record time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping and rubbing his bloated gut, Nick oinked, just like \"Master\" told him to do. He tried to keep his face out of the shot; Nick didn't need to give \"Master\" more ammunition. When he felt that he fulfilled what was demanded by \"Master\", Nick waddled over to the camera and turned it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past two months, Nick followed exactly what \"Master\" told him to do. He couldn't risk anything. As much as he just wanted to run away, the skater feared what would happen if he pissed \"Master\" off. So he just did whatever was asked, hoping that Master would accidentally drop some clues that Nick could use to figure out who this person was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, all Nick could figure out what \"Master\" had money. At least five times a week, Nick would receive a message from \"Master\" commanding him what greasy, fatty thing to devour. Nick would then check his VenPal account and see that more than enough money was there to cover the cost of whatever he was ordered to get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was always ordered to eat a lot. With the tens of thousands of calories that Nick was forced to consume, his weight skyrocketed. Now hovering around 182, the skater had considerably plumped up. The roll of pudge now had turned into a belly that stuck out several inches and sagged over his waistline. His once-flat chest was now sprouting moobs; even his nipples looked fatter. His arms puffed up, and he was getting the beginnings of a second chin. His thighs swelled and softened and wobbled like crazy when he walked. The skater's butt blew up prominently. Nick's ass had exploded out of most of his jeans forcing him to go up a few sizes as well as purchase larger underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that if he didn't figure out who \"Master\" was and soon, the skater would essentially turn into a blimp. He needed to find out a way make \"Master\" say something that would help Nick narrow down who it could possibly be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Thursday night, Nick got home from work. He unbuttoned his tight jeans and tossed them onto the floor, letting his chunky butt and thighs jiggle as he went over to his computer. As usual, there was a message there from \"Master\":<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>hope you like those shake, Piggy. I'm training you to start drinking two now</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gulped. He really needed to end this soon. \"Master\" is looking to make him absolutely huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if Nick pretended that he was really into it, he might be able to draw \"Master\" out of hiding. Suppose that he wanted \"Master\" to feed him personally, he would have to reveal themselves. Or, if lied about something and \"Master\" caught it, then he could start to figure out what he knows about Nick. That way, Nick can start narrowing down who this is.</span></div></div>",

And he was more than willing to fulfill them so long as the price was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStroking his erection as he devoured the last of many burgers, Nick turned off the camera, gently rubbing his painfully distended belly. He had just finished up with a video from a PornTube user burgerbitch who paid good money to see how many bacon cheeseburgers the skater could get in him. His record was four. Satisfied with a job well done, he walked his naked, bloated body over to his bed and collapsed. A nap was necessary to digest all the thousands of calories currently in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust on the cusp of sleep, Nick heard a <b>bing</b> from his phone. He groggily reached for it on his nightstand. It was the PornTube app on his phone telling him that he received a new message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was interested in seeing what new commission was coming in, so he clicked open the app. A user with the name of <i>jthegiantpeach</i> had messaged him. He clicked on the profile. The main photo on the page was of a young looking man, from the neck down, his body a sea of pale, soft rolls that reached either side of his wide desk chair. Bright red stretchmarks raced up and down his fat body. His profile listed loads of videos, the most recent featured him bloating up as much as possible on soda. Close to five liters filled the boy's belly, the sloshing of all that liquid could easily be heard in the video. Nick scrolled through the user's video library, each older video featuring a smaller and smaller boy until he found the very first video posted a little over two years ago, its subject being a thin boy, nearly as thin as Nick trying and failing to eat a dozen cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>hey man! Just wanted to write you saying that I love your videos! Easily one of my favorite bloaters on this site</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was flattered by the message. Checking his profile again, he saw that jthegiantpeach had a ton of followers and viewers. The skater's profile was tiny by comparison. He was about to send him a message back when he noticed the user's location: New Porthamton. He and Nick lived in the same city! It was a wild thought, but the skater considered asking if he wanted to meet up. His cock stirred to life thinking of all the fun they could have stuffing themselves silly. But then again, it might weird out jthegiantpeach. Maybe a simple thank you message would suffice. That, and perhaps a special video for him.</span></div></div>",

Peering into the cupboards, he found a few boxes of snack cakes he had bought while grocery shopping. Undoubtedly, Nick had bought them while high and figured he'd want them the next time he was stoned. In the fridge was most of a pizza he had ordered the night before. Nearly three quarters of it remained. Luckily, Nick didn't mind cold pizza. Peaking into the freezer, he saw a couple of boxes of ice cream bars. Again, it was another purchase Nick suspected he made while shopping while stoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, what to choose, what to choose...\"</span></div></div>",

His skin was numbed by the last of the weed, and he was leaning against the wall of his shower enjoying the sensation of the water trickling down the front of his stoned body. Slowly, he turned around and let the water run down his back and tickle his small firm butt as Nick giggled to himself with a silly smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Nick felt an intense burning sensation in his throat. It wasn't something to worry about. This was something that occasionally happened to him when he smoked weed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater turned his nude body back around and held his mouth open under the shower head. It was helping, but the water wasn't getting in his mouth very well. High as a kite, Nick came up with a silly idea. He unhooked the detachable shower head from its mount. Switching settings, the water now came out in a forceful stream rather than a spray.  The skater raised it to his mouth and started sucking down the cool water from the shower head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was overcome by a feeling of euphoria was he drank more and more of the cool water. It did little to soothe his burning throat, yet he drank anyway. The cool water filled his belly turning it from a flat tummy to a prominent convex curve to total spherical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand on his bowling ball sized belly, Nick's eyes widened in amazement as he could feel the skin of his belly stretch to accommodate the gallons of water filling him. Worried he would burst, Nick moved to turn off the shower. But the irritation in his throat turned into a venerable inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than turning off the water, Nick cranked up to the cold water in an attempt to stop the searing pain. His stomach groaned and creaked as it doubled then tripled then quadrupled in size. Nick's eyes rolled to the back of his head and he moaned, partially because of the unending heat in his throat and partially because of the pain of his swelling belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more water entered him, and soon his belly was pressing against one side of the shower stall, then another, and another, and then Nick was pinned in his own shower by the inflating mass of his belly. He prayed that he'd stop, that his throat would stop burning up before he'd expl-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Nick woke up in a cold sweat. The weed had caused him to have another bizarre dream. He laid shaking and panting in his bed, a hand clutching his flat stomach as a way of proving to himself it was all a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had gotten stoned plenty of times in his life, but never had he had reactions like this before. Diego also smoked from time to time. Nick could ask his best friend if he had similar experiences. Or maybe now was the time to call up his dealer and get some answers. Or, perhaps, Nick should just let this go. He got some bad weed and he'll never smoke that kind again.</span></div></div>",

What caught Nick's eye was the growing bludge in Diego's jeans, Nick's own bludge having naturally gone down but not after a quick cold shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround fifteen minutes after Diego had fallen asleep, he woke up with a jolt.

And getting himself off was no longer satisfying his urges. A Saturday fooling around with a stranger, Nick believed, would be a Saturday well spent. With one hand still in his boxers, he picked up his phone scrolled his apps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was MeetHer. It was an app for guys and girls to get together. However, it was mostly used for dating. Nick wasn't all that interested in having a girlfriend, so he only looked for hookups. Unfortunately, not too many girls on there want one night stands but it was still worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, there was Guydar. This was for guys to meet other guys. It was pretty much the opposite of MeetHer; mostly everyone on there was looking just for someone to play with for the day. Nick used this before when he really needed to get off bad. He wasn't sure how much he was into guys at this point in his life, but he kept a faceless profile there with a profile photo showing off his svelte body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while ago, Nick had downloaded Fetter. This was an app that revolved more around fetishes. Sure, Nick liked the occasional pair of handcuffs, but nothing too crazy. He just downloaded the app when he was super high after reading about it online and just hadn't bothered to delete it yet. His profile is entirely blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, it had been a while since Nick checked the App Store.

When he finally got it right, he was directed by the app to check his profile and make any updates since he'd been gone for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis profile photo was of his bare chest and flat stomach that teased a little bit of what was below his waist without showing too much off. Nick's profile description stated clearly what he was after: He wants a bottom, discreet, nearby, someone how could host, and someone was \"height/weight proportional\". He had to put that down since he got a lot of flak for flatly saying \"No fatties\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nick confirmed that everything was correct, thumbnails of other profile pictures popped up and he strated searching for a guy to screw. Unfortunately, the prospects of finding a guy that fit his criteria was not looking that great. Many of the guys nearby were too old or too out of shape or not very attractive. Others were kind of creepy or weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two guys that he thought were attractive but might not mesh with Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a user by the name of JimRat. In his profile photo he sat on a weight bench in shorts and a tank top which showed off his swollen quads, pecs, and biceps. Age: 23, Height: 6', and Weigh: 244, he says that he's looking for bigger guys to mess with. Nick was half his size and hardly had any muscle on him. Clearly, he wasn't the muscle-bound hunk this guy was looking for. But Nick thought there might not be any harm in reaching out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other profile that stuck out to him was a user by the name of twink2twunk. He immediately caught Nick's attendtion while scrolling because his profile photo was of his slender body and plump bubble butt. 5'10, 145, 20 years old, Nick guessed that he was a student at the local community college and needed some company in his dorm room. twink2twunk said he as looking for a guy to have more regular interactions with, and Nick was just looking for something now. Nevertheless, it wouldn't hurt to message him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick was considering who to chat up, a notification popped it. It was a chat request from a guy not too far away, so Nick humored him and checked out his profile. The guy was a bit bigger than the skater was looking for at 260 pounds, stood at 5'9\" tall, and was 22 years old. But his face wasn't half bad to look at.</span></div></div>",

A simple tall brick building, it served to house many of the school's underclassmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sat on a bench outside Clark Hall. He played a mobile game on his phone while waiting for Eric, or twink2twunk. They chatted a bit on Guydar before swapping face pics, and Eric was quite smitten by Nick's good looks. Eric himself had a youthful, boyish face that rarely needed shaving. Nick thought he was attractive enough, and their albeit brief conversation let him know this guy was pretty sane. Eric felt the same way and invited Nick over to his dorm for later that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, Nick kept an eye out for his hook up. Eric had texted him a few minutes ago saying he'd be down in as soon as he got dressed. Though Nick didn't mind waiting a bit. It was a beautiful summer day, and a minute or two longer out in the sun will at least help the skater keep his tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door of the Hall swung open, and Nick looked to see Eric exiting and walking toward him. Or, at least, he thought it was Eric. Facially, he looked just like the photo Nick received. But the boy seemed like he had packed on not only the Freshman Fifteen but also the Sophomore Sixty. Meaty thighs and wide hips stretched his shorts shorts skin-thight, a small belly pressed against his tank top, and mounds of flab were sprouting on his chest. His butt seemed to have swollen the most and was starting to tear apart the seems of the rear of Eric's shorts. The small, firm rear in the profile was now a plump bubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's whole body wobbled and bounced as he approached Nick. \"Nick?\" he asked the skater. \"I'm Eric! Sorry to make you wait. I ran into my RA and he needed to ask me about a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh no worries,\" Nick said as he tried to avoid staring at Eric's soft body. Clearly, Eric was way fatter than his profile lead on. There was no way he was 140 pounds. This guy must have stolen his profile photo or something. But Nick refused to believe that the faceless photo of the slim trim body in his profile was him. Be that as it may, Eric wasn't half bad to look at. Sure, he was bigger, but he wasn't grossly overweight. And the fat seemed to go to all the right places. Plus, it would be a shame for Nick to travel this far and not get some action even if it was with a catfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, should we go back to my room?\" Eric asked.</span></div></div>",

Nick replied positively with a firm pinch to one of his plump butt cheeks. He yelped in surprise as Nick's fingers sunk into the soft flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skater's hands once again went for Eric's booty the moment he closed and locked the door to his dorm room. The boy moaned in pleasure as Nick massaged the two spherical masses Reaching around to the front, Nick undid Eric's pants and yanked them down to his ankles. The skater playfully nibbled at one of the marshmallowly cheeks. Eric responded by briefly trying to smoother the skater with his ballooned up butt as he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, both boys were furiously making out on Eric's bed clad only in their underwear. They pressed and rubbed their stiff junk against each other's as their hands and mouths explored the other's body. Nick was finding himself enjoying Eric's body. Despite the fact that he was way fatter than he expected, Nick was having fun squeezing love handles, sucking moobs, and grinding against Eric's butt which, to be honest, Nick thought looked better than any butt he had seen on a girl before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments before Nick was going to pull off the last of Eric's clothes for the main event, the other boy's stomach growled loudly. \"Ugh, oops,\" said Eric. \"I don' think I've eaten anything in a while. Do you want something to eat before we really go at it? I've got loads of snacks here, or we could order something. My roommate will be gone for the rest of the day, so we've got plenty of time.\"</span></div></div>",

The bottom boy was panting, his body too covered in sweat and a small pool of various fluids stained his beds. He had reached climax not too much sooner then Nick had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the skater cleaned himself up and started dressing himself, Eric got off from his bed and walked to the mini-fridge at the other side of his dorm room. From it he pulled out a shaker bottle filled with a creamy white substance. The nude boy opened it up and starting chugging it. Nick watched him as he put his pants back on. In only a matter of seconds, Eric had swallowed it all. This, Nick thought, would be a decent time to address the elephant in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had fun?\" Nick asked. Eric nodded as he slipped on his boxer briefs that were tight against his butt and thighs. \"So, uh, I was meaning to say something, but you don't look a thing like your profile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's face lit up. \"Oh, I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you look a little...or maybe a lot... bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatter. You can say it,\" Eric said. \"And thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\" Nick looked puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I'm been trying to thicken up for a while. But nobody has said anything about it yet. Which is strange. I've put on about fifty pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you put on fifty pounds on purpose? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day, I just looked in the mirror and didn't like seeing the boney guy in the reflection. So I ate, and ate, and ate. The more I gained, the thicker I got, and the more I liked my body. And I'm going to keep on going until that changes. I should be 200 pounds pretty soon. Sooner if those shakes work.\" Eric gestured to the empty bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. But why haven't you changed your photos on your profile yet? I thought I'd be fooling around with a skinny guy today. I mean, not like I minded too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I could tell you didn't mind.\" Eric then winked at Nick. \"It's because nobody seemed to care or say anything. I guess I should, but I'd rather just get rid of my profile all together. I want to see someone on the regular. It's nice to feel a guy appreciate my thickness. But it'd be way better to have a guy who will be there as I thicken up. And that can be you, Nick. You're cute, and you know how to please a man. I wouldn't mind seeing more of you. And I hope you wouldn't mind seeing more of me. Literally more of me. What do you think? Hell, we might even be able to put some meat on your bones too!\"</span></div></div>",

Eagerly, he opened the attachment. The photo was of Eric who in the photo was lying down on his stomach naked in bed. He had snapped a shot over his shoulder of his bubble butt which looked like two soft pale mounds of dough. Nick couldn't even see the rest of Eric's legs past his enormous rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>does this nothing make my ass look big?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past several weeks, Eric often teased Nick by sending him photos, usually of his nude body and usually of his rear. He liked showing off his thick body, and Nick liked seeing it, especially as the boy grew. A few days after first hooking up, Eric passed 200 pounds. Two weeks later and was sitting at 209. And the night before, he informed Nick that we was now weighing in at 216. Every time he went over to Eric's place to fool around, Nick got a chance to see how all those new pounds were filling Eric out. Much of the new weight went to his already plump ass. But now his hips were widening out, his thighs were starting to rub together, and his chest had some more bounce and jiggle to it. The sizable roll of pudge that made up Eric's belly had swollen up slightly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>fuck, bb. can't wait to see you tonight</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Nick meant it. The moment Eric brought Nick up to his dorm room, the skater tore off the fatter boy's clothes. In seconds, Eric was clad only in a pair of white briefs which, thanks to his gelatinous ass, looked like a thong on him. Nick sat on the bed sucking and nibbling on Eric's chest while he stood nearly naked in front of the skater, whose hands to clawing and grabbing and pinching his oversized butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, I need to talk to you about something,\" Eric said as he gently pulled the skater's head away from his chest. \"You're sexy and all. But I'm starting to think you're too skinny for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you mean by that?\" Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like 125 or something close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, I'm almost a hundred pounds heavier than you,\" laughed Eric. \"My butt alone probably weighs as much as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe? I mean, since I've been getting bigger, I've noticed that I'm checking out bigger guys now. Now that I'm heavier, I've been fantasizing about being taken by larger guys. Fatter, muscular, both. It just feels weird now knowing that the guy humping me is so...frail? Tiny? Light?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You don't want to screw with me anymore because I'm skinny?\" Nick asked pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed. \"I don't know. I think so. Unless...ugh, nevermind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me,\" Nick demanded as he pinched one of Eric's blown up butt cheeks hard. The boy yelped as he slapped away Nick's hand. He then waddled to his mini fridge and pulled out a shaker bottle filled with the same creamy white substance Eric drank from after every time they played. His hips swayed as he seductively walked back over to Nick. Uncapping the bottle, he raised it up to Nick's lips as he sat there confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you weren't skinny anymore. I think you'd look cute with a belly. But then I think you'd look hot with a big belly. But something. I don't think I can't get off anymore if I'm worried I'll crush the guy I'm fucking like a bug.\"</span></div></div>",

He downloaded Guydar again and updated his profile once more, this time including a better photo showing off his trim torso and abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem with Guydar, as Nick saw it, was that it pretty much had the exact same guys on it all the time. Very rarely did anyone new pop up and, if they did, their account was not up for long. He was about to delete the app again when he recognized a familiar face in a thumbnail: It was Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking on his profile, Eric's photo came up. Still boyishly handsome, though his hair was a bit longer and unkempt. Nick instantly noticed to pronounced double chin hanging from his jaw, and went to check out the other photos Eric posted to his account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, to say the least, had gotten big. In one photo, he stood naked in a doorway with this back to the camera. His hips were so wide that they nearly brushed up against both sides of the frame. The boy's ass, formerly plump and smooth, now looked like two beachballs full of cottage cheese. Eric may had joked that his butt alone weighed as much as Nick, but now it wasn't a joke anymore. Hanging over his gigantic rear were two slabs of jiggly fat that made up his love handles. The boy's thick thighs fought each other for space as they rubbed against one another almost down to Eric's knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick swiped to pull up another photo. In it, Eric was holding up one of his mammoth man tits up as he seductively licked his own nipple. Swipe, and up came a photo of Eric as two burly men sucked on each of his moobs, his belly a cascade of rolls. Swipe, and now there was a photo of Eric being taken from behind by a morbidly obese man whose belly rested on his lower back. Swipe, and the last photo was of Eric years ago, hundreds of pounds thinner and dressed only in a Speedo as he held up a swimming medal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick hit an icon to pull up the profile information. Most of it was blank except for two fields:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeigh: 402 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for: <i>big men. bigger=better</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring in shock at what Eric did to himself, Nick reflected on that fateful day years ago. Eric stood in front of Nick, thick shake at his lips, ready to blow the up skater's waistline. He was thankful that in that moment of lust he didn't succumb Eric's desires. Who knows what he'd look like if he agreed to put on weight for that delusional tub of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swiped back to the photo of Eric, naked in the doorway showing off his tremendous butt. Nick's manhood stirred to life as he stared at the two impossibly large globes of fat and soon an intense erection strained against the skater's jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, Nick thought, it wouldn't have been that bad.</span></div></div>",

I didn't guess I'd end up with this glorious posterior, and now feeling it strain my underwear is one of the biggest things, no pun intended, keeping me motivated to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric lowered himself to straddle Nick, resting his glorious glutes between Nick's legs and rubbing against his crotch. He looked Nick straight in the eye with an impish smile and gently rocked the bottle in his hand. Without a word, Nick gave a few quick nods and tipped his head back, and Eric took this cue to pour the liquid into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was bemused by the sweetness of the liquid as it filled his mouth, but his nerves calmed and his appetite grew as his brain flooded with dopamine. He began to gulp to keep pace with Eric's steady pour. The bottle seemed larger than he had anticipated from this angle and he wanted to pull away to catch his breath, but with Eric's unwavering hand and the surprisingly quick flow of liquid he began to chug even faster, draining the bottle so he could catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gently touched Nick's face with his free hand, then ran his hand along his chest until he reached Nick's flat stomach. Eric ran his fingers across its surface delicately, then moved to his waist before sliding a hand under Nick's petite backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great, Nick...get used to this and you'll be a big boy in no time. Hopefully turn these pancakes into melons...\" he rasped, giving Nick's buttocks a squeeze. He returned his hand to Nick's abdomen, feeling it inflate as the bottle emptied. When he removed the container from Nick's lips, the slim guy's stomach had rounded out and was firm to the touch. Eric gave it a tentative push, and Nick let out an \"oof\" of discomfort in response. Eric smiled again: \"That wasn't so bad, was it? These are my favorite meal of the day\u2014tasty, filling, calorie-packed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick struggled to sit up, finding it difficult to breathe from the angle at which his back leaned against Eric's headboard. His midsection felt tight, but he felt a euphoric daze setting in as he brought his own hand to his stomach. Eric placed his hand atop Nick's, then interlocked their fingers as he leaned down to give Nick a deep kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...pretty...great...\" Nick said, gasping between words as he grabbed hold of Eric's ample curves to pull himself into a more comfortable posture. \"How long will it be before I can down one of those without struggling to catch my breath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled, and began to rub Nick's belly with a sensual firmness. \"I bet by next week your capacity will have stretched to the point you can drain one of these on an empty stomach no problem. And until then, I'll make sure you have my expert belly rubs to alleviate some of the discomfort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric heaved himself up, grazing his protruding belly across Nick's face as he did, and waddled back over to his fridge and filled his arms with bottles of the stuff. Nick admired the way Eric's rounded chest puffed out as he crossed the room, and looked up at him inquisitively as Eric emptied his arms and 5 containers cascaded onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all I have for now; I guess I better pick up some more ingredients if I'm going to to be doubling the recipe,\" he said wryly, reaching down to give Nick's abs a pat. Then, his expression changed as if to suggest he'd just recalled something as he swooped up one of the bottles and unceremoniously drained it in front of Nick. He let out a tiny burp, the sound almost humorous coming from the sizeable boy, and smiled at Nick. \"I forgot\u2014hadn't had my daily serving yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt a jolt of tumescence rise in his boxers as he replayed the last 30 seconds in his head on a loop. He pushed himself forward, crawling toward the edge of the bed and planting his face firmly in Eric's soft and inviting belly.  Eric put his hand on the back of Nick's head, gently stroking his hair and pushing it deeper into his gut. Nick's lips were pressed firmly against the flesh as he reached around again to paw at Eric's ass.  Before long, he had used the heft of Eric's backside to hoist himself up to meet his lips, then pulled the chubby hunk atop him as he yanked down Eric's overtight briefs and his own boxers in two quick gestures. He flipped Eric onto his back, the bed sinking and recoiling under his considerable weight, and went wild with lust as he handled Eric's well-rounded figure. Eric moaned, the increased sensitivity of his ample flesh causing waves of pleasure to shoot through him\u2014a smile crossed his lips as he closed his eyes, imagining Nick growing fatter by his hand. He couldn't have imagined a better outcome for the date; he was prepared for the lanky skater to reject the idea out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished, Nick loaded up the bottles into his bag and hurried home to stash the shakes in the fridge. As he hustled into his apartment, he was surprised by how painful it was to move with his still-bloated stomach; he furtively brought his hands to his stomach and tried to imitate Eric's motions, feeling the pressure abate a bit as his fingers seemed to loosen the taut flesh of on his abdomen. Now that the afterglow was gone, he felt his nerves rising again\u2014was he ready to get fat after all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hid the creamy shakes in the back of the fridge, and on his way to his room he passed by Diego's bedroom and noticed the door was ajar. Inside, Diego was napping in his underwear and Eric was surprised at the sight. Diego's frame was a bit heftier than he recalled: a pot belly was pooching over the waistband of his boxer briefs, and the fabric was straining against some impressively thick thighs. He smirked as he thought to himself: <i>Well, it seems I won't be the only one putting on weight in this house</i>. He pulled Diego's door shut until it was cracked and continued to his own room, where he flopped onto his bed and smiled at the thought of all the thickening that was about to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he had drained the last of his supply from Eric, Nick was eager to meet up again. Eric, for his part, had anticipated as much, and made good use of the intervening days to whip up several batches of the shake in preparation for their next encounters. In light of Nick's apparent enthusiasm, Eric figured they could up the ante a bit: in addition to a shake after their hookup, they were both polishing off one beforehand. Soon enough, the stuffed feeling only amplified their libidos despite the mild discomfort, and the results were starting to show on both of their waistlines...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======Three Weeks Later=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick woke up feeling drowsy, having had a bit of a binge before he went to bed the previous night. As he rolled from his back onto his side and then attempted to sit up, he was surprised to feel a soft roll of fat collected at his waistband. He brought both hands to it and gave it a squeeze, feeling the soft flesh slide and bulge between fingers. He pulled his electric scale from the closet and stepped on it, watching the numbers shift until it settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n145, it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was both shocked and not surprised; he hadn't weighed himself since he started packing on the pounds with Eric, but he knew that had to be correct.  He'd been downing one of the shakes every day for the last three weeks, and meeting with Eric every few days to refresh his supply. Eric, he knew, had also filled out a bit, and though he hadn't announced a change to his numbers Nick could see hints of new flesh in the roundness of his cheeks and the wobble of his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick threw on some clothes, noting the tightness of the waistband on his athletic shorts and the way his little paunch stretched the front of his black tee shirt. He wandered into the kitchen, reaching into the fridge for his morning shake, and noted with surprise that there were fewer left than he anticipated. This had been happening frequently since he started stocking them, and Eric was convinced that Nick was simply in denial about how many he was consuming when he asked for refills. It was then that Nick glanced from the fridge into the living room, where Diego was lazing on the couch with his shirt off, playing video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick took in the visual, he had a growing suspicion his roommate was pilfering his shakes. After seeing the tubbier Diego a few weeks prior, he was shocked by how much rounder he had become.  What had been merely tight boxer briefs were now obscene, a rip in the side seam exposing smooth brown flesh, and a few inches higher was Diego's corpulent belly. His chest had puffed out and his nipples had expanded to match their larger size, and his face had softened considerably, his full lips now framed by chubby cheeks and a rounder jaw with a hint of double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was gawking, he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket.  A text from Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You coming over tonight after work? I've missed feeding that cute little face</i>, it said.<br>\r\n<i>Sure thing\u2014but do you mind if I pick up some more shakes? I'm out again</i>, he replied.<br>\r\n<i>Already!?! Someone's getting pretty greedy! I'm happy to help, but hopefully you can pitch on the supplies because my parents are getting suspicious of my spending</i>, he said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric responded affirmatively, then considered his options. He was intrigued by Diego's growth, but couldn't decide if he wanted to confront him about the shakes or not\u2014he liked seeing his roommate fatten up, but he didn't want to invite questions about his own growth quite yet. Maybe he should invite Eric over to meet Diego instead; he might be able to \"size up \" the situation, or even entice Diego to confess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up from his phone at his tubby roommate, and noticed an empty container peeking out from beside the couch...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick stuffed his phone back in his shorts and walked toward Diego, who didn't take his eyes off the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Diego...\" He said, noting with surprise that Diego looked even bigger up close, his chest wobbling as he mashed buttons on his controller, \"...have you been drinking the shakes in the back of the fridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished his sentence, Diego's eyes widened and he jolted upright, his foot not-so-furtively kicking the emptied container out of sight. \"What shakes?\" he asked, doing his best to sound sincere but failing to hide the panic in his eyes. Diego pulled a nearby tee shirt over his head, but as he did so the shirt seemed to catch on the rolls at his sides before stopping halfway past his love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fess up, chubs,\" Nick replied, his tone an unsettling combination of angry and teasing, and walked over to poke Diego's exposed flesh, \"I had some shakes in the back of the fridge but they keep disappearing before I can finish them...and I saw the empty bottle you just tried to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego heaved himself up to face Nick, trying in vain once again to pull the shirt down over his belly.  When he finally conceded the battle, the shirt had rolled up above his navel. \"I'm sorry, Nick...I saw you drinking them for breakfast and I thought I'd try one to see what the big deal was...but they're fucking delicious, man, I couldn't help myself.\" Diego had absentmindedly started to rub his stomach as he said this, practically salivating at the thought. Nick, who had been meeting his gaze, looked down at Diego's belly and back up again, raising his eyebrow at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego realized what had happened and stopped rubbing; he folded his arms across his chest, as if that would hide the bulging gut, and smiled sheepishly. \"I've...uh...been pretty hungry lately, and they really hit the spot. I'm sorry for taking them; I promise I'll stop.\" It was then that he first noticed Nick's little paunch, his black tee shirt failing to disguise the added weight at point-blank range, and he returned Nick's poke with a quick one of his own. Diego's chubby brown finger sank in a short way, then he withdrew it before giving Nick's middle a pat.  \"Someone else seems to have been hungry these days, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Nick was the one who'd been caught. \"Must have been the munchies...I should probably skate more, eat less, but clearly you know how the wake-and-bake life can catch up with you...\" Nick said, grabbing a hold of one of Diego's handles and shaking it. He felt his crotch start to stir as Diego's torso wobbled, and he noticed Diego smiling while he jiggled. He let go, gave his roommate a quick smile, and attempted to change the subject. \"Well, now that that's over, I hope you'll stop stealing my food, tubbo.\" He started to make his back to his room: \"I gotta get to work, so I'm gonna get dressed and head out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a sec...\" Diego called out. \"Do you have any idea how many calories are in this shake? I'd been getting a little thicker before these came along, but as soon as I started sneaking these I fucking ballooned.\" He started to walk toward Nick, who could hear his heavier footsteps behind him. \"You wanna guess how much I weigh now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gulped before turning to face Diego. When he turned around, Diego had stripped off the tee shirt-turned-crop top and was holding his belly in both hands. \"No idea...how big are you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego smiled before answering. \"I just hit 200 this week. I was 150 just a few months ago.\" He walked up to Nick with a surprising newfound confidence, his gut seeming to lead as he walked, and bumped it into Nick's little pooch. \"And it was all intentional, plus a little unexpected help from your shakes. I guess that shouldn't be surprising to you: I'm a gainer, and I think you might be too, 'little guy'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was exactly why Nick had been worried about confronting Diego: he wasn't sure he was ready to share his secret with anyone, even his best friend. But then again, Diego came out as a gainer without much prompting. Nick steeled himself and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick thought better of confronting Diego now\u2014besides the fact he was already running behind for work, he thought it might be more fun to catch him in the act. Or better yet, perhaps Eric would be open to mixing enough shakes for a third person; Nick thought Diego looked better with the extra weight, and the shakes seemed to agree with him. Nick quickly dressed for work, noting the troubling tightness of his non-elastic clothing, and made his way toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, Diego\u2014and put on a shirt, you're living like a slob!\" he said jocularly as he made his exit. Diego had managed to grab a new snack in the intervening minutes, and Nick heard Diego say \"Later!\", though the word was muffled by a mouthful of tortilla chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was out the door, he texted Eric:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey babe, how about you come to my place tonight instead? My roommate has been stealing my shakes and making a total pig of himself\u2014I think we could have some fun with him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric responded quickly. <i>I need more details, mister, but I'm in.Shall I make dinner for us? I can make more than gainer shakes. ;)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great. I'll pick you up at 6:30 tonight. Looking forward to stuffing myself with your cooking. ;)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric replied to that last text with a photo of himself captioned <i>Did someone say stuffing?</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photo showed Eric in his underwear, propped up against his headboard and looking even heavier than Nick had recalled. He had a look of bliss on his face, tempered by a tinge of discomfort\u2014his hands were gripping the sides of his swollen belly, and he had two empty containers of gainer shake resting on his gargantuan thighs. Nick suddenly winced as he realized that his erection, combined with 20 extra pounds, had made his pants painfully tight. He tried his hardest to not think of Eric's gloriously fattened form, but realized at this rate he'd be late for work if he waited for it to go down. He drove off, making plans to handle his situation in the restroom as soon as he got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a dull day at work, Nick made a quick trip home to freshen up. He showered, combed his hair, and put on a button-up shirt\u2014from the way buttons strained and the fabric stretched across his little pot belly, he had a hunch it wouldn't last in his wardrobe much longer. <i>Maybe Eric has some old clothes he could lend me...</i> he thought as he dressed, recalling how Eric had been only slight larger than he was now only a few months ago. He made a mental note to ask Eric when he picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at Eric's dorm, he checked his hair in the mirror, noting for the first time in a while he was actually trying to impress a guy. From the corner of his eye, he saw a figure carrying a large paper grocery bag approaching, and he turned to look. He could see Eric's face peeking out from above it, and he got out to open the car door for him like a gentleman.  \"Could you take this for a sec? Thanks,\" Eric said quickly, handing the grocery bag to Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Nick realized what the grocery bag had been obscuring. Nick looked <i>enormous</i> compared to just last week. While his face hadn't grown much fatter (it was still the least changed by his weight gain), the rest of him seemed to have rapidly expanded. He was dressed in a stylish button-up and slim-fit jeans, but by all accounts these clothes were entirely inappropriate for someone his size. Because he wasn't wearing an undershirt, with every breath he took the spaces between his shirt buttons stretched to expose his spectacularly fleshiness. Belly fat seemed ready to burst through these gaps, and at the bottom of the shirt an inch or so of overhang was visible\u2014his gut had grown nearly proportionate to his ass at long last. Speaking of his posterior, the jeans were nearly painted on: he had two sizable saddlebags protruding from the waist of his pants that blossomed outward before drooping over his belt, and every curve of his thighs and ass were visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was stunned, taking in the sight of Eric's new growth, and that seemed to be exactly the reaction Eric was looking for.  He did a quick turn for Nick before approaching to give him a kiss. \"Like what you see?\" he said flirtatiously, cupping his exposed overhang his hands. Nick, unable to speak, nodded in awe. \"Don't worry, this display was just for you: I brought a new shirt to change into, but this was the shirt I was wearing when you first agreed to get fatter for me. I wanted you to know I kept up my end of the bargain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick chuckled. \"How much are you weighing now, anyway?\" he asked as he loaded the groceries into the backseat. \"250 pounds\u201434 pounds in three weeks!\" Eric replied, lowering his heft into the passenger side of the vehicle. As he did so, the car sank with him, bumping Eric's head as he leaned into his vehicle. \"Oh, sorry! I didn't realize I was THAT heavy!\" He apologized, but there was a hint of pleasure in his voice. Nick climbed into the driver's seat, and looked over at the gorgeous boy. Eric smiled, his rounder cheeks bunching up as he did, and Nick reached over to grab the exposed flab at his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I change, I have a treat for you!\" Eric exclaimed. \"Ready?\" Nick nodded. Eric took a deep breath, sucking in his stomach, and then exhaled forcefully, causing his belly to expand rapidly. In a cascade of pings, each of the shirt's buttons went flying about the car and his torso took on an almost liquid quality as it jiggled and heaved.  A stray button bounced off the dashboard and struck Nick's forehead, but the pain was nothing compared to the pleasure of taking in Eric's enormous body.  He leaned over and pulled Eric close to him, Nick's hands sinking into the soft flesh of his lower back. Eric's fattened torso filled up the space between them surprisingly quickly, and when he could get no closer Nick strained his neck to kiss Eric deeply on the mouth. \"This is going to be an amazing evening, babe.\" Nick said, looking into Eric's eyes. \"I agree, but could you let me sit back so I can change into my shirt? I don't want to get a ticket for public indecency!\" he said, shimmying his chest in a way that made every inch of his torso quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at Nick's apartment, Eric picked up the groceries from the back seat. His new button-up fit his well-rounded corpulence in a pleasing way and the jeans, which had not been replaced, flaunted his admirable assets. As Nick opened the door to the apartment, he saw Diego frantically rifling through a pile of shirts at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, none of these fucking things fit me anymore!\" he cried out, his chubby torso wobbling from the frenzied activity. Nick watched for a second as he surveyed the damage: several of the shirts had rips, buttons had scattered across the floor, and there were a surprising number of candy wrappers interspersed among the pile of fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick cleared his throat to get Diego's attention, and Diego responded with wide-eyed and round-faced surprise. He grabbed an oversized hoodie from the sofa next to him and zipped it up to cover his gut. \"This is Eric\u2014Eric, this is my roommate Diego...who seems to be having trouble getting dressed this evening.\" Diego looked a little ashamed as the words left Nick's lips, but then he noticed Eric. His jaw nearly dropped at the sight of the gorgeous chub, but he quickly regained his composure though his eyes covertly darted to examine every curve of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nice to meet you, man\u2014I was just heading out to meet some friends, but I'm having a little trouble getting dressed as you can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stepped forward and embraced Diego in a hug. \"I've been looking forward to meet you for a while now; are you sure you can't join us for dinner? I'm cooking, and I bought enough ingredients for three.\" Eric pressed his body against Diego's, and Diego seemed to press back as the sumptuous fat of their midsections collided. Nick smiled as he saw Diego's face soften into a pleased expression and he wrapped his arms tightly around Eric. This was just about all the confirmation he needed that Diego was not only getting fat on purpose, but liked it on others too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diego released from the hug, his expression was conflicted. \"Look, I promised the guys I'd meet them out at this bar in a bit...but I AM famished.\" Nick spoke up: \"You should join us! Eric's a helluva of a cook, if you can't tell from looking at him, and he really did plan to cook for three.\" He stepped up behind Eric, wrapping his arms around him and patting Eric's hefty gut, letting his hands caress it as they returned to his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego stood in thought for a moment, then replied \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

It appeared that the app was more focused on creating community people people with particular kinks than it was connecting people who wanted to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nick came to this realization, he ended up just screwing around on the app. One tab had a list of various sexual fetishes people listed on their profiles. And he was having fun just scrolling through and seeing what kind of weird, kinky stuff people were into. There were people who got off over the idea of women getting flatten like a cartoon character, guys who got hard thinking about women giving them piggy back rides, and folks who wanted to be transformed into inanimate objects. The skater snickered and laughed at some of the photos people posted trying to play out their bizarre fantasies. He really got a kick of the woman pretended she had been flattened like a piece of paper by a steamroller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping the home icon on Fetter, Nick brought up the full list of kinks and searched for a new one to look at. Flickering through, there were a few that caught his eye. Apparently, there are people in something called stuffing where guy and girls eat loads of food. He saw another link for people into inflation. \"Holy shit,\" Nick said while laughing. \"People get off to the idea of blowing up like an actual balloon? No way!\" And then he saw a link for people into something called SSBHM. \"What the hell does that stand for?\" he asked to himself.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Nick Stein is a 21 year old skater boy who spends his days laying around his apartment, working a job at a local warehouse to pay the bills, getting high, and (you guessed it) riding around his hometown of New Porthampton on his skateboard. Standing at 5'9\", he has piercing blue eyes, a medium tan, a handsome face, and a mop dirty blonde hair. Thanks to good genetics and the exercise, Nick is rail-thin at 125 pounds and without an ounce of fat on him. This is a source of playful teasing from his best friend and roommate Diego Hernandez, who's 5'8\" and 150 pounds with shaggy black hair, a round face, rich dark skin, and warm brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Nick, he's been able to keep his trim waist and flat stomach without much work thanks to his hyperactive metabolism. Unluckily for Nick, that metabolism is going to grind to a halt very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules &amp; Guidelines<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Please put some effort into your chapters. Avoid things like single sentence chapters, horrendous grammar, unreadable formatting, and the like. Short chapters are fine if they are trying to drive the story in a particular direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) The focus of this story should be on weight gain, and it should focus on Nick in particular. Other characters can get big alongside Nick, however he is the main character and needs to be growing. But feel free in include things that are weight gain adjacent e.g. bloating, slob, or button popping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) This is fiction, but not fantasy. Please keep weight gain somewhat realistic and don't include this like magic or science fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Sex and graphic content is allowed, both gay and straight. But keep the focus on the overall story on weight gain and not on sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Characters who are minors and their weight gain is permissable. However, they should not be involved in any sort of sexual acts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) This is a kind of \"choose your own adventure\" story, so please make your chapters options as kinds of choices for Nick to make. For example, try to make your options in the form of \"Nick chose X or Nick chose Y\" rather than \"X happened to Nick or Y happened to Nick\". Ignore this suggestion if you need to move the story's timeline along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) Characters cannot be killed off. And please don't write about anything gross like scat or vomit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, have fun.</td>",
