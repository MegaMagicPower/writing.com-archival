It's a fool's mission. You're sure you have must have annoyed to council to be given this mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Master, sector 1112-023 has been scanned. Nothing found\", Oma-da announces breaking T-Wana from his meditation. T-Wana points his finger in another direction and says, \"That way\". Oma-da tilts her head and says, \"Master, there is nothing on that direction. We scanned it already and found nothing\". T-Wana smiles and says, \"I didn't ask you to scan it again. I said to take the ship in that direction. Yes the scanners did not reveal anything and what is even stranger is that I did not sense anything. Even in space the Force exist. It mingles between microscopic dust and the hardy lifeforms that live within. Yet, right there I don't sense anything. Something is being hidden\". Oma-da's eyes get wide and says, \"Master, who would be capable of doing something like that\"? T-Wana frowns as that is a question he has already himself and replies, \"No one that I know of. No Jedi has that amount of power or skill with the force\". T-Wana works to suppress his fear as Oma-da turns the ship and engages the engines. Oma-da is young and does not know yet the oddness of this. As the ship moves closer to the region of space in question T-Wana squirms a little. T-Wana is particular sensitive to the force. It is why he was told he was picked for this mission. Unlike other Jedi he can actually see it flowing about. As the ship nears this region of space he becomes more uneasy. A part of him wants to yell to Oma-da to turn around. Oma-da must be starting to feel it as well as she is starting to look uneasyl. \"Master, I have a bad feeling about this. We should turn around\", she says. T-Wana feels it as well and it only re-assures him that they are on the right path. Most Jdei would have never noticed this and few other would be going towards it. It's almost as if it was created to keep not just force sensitives out, but everyone. It speaks to a primal portion of the mind telling you to run the other way. T-Wana wipes the sweat from his brow and says, \"Oma, set the navigation computers on automatic and time lock them. Set them not to unlock until we are through this\". With her hands shaking she does as her Master commands. He then looks out as the darkness gets closer. He looks to the side and sees the flow of the force starting to ebb and vanish. Even with all his skills as a Jedi master he still digs his fingers into the armrest of the seat as they enter this strange area of space.</span></div></div>",

When they emerge on the otherside T-Wana amazed by what he sees with his Force sensitive eyes. It's a world more rich with the Force than any he has ever seen. \"Oma we have found it, we have found llume\", he says quietly. Oma is more preoccupied with something else to hear. \"Master, we are surrounded by three ships of unknown design. They have us in some sort of tractor beam\", she exclaims. T-Wana takes his eyes off the planet and flips on the communicator. \"Attention, unknown vessels. I am T-Wana on a special mission from the Jedi council\", he starts to say but is cut off. A voice breaks in saying calmly, \"We know who you are Jedi. You will come with us\". T-wana sits back in his seat. \"Master, I'm unable to detect the nature of the tractor beam they are using\", Oma announces. T-Wana looks about the ship. The swirling colors of the Force wrap around it. Not only does he see it, but he can feel it very strongly. These unknown pilots are skilled and strong with the Force. This is confusing. If they were Jedi they would have introduced themselves as such. If they were the Sith there would not be so many and he and Oma would have been destroyed. There was though a story he heard once, a fairy told to young Padawans of a third people. \"Could it be\", he thinks to himself.</span></div></div>",

The planet swirls with the power of the force. They descend through light cloud coverage to a small spaceport, but T-Wana's attention is on a building not far off. He senses that whoever dwells there is powerful with the force. T-Wana and Oma exit their vessel and are greeted by the pilots of the other ship. Oma looks to the objects attached to their uniforms. They are very familar to the young one and T-Wana as well. Each one of these strangers has at least a dozen light sabers. T-Wana approaches, bows, and says, \"I am honored to meet the legendary Saber Knights\". A voice then comes form behind and low. \"An honor it is Jedi. Long time has it been since someone from outside our order come to llume\", it says. The crowd parts and out walks Yoda, or atleast someone from his race. As if he is able to hear T-Wana's thoughts (probably because he can) he then says, \"Yes, Yoda, a distant relitive. Hosol, my name is. Walk with me you will.

A rare gift your Force sight is. Only one other I have met who has ever had it. Vadu, leader of our order he is. Only need to let go control of your emotions you must\". T-Wana stops dead in his tracks. This is not the first time he has heard this kind of talk. Using your emotions to increase your power is a tactic used by the Sith. Could his belief about the Saber Knights have been wrong. They may be no better than the Sith. He and Oma could be in great danger. Hosol holds up his hand and says, \"Understand you do not. Vadu you must meet\". Hosol motions for him to follow. T-wana uses his Jedi training to supress his fears and follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A short time later they arive at the temple. Hosol rings a rather large bell and then says, \"Come shortly, Vadu will\". Hosol then walks off. T-Wana scans the area. The temple is stronger with the force than any other place he has ever been. It appears to be very,very old. Many Force sensitives have been here. Just then T-Wana feels a disturbance in the force and turns towards it. \"I am Vadu, Jedi Master T-Wana\", a voice in his mind announces.

Vadu's scales glitter like metal, but T-Wana does not see this. What he see's is the Force flowing around him, through him, and out of him. T-Wana gathers himself and says, \"Greetings Vadu, if your intention is to sway me to the darkside we have nothing to discuss\". Vadu erupts into laughter. This was not the response that T-wana expected, but is not a good sign. If the leader of these Saber Knights cannot control his emotional outbursts then they might possiably be swayed to the darkside. The voice in his head speaks again, \"Young Jedi, your masters are misguided as are the Sith. Jedi believe they can reach balance in the force by denying half of it. The Sith believe they can have ultimite power, but not have that power tempered with wisdom and virtue. We Saber Knights were the original Force religion. We have balance by accepting everything. We do not deny or attempt to control what we are. The Force is not light or dark. Many thousands of years ago the First One understood this, his children did not. One of them founded the Jedi, the other the Sith. They converted many Saber Knights to their sides before the First One cast them out and hid this world. They then went out and because of their unbalanced beliefs about the force cast he galaxy into war that lasted centuries with each side gaining advantage for a short time only to fall and have the other gain advantage. This goes on to this day. Your order is even now about to loose it's advantage. I see the Sith even now growing in power as the Jedi weaken\". T-Wana steps back. Every thing that Vadu says flies in the face of what he has been taught. \"The Sith, gaining power. What is he talking about? The Jedi would have seen this\", T-Wana thinks to himself. \"The Jedi do not see it because they are blind to the actions of the Sith. The Sith use the force in a way that the Jedi cannot accept. Though we Saber Knight have never taken sides in the Sith Jedi war I have seen the number of lives that will be lost with the Sith in control once more. Even though it is years away I can feel and see the tremors in the force caused by their actions. Unlike before this time they will have the ability to destroy entire worlds in one stroke. I can't envolve the Saber Knights in your war. However, I can train you young Jedi and send you back to warn your fellow Jedi\".</span></div></div>",

At first, he seemed uninteresting, a normal humanoid who was found and adopted by a loving humanoid family. Thus, he was left alone... until his tenth birthday when his life changed forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream came again that night, as it had come every night for the past year. Lights were flashing and sirens were sounding all around him inside a hallway with people of every size, age, and description running passed him. Jake could not tell where he was, but he could sense danger and panic all around him. A muffled explosion shook the hallway and Jake saw fire surging towards him. A scream echoed from his mouth, just as someone from the frantic crowd swept him into his arms as he ran with the flames scorching his heals. He carried Jake though two other hallways, into a small room where a large number of people were desperately talking in a strange language he did not understand. An ear shattering explosion shook the room with a jolt and the door closed with a loud hiss, just as a slender young woman reached it with a small child in her arms. She pounded on the glass window of the door as four men inside the room desperately tried to force it open. A smaller, muffled explosion shook the room and it moved away from the woman on the other side of the door. Jake heard himself call out to her as stars came between him and her. He saw tears running down her face as she mouthed out his name, just before a brilliant flash filled his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake woke up in a pool of sweat, as he had every night before since the repeating nightmares had started. Only this time, his frustrations got the best of him and he screamed out, clenching his fists. At that very moment, something clicked inside of him and an unknown force exploded from his body, leveling the walls around him. He jumped and looked around to hind his room, his house, his entire block flattened! Shaking, he searched for his adopted parents but they were nowhere to be seen. \"Mom... Dad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, they had left to find him a present for his birthday. They returned later to find their entire block leveled and Jake missing as he had run away, fearing he had killed them and others. This sudden display of power, though it baffled Jake's town, did not go unnoticed. The power was felt a far distance by both the Jedi and the Sith. It was only a question of who would investigate first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tears fall from Jakes red eyes as he continues to run down the streets filled with people of different sizes and shapes, and yet still Jake did not slow down, he did not stop as he bumped into people rudely pushing them out of his way as he continued to run as if he was a solider on a dire mission. All Jake wanted to do was run, run away from the pain of losing everything, of losing the people he loved the most, his parents. Jake didn\u2019t know what that mysterious force was that had enveloped his entire being, that destroyed his whole entire town, but deep down he knew that he was the cause of its birth. So he had to run, he had to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake upon hearing his name get called abruptly stops running, and with out wasting time looks for the source. As Jake looks through the entire crowd of people a face becomes clear, a face all to familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSara!\u201d Jake shouts out, happiness quite evident in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara Olen was jakes childhood friend. They had known each other since day one of Jake being adopted by his loving family. Sara was one of the only friends Jake had made, that didn\u2019t really see him as weird, so they had a close relationship, the only problem was that Sara lived in the city of Sule, while Jake lived in the neighboring town of luminous. So it was quite difficult for them to see each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara upon seeing Jake in the middle of the crowd of people rushes over to him and hugs him with all of her strength, an act that caught Jake a little off guard, and yet the act wasn\u2019t unwelcome, especially after everything Jake had been through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake thank all the gods in the universe that you are ok.\u201d Sara says with happiness in her voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be ok?\u201d Jake asks a little confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara releases Jake from her hug and looks at him with serious and yet confused eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you ask that, your town it was just destroyed by a mysterious attack.\u201d Sara says looking right into Jakes eyes with sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one knows where the attack came from but the Republic is looking into it, this is a serious matter, many people think it is the immortal empire.\u201d Sara says with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was amazed how word had already traveled about his town being destroyed, all ready speculation was already being made about the nature of the supposed attack. The immortal empire, one of the many enemy\u2019s of the Republic and The alliance, that symbolized peace between the different colonies of both The republic and the empire, was being Blamed for the tragedy Jake had caused. That was how Jake wanted it . The last thing he wanted was for people to believe it was him that destroyed the town of luminous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy that you managed to escape the town in time Jake.... where, where are your parents?\u201d Sara asks turning her head left and right looking for them. Soon her eyes focus back on Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sees Sara\u2019s hopeful gaze staring at him, and just couldn\u2019t take it. Jake turns away from Sara and stares at the ground beneath his feet in shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-my parents are dead.\u201d Jake says in a low whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s face becomes pale, and all of the joy within her face quickly vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sara asks hoping with all of her might that she didn\u2019t just hear what she thought she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jake said as he continued to run down the street. As Jake ran he could hear Sara behind him calling his name, but soon this to disappeared as he vanished into the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake soon makes it outside of the city boards and what awaited him was thick jungle, as far as the eye could see. This was the Forest of Mindo, a thick forest filled with tall trees and wild animals. The whole city of Sule rested right near this forest, and even though it was dangerous Jake didn\u2019t care. He just needed to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation Jake runs into the forest not looking back at the civilization he was leaving behind. As he stepped into the jungle Jake thought about his parents he believed to be dead, he thought about Sara, and the friendship he was forsaking. Tears once again began to fall from his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthors notes <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope you liked my version of the story. Not a lot of action but I\u2019m going to continue working on it. Please add. I love Star Wars but when it comes to information about characters and locations I don\u2019t know a lot. So I\u2019m pretty much starting over from scratch. So this story is after Yoda, Luke skywalker, it\u2019s after all of the recorder grand masters of Star Wars history. So we are beginning something brand new. So please try to keep that in mind </span></div></div>",

That was cheap for a ship, making Jake believe it was stolen or found and repaired. Still, it was a lot of credits and he only had five hundred credits to his name so he tried to bargain with them. Waving his hand to show he had no weapons, he calmly said, \"Five hundred credits is a good bargain, since it is not rightfully yours to sell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jawas turned to each other then turned back to Jake before repeating his statement in their own language. Jake, knowing the basics of their language, smiled and gave them the credits before boarding the ship. It was a modified RZ1 A-Wing Interceptor, and in very good condition. Not that Jake knew anything about the ship, or cared, so long as it got him to the next star system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The controls seem easy enough to understand.\" muttering to himself, he said. \"It looks like someone upgraded the weapons on this thing.\" he shrugged. \"Let's hope I don't need to use them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jake activated the engines with a quick series of buttons and piloted the ship out into space.

Goodbye, dad.\" tearfully, he whispered. \"May the next life treat you well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Jake, in another star system, a tall man in strange robes looked out a window, over a large planet as a another, very small, man approached him. \"You sense something, Skywalker, yes you do.\" serious, the little man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Yoda are a very insightful people.\" calmly, the man, Skywalker said. \"I sensed a brief but powerful disturbance in The Force, I can not tell where it came from but it felt like a birth of the mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Jedi sensed this when The Force awakened in you.\" smiling, Yoda replied. \"The Yoda before me thought you to be the chosen one, he was right in many ways.\" pausing, Yoda added, \"I sensed this disturbance as well but I feel we shall meet this one soon enough, let him come to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm concerned that the new Vader will find him before then.\" frowning, Skywalker said. \"Still, its his destiny. He will have to chose his own path and we can only hope he chooses wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Jake brought his ship out of hyper drive and scanned the surrounding Space for a planet to stop and earn credits to refuel and move on. Only as he did, he sensed a powerful presence in two separate directions. He paused, wondering what to do. To his right, was a blue planet. A strange feeling was coming from that direction. He had a good feeling about it, which made him nervous but also curious. To his left, however, he had a bad feeling. In that direction was a green planet. Ahead of him, a brown planet showed up on the sensors. Oddly, this planet had no feeling to it at all, which was not a good sign either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Jake decide to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't have enough fuel to get to either the blue or green planets on his fuel tank, the brown planet was closer, so he had a better chance of reaching it. He asked the computer to plot a course for the brown planet, which he saw on the ship screen was named Raxus Prime. His fuel tank would get him as far as the planet's surface, but no further. He had heard of Raxus Prime, it was the galaxy's junkyard, the only inhabitants, as far as he knew, were the indigenous animals, mutated by centuries of waste. It was the last place in the galaxy that Jake could hope to make his fortune. But it was all he could do, he couldn't get to any of the other planets, they were too far off. He had nearly reached the planet. He could see it out the window. It looked like it was burning, the fumes of burning rubbish blocking his view of the planet's surface. His ship entered the upper atmosphere. The atmosphere was full of thick gas, thick enough to carry the ship. He turned the ship engines off, so he wouldn't risk igniting the flammable gases in the atmosphere. He then simply waited. There it was, a pocket of thinner air. He turned the ship to find the thinner air current, and felt his stomach leap. His ship dropped like a stone. He closed his eyes. Suddenly, the ship came to an abrupt halt. It stopped so quickly, that Jake was thrown forward and his head banged into the front screen. Just before he lost consciousness, he saw through the screen, a hooded and cloaked figure, both of his arms raised. Then, Jake knew no more.   </span></div></div>",

Each student held a single lightsaber and was fighting against another lightsaber. In the center of the room stood a woman, her arms out to either side. \"This is Saber Master Sona Seer\" said Yano. As he spoke, the lightsabers flew towards Sona Seer and deactivated, attaching themselves to her tunic. <br>\r\n\"This lesson is over for now\" she said \"Go and work on your lightsaber technique\" <br>\r\nSona Seer walked towards Yano. \"Master Yano, to what do I owe the pleasure?\" she asked <br>\r\n\"This is Jake from Tatooine 2\" said Yano \"He wishes to join our order, I thought you could give him some training in force usage\" <br>\r\n\"Leave him with me, i'll give him an introduction to the Force\" said Sona. Yano bowed and left. <br>\r\n\"You need not be afraid, Jake\" said Sona \"I can sense you are strong in the force, now, what do you know about the force?\" <br>\r\n\"It is an energy that is all around us, certain people can harness it, but some are afraid of being corrupted, I am not familiar with which side the Saber Knights fall on\" said Jake<br>\r\n\"The Saber Knights exist to keep the balance between Jedi and Sith\" said Sona \"Since we are neither Jedi or Sith, we are not limited by our emotions, we can use the force no matter our emotional state, but we are also capable of restraint, we each carry multiple lightsabers, and are capable of controlling many of them at once\" She demonstrated by controlling six lightsabers in the air. Suddenly, one of them ignited and flew towards Jake. Jake flinched, but the lightsaber stopped in front of him, turned round so the hilt was pointing at him and hung there. He grabbed it. <br>\r\n\"The Force is described as a sixth sense\" said Sona \"And in a way, it is, a popular Jedi training technique is to put helmets on their younglings to deprive them of sound and sight and let them sense the bolts and deflect them, we also use this technique\" A helmet flew into Sona's hand, as well as a small, round object. She placed the helmet on Jake's head. Sight and sound ceased to be for Jake. Sona watched him. She turned on the training droid in her hand, and backed away. The droid fired. The lightsaber in Jake's hand moved of it's own accord, blocking the blaster bolt and sending it off to the side. He could sense everything around him, as if he didn't have a helmet on at all. He suddenly felt a strange vibe from Sona. It was similar to the dark vibe he had got when looking at the planets earlier. He had allowed himself to get distracted and a bolt had got past his defenses. The bolt hit his left leg. He deflected the next bolt and the next, feeling the bolts as they came. <br>\r\n\"Enough\" said Sona. The blaster fire ceased. Jake pulled off his helmet. <br>\r\n\"You certainly have the gift\" said Sona \"Master Yano was right to bring you here, you could be the strongest Saber Knight ever\"<br>\r\n\"What do I do now?\" asked Jake. Sona considered for a moment.  </span></div></div>",

There were no desks in the room. It was well lit for others convenience, but from what Daria told him, Master Horus didn't need light to see by. Lastly, Jake's eyes took in Horus himself. He was quite a tall man with a strong stature and the look of a warrior, emphasised by the five lightsabers hanging from his belt. His eyes were covered by a grey piece of cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both the Jedi and the Sith teach the technique of the third eye,\" said Horus, his voice rang with the power his stature presented as well as thee wisdom behind his blinded eyes \"Both use different techniques to do it, the Jedi use these-\" he held up what looked like small, metal spheres in one hand \"-they are made to wear a helmet to block their eyes, remember that your eyes can deceive you, don't trust them, the Sith use a different tactic to train the third eye-\" Horus pressed a button and a hidden door opened in one of the walls of the classroom to reveal three silver combat droids, each holding a variety of different weapons in their multiple arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Saber Knights, however, use a mixture of both of these methods,\" said Horus. As he said it, shutters on each of the windows came down, blocking out the light from outside, the combat droids as well as the spheres in Horus's hand turned themselves on, and all the lights in the room went out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake panicked a bit. he had not yet been given a lightsaber to use to defend himself, and he couldn't see anything.He prepared himself to dodge any of the blaster bolts that came his way. He had no idea how he would dodge the combat droids, but he would have to figure something out, and fast.    </span></div></div>",

To his relief, a loud clang was heard as the droid landed a fist on something just beyond his open hand. \"I think I did it.\" whispering, Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt another swing coming but it had the sound of metal swishing through the wind. Curious, he did not hear any heavy breathing, meaning it had to be a droid unlike the person five paces behind him. <i>\"How am I hearing that!?!\"</i> Jake did not have the time to ponder over that as he felt a breeze too close to his face and he dodged, feeling something breeze through his hair. \"This is getting serious!\" whispering, Jake muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swishing sound came again and Jake used the force again, blocking the sword with a clang. He could hear the other students screaming and moaning from the droids and flying drones taking shots at them. Jake feared that many of them were getting injured and knotted his jaws in decision. \"Enough of this!\" a glow forming over his fists he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the moves of an obsessed man, Jake lashed out at the droid  before him with one hand. There was a ripping sound of metal before the loud clang of the droid hitting the floor. There was a pause in the screams and mechanical sounds before Jake saw a number of red eyes approaching him only he remained still. A light saber came to life and took a swing at Jake only he dodged and took a spare light saber off the droid he had destroyed and counter attacked. The other droids followed but Jake threw his hand forward, throwing the small number of droids into the air. Screams were heard of the other students, scrambling to get out of the way. Jake was about to land his light saber onto the second droid when Horus called out, \"Enough!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blinds lifted, lighting the room and Jake saw that the droid before him had stopped its attack. Surprised, Jake looked around to find that Daria had leveled a number of droids and drones as well with the other students having merely held their own. \"Well done, students.\" politely, Horus said. he then turned to Daria and Jake. \"When you felt the breeze of the blade, did you know it was a droid and not a fellow student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was no breath coming from my opponent, master Horus.\" bowing, Jake replied. \"I could hear another student breathing behind me and he was further away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, very good.\" his face softening, Horus said. he turned to the class. \"The third eye does more than allow you to see danger coming, it allows you to tell the difference between an enemy and an ally in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the third eye help us see where we are going in the dark?\" curious, Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorus laughed, adjusting his blindfold. \"What do you think, young one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake smiled. \"I think I have a lot to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorus nodded. \"We are all constantly learning.\" softly, he said. \"Please report to your next class, you are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the next class?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The life of a Saber Knight is rough, you will get hard lessons and bitter experiences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we start in learning had to hand combat?\" politely, Daria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By testing each of you.\" serious, Han Solo replied. \"One by one, you will each attack me with only your physical prowess and fighting skills.

It had several tiny lenses everywhere on it that Jake guessed were low powered lasers. The drone was called a tagger, originally used to train elite Imperial troops in the use of stealth combat. If the taggers did not see and tag a cadet, it means he is doing well to avoid detection. However, in this case, the tagger was right in front of Daria and Jake so his guess was they had to fend it off with a light saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to learn how to defect a laser blast with your light saber.\" pointing to the drone Luke said. \"Now you may think that impossible but it is not. In ancient times, when we used projectile rounds, the Jedi were able to slice a round in half with a steel blade. This is no different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Luke stepped aside and the drone began to fire a small barrage of lasers at both Jake and Daria while moving about. Jake found it easier than he had feared and blocked all but three of the laser shots with his light saber. Daria had a slightly harder time but she only got tagged four times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to be all about increasing reaction times.\" curious, Daria said. \"The faster you react, the easier it is to avoid being hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke rose his hand, freezing the drone in place. \"Partly, Daria.\" serious, he replied. \"Now, ignore your senses and work on instinct alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed a helmet onto both Jake and Daria's head with the blast shield down, blocking their vision. \"This is no different than our night training with the Saber Knights.\" unimpressed, Jake said. \"How is this going to make things more difficult.\" Luke did not seem to respond. \"Luke...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the helmet was lifted and Jake heard Luke speak. \"I responded but the helmet blocks hearing as well as sight.\" softly, he said.  \"A heavy blast can damage your ears as easily as it does your eyes. When you find yourself blind and deaf, you must focus on your remaining senses and instincts defend yourself in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Luke released the drone and Jake tried his best to sense the drone. Only he took the first hit, forcing a grunt to escape his lips. \"Damn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helmet was raised. \"Seek out with your feelings, Jake.\" Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helmet was lowered again and Jake tried to do as Luke suggested. To his surprise, he found that he could feel the air being displaced slightly and moved his light saber in the direction, nothing hit him. He sensed something moving and he turned his light saber again, nothing hit but he felt a push on his light saber, he had deflected the blast. Finally, the helmet was raised and taken away and Jake saw Luke smiling slightly. \"See?\" calmly, he asked. \"You can do it, both of you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was between hyperspace jumps, Han and Chewbacca were making their way towards a spaceport to re-fuel. <br>\r\n\"You seem to have a good grasp of basic Jedi tactics,\" said Daria \"What your prior training has been lacking, is training in unusual environments, and use of the Dark Side alongside the Light.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't feel comfortable using the Dark Side yet,\" said Jake \"I fear it will corrupt me.\" <br>\r\n\"Do you wish for power over the people of this universe?\" said Daria \"The Light Side and the Dark Side are not as black and white as you might think. What makes the Sith evil, and the Jedi good? Both have great power, both are skilled fighters, and commanders. The only thing that makes them different from each other is what they choose to do with that power.\" <br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Jake, a little uncertainly. <br>\r\n\"I did anticipate you would be uncomfortable using the Dark Side,\" said Daria \"So, we're going to do some environment training.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led him to the back of the ship, pressing the button to open the hatch. Expecting the vacuum of space to suck him out as she opened it up, Jake was surprised to find that it did not. <br>\r\n\"Here, take these,\" said Daria, handing him a training lightsaber, and a breathing mask \"I had Han expand the atmospheric shell, we're going to do some training in zero gravity.\" She put on her breathing mask, and dived out into the void. Jake ran to the edge, very slowly due to the gravity decrease. He saw Daria floating in the void, lightsaber drawn in one hand, and her other hand creating a force anchor that kept her from drifting off into the void. <br>\r\n\"Come on, Jake,\" said Daria \"Just jump.\" Instead of opting for the tactic of diving head first out of the ship, Jake jumped slightly, allowing the ship to go ahead of him, leaving him in the void. Jake focused on doing what Daria did, anchoring himself to the ship. He immediately swung himself towards Daria, slashing his lightsaber towards her. Daria used her own force tether to pull herself closer to the ship, at the same time bringing up her lightsaber to block the blow. Continuing his momentum, Jake couldn't stop, slamming into the side of the ship. Winded, he climbed up the side of the ship, creating a new anchor after relinquishing the first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sensed a presence in the force, and threw himself to the ground to avoid Daria's training lightsaber, her feet skidding along the hull of the ship as she came to a stop. <br>\r\n\"If you dent my ship, I'll put a blaster bolt through your head!\" Han's voice came through the comm. <br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Daria, then ran towards Jake, her lightsaber a blur. However, in the zero gravity environment, the blur moved much slower, obscuring Daria from view. Jake couldn't see where her attack was going to come from. So he closed his eyes, and gave himself over to the force. He brought up his lightsaber, blocking where he sensed Daria's lightsaber would be, then spun around, bringing his lightsaber down to protect his midsection. Both times, lightsaber met lightsaber, sparks flying from them. </span></div></div>",

Before Han could answer, two small ships came out of hyperspace. The ship on the right appeared to be a modified version of the Old X-Wing fighters used by the Rebel Alliance, but with a different design marking it out as belonging to an outlaw. The one on the left was much larger, and looked very strange. It appeared to be a light blue body, bristling with long, blue spikes. The X-Wing banked to the right and moved along the right side of the Falcon's hull. When it had a clear shot, it fired three blasts into the Falcon. All three bounced off the forcefield. Daria ran along the Falcon and jumped, landing on the X-Wing's canopy, drawing two lightsabers mid-jump, and stabbing them into the canopy, shredding the X-Wing and it's pilot, throwing him from the canopy before leaping in herself. Turning the X-Wing, she started flying back towards the other ship. Jake jumped off the Falcon, sling-shotting the X-Wing towards the weird icicle-ship. However, before he could clear the top of the icicles, his feet found a forcefield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, get the hell off there!\" Daria's voice sounded panicked, so Jake didn't hesitate. He jumped off the forcefield. Looking back, he saw a pressure building from the ship. Then, a huge orb of energy discharged from the icicle-ship. Jake, once again sling-shot around the X-Wing, but this time, he stopped himself in front of the  X-Wing, and focused all of his force energy to create a wall of force around the X-Wing. Luckily, the orb of energy went around them, leaving the X-Wing unscathed. It hit the Falcon, however, and the light in the cockpit went out. <br>\r\n\"Must have been an electromagnetic pulse,\" said Daria \"That thing must have just shorted out the Falcon's shields, they'll be defenceless.\" <br>\r\nAll she heard was static. Examining the ship, she couldn't detect the shields using the Force, her instruments, while still functioning, had gone haywire after the pulse. She flew around the ship, sensing a large power source from the bottom of the ship. Locking onto it with the force, she fired a photon torpedo, which caught what her instincts told her was the engine. It exploded, splintering the orb-like ship in half.  </span></div></div>",

He forged the order of Saber Knights. Yano was a strange looking creature, only as tall as your knee, but one of the strongest force-users in the galaxy, his skill with a lightsaber was unequalled. With his blue skin and pointed ears, he looked a lot like Yoda himself, save his skin.   <br>\r\n\"Naboo, you must go to\" said Yano, getting directly to the point \"Under siege by the Trade Federation, Naboo is, Jedi have been sent to find out what's happening there, reveal yourself, you must not\" <br>\r\n\"Master Yano, wouldn't it be better to reveal ourselves to the Jedi, rather than leave them to struggle with what is to come?\" you ask<br>\r\n\"Reveal ourselves to the Jedi, the time for it this is not\" said Yano \"The time will come, Master Tanner, patient you must be\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a lander. The doors of the lander opened and several hover tanks rolled out. You sensed a small surge that told you the Jedi were hiding in one of the tanks. You smiled, they were good. But you were better. You quickly sneaked into Theed Palace, found a guard room and stole a uniform and gun, keeping your lightsabers hidden under your uniform, you went to the throne room and took up a position next to Queen Amidala. You were no fool. You knew you, and everyone in this room were going to be captured by the droids.

As a result of this, there were new students of all ages. You decided to sit and watch the young ones train. Saber Master Sona Seer was taking the lesson.

You instinctively used the force to slow it down. You met Sona Seer's full force concentration behind the light saber, or at least you thought it was her full concentration. Five more lightsabers were soon floating in the air, stopped by you at the same place as the others. <br>\r\n\"A Jedi would disengage and dodge the lightsabers\" you said, picking up on Sona's thread \"A Sith would use his force lightning to catch the attacker off guard, a Saber Knight does none of these things, The Lightsaber is his life and his art, he moves with the force and the lightsabers\" You jumped into the air and landed with one of your feet placed on each of two of the ligthsabers handles. You then released your force grip on the lightsabers you were not standing on and transferred all the energy to pushing back against Sona's force grip on the remaining two. The three lightsabers you had released flew at the place you had been. The other two slowly moved towards Sona Seer. You reached into your robes and drew one of your own light sabers, before igniting it. You then jumped into the air, releasing your force grip on the two lightsabers you had been standing on and withdrew your second lightsaber, landing behind Sona Seer, placing both your lightsabers in an X across her throat. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master Tanner\" said Sona Seer. You deactivated your lightsabers and used the force to help Sona Seer retrieve hers. <br>\r\nSona Seer addressed the students. \"The lightsaber can be manipulated in several ways, a Saber Knight carries many lightsabers, Master Tanner here owns several, I myself have created dozens, the point is to use the force with the lightsabers in creative ways that your opponent would not have thought of, Master Tanner did something that few would have expected, you must be unpredictable in your movements and attacks, this is the key to the Saber Knights, now, time for a tutorial in lightsaber use\" <br>\r\nThe assembled students drew and activated their lightsabers. Dozens of lightsabers flew out of Sona's robes and activated. Each one flew towards a student. The students took defensive positions, then the lightsabers attacked. You smiled. How Sona Seer controlled so many lightsabers at once, you would never know. You retreated to the side of the room and watched the students.

Eventually, just before her thirteenth birthday, she crash landed on Ilum. By lucky coincidence, she landed right in front of Saber Master Yano. Tired and hungry, her force power spent, she expected to die there. But Master Yano had other ideas. He took her to the Saber Knight Temple and nursed her back to health. When he found out about her force sensitivity, he offered her a place with the Saber Knights, but she refused, leaving to go and assassinate her former Master.

She would have also been killed if a group of Jedi had not rescued her and left the planet. By this time she was fourteen, too old to be trained in the Force by the Jedi. They planned to take her to Coruscant and put her up for adoption there.\"<br>\r\n\"How did she end up here then?\" you asked <br>\r\n\"The Jedi ship was attacked, shot down by a bounty hunter novice over Ilum, they made an emergency landing and the bounty hunter assumed they were dead, their crashed ship was found by the Saber Knights a few days later, we nursed them back to health and then asked Marielle if she wanted to stay, she said yes and we wiped the Jedi's memories of us and sent their ship back into the atmosphere repaired, Marielle stayed and trained to become a Saber Knight,\" Sona finished \"She's been training here for two years.\" <br>\r\n\"She seems like a good apprentice for me,\" you agree \"I'll talk to Yano, see if he approves, then I'll talk with her.\"</span></div></div>",

You put both your hands out to either side, using the force to pull every gun from the had of the person holding it \"Tell us where the hunter is hiding, and we'll walk out of here, and no one has to die.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked out of the canteen a few minutes later, and smiled at Maria as you did. <br>\r\n\"That was brilliant,\" you said \"If a little unorthodox, they might call the Jedi council, then they'd come here looking for the two Sith who were here.\" <br>\r\n\"We'd be long gone by then,\" said Maria \"Anyway, that's not important right now, we know where the Sith bounty hunter and the Jedi are, we need to go there.\" <br>\r\nYou rented a landspeeder, and drove it out to a moisture farm right on the edge of Mos Eisley. Stopping a few miles away, on a low hill overlooking the farm, you pulled out some binoculars and observed the farm. It seemed deserted, as Mos Eisley grew, moisture farms had to relocate further and further out because of lack of water close to the city. This one must have been abandoned long ago.<br>\r\n\"I sense one presence,\" you said \"Can you sense the other?\" <br>\r\n\"No,\" said Maria \"Feels like the Jedi is in there, the Bounty Hunter musn't be there.\" <br>\r\n\"We're clear then,\" you say \"We'll go in and free the Jedi, free them, then find the Bounty Hunter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both ran down the sand dune you had been watching from, running fast towards the farmhouse. Getting there, you found the door was locked. You pulled out a lightsaber, and cut through the lock, opening the door. The Jedi was sitting in the chair, feet and hands tied down and a gag over her mouth. <br>\r\n\"Look around,\" you said \"See if there are any clues to where the hunter has gone.\" <br>\r\nYou ran over to the Jedi, cutting through both the hand and foot ropes, and pulling off the gag. <br>\r\n\"Can you walk?\" you asked, the Jedi nodded. <br>\r\n\"Ray Tanner,\" you said, holding out your hand \"Saber Knight, we heard about you leaving the Jedi, and came to offer you a place with us.\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" said the Jedi \"Just get me out of here, before Sool gets back.\" <br>\r\n\"Why are you so scared of him?\" you asked<br>\r\n\"He's a Sith,\" she said \"More powerful than any I've ever heard about, if he comes back, we're done for.\"<br>\r\n\"Master,\" said Maria \"What's this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to her to see a 3d screen showing the planet Tatooine, coming closer and closer, passing into it's atmosphere and toward the planet below. <br>\r\n\"Space to ground missile!\" you shouted \"We need to run, now!\" <br>\r\nYou led Maria and the Jedi out of the door and away from the disused moisture farm. When you heard a whistling noise, you threw yourself to the ground as the other two did the same. A blast of heat came over your head. <br>\r\n\"That,\" said Maria \"Was a little too close.\" <br>\r\nYou looked round to see blackened sand, mere inches from where Maria was lying. <br>\r\n\"We're fine,\" said the Jedi \"We should get back to your ship, and get out of here, the bounty hunter will be off-planet by now.\" </span></div></div>",

Paying for the use of it, Cecelia contacted the council. The hologram showed a small, green creature of a species you couldn't identify, but you did recognise this particular creature. Master Yoda, the head of the Jedi order. <br>\r\n\"News, you have, Cecelia, mmm?\" said Yoda, who examined you and Maria with curiosity. <br>\r\n\"The Bounty Hunter was a Sith,\" said Cecelia \"Trained in the Dark Side, he captured me, I managed to get away with the help of these two force users.\" <br>\r\n\"Force, users you say?\" said Yoda \"Not Jedi, I think, nor Sith, but no other factions there are.\" <br>\r\n\"We are called Saber Knights,\" you said \"We have isolated ourselves from the civilized galaxy, taking in any from either the Jedi or the Sith who wish to change their ways, but will not be accepted by the opposite order, we work to maintain the balance between good and evil in the universe.\" <br>\r\n\"We can discuss this later,\" said Cecelia \"Right now, I need pickup.\" <br>\r\n\"Near your position, a Jedi team is, meet with you, they will,\" said Yoda, and the hologram turned off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all we have to do is find a defendable location and wait for the Bounty Hunter to come to us,\" said Maria, as if this was the easiest thing in the world. <br>\r\n\"I doubt it will be that easy,\" you said<br>\r\nThey quickly found a defendable location, a T-junction facing the spaceport. </span></div></div>",

They split, each going to a different flank of the bounty hunter. You put a finger to your mouth. Maria nodded, and pulled out a lightsaber, igniting it. It ignited without a sound, as you did the same. You then focussed your force powers on freeing Cecelia, while Maria charged, yelling a battle cry as she swung her lightsaber. Sool ignited his red lightsaber and brought it up to block, but in doing so, his grip on Cecelia became less secure. You used the Force to pull her away from him. You threw a lightsaber to her, and she jumped into the air with the Force to catch it, before landing in a defensive posture. After seeing that she was all right, you charged into combat with the bounty hunter. You sensed Soara Antana and her apprentice approaching, their lightsabers also drawn. Carben, apparently seeing the odds stacked against him, pulled something out of his pocket and threw it at the two Jedi.

You sliced the head off one with both your lightsabers, and then threw both lightsabers at two others, both finding their mark, before falling back through the protective net of lightsabers. Then, holding it up so Maria could concentrate more force energy on attacking Mandalorians. Maria used her double bladed lightsaber to parry several blasts at her, before using her other lightsaber to stab through the Mandalorian, stabbing into it's jet pack, then jumping away as it exploded.

The stars became streaks. The ship nav computer calculated that the hyperspace jump would take six hours. You unstrapped yourself and went to join the rest of the crew. Daria was having a lightsaber lesson with Sona. Twelve lightsabers were suspended in midair, locked together in separate battles. In the centre of this battle, Sona and Daria were similarly engaged. </span></div></div>",

Some of them were mere children, even younger than Anakin, and they were terrified, clutching their parents with terror in their eyes. You pulled all of your lightsabers from your belt, and threw them into the air, holding them up with the force. Daria and Sona's lightsabers joined them. You looked at them, and they nodded. As one, every single lightsaber in the air ignited. And dropped. There were at least twenty lightsabers in the air, and each one found a droid, slicing it vertically in half. You retrieved your lightsabers as your fellow saber knights did the same. A door opened and the thirty droids that had been hidden in reserve came out to join the ten that had survived the attack. You ignited a second lightsaber, then felt a surge in the force that could only mean one thing. A Naboo starfighters cannons blasted the droids, incinerating every single one. You watched as the ship flew out of the hangar and into the sky. <br>\r\n\"His starfighters on autopilot,\" you say \"It must be programmed to fight in the space battle above.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's move on,\" you say \"We still need to clear the rest of the droids from the palace, although I think the worst is finally over.\" </span></div></div>",

Recently, you had been taken as an apprentice by Joren Dall, the newest member of the Saber Knight council. Right now, you were training. You closed your eyes, feeling the force flow around you, you had been working on this fighting technique for some time, it was invented by Jedi Knight Tahl after she was blinded during a battle on Melida/Daan. Grand Saber Master Yano had met her while she was on a mission to Alderaan, and she had taught him the technique. The technique was in fact, a more advanced version of how youngsters learned the Force for the first time. You found it more effective than using your eyes. With your eyes still closed, you jumped onto one of the walls of the training room, using the Force to lock you in place. Then, you started to walk slowly along the wall, fighting with a force-powered disembodied lightsaber. Grand Saber Master Yano had used the Force to program the lightsabers to copy the fighting level of any opponent. As such, the lightsaber immediately engaged with you, forcing you backwards with each step. You backed up the wall towards the ceiling, giving ground, then, when you reached the ceiling, you jumped, somersaulting before landing feet first on the ground. You opened your eyes, and retrieved the force-powered lightsaber, turning it off and putting it away. You deactivated your own lightsabers and put them in your belt. <br>\r\n\"Very good, Padawan,\" said a voice.

They were, however, corrupt and used the dark side of the force to manipulate and control everyone in their empire. Two of the Rakata disagreed with the philosophies held by much of the Rakata and, with a small band of followers, left their home world and their empire far behind. It wasn't long before the Rakata began to lose their force sensitivity, but for reasons unknown,the descendants of the original two Rakata who left their home world kept their sensitivity. They settled on Ilum, where they used their force-powered technology to build a magnificent temple. Following the formation of different factions of force-sensitive, the newly formed Saver Knights, their council led by former Jedi Master Yano, decided not to get involved in any of the conflicts between them except to maintain the balance between good and evil. You are one of the descendants of the original Rakata escapees, and you are about to undertake the trials to become a Saber Master, you will undertake a mission on your own without your master. As you walk into the council room, you wonder what mission the council has decided for you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You discovered the Saber Knights when out on a mission for Plagus to the planet Ilum to gather lightsaber crystals for his Sith acolytes. During this mission, you had discovered the secret order of the Saber Knights. In the caves of Ilum, you saw yourself for the first time, what a monster you had become, what monsters you had served under, you vowed to make sure that none of those monsters would ever walk the earth again, so she left, heading for Naboo, where she knew Darth Plagus and Sidious were hiding. When she got there, however, Plagus was dead, murdered by Sidious. Sidious had gone, left Naboo to continue his plans, whatever they might be, but in the house where both of them had been hiding, you found a young girl, only about seven or eight years old, just sitting there, fear in her eyes, even though the monsters were long gone. <br>\r\n\"Come, child,\" you said \"You are safe now.\" <br>\r\nThe girl ran to you, throwing her arms around you. You were a little stunned, but hugged her back. <br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" you asked<br>\r\n\"Daria,\" she said \"You're not like them-\" at this point she gestured to the still form of Darth Plagus.<br>\r\n\"You're safe, Daria,\" you said \"Come with me.\" <br>\r\nAs you walked out of the room with Daria, you sensed a strong force presence probing you, but you shielded yourself with your own force powers. There was more to this Daria than met the eye. <br>\r\nYou, along with Daria, returned to Ilum, where you were both welcomed into the Saber Knights. After a few years, you had mastered the ways of the Saber Knights and had taken Daria as a padawan. At least in the Saber Knights, there wasn't a possibility of being killed by your padawan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years, you trained Daria in the ways of the force, but felt impatient with her progress. Whilst you had progressed quickly through the training for the Saber Knights, Daria was much slower. Eventually, whilst continuing to train Daria, you became the most competent Saber Knight with lightsabers in the temple and was offered the rank of master. You were also given the title of lightsaber instructor, instructing all of the young padawans in lightsaber training. </span></div></div>",

You wanted to get as far away from the life you had once had as you possibly could. Away from the influence of the Dark Side. Once you had done that, however, you were faced with a problem of where you were going to go next. You didn't have a home anymore. You pushed back the memories of the terrible things you had done to the people you had once called family. You felt Daria stir in the chair next to you, and you once again felt her force presence gently prodding your shields. You continued to block her out. No child should have to experience what you had. Daria was trying to comfort her with her thoughts, but to let her do so, you would have to allow her to experience your memories as you had. You refused to traumatise Daria like that. You were broken, but perhaps she could still be saved. The Jedi would not take you. You had killed too many of their kind for their forgiveness. The best you could hope for with them was a swift death. You had learned that while the Sith, in their methods, were extreme, the Jedi were similarly extreme, just in the other direction. You did not want to associate with either of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the Force had a different idea in mind, for as you were locked in indecision about which path to take, you had been subconsciously working on the controls, entering the coordinates to a planet. You were now landing on Ilum. Picking up the now-sleeping Daria, and wrapping her in blankets, you opened the back of the ship, your twin lightsabers floating around the two of you, not yet ignited, but ready to defend if it came to a fight. Yano, master of the Saber Knights, had told her how to get in contact with him. Moving away from your ship, you entered a small, ice cave. Freezing cold by this point, you carefully placed the sleeping Daria on the ground, and sat down next to her. Crossing your legs in the lotus position, you cast your mind out, searching for the small Saber Knight Grandmaster with your mind. <br>\r\n\"Let me help you,\" you saw Daria's face peeking out from the blankets \"You're going to die if you don't let me in. If we work together, we'll be able to do whatever you're trying to do. What are you afraid of?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm broken, Daria,\" you said, as the feelings you had been holding back all of this time began to erupt from you. Floods of tears began falling from your eyes \"I've seen so much pain and suffering. I don't want you to feel what I have. I don't want to do that to you.\" <br>\r\nYou felt a small hand take yours, and you looked down. Daria was holding one of your hands with both of her smaller ones, and she was looking right into your eyes with a determined expression on her face. <br>\r\n\"I'm not going to let you die, I owe you that much, you saved me from an eternity of pain and suffering, the least I can do is suffer some of yours in order to save your life.\"<br>\r\nAnd you once again felt a probing at your shield, but much stronger than before, and you heard Daria's thoughts in your head. You saw tears in her eyes as she experienced the memories you had been trying for so many years to suppress, in a few moments, but she looked up, as her eyes burned with determination. You felt her considerable force reserves, added to yours as both of you searched out with your minds, reaching out as far as you could. And finally, you felt something, a very powerful force presence, then multiple smaller ones converging on your position. As relief overwhelmed you, you felt yourself slipping into unconsciousness.  </span></div></div>",
