            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Have you ever wished you could trade your old, boring life for a brand new one? That was the question posited by the numerous advertisements for a company called <i>New Horizons</i>.  The company started about 5 years earlier; the brainchild of some eccentric millionaire.  The idea behind the company was that if you were unhappy with your current life, or simply bored with it, they\u2019d create a new one tailor-made for you.  The catch was that you\u2019d have to say goodbye to your old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll be honest; there have been times, over the last year or so, that I was very tempted to make an appointment for a consultation.  Now before you get the wrong idea, I love my family very much; so I didn\u2019t take such a serious decision lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lived in a small town in southern New Jersey; probably no more than 20 minutes to the beach and 15 minutes to Delaware.  My dad left years ago, so it was just me, my mom (Abigail), and my twin sister (Kelsey).  I know what you\u2019re probably thinking; what\u2019s so wrong with my life that I\u2019d be tempted to get a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the answer to that is rather complicated.  I wasn\u2019t popular but I\u2019ve had two friends (Kyle Williams and David Beltran) since pre-school.  I wasn\u2019t bullied (much) at school, and my home life was decent enough.  It\u2019s just that, for whatever reason, ever since I turned 13; I just wasn\u2019t happy with my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI often found myself, out in public, watching random people and imagining what it would be like to have their life for myself.  I would never admit to it in public, but there were a few times where I imagined what it would be like to live some random woman\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know; maybe one day I\u2019ll finally have the courage to make that appointment.</span></div></div>",

As I sat up in bed, I noticed the telltale smell of bacon and sausage coming from downstairs.  Today was one of those days where I almost didn\u2019t want to get out of bed; but the smells coming from downstairs, coupled with the fact that I had plans with Kyle and David, were enough to get me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed, I trudged downstairs to the kitchen; to find that Mom and Kelsey were sitting at the table eating breakfast.  I noticed that they were both giving me strange looks as I sat down, but I didn\u2019t think much of it.  That was until I heard them whispering to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlapping some bacon onto my plate, I said, \u201cWould you guys mind telling me why you\u2019re looking at me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Kelsey turned to face each other; after getting a nod of approval from Kelsey, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that you\u2019re unhappy with your life, Kevin.  Everyone knows that you\u2019ve tried your best to put on a happy front, but it\u2019s not working.\u201d  Getting up, Mom retrieved an envelope from the counter.  Handing it to me, Mom said, \u201cThere\u2019s something in <br>\r\nthis envelope that your sister and I think will help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was being cryptic for some reason, but I opened the envelope anyway.  The envelope was of a decent size; so I wasn\u2019t surprised when a pamphlet slid out onto the table.  I was, however, surprised when I saw that it was from <i>New Horizons</i>.  In shock, I looked at Mom and said, \u201cW-What\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you know what it is, sweetie.\u201d Her expression turning sorrowful, Mom said, \u201cRight there is the key to a better, happier life for you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But Mom was right, that wasn\u2019t going to happen now.  \u201cI suppose they deserve to know what\u2019s going on; I\u2019d had to leave them out of the loop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 45-minute drive to the office; so if you want to say goodbye to them, be back here by 10:45.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to leave the kitchen, I barely made it 5 feet before turning around.

We\u2019d known each other since pre-school, so they were well aware of just how unhappy I was with my life.  Arriving at our meeting spot, the fountain in the town square, I rode up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was the first one to see me; waving at me as I got closer.  \u201cHey man, where\u2019s your beach stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to talk, you guys.\u201d Stopping in front of them both, sighing, I said, \u201cSomething\u2019s come up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us went to a quiet area nearby, where I told them everything.  The expressions on their faces mirrored what I\u2019d seen on mom and Kelsey.  Once I was finished, after they\u2019d had a chance to process what I told them, Kyle said, \u201cAre you really going through with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really going through with it.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI have an appointment in a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I know you\u2019ve been unhappy for a while, but I never thought you\u2019d go this far.\u201d Looking at me, David said, \u201cYou realize that you may never see us again, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cYou guys have been my best friends for years; I\u2019ll miss you both so much, but this is something I need to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Kyle nor David was the emotional type, so I was a little surprised when they started tearing up and hugging me.  That got me going as well; the three of us were all crying for a minute or so.  \u201cI love you, man; you\u2019re my brother.\u201d Looking at me, Kyle said, \u201cI want you to know that David and I will be there for Kelsey and your mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, man.\u201d Choking up, I said, \u201cT-That means a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned to leave, David came up to me and said, \u201cPromise me one thing, man; wherever you end up, please lead a happy life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Since it was fairly likely that I wouldn\u2019t be back in town, Mom decided to drive to some of my favorite places in town,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey and mom would take turns reminiscing about some memorable events that happened at each location.  I participated too; I may not have been happy with my overall life, but there were some joyous moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particularly memorable moment that we talked about, was an incident at our 8th birthday.  We had a party in the park, all of our friends came.  Everything was going well until my uncle sat down at the picnic table; the table was off balance and fell over, causing me to get covered in birthday cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom turned towards the highway, Kelsey looked at me and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m never going to have any more memories of you, after today.\u201d Taking my hand, tearing up, Kelsey said, \u201cYou\u2019re my twin brother, my first best friend; wherever you end up, I know in my heart that you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to go through with this, Kelsey; Mom can just turn around and go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe both know that\u2019s not going to happen, Kev.\u201d Sighing, Kelsey looked at me and said, \u201cWe both know what could happen if you don\u2019t go through with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew what Kelsey was getting at; if things got worse for me, what\u2019s to say I wouldn\u2019t resort to suicide somewhere down the line.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI guess that doesn\u2019t leave me with much choice, does it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through her purse, Kelsey pulled out a small envelope.  \u201cI read that they let clients keep some mementos from their former life.\u201d Handing the envelope to me, Kelsey said, \u201cHopefully this will keep you from forgetting where you came from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the envelope, I found that it contained a dozen or so photos; mostly of Kelsey and me.  Holding the envelope close, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll treasure this for the rest of my life, Kelsey.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I stopped briefly as the door closed, looking back at my family for the last time.  <i>You can do this, Kevin.</i>  After waving to them, I turned and walked up to the receptionist counter.  \u201cHi, m-my name is Kevin Scott; I have a noon appointment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist, a cute looking girl in her early 20s, looked at the screen for a moment.  \u201cAh yes, there you are.\u201d Pointing down a long hallway, she said, \u201cGo down the hall to the waiting room, 4th door on the right.  Doctor Harris, one of our intake specialists, will be with you shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Pausing, I turned to her and said, \u201cYou probably can\u2019t tell me; but how often do people my age come through here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 1/3 of our clientele are around your age; ranging from 12 to 20 years old.\u201d Looking at me, before returning to her work, she said, \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is for your happiness; no one here will hold that against you.  I hope you have a good life, Mr. Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking the receptionist, I walked down the hallway towards the waiting room.  As I walked by the glass window, I saw a woman in her mid-to-late 60s sitting inside.  She looked up at me as I walked passed; I could almost swear I saw a look of recognition in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took a seat, a few spaces down from the woman, I grabbed a magazine from the wall.  I was about to open the magazine when the woman got up and took the seat next to me.  \u201cYou\u2019re awfully young to be here, young man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well my life hasn\u2019t been the best.\u201d Sighing, without looking from the magazine, I said, \u201cMy mom and sister thought this would be in my best interest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must\u2019ve been a very difficult decision for your mother to make.\u201d Pausing, the woman said, \u201cIf one of my children said they were coming here, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d handle never seeing them again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to get a little uneasy about the way the woman was looking at me; I didn\u2019t know her, but she seemed to think she knew me.  \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude; but why are you looking at me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a confused look on the woman\u2019s face, but that was quickly replaced by a look of realization.  \u201cHow silly of me; I forgot you wouldn\u2019t recognize me like this.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Helen Collins, but you knew me was Duncan Wilcox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped.  The woman sitting next to me, in her late 60s, just said that she was Duncan Wilcox; the star QB at school during my Freshman year.  He disappeared halfway through the school year; with his family and everyone else thinking that he died in an accident.  But here he was \u2013 a senior woman.</span></div></div>",

I watched as she put on a pair of reading glasses and picked up a celebrity gossip magazine.  \u201cWhat happened to you?  Everyone in town, including your own family, thinks you\u2019re dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured I might as well be; after the accident ruined my knee.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cI\u2019d be able to walk again, but I'd never play football again.  Can you picture Duncan Wilcox not playing football? I sure couldn't.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but this place could\u2019ve made that possible again.\u201d Gesturing to her, I said, \u201cBut why this?  Why become a little old lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness.\u201d Showing me an interview with cast members from a popular show on the CW, she said, \u201cWhy would anyone let their children watch this show?  I heard more foul language in 15 minutes then I would\u2019ve cared to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funny thing was; the show was something that Duncan would have liked.  \u201cWhy become an older woman, Duncan...I mean, Helen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had such fond memories of my grandmother; once I finished  my psychological evaluation, I realized I wanted to be more like her.\" Something in the magazine caught her attention again.  \u201cOh dead, there was so much sex and nudity in this movie.  Whatever happened to leaving it to the audience\u2019s imagination?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she talked, the more I realized they\u2019d altered her personality as well; she was every bit an older woman, complete with the way she talked and acted.  \u201cThat\u2019s what happened to Duncan; but what about your life now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been happier, Kevin; I\u2019ve been married to a wonderful man for almost 2 years now.  In fact, our oldest daughter just gave birth to twins; so I guess that makes me a grandmother.\u201d Pausing, Helen said, \u201cI flew up from Florida last night so I could see my family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell them you\u2019re alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goodness no, they would never accept that.  My father was one of those men are men types; he wouldn\u2019t like that his oldest son is now an older woman.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cNo, I heard through the grapevine that my sister got into Yale; she leaves today and I felt like seeing her off.  The company is providing me with a driver for the day; I\u2019m just waiting for them to get here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re happy, Helen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Kevin; I hope that you find some happiness as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a woman in her 30s, dressed in an impeccable skirt suit, walked into the room.  Stepping towards me, her hand outstretched, she said, \u201cMr. Scott?  I\u2019m Dr. Eliza Harris; would you please come with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently got up and followed her out of the room; as I did, I heard Helen say, \u201cI\u2019m glad they told me she\u2019s a singer; the way she\u2019s dressed, I would have assumed she was a streetwalker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at just how complete Helen\u2019s transformation was; I wondered what they could do for me.</span></div></div>",

The point is, your new tailor-made life begins the moment you leave this building.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it a requirement that I leave my friends and family behind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not; but most of our clientele decide to go in that direction.\u201d Turning serious, Dr. Harris said, \u201cAs you know, there are laws in place to govern this industry; and one of those laws states that you need a signed document, from a therapist, stating that you\u2019re truly unhappy and need a do-over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t aware of that until now.  Wincing, I said, \u201cSo I\u2019ll need to get professional help before I can start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry, Kevin; we\u2019ve got several therapists on staff who can evaluate your view of your current life.\" Calmly, Dr. Harris said. \u201cUnderstand that once you go through with this, there\u2019s no turning back.  That\u2019s why we need to be absolutely certain that this is what you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see one of your therapists, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Standing up, a smile on her face, she said, \u201cI believe Dr. Willard is free; she\u2019s one of our more thorough therapists.\u201d</span></div></div>",

One of them, a petite red-head, looked to be about 7 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all glanced at me as they walked past; no doubt realizing what I was here for.  I threw them a casual wave as Dr. Harris stopped in front of a door that said <i>Evaluation Department</i> on it.  She opened the door and we walked inside a small room, slightly bigger than the waiting room; consisting of a sitting area and three doorways leading into offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll but one of them was closed, as Dr. Harris me towards it.  A quick glance through the door showed an attractive woman sitting behind a desk, looking at something on her computer.  I found it interesting that every employee I\u2019d seen here so far was a woman.  Knocking on the open door, Dr. Harris said, \u201cMiranda, do you have a moment?\u201d gesturing to me, Dr. Harris said, \u201cI have a potential client in need of an evaluation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I could use a break from this anyway.\u201d Looking up from her computer, sighing, Dr. Willard said, \u201cWho knew booking a wedding venue 2 years in advance was so time-consuming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Willard got up to walk over to us, Dr. Harris said, \u201cMiranda Willard, this is Kevin Scott; a 15-year-old boy who is, as his mother said, perpetually unhappy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met a teenager yet who didn\u2019t seem to be perpetually unhappy.\u201d With a brusque tone, Dr. Willard said, \u201cHello, Mr. Scott; it\u2019s my job to determine whether or not you qualify for our services.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you get to it, then.\u201d Stepping towards the doorway, Dr. Harris looked at me and said, \u201cGood luck Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dr. Harris closed the door, Dr. Willard pointed towards her couch.  \u201cHave a seat, Mr. Scott; let\u2019s get right into it, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour and two boxes of tissues later, Dr. Willard and I were both struggling to regain our composure.  I went into detail about how I loved my family and friends but felt that the life I had wasn\u2019t the one for me.  Dr. Willard, far from the brusque and seemingly combative person I thought she was; turned out to be a caring and understanding woman.  Dr. Harris wasn\u2019t kidding about her being thorough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter signing some paperwork, Dr. Willard turned to me and said, \u201cI want to apologize, Kevin, for putting you through all of this; but, as you were told earlier, we have to be certain this is the best course of action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably noticed that I was entering your answers into my computer; we have a program that uses that information to come up with four possible new identities for our clients.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cBefore I show you the results; you\u2019re able to change certain aspects.  For example, one of your possible choices is that of a 5-year-old girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time I\u2019d been answering those questions, I found myself wondering if something like that was a possibility.  Looking at Dr. Willard, I said, \u201cReally?  One of my options is a little girl\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Dr. Willard continued, \u201cNow say you want to be a 3-year-old girl, or even a 5-year-old boy; we can change that.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cJust know; once you make your decision, it can\u2019t be undone.  You\u2019ll be brought down to the hall to one of our Life <br>\r\nDesigners; where you\u2019ll help design your new life from the ground up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was definitely far more to this than I thought, but it wasn\u2019t enough to scare me off.  I deserved to be happy, after all.  Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to see my options, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Willard silently turned her computer monitor towards me; on the screen, I saw four options to choose from:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A - 5-year-old girl<br>\r\nOption B - 13-year-old boy<br>\r\nOption C - 26-year-old woman<br>\r\nOption D - 37-year-old man<br>\r\nOption E - 53-year-old woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a fair amount of time to come to a decision; after all, the life I chose would be mine for the rest of my life.  After what seemed like an eternity, but was in fact only 5 minutes, I looked at Dr. Willard and said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go with _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s perfectly normal; after spending their first life as one gender, many clients want to spend the next life as the other.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cFor people in your position, who choose to become young children again, see it as an opportunity to make different life choices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that makes sense.\u201d Shrugging, I said, \u201cI mean; there\u2019s nothing more different from a 15-year-old boy than a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you still have your doubts; one of my colleagues in <i>Life Design</i> was born male.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIf she\u2019s willing to do so, perhaps she\u2019ll tell you her story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it would be nice to talk with someone with firsthand experience.\u201d Thinking back to my conversation with Helen, I said, \u201cI met an older woman in the waiting room, who I knew from school.  She told me a little about her new life, but was more focused on critiquing the latest trends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, Helen Collins.\u201d Nodding, Dr. Willard looked at me and said, \u201cShe chose one of our most extensive personality alterations; I\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any remaining personality traits from her old life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe seems perfectly happy though, so I guess that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one more thing we need to figure out before I bring you down to Life Design.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cYou need to pick a name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike first and last?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just the first name.\u201d pausing, Dr. Willard said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re becoming a young child, we\u2019re going to place you with a pre-determined family.  They\u2019ll raise you as their daughter, and in time you\u2019ll come to think of them as your parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something I hadn\u2019t thought about; I would need parents as a little girl.  I certainly wasn\u2019t going to do all of this to end up on the street or in foster care.  Leaning back in the chair, once again, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been 100% sure why, but I\u2019ve always liked Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, Sophie; it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s only fair to warn you; from here on out, everyone you meet here will converse with you as a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I suppose that\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the file from her desk, Dr. Willard got and said, \u201cOkay Sophie, sweetheart, let\u2019s go design your new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned a bit as I got up; rolling my eyes as I followed behind Dr. Willard.  She wasn\u2019t kidding when she said they\u2019d talk to <br>\r\nme like I was already a little girl.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As she took her seat behind her desk, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cYou know me: always willing to share.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Turning to me, Dr. Willard said, \u201cIt was lovely to meet you, Sophie; I wish you nothing but happiness in your new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a seat as Dr. Willard left the room.  Once it was just the two of us, I looked at Mrs. Cummings and said, \u201cYou used to be a man?  What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a big argument with my daughter, and I realized I wasn\u2019t seeing things from her point of view.  So I came here, to New Horizons, and became a 22-year-old woman.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cNow I work here, helping to give people the same second chance that I got.  I\u2019ve even got myself a wife and a baby on the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Mrs. Cummings gently stroked her belly.

Looking at Mrs. Cummings, I said, \u201cYou must be so happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cummings nodded, before saying, \u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed, though; I was hoping for a little girl.

I should\u2019ve realized how much work would be involved, but I was still thrown off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that we worked on was my physical appearance; with some input from Mrs. Cummings, I settled on blue-green eyes with strawberry-blonde hair that reached just above my shoulders.  One thing that I suggested, which I always thought looked adorable on little kids, was a smattering of freckles on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was done, we turned to my height; I didn\u2019t want to go overboard, so I decided on the typical height for a 5-year-old girl \u2013 just shy of 3\u00bd feet.  It seemed trivial to me, but one of the options that Mrs. Cummings asked was whether I wanted to be left or right-handed.  Since I was already undergoing a drastic change, I decided to take it one step further and change from right to left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all that was finished, we waited for Mrs. Cummings\u2019 computer to create a rendering of what I\u2019d look like.  \u201cOkay, Sophie; so what the computer is doing right now is taking all the answers you gave me and using that to create a picture of what you\u2019ll look like as a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been a good sport up to this point, but I was starting to get annoyed by Mrs. Cummings' efforts to dumb down everything she said.  I took a semester of Animation 101 my freshman year; I knew what a computer rendering was.  But I figured it was only wise to play along; after all, I was going to be a little girl soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer beeped after another few minutes.  Mrs. Cummings looked at the computer and I saw a smile form on her face.  \u201cSophie, sweetie, you\u2019re going to be one adorable little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to blush, I said, \u201cR-Really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the computer monitor to show me, she said, \u201cSee for yourself, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned forward to get my first look at the little girl I\u2019d soon become.  To say I was floored would have been the understatement of the century; I was stunned by what I saw on the screen before me. The little girl on the screen, wearing a green dress, was downright adorable.  Tearing up, I brought a hand to my mouth.  \u201cT-That\u2019s going to be me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Sophie; that\u2019s going to be you.\u201d Handing me some tissues, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cWe just have to figure out what kind of girl you want to be, then I\u2019ll bring you down the hall to the procedure room.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I even started skipping at one point; I wasn\u2019t even a little girl yet, and I was subconsciously acting like one.  We stopped outside a door marked <i>Transfigurations</i>. After knocking twice on the door, Leslie opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a woman who looked to he in her late 20s; professional except for her bubblegum pink hair. \u201cSophie, sweetie, this is Dr. Lizzie Weintraub; she\u2019s going to turn you into a little girl.\u201d Handing the woman the drive, Leslie said, \u201cLiz, this little sweetheart is Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Sophie; I\u2019m so glad that I could be here to help you.\u201d  Plugging the drive into a computer, she said, \u201cDid Mrs. Cummings explain to you what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t, and I had forgotten to ask.  Shaking my head, I said, \u201cNo ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst I\u2019m going to give you something help you sleep, then some teeny-tiny robots will go in and make you into a little girl.\u201d taking my hand. Dr. Weintraub said, \u201cNow say goodbye to Mrs. Cummings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently waved bye to Mrs. Cumming as Dr. Weintraub led me into another room.  Before the door closed, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cGood luck, Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding me a hospital gown to wear, Dr. Weintraub said, \u201cYou\u2019ll wear this for now; when you wake up, you\u2019ll be wearing something more appropriate for your size.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cDo you need a moment before we begin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I went to change behind a curtain, I said, \u201cNo ma\u2019am, I\u2019ve already said all my goodbyes; I\u2019m just ready to get started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing, I handed my things off to Dr. Weintraub, who said, \u201cIs there anything here that you\u2019ll want to keep?  Otherwise, we\u2019ll send it back to Kevin\u2019s family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the photos, I said, \u201cMy sister gave me an envelope with some photos, I\u2019d like to keep that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly found the envelope and placed it in a plastic container by the door. As I climbed onto the bed, she ran an IV into my arm.  After that came what I assumed was the nanites.  With the sedative starting to take effect, Dr. Weintraub said, \u201cSleep tight, Sophie.  When you wake up, you\u2019ll be Sophie all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving me a quick peck on the cheek, she dimmed the lights and left the room. I then closed my eyes and let the sedative do its work, so the nanites could do theirs.</span></div></div>",

Looking at me, a spoonful of cereal in her hands, she said, \u201cSo, what you do yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying around a little with my cereal, I said, \u201cI played basketball with David and Kyle; they let me win a few times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Smiling, Kelsey said, \u201cWhat else happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe went to the mall.\u201d  <i>Was my voice getting higher?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly unfazed by the changes in my voice, Kelsey continued, \u201cWhat else did you do, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sweetie?</i>  \u201cThen we went swimming; I was ascard of the pool, but Kyle stayed with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy voice was higher, and getting higher with every sentence.  Oddly, Kelsey didn\u2019t seem to notice; she just continued asking me what I did yesterday.  After I was finished with breakfast, I brought my dishes to the sink.  However, when I got there, I found that I was too short to see over the counter; I had to get up on my tippy-toes to do it.  <i>How was I supposed to do the dishes like this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing up from behind me, Kelsey said, \u201cI\u2019ve got this, sweetie.\u201d Taking the dishes from me, still the same size as before, she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go pick out a movie for us to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching the movie, the two of us went to the park.  Kelsey pushed me on the swing and let me feed the ducks; we had fun.  Back home, Kelsey ordered us a pizza.  I was bummed that it was a small pizza until I realized I couldn\u2019t even eat <i>that</i> by myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pizza, we played Candy Land until it got dark.  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for bed, sweetie; it\u2019s time for your bath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly filled with energy, I ran upstairs to the bathroom and got undressed.  It didn\u2019t faze me at all that I was a girl.  As I sat in the bath, playing with some toys while Kelsey washed me, I looked at her and said, \u201cWill I get a chest like yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour time will come, kiddo.\u201d Giggling, she said, \u201cJust give it a few years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce my bath was done, Kelsey dried me off and I got into my favorite pink pajamas.  She then tucked me in and read me a bedtime story.  Once that was over, feeling drowsy, I said, \u201cGood night, Kelsey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing me on the forehead, Kelsey said, \u201cGood night, Sophie.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t help but be amazed by how tiny my hands had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, I quickly realized that I wasn\u2019t in Dr. Weintraub\u2019s lab anymore; instead, I was in a hotel room.   \u201cThis is a nice room,\u201d I said; giggling at the sound of my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted a clock on the table next to me; I tried to read it but found that I couldn\u2019t tell time anymore.  I had no idea what 7:45 meant; although judging from the sunlight, I figured I had slept through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mouth tasted icky after sleeping for so long, so I decided to brush my teeth.  Pulling the sheets back, I giggled again at the sight of my little feet.  Climbing out of bed, I ran into the bathroom; where I found a stool sitting in front of the bathroom sink.  Stepping up on the stool, I got my first look at my new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all there; my strawberry-blonde hair, my blue-green eyes, and my freckles.  I\u2019d seen it all before on Mrs. Cummings' computer, but this was different \u2013 this was <i>real</i>.  <i>I</i> was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started brushing my teeth and was halfway through when I realized I\u2019d been using my left hand.  I was just finishing up when I heard a knock on the door.  In the distance, I could hear Dr. Harris say, \u201cSophie?  Are you up, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull of energy, I practically ran to the door.  \u201cI\u2019m up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and I saw Dr. Harris enter; along with Dr. Willard, Mrs. Cummings, Dr. Weintraub, and another woman, with tattoos on her right arm. Dr. Harris had a cupcake with her, with a candle shaped like a number 5 in it. Once everyone was in the room, they all sang \"Happy Birthday.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d never been particularly excited about getting presents but now it was different.  Before anyone could stop me, I tore into the box and saw that it contained a pretty lavender-colored dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding it up, a smile on my face, I said, \u201cIs this for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is all for you, sweetie.\u201d Smiling, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cA pretty girl like you deserves a pretty dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tattooed lady, who I still didn\u2019t know, handed me the bag.  \u201cThis is for you too, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly grabbing the bag, I opened it and found that it contained a teddy bear.  I instinctively grabbed it and hugged it tightly.  \u201cI can\u2019t thank you all enough for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d Looking at everyone, I said, \u201cFor the first time in a long time, I\u2019m truly happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, Dr. Harris and the others left; leaving only myself in the room with Mrs. Cummings and the tattooed lady.  They took a seat on the couch, sitting awfully close to each other, as they gestured for me to join them.  Gesturing to the tattooed lady, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cSophie, sweetie; this is Grace, my wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little bashful, I looked at Grace and simply said, \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you, Sophie.\u201d Smiling, Grace said, \u201cLeslie told me about how you were unhappy in your former life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKevin\u2019s daddy left when he was 8 years old.\u201d Frowning, I said, \u201cHis Mommy raised him and his sister on her own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy being a single parent.\u201d Sighing, Leslie said, \u201cLord knows I didn\u2019t do a good job of it the first time around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, you have to stop beating yourself up over that; it\u2019s in the past.\u201d Looking at Leslie, Grace said, \u201cAll you have to do now is focusing on being an amazing mother to our unborn son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us talked for a while after that; for some reason, they kept talking about how great they\u2019d be as parents.  After a while, they suggested we all spend the day together.  I jumped at the opportunity because it would give me a chance to wear my new dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s how I ended up leaving the hotel, which turned out to be only a short distance from the beach, with Grace and Leslie.  I held both of their hands as we walked down the sidewalk; we got some looks from people, but we didn\u2019t care.</span></div></div>",

We did, however, get some food and drinks at the pavilion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, we walked down the street together.  In addition to them buying me more clothes, I got a chance to see the two of them together.  I could tell that they loved each other; and it wasn\u2019t just the hugs and kisses.  It was how they spoke to, and looked at, each other.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel they\u2019d both be sad had Mrs. Cummings not become a woman. <i>Their baby\u2019s coming to a house of love.

You reminded me of my daughter at that age; before my small mind tore us apart.  I\u2019d like to try again, Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still confused, but not as much as before.  Looking at me, Grace said, \u201cShe told me the same thing when she came home from work; it was the first time she\u2019d ever spoken about a client like that.  The way she spoke about you, I just knew that I had to meet you.\u201d Kneeling next to Leslie, Grace said, \u201cYou\u2019ve swept me off my feet, Sophie; and nothing would make me happier than to be your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit me, as I was standing there in the hotel room, just how much my life had changed in the last couple of days.  When I woke up yesterday, I\u2019d been a teenage boy with a single mother and a twin sister.  Then they took me to New Horizons where I settled on becoming a little girl.  When I woke up this morning, I was that little girl.  Sure I had said I wanted two parents, but I had meant a mommy and daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was that really what I meant?  I couldn\u2019t help but remember what I thought this morning; about how their baby was coming into a house of love.  I wanted nothing more than to find a home like that; and here it was right in front of me.  They loved each other and they loved me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like I\u2019d done yesterday, I was faced with one of the biggest decisions of my life.  With a smile on my face, I ran over and hugged both of them.  \u201cMommy! Mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hugged me back; until Mommy Leslie said, \u201cOoh!\u201d and touched her belly.  \u201cIt looks like your little brother wants to celebrate as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking my hand, she put it on her belly and I felt my baby brother kicking.  Looking at them, I said, \u201cDo I get to come home with you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, honey; we have to get some paperwork done.  After that we\u2019ve got to make out second guest room into a room befitting a little girl.\u201d looking at me, Grace said, \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t take too long, but it won\u2019t be long before you\u2019re home at us.\u201d<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed.  With a frown, I said, \u201cI guess so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed like I was telling a joke, but I was serious.  I wanted to go home with them, not stay in a hotel room.  But it made sense that they had to get things ready for me.  After all, they were getting ready for my little brother and they did know about him first.</span></div></div>",

We were going to the beach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent a few hours at the beach; Mommy Leslie loved being in the water.

Looking out the window, I said, \u201cThe trees kinda look like hearts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing out the window, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cNow that you mention it, they sure do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at them again, I said, \u201cHow come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see the power lines?\u201d looking back at me, Mommy Grace said, \u201cThe trees grew up to the lines and then grew out to either side.  That's why they've got a heart shape to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, we pulled into the driveway and Mommy Grace hit a button on the ceiling to open the door.  Inside the garage, I saw two big bikes and a little girl\u2019s bike with training wheels on it.  As we got out of the car, Mommy Grace said, \u201cMommy Leslie doesn\u2019t right her bike much right now.  But you and I can ride together.\u201d Helping me from the car, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you can\u2019t wait until the training wheels are off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mommies showed me around; there was the family room, the dining room, a breakfast nook, and the kitchen.  Upstairs there was a large bathroom and a hallway that led to Mommies\u2019 bedroom.  On the opposite side of the house, I saw three doors; one was a bedroom, one had a crib and a rocking chair.  The last door was closed, and I saw the letters S-O-P-H-I-E on it.  Looking at them, a smile on my face, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s your room, sweetheart; take a look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quite large, slightly bigger than the room Kevin had, with a bed, a dresser, and a closet.  There were a table and chairs in one corner, all set for a tea party. There was even a guest already, a doll whose package said her name was Anna.  In front of the window, I saw a small bookshelf with picture books and storybooks on it.  I spotted a pair of shoes on top of the bookcase.  \u201cThose are ballet slippers, Sophie.\u201d Walking up behind me, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cOnce you\u2019re all settled in, we\u2019ll get you signed up for classes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing up, I hugged them both and said,  \u201cThank you, Mommies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was home.

I found myself in the kitchen when Mommy Grace was working on her computer.  <br>\r\nWalking up to her, I tugged on her shirt sleeve and said, \u201cIs it lunchtime yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sweetie, it\u2019s not.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cLunchtime isn\u2019t until noon; that\u2019s 12:00.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d After waiting a moment, I said, \u201cIs it 12:00 yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, sweetie...\u201d kneeling, she looked at me and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know how to tell time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head sadly; I hadn\u2019t realized just how much knowledge I\u2019d lost until that moment.  Picking me up, Mommy Grace said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey; mommy will teach you.\u201d Walking over to the microwave, she said, \u201cDo you know your numbers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you count to sixty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and said, \u201cI know all that stuff, I just don\u2019t know how to it goes together on the clock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, they go all out for clients like you.  But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll pick it up again in no time.\u201d Pointing to the numbers on the microwave, she said, \u201cThe number on the left of those two dots, can you tell me what that is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, ten!  The number of the left is the hour; there are 24 hours in a day, and it's divided into two 12-hour periods.  That is unless you were in the military like mommy, then it\u2019s just one 24-cycle.\u201d Sighing, Mommy Grace said, \u201cSo we know the hour is ten, now what\u2019s the number of the right side?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you, my little genius.  The number on the right is the number of minutes after the hour.  If there are 60 minutes in an hour, then what time is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understood what she was saying now.  \u201cIt\u2019s 10:30 mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d giggling, Mommy Grace said, \u201cThat means, in an hour and a half it\u2019ll be what time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"12:00!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd since its 10:30 in the morning, that means that 12:00 has another name.  At night it\u2019s called midnight, but during the day we call it noon.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cSo since lunch is at noon, how long is it until then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn hour and twenty-nine minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed. \"The time on the clock changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?

Then, after that, we went to sign up for ballet classes.  I was in for a surprise when I got there; because, as we pulled into the parking lot, I saw Kelsey walking through the parking lot.  As we drove by, I saw my former mommy sitting in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered that Kelsey took ballet, but it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that we\u2019d end up at the same school.  My mommies said they were going to wait a few more days before emailing my former family; to give everyone time to settle.  I wanted to email them myself, but they both said I was too young.  I could only imagine how they\u2019d react when they learned I was a little girl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, we went to the park to have a picnic lunch.  Mommy Grace pushed me on the swing, and watched me on the playscape, while Mommy Leslie read a book on baby names.  I soon realized that she hadn\u2019t decided yet. Eventually, I got tired, so Mommy Grace and I went back to the shady tree where the blanket was set up.  Sitting to Mommy <br>\r\nLeslie, Mommy Grace said, \u201cHow goes the baby name search?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know me; I think I have the perfect name one day, and the next I hate it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Sophie can help,\" Mommy Grace turned to look at me and said, \u201cSweetheart, would you like to help name your little brother?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know what you're thinking; but no, I didn't say Kevin. \"Kyle David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Leslie thought it over a for a moment, until she said, \u201cYou know what, that has a good ring to it.\u201d Placing a hand on her belly, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in a few months, Kyle David Cummings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night I was asleep until a loud noise woke me.  Sitting up, I listened to the rain hitting my window; when a bright flash, and the same loud noise, made me scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter less than a minute, Mommy Grace ran into the room.  \u201cAre you alright, Sophie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ascared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thunderbolts and lightning are very very frightening, huh, Galileo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t get the reference, but I nodded anyway.

Well the jokes on him; because I\u2019ve performed the lead in the last two recitals and I\u2019m co-captain on the cheer squad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn to be upset; it\u2019s only been a few days since I left, but I could tell that Kelsey was struggling to hold herself together.  I wanted nothing more than to go up and tell her who I was, but I knew it wasn\u2019t the right time for that.  After that, we all introduced ourselves before we got down to doing some exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was standing up against the wall, a short time later practicing standing on my toes, when Kelsey came up behind me.  \u201cYou\u2019re <br>\r\ndoing a very good job, Sophie; but you might want to work on strengthening your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Ms. Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Kelsey.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cAren\u2019t you the little girl with the two moms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you looked familiar.\u201d Kneeling in front of me, Kelsey said, \u201cYou remind me a lot of myself at your age; I was a natural at ballet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting, Kelsey; I\u2019m right here.  As I looked at her, I found it difficult not to just come out and say that I was her brother.  But, once again, I knew the time wasn\u2019t right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce class ended, Kelsey walked me over to Mommy Leslie and said, \u201cMa\u2019am, you\u2019ve got a wonderfully talented little girl here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful of you to say.\u201d Smiling, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cShe was very nervous about starting this class, but I\u2019m glad to see it was all for nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting bored with the conversation, I said, \u201cMommy, can we get ice cream on the way home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, sweetie; Mommy Grace and I have plans with some friends tonight, so we need to get home.\u201d Pausing, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of last minute, so I hope I can find a babysitter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words had barely left Mommy Leslie\u2019s mouth when Kelsey said, \u201cI can babysit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something special about your little girl, ma\u2019am; something I can\u2019t quite put my finger on.\u201d Sighing, Kelsey said, \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not exactly looking forward to going home right now; my mom\u2019s been pretty depressed the last few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was torn; between wanting to spend time with Kelsey, and not wanting to.  Before I could make my opinion known, Mommy <br>\r\nLeslie said, \u201cOkay then; call your mother and let her know, then I\u2019ll bring you both to the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Tousling my hair, Kelsey said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have fun, Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kelsey ran off, Mommy Leslie looked at me and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey was my twin sister.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Y'know, like food allergies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nary a one,\" Mommy Leslie said. \"You've got our phone number, in case of an emergency. There are frozen dinners in the freezer. And don't let her play with the tablet for more than an hour.\" She turned to me. \"You'll be a good girl for Kelsey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mommy.\" What Kelsey didn't know was that being a good girl included not telling her that I used to be the twin brother she was mourning. If she figured it out for herself, that was okay, but I wasn't supposed to lead her to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got a hug and a kiss from each of my mommies, and then they said goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were gone, Kelsey asked, \"What do you want to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna see my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI led her to my room and showed her around. \"This is my dresser. I got most of my clothes in here. This drawer is for my ballet things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. I keep my ballet things apart from my other clothes, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I already knew that. It was where I got the idea. But I didn't say so. \"Sometimes I come in this corner to read one of my books, or play on Mommy's tablet. And sometimes, I have tea parties with Anna. That's her right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Anna. Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dress-up clothes are in the closet, for if I'm going to a party, or if I feel like being a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my toy chest. This on top is my new baby dolly. She drinks, cries, and wets. I got her for if I get bored when my mommies have to take care of my baby brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your mommies as examples, I'm sure you'll be a wonderful mommy, yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought us to my bed, with my Frozen 2 pajamas laid out for me. \"This is Teddy. He sleeps with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delighted, Teddy.\" She reached for the table drawer, where I kept the pictures she gave me before I became Sophie. \"What's in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed the drawer shut again. \"That's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said, backing away. \"I didn't mean to pry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you. So, that's my room. What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about an hour before your supper. I'll let you play with the tablet, then call you when supper's ready. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when she called me to supper, I saw that an hour had gone by. I gave her the tablet (no gadgets at the table, anyway), and sat down for my supper, which was chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper, we watched a movie. Well, <i>I</i> watched the movie. Kelsey did her homework. When the movie was over, Kelsey played Candy Land with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kelsey said, \"It's getting close to your bedtime. We'd better give you a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelsey washed me, I said, \"I had fun today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you did,\" she said. \"My twin brother stopped having fun a while back, and he got really sad from it. I wouldn't want you to be sad like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good ballet teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed my forehead. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she dried me off, I put on my pajamas and got into bed. Kelsey tucked me in, then she read me <i>The Little Engine That Could</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Kelsey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slept for a little while, until my mommies came in, and they kissed me goodnight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the first week of school, Amelia, Scott, and I became good friends. I introduced them to both my mommies when either one would come pick me up. They introduced me to their parents, and the parents started talking about a playdate for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't get along at all with Danny Maher, though. That was clear in the second week of kindergarten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Detweiler had us drawing pictures with crayons, and I was drawing a picture of my family. I was really focused on my picture, and I barely heard when Mrs. Detweiler said, \"Danny, back to your picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did notice, though, when Danny pulled my hair. I swung out the back of my hand, and definitely hit him. Mrs. Detweiler separated us before it got any further, and took Danny to the principal's office. I figured that was the end of it, and went back to my picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine my surprise when Mrs. Detweiler came to me and said, \"The principal wants to talk to you, Sophie. Your moms are on their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't understand why I was in the principal's office. Danny Maher started it. Why was <i>I</i> in trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I started worrying about what my mommies would do. Would they take away my toys? Maybe decide I couldn't be in ballet anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mommies finally came. \"Good afternoon, ladies,\" Principal Pasternak said. \"I'm sure you're wondering why I called you. Your little Sophie has gotten herself into an altercation with another student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it happen?\" Mommy Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He pulled her ponytail, and she hit him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand,\" Mommy Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did I lose you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said Sophie got herself into trouble. Then, you told us a story where she defended herself. Draw me a map from the one point to the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Cummings, we teach non-violence in this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a laudable goal, but Sophie is the victim. She should not be treated as if her actions are equal to those of the boy who attacked her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed with relief. Mommy Grace understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Cummings,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're aware of the statistics linking childhood bullying and abusive relationships later in life. Don't you want to protect your students from that situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Pasternak sighed. Mommy Grace had him boxed in. \"Perhaps I overreacted in this case.\" Turning to me, he said, \"I'm sorry, Sophie.\" Turning to Mrs. Detweiler, he asked, \"Can she return to class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're about to dismiss for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dismissed, Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to tell him that,\" Mrs. Detweiler said, as she walked us back to kindergarten. \"But he insisted it was the principle of the thing. No pun intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Leslie chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dealt with my share of guys like that in the army,\" Mommy Grace said. \"Between that and the reading I've been doing getting ready for the baby, I was ready for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Mrs. Detweiler said, \"if he thought that Sophie was starting trouble, he should've seen me growing up. I was quite the little hel - I mean, troublemaker as a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding,\" Mommy Leslie said. \"I still remember the time you decided to cut a girl's hair with safety scissors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Detweiler stopped. \"Where did you hear about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Grace bent down to me. \"I think Mommy just put her foot in it.\"</span></div></div>",

I guess it was a little more raw for her than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was in the bottle?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pills. I was in a bad place inside. The only parent I'd ever known said he didn't love me anymore, so I felt like nobody loved me. After... after that, I realized that I didn't really want to die, so I called for help. Emily came, I got therapy, and the rest is history. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. My mommy from before and my twin sister, they were ascared that I was going to a bad place. So they took me to New Horizons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I forgot you told me about that.\" She gave me a side hug. \"I just thought of something: My dad is your mommy, right? That kind of makes me your big sister, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can't let anybody else know about this. That would mean your mommy's privacy, and my job. So, during school, I'll be Mrs. Detweiler, and, when school is out, I'll be Sara. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went back to the living room, where Mommy Grace was holding Mommy Leslie, and Emily was looking like she knew she did something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara sat down next to Mommy Leslie. \"My therapist told me something very clever,\" she said. \"He said I should write a letter to you, detailing everything you did that I didn't like. Then, I should take the letter and burn it. It worked, too: I realized that the reason those feelings haunted me was because I was carrying them. Once I put them out and let go of them, they didn't have any power over me. I was free to build my life, the way I wanted. I actually heard the chains breaking, and I knew I could be a better person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I hurt you, baby,\" Mommy Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for what I said,\" Emily said, coming closer to us. \"I'm sorry, to all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I threatened to leave you, Grace,\" Mommy Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I accused you of rushing into everything,\" Mommy Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all stood there, hugging each other, until it was time for Sara and Emily to go.</span></div></div>",

I was a little nervous about having them over; because this would be the first time they saw me in something that wasn\u2019t a dress.  I remembered telling Mommy Leslie that I wanted to both girly and a girl who didn\u2019t mind getting dirty.  I just hoped that Amelia and Scott would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Grace had one of our neighbors come over the day before and put together some play equipment in the backyard.

I was outside playing on the swing when I heard Mommy Leslie\u2019s voice calling me from inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping off the swing, I ran inside to find Amelia and Scott standing in the doorway with Amelia\u2019s mommy standing behind them. *I\u2019d later find out that Amelia\u2019s mommy was dating Scott\u2019s daddy.* All my concerns about how they\u2019d react to seeing me in overalls evaporated when I saw them both wearing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we hugged each other, we ran excitedly ran out to the backyard to start playing.

I'd had two more ballet classes; in which I found out that I was a quick learner.  I spent most of my time at school hanging out with Amelia and Scott; the three of us had quickly become inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Grace was busy with something from school, while Mommy Leslie had dinner plans with Mrs. Detweiller; so I wasn\u2019t surprised when I got off the bus to find Kelsey waiting for me at the bus stop.  I quickly ran up and hugged her, yelling, \u201cKelsey! Kelsey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, kiddo.\u201d Kneeling in front of me, Kelsey said, \u201cHow was school today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was fun!\u201d holding up a piece of paper, I said, \u201cI drawed a photo of my mommies and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, we should put that on the fridge for them to see, shouldn\u2019t we.\u201d Taking my hand, Kelsey said, \u201cI\u2019ve got some snacks waiting for you at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked up the street to my house, I found myself thinking about how much my relationship with Kelsey had changed \u2013 we\u2019d gone from being twins to me being a little girl that she babysat for.  Of course, it helped that she didn\u2019t know that I had been her brother.  Mommy Leslie had emailed Kelsey and her mommy a few days earlier; telling them that I was safe and happy with my new family \u2013 while not going into too much detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shortly after 4:30 and I had just come in from playing in the backyard; all covered in dirt and mud.  Kelsey was sitting at the kitchen table, working on homework, when she saw me standing there.  \u201cWe should probably get you cleaned up, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a bath where a fair amount of water ended up on the bathroom floor; thanks, in large part, to Kelsey and me splashing each other.  Once we were both dried off, she carried me down the hall to my bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that I felt a lump in my throat; the drawer where I kept my photos was wide open.  It wouldn\u2019t have been a problem had the drawer not been next to my dresser, where Kelsey was rummaging to find an outfit for me to wear.  After choosing a pair of shorts and a Paw Patrol shirt, Kelsey was closing the dresser drawers when she noticed the photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to panic as she placed my clothes on the bed and took out the photos.  Looking them over for a moment, she looked at me and said, \u201cWhere did you find these, Sophie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I\u2019d given a lot of thought to what I would say in this situation.  At that moment, I was terrified \u2013 both because I\u2019d been caught and because I was afraid of how Kelsey would react.  As I started tearing up, I looked at her and said, \u201cYou gave them to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey just stared at me in silence for a moment; her mouth agape.  After a few moments, all she could manage to say was, \u201cKevin?\u201d</span></div></div>",

They even made you left-handed, like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled.

And how do you feel about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad she's happy. That's why we took Kevin to New Horizons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the doorbell rang.

Kelsey's told me so much about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's more to tell,\" Kelsey said. \"Mom,... Sophie used to be Kevin.\"</span></div></div>",

Everyone keeps telling me how incredibly bright you are for your age; give yourself a chance to see the Sophie that they\u2019re talking about, the most amazing little girl I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Grace was right, I shouldn\u2019t be in a hurry to grow up again; I didn\u2019t want to make the same mistakes that Kevin did.  Hugging her, I said, \u201cThanks, Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Leslie walked over at that point; looking at me, she said, \u201cSophie, sweetie, I saw Amelia\u2019s mother over by the softball field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmelia\u2019s here!?\u201d getting excited, I started jumping up and down, \u201cCan I go see her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can, sweetie,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ripped the helmet off and ran to the softball field; getting there just in time to see a boy, wearing a softball uniform and helmet, walk up to Amelia\u2019s mommy.  That\u2019s weird, I thought to myself as I got closer, Amelia never mentioned having a brother.<br>\r\nWalking up to Ms. Doherty, I said, \u201cHi Ms. Doherty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ms. Doherty and the boy looked worried as they looked at me; the boy fidgeting with his shirt while Ms. Doherty said, \u201cHello Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my attention to the boy; there was something familiar about him but I couldn\u2019t place it.  He looked like a male version of Amelia, but she never mentioned having a twin brother.  Putting my hand out, I said, \u201cHi, my name\u2019s Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy hesitated for a moment before taking my hand, saying, \u201cH-Hi, m-my name\u2019s E-Evan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised to see that he even sounded like Amelia, but I didn\u2019t dwell on that for too long.  \u201cHow come I haven\u2019t seen you at school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan looked at Ms. Doherty with a look of utter terror in his eyes.  She turned to me and said, \u201cEvan has a condition that requires him to be homeschooled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cPerhaps you could come over with Amelia the next time I see her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Doherty looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Sophie, but we should be going.  I\u2019ll tell Amelia you said hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Ms. Doherty and Evan, I started walking back towards the picnic blanket.  I stopped in my tracks when I heard Evan\u2019s voice behind me, \u201cSophie, wait!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I was surprised to see Amelia running towards me; wearing Evan's uniform and holding his helmet in her hands.</span></div></div>",

Whatever they were discussing, it sounded like they weren\u2019t agreeing on something.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea, Grace; she\u2019s only 5 years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not giving her enough credit, Leslie; she\u2019s smarter than most kids her age.\u201d Sighing as she stopped at a light, Grace said, <br>\r\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s still something of Kevin left in her; but I think she\u2019d understand it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI perked up when I heard Kevin\u2019s name mentioned; neither of them had said that name since Mommy Abigail came to visit.  Mommy Leslie was silent for a moment, until she said, \u201cOkay fine, we\u2019ll do it your way.\u201d Turning to look at me, she said, \u201cSophie, sweetie, did Evan tell you anything about being trans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, but his mommy did; he told her that he felt more like a boy than a girl.\u201d Looking up at them, idly fidgeting with the toy in my hand, I said, \u201cShe took him to a doctor who said he was a boy, so now his name\u2019s Evan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, sweetie; he looks like a girl, but he\u2019s really a boy.\u201d Giving Grace an apologetic look, Leslie said, \u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurely by coincidence we drove by a brand-new billboard advertising New Horizons.  Looking back at Mommy Leslie, I said, \u201cWas I trans before New Horizons changed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo honey; you wanted to make a change, so we changed you.\u201d Reaching back to hold my hand, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t chosen to be a girl, we simply would\u2019ve made you someone else.  Evan has always been Evan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan Evan go to New Horizons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, sweetie; the procedure is too risky for someone your age; we can turn people into children, but we can\u2019t change children.\u201d Smiling, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cBut, if he wants it, we can help him when he\u2019s older.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Evan being his true self made me smile; I wanted him to be happy.  \u201cI\u2019d like that for him, Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got back to the house a short time later; turning the corner as Mommy Leslie was on the phone with someone, she kept calling Dad.  \u201cWe\u2019re almost home now, Dad; so why don\u2019t you guys come over in an hour or so.\u201d Smiling, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019m sure Sophie will be excited to meet you once I tell her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up the phone, Mommy Leslie turned back to look at me.  \u201cSophie, sweetie, how would you like to meet your grandparents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cWell that\u2019s settled then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we approached the house, I noticed a strange car parked out front.  Mommy Grace and Mommy Leslie were confused; especially once a man got out and started walking towards them.  Rolling down the window, Mommy Grace said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat depends, I\u2019m looking for Leslie or Grace Cummings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Grace Cummings, Leslie is my wife.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding an envelope to Mommy Grace, the man said, \u201cYou\u2019ve just been served.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Grace was silent as the man walked back to his car, while Mommy Leslie grabbed the envelope and looked inside.  After a few seconds of silence, she said, \"That stupid bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped in shock at the harsh language Mommy Leslie used, while Mommy Grace just looked at her.  \"Leslie, language!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm just angry.\" handing the envelope to Mommy Grace, Mommy Leslie said, \"Abigail is suing us for custody of Sophie.\"</span></div></div>",

Leaning against the back of the couch, I saw four people step inside the house: two older people, a woman about my mommies age, and a teenage boy.  With a smile on her face, Mommy Leslie got to her feet and walked over to hug them.  \u201cHey guys, I totally forgot you were coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Mommy Leslie, concerned, the older woman said, \u201cWe spoke about it earlier, sweetheart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath to compose herself, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cI know, Mom; it\u2019s just been a crazy morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, the man looked at Mommy Leslie and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to retrieve me from the couch, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cSophie\u2019s birth mother is suing is for custody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one look at me, the woman turned her attention to Mommy Leslie, \u201cIs this her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, I\u2019ve had the worst memory lately.\u201d With a smile, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cEveryone, this is Sophie. Sophie, I\u2019d like you to meet Stan and Joanna Simmons, my parents since becoming a woman; my older sister, Heather; and my kid brother, Duncan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions had been made, I turned my attention to Mommy Leslie\u2019s parents.  \u201cIf you\u2019re my mommy\u2019s parents, does that make you my grandparents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smiling on her face, Grandma said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning my attention to the others, I said, \u201cAnd you\u2019re my aunt and uncle, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Sophie.\u201d Smiling, Heather said, \u201cI\u2019m your Auntie Heather.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I\u2019m sure it was only an act, considering I knew how teens could be, Duncan looked less than thrilled to be here.  Looking at me, putting a smile on his face, he said, \u201cI guess that makes me your Uncle Duncan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family adjourned to the family room as Mommy Grace returned with drinks for everyone.

Sitting up in the bed, I barely had time to process where I was before I saw a bright flash outside followed by another loud noise that made me scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn hindsight I should\u2019ve figured I wasn\u2019t alone in the room; I mean who would leave a 5-year-old girl alone in a hotel room.  But at that moment I was still frightened by the loud noise, which I quickly realized was thunder; so much so that I screamed again when the bedroom door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I calmed down, I turned to see Mrs. Cummings rushing into the room wearing pajamas that were just a tad small on her.  Running over to the bed, she said, \u201cSophie, sweetie, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d shaking my head as I clung tightly to the covers, I said, \u201cThe thunder is scary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a caring look on her face, Mrs. Cummings sat next to me in bed.  \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie.\u201d Holding me close, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cThe thunder won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I heard another clap of thunder outside, I said, \u201cKevin wasn\u2019t ascared of thunder, why am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I explain this so a 5-year-old will understand it.\u201d Mrs. Cummings looked me for a moment, before saying, \u201cWhile the little machines were busy turning you into an adorable little girl, the computer was busy changing your mind.  You wouldn\u2019t want to be a little girl with the mind of a teenager, would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI of course remembered all this from yesterday, but I decided to play along and listen.  I couldn\u2019t help but grimace at the thought of being a little girl with a teenager\u2019s mind.  Looking at Mrs. Cummings, I said, \u201cSo my fear of thunder is because of the computer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it exactly.\u201d Smiling, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cIt gives people random fears; for example, I\u2019m deathly afraid of pelicans now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was feeling a little better, Mrs. Cummings and I went out to the private patio to watch the storm come through.  While we were out there, she told me how she volunteered to stay the night because she knew what I was going through.  \u201cI thought that you would be more comfortable with someone who went through the same thing.\u201d Pausing, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cMy wife, Grace, wanted to come but she got called into work at the last minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping off my chair, I walked over and hugged Mrs. Cummings.  \u201cThank you, Mrs. Cummings; for everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, sweetheart.\u201d Running a hand through my hair, she said, \u201cBut please call me Leslie, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking a little more, Leslie suggested that I get dressed and she\u2019d take us out for breakfast.  Suddenly filled with energy, I ran back into the room and found a bag full of clothes sitting at the foot of the bed.  Rummaging through it, I found a pair of overalls that looked cute.</span></div></div>",

With everything that\u2019s changed, I figured my favorite foods had changed as well.  I was, however, happy to discover that I still liked pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so hungry that I ended up asking for a second helping of pancakes.  Once they\u2019d been delivered, apologetically, I looked at Leslie and said, \u201cSorry, I guess I\u2019m just hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie; it\u2019s a side effect of the procedure.\u201d Leaning closer, so no one else could hear, Leslie said, \u201cAfter I changed, I was hungry that I ordered three omelets from room service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still drizzling as Leslie and I left the caf\u00e9, so we both stopped under a nearby tree to figure out what we wanted to do.  I spotted a movie theater in the distance and, excitedly, said, \u201cCan we go to the movies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not.\u201d With a smile, Leslie said, \u201cI could stand to get off my feet for a couple hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we got closer to the theater, I saw the only age-appropriate movie was <i>Onward</i>.  While a big part of me was excited to see the movie, another part was realizing just what it meant to be a little kid again.  No more late nights, no more scary movies, no more doing anything without an adult around.  <i>But,</i> I thought to myself, <i>that\u2019s price I\u2019m paying for happiness.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for the tickets Leslie and I walked into the theater, where we were approached by a woman a few years older than my former mommy.  I grew anxious at the way she was staring at us, while Leslie seemingly ignored it; until the woman said, \u201cYou have an adorable little girl there; does she take after her father?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d Holding me close, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019m not her biological mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed enough to satisfy the woman, as she walked out of the theater a moment later.  While we waited in line for the concession stand, I looked up at Leslie and said, \u201cWho exactly am I related to, now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m qualified to answer that, honey.\u201d Looking down at me, Leslie said, \u201cBut that\u2019s not something a girl your age needs to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t completely sold on that answer, but I didn\u2019t want to press my luck.  \u201cOkay.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I even started crying at the end because Ian missed his one chance to see his dad.  Once the movie was over, Leslie led me to the bathroom to clean my face as it was covered in popcorn crumbs and bits of chocolate.  \u201cGood Lord,\u201d wiping my face, Leslie said, \u201cWere you this messy as a teenager?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really; but I <i>was</i> big enough to wash myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie must\u2019ve sensed the emphasis I\u2019d put on the word <i>was</i>; because she looked at me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get there eventually, Sophie; you shouldn\u2019t be so anxious to grow up.\u201d Looking around to ensure the coast was clear, Leslie knelt in front of me and said, \u201cI must admit that I\u2019m a tad jealous; you\u2019re getting to experience something that I never did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly had no idea what Leslie was talking about; as we\u2019d both used New Horizon\u2019s services.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get to grow up as a girl; while I skipped all the important parts.\u201d With a weak smile, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ll never get to experience what it\u2019s like to experience a first period or getting my first bra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Leslie, I couldn\u2019t tell if she was being serious or not.  \u201cUh; you experienced every single one of those things.\u201d Placing my hand on her belly, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re even experiencing what it\u2019s like to be pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right; but it\u2019s not exactly the same.\u201d Sighing as she ran a hand through her hair, Leslie said, \u201cEach of those is a milestone in a girl\u2019s life; I kind of cheated my way past them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few minutes to use the bathroom, Leslie and I left the theater.  It wasn\u2019t raining now, but I could tell a shower had recently come through.  Turning my attention to Leslie, I said, \u201cSo, uh, what happens now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie\u2019s cellphone started ringing before she had the chance to respond; she went off to answer it after ensuring that I stayed where I was.  I couldn\u2019t hear the conversation, but I could tell from Leslie\u2019s body language that it wasn\u2019t going well.  Leslie returned a few minutes later, looking upset about something.  \u201cWell that didn\u2019t go the way I\u2019d hoped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Leslie as we started walking, I said, \u201cWhat didn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping in her tracks, Leslie turned to me and said, \u201cThat was the Corporate Office; I\u2019d called the Legal department yesterday to inquire about the possibility of adopting you.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Leslie said, \u201cThey just got back to me and said it wasn\u2019t possible; that it would be a breach of my employment contract.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been so focused on adjusting to my new life that I hadn\u2019t given any thought to where I\u2019d end up.  The thought of going to live with Leslie was a nice one; but that wasn\u2019t possible anymore.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got several families that I\u2019m sure would love to adopt you.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Leslie said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry; you\u2019ll have a loving family soon enough.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I spent most of the intervening time either playing with kids at the pool or lounging around the room watching cartoons.  It\u2019s been almost 5 days since my procedure and, in that time, I had slowly adjusted to my new life.  I realized that I should enjoy my freedom while I could, because everything would change once I was adopted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was full of energy today; excited by the prospect of meeting my new family.  Leslie had tired herself out trying to wrangle me into a dress she\u2019d bought for the occasion.  But eventually she got it on me and lay on the bed while I looked at myself in the mirror.  <br>\r\n\u201cGod, I think you would\u2019ve given my daughter a run for her money at that age.\u201d Feeling winded, Leslie said, \u201cI just hope my son isn\u2019t that hyper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was too caught up in my appearance to pay attention to what Leslie was saying - the dress I was wearing was probably something one would normally wear to church.  I found myself spinning around to get a better look.  Once I got tired of that, I turned to Leslie and said, \u201cThanks for the dress, Auntie Leslie.\u201d With a giggle, I climbed up on the bed next to her and said, \u201cI like how pretty it makes me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked at me for a moment; eventually saying, \u201cSometimes I find myself forgetting that you used to be a teenage boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well now I\u2019m a pretty girl!\u201d giggling, I said, \u201cOne that\u2019s excited to meet her new family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the time on her phone, Leslie said, \u201cSpeaking of which; we should probably head downstairs to meet them.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter helping me with my shoes, Leslie and I ventured down the hall to the elevator.  The closer we got to the lobby, the more anxious I got.  Looking up at Leslie, I said, \u201cI hope this family likes me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they will, sweetie.\u201d With a smile on her face, Leslie said, \u201cThey weren\u2019t vetted by New Horizons, but a local agency referred them to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure what vetted meant, but I didn\u2019t care.  \u201cDo they have any other kids?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes; a 6-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was excited by the prospect of having an older sister; but I was less than thrilled by the prospect of having a younger brother.  Having been on that side of the fence, I knew all too well what boys were like at that age.  But, as the elevator reached the lobby, I told myself that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie and I stepped out of the elevator to find a family waiting nearby; the looks on the adults faces telling me they were waiting for someone.  The father was tall and dressed in a suit, the mother was petite, while the kids looked like younger versions of their parents.  Taking my hand in hers, Leslie walked over and said, \u201cI\u2019m Leslie Cummings; are you the Petersons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s us.\u201d Looking at me, the woman said, \u201cIs this her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Gently pushing me in front of her, Leslie said, \u201cThis right here is Sophie.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was so worried that I scared her off; until she kissed me and asked me on a second date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it certainly looks like you two are happy.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI know New Horizons doesn\u2019t exactly allow clients much contact with their former families; but does your daughter know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie\u2019s smile quickly turned to a frown; as she said, \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to tell her for the last two years, but I never had the courage to do it.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cShe thinks I died in some tragic car accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel terribly for this woman I just met.  \u201cLeslie, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be, I brought this all on myself.\u201d Sighing, with a tinge of remorse in her voice, Leslie said, \u201cBesides, I get to see her once a week; even if she doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry; I\u2019m still trying to process everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d looking at her, feeling somewhat confused, I said, \u201cHow do you see her every week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCassie and I signed up for Lamaze classes a couple of months ago; you know, to help me prepare to push something the size of a watermelon through something the size of a grape.\u201d Grabbing some tissues, Leslie said, \u201cImagine my surprise when Grace, my daughter, came into the classroom with a pregnant woman.  We got to talking; and long story short, she got married 2 years ago; after which she and her wife decided to have a baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must have been awkward for you and your wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as much as you\u2019d think; being the only two lesbian couples in the class, we\u2019ve managed to strike up a friendship.\u201d Looking at me, Leslie said, \u201cAmy keeps trying to convince me to come out to my daughter, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to do that yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever it happens; I hope it works out for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Looking at a clock on her desk, Leslie gasped and said, \u201cOh wow; that took way longer than I expected.  We should probably get to work designing your new life, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t mind talking with Leslie; I felt a sense of kinship with her, seeing how we both used to be men.  <i>Look at that, I\u2019m not even a woman yet and I\u2019m already talking like that.</i>  \u201cI suppose now\u2019s as good a time as any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s get to it, shall we?\u201d Turning to her computer, a faint smile on her face, Leslie said, \u201cFirst things first; what do you want your new name to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been thinking about that on and off since my decision; struggling with several good possibilities.  I wanted to make a good choice because this would be my name for the rest of my life.  After a few more seconds of thinking, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve decided on Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Amelia.\u201d Her smile getting bigger, Leslie said, \u201cI always make this little comment to the new women that come through here; \u201cThe Bible says God created man before He created woman. Everybody knows the second draft is better than the first.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So begin the lengthy, and sometimes arduous task of designing my life as Amelia Webber.  I suppose I should\u2019ve realized how much work was involved in something like this, but I was still thrown off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first parameters that we worked on revolved around my basic body shape.  I\u2019d already settled on being a Caucasian woman, so we continued from there.  I didn\u2019t want to go overboard, but I let Leslie talk me into some otherwise objectionable decisions \u2013 for example, I didn\u2019t want <i>huge</i> breasts but Leslie still managed to convince me otherwise; so instead of the 34C I was leaning towards, we went with 36D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I asked why Leslie was so insistent about that, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve always had a thing for well-endowed women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t mind the occasional input; but this is <i>my</i> body we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you turning me into your dream girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, you\u2019re no fun; but I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d Turning back to her computer, Leslie said, \u201cNext on the list is height; what are you now, about 5\u20199\u201d?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled to myself; amused that Leslie was already treating me like a woman.  I suppose it was something the company did; to help clients get used to their new lives.  If I\u2019d chosen to be a little girl, I\u2019m sure she would have talked to me like I was a child.  Thinking about her question, I leaned back and said, \u201cI\u2019m just shy of six feet, actually; I just slouch a lot.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThis time around, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019d like to go shorter; somewhere around 5\u20196,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice, you could always get a decent pair of heels to look taller.\u201d Inputting the information, Leslie said, \u201cHow about hair color and length?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a thing for girls with dark blonde hair; so how about that, maybe an inch past my shoulders.\u201d Looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cI\u2019m curious, how exactly will I be transformed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe specialists will use the criteria we\u2019re creating to program nanites; which they\u2019ll inject into your body.  The procedure only takes about 15 minutes; but as someone who\u2019s gone through it, I can tell you that it\u2019s physically taxing.  Don\u2019t be surprised if you sleep for a few hours afterward.\u201d Glancing at the screen, Leslie said, \u201cWe\u2019re all set with the physical parameters; the computer is coming up with a representation of what you\u2019ll look like.  After that\u2019s done, we can move onto actually figuring out exactly who Amelia Webber wants to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore we get to all, I\u2019ve got a question; how exactly will they alter my personality?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not well versed in the science behind it, but I know they use some machine to rewrite your brain to fit the new personality.\u201d Chuckling, Leslie said, \u201cHow else would they turn a bible-thumping conservative into a proud lesbian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all sounds so complicated; what\u2019s to keep them from accidentally erasing the memories from my old life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re forbidden from doing that without a court order.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be Amelia Webber but you\u2019ll still remember your life as Kevin Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the computer beeped, and I saw a grin form on Leslie\u2019s face.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cDamn girl; you\u2019re going to be one attractive woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed a little at that; if Leslie thought I was attractive, then I suppose I made the right decisions.  \u201cThis is going to be the new me; I just wanted to look good, is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, honey; if you decide to be lesbian or bi, I\u2019d be begging my wife to either let you move in with us or to let us move in with you.\u201d Looking at me, Leslie said, \u201cAre you ready to see the new you, Amelia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting butterflies in my stomach.  Fidgeting a little bit, I said, \u201cI-I\u2019m ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Leslie turned the monitor towards me; and I got my first look at the woman I would soon become.  To say I was floored would have been the understatement of the century; I was stunned by what I saw on the screen before me.  The woman looking back at me was downright gorgeous, exactly as I\u2019d pictured her as I answered Leslie\u2019s questions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After I spent a few minutes looking at images of what I would soon look like, Leslie and I got to work figuring out my new personality and what kind of life I wanted to have.  I won\u2019t bore you with the details; but suffice it to say, I was going to be a straight woman who liked yoga, jogging, and hanging out with friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was also going to have a professional demeanor at work; dressing in a skirt or pantsuit.  When not at work I\u2019d dress casually, but wasn\u2019t above dressing up for dates or girls nights.  Leslie was finalizing that information when two women, who I assumed were her coworkers Erin and Carrie, walked into the room.  As they sat at their desks, one of them said, \u201cGirl, why are you always working through lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast minute assignment from Miranda.\u201d Gesturing to me, Leslie said, \u201cErin King, Carrie Miller; let me introduce Amelia Webber, formerly Kevin Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions were made Erin came behind Leslie\u2019s desk and casually looked at the monitor.  \u201cDamn honey, you\u2019re going to be gorgeous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Blushing from embarrassment, I said, \u201cSome of that was Leslie\u2019s idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that; she always tries to persuade new women to get bigger breasts.\u201d Glancing at Leslie, who was blushing deeply, Erin said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t take too much of her advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you ladies mind?\u201d getting frustrated, Leslie said, \u201cAmelia and I were just about to finalize her career and education when you came in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies, we\u2019ll let you ladies get back to work.\u201d Looking at me, Erin said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently nodded as Erin and Carrie went back to their desks.  Once they were gone, I turned to Leslie and said, \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that I don\u2019t quite understand; you said that I\u2019ll be given whatever knowledge I\u2019ll need to live my life.  But how will I start a career if an employer finds out that my resume is a lie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey; we\u2019ve got contacts in colleges all over the country.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cWith one call, I can get you a degree from any one of them.  I can even get you into a sorority if you wanted to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well I suppose that makes sense.\u201d Looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cI never realized just how complicated this all was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a new life for you from scratch; things like that aren\u2019t easy.\u201d Turning to her keyboard, keeping one eye on me, Leslie said, \u201cSo the first question; what kind of career would you like to have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question gave me pause, as I tried to figure out an answer to it.  After a moment, I said, \u201cMy Aunt, or rather Kevin\u2019s Aunt, has made a pretty successful career as a financial executive in New York.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI always thought that would be a fun career to have, but I was never good with math.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing some work on her computer, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ve found several possible job openings with companies that we\u2019ve deemed safe for our clients.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie, once again, turned her monitor to let me see the possible job opportunities:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Executive Assistant; Innovative Talent Agency, Los Angeles<br>\r\nOption 2: Customer Service Representative; Boeing, Chicago<br>\r\nOption 3: Human Resources; Verges Financial Group, NYC<br>\r\nOption 4: Paralegal; Law Offices of Dennard &amp; McShane, Washington, DC<br>\r\nOption 5: Office Manager, Target Corporate Offices, Minneapolis<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving it some thought, I sat back and looked at Leslie.  \u201cI think I\u2019ll go with _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We stopped outside a door marked <i>Transfigurations</i>.  After knocking twice on the door, Leslie opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a woman about the age I\u2019d soon be; professional except for her bubblegum pink hair.  \u201cAmelia, this is Dr. Lizzie Weintraub; the head of Transfigurations here.\u201d Handing the woman the drive, Leslie said, \u201cLiz, this is soon to be Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Amelia; I\u2019m glad I can be of service to you.\u201d Plugging the drive into a computer, she said, \u201cI imagine that Leslie told you what you can expect from this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Dr. Weintraub; she mentioned sleeping for hours after it was finished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all girls here, Amelia; you can call me Liz.\u201d Gesturing towards a nearby door, she said, \u201cFollow me, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking Leslie for everything, I followed Liz through the door into a room whose main feature was a chair.  It resembled a reclining chair that was stuck in the reclined position.  As she handed me a hospital gown, Liz said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a few minutes; I\u2019ve found that clients like to say one last goodbye to their former lives.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cOnce that\u2019s done, take off all your clothes; including socks and underwear.  After you put the gown on, you\u2019ll lie back on the chair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Liz; I\u2019d like to get started right away.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve already said my goodbyes to every aspect of my life as Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded silently as she left the room; giving me privacy while I got undressed.  Once I settled onto the chair, she came back into the room.  Putting my clothes in a bag, she said, \u201cIs there anything in here that you\u2019d like to keep?  Otherwise, we\u2019ll return it to Kevin\u2019s family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the photos, I said, \u201cMy sister gave me an envelope with some photos, I\u2019d like to keep that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly found the envelope and placed it in a plastic container by the door.  \u201cWould you like a sedative before the nanites are administered?  Some of our clients don\u2019t wish to watch their bodies changing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sedative would be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz quickly ran an IV into my room; followed by a syringe of what I assumed was the nanites.  As she attached some wires to my head, she said, \u201cWhen you wake up, it\u2019ll be Amelia Webber\u2019s birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving me a quick peck on the cheek, she dimmed the lights and left the room.  I then closed my eyes and let the sedative do its work, so the nanites could do theirs.</span></div></div>",

Instead, I found that I had to dig it out of my cleavage.  <i>Did I have cleavage when I sat down?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the movie was over, Kelsey and I went into the bathroom to freshen up.  I took a moment to admire myself in the mirror; I was a good-looking young woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think my books will be like yours when I'm your age?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kelsey, smiling, I said, \u201cJust take a look at your mother, that\u2019ll tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I dawned on me; weren\u2019t Kelsey and I twins?  Why I would be talking about her mother as if she weren\u2019t mine?  Then I realized how absurd that sounded; we couldn\u2019t be twins because I was a good 10 years older than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the bathroom to find that Kyle and David were gone.  Where did they go?  Then I realized, they would\u2019ve hung out with Kevin; but I wasn\u2019t Kevin Scott anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was Amelia Webber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up again, the first thing I realized was how sensitive my skin was; a wave of pleasurable sensations washed over me as I moved around in the bed.  Opening my eyes, I was confronted with a few strands of hair blocking my view; so I pushed them aside while thinking \u2013 <i>I\u2019ll have to get used to that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up in bed, I found that I was inside a well-appointed hotel room; more than likely a suite from what I could see in the bedroom.  \u201cDamn, they go all out for their clients.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused; as that was the first time I\u2019d heard my new voice.  It sounded lovely; not too high pitched and almost melodic.  I then got it in my head to check out my new body, so I pulled the sheets off and made my way into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face was just as it had been on Leslie\u2019s screen; only seeing it on a screen didn\u2019t compare to seeing it in person.  <i>Damn girl, you look good.</i>  I was still wearing the hospital gown, so I couldn\u2019t see what I looked like underneath.  Of course, I\u2019d already seen computer images of that, but nothing can beat the real thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to disrobe and examine myself when there was a knock at the door.  Quickly fixing the gown, annoyed at the interruption, I walked through the room to the door.  Smelling a faint scent of smoke outside, I first thought perhaps there was a fire in the building.  Looking through the peephole, I saw Dr. Harris holding a small cake while Dr. Willard, Leslie, and Liz stood behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy memory still a little hazy, I opened the door.  Before I could say anything, all four women started singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d as they walked into my room.</span></div></div>",

Opening the second one, I saw that it was a Master\u2019s degree in Business Administration.  Looking closely at them, my jaw dropped.  \u201cHow did you guys get me degrees from Dartmouth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, we have our ways.\u201d Smiling, Leslie said, \u201cHold your head up high, girlfriend; you\u2019re the first one in your family to go off to college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you know?\u201d chuckling, as I put the diplomas next to the cake, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you got me violin lessons, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo we didn\u2019t, but then again you didn\u2019t ask for that.\u201d Looking at me, silently recording everything until now, Liz said, \u201cThere are, however, some other matters to attend to.

We were talking about basically anything that we could think of.  I always wondered how my mom could find herself drawn into such ideal chit-chat; now that I was a woman, I realized just how easy it could be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone but Leslie left about an hour later; saying that they had to get back to work.  After saying goodbye to them, I closed the door and walked back into the room.  Looking at Leslie, sitting on the couch, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, Leslie; but why are you still here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all decided that I\u2019d be the one to train you in how to be a woman.\u201d Leaning back against the couch, Leslie said, \u201cSeeing how I know firsthand what you\u2019re going through, they thought it would be easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Sitting next to her, pretending to be a little sad, I said, \u201cHere I thought it was because you liked me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do like you, Amelia; which is funny to say since we just met this afternoon.\u201d Getting up from the couch, Leslie said, \u201cNow follow me, we need to get you dressed; because that hospital gown is doing nothing to hide your figure, and it\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet in the room had a small assortment (3 outfits) of clothes to choose from.  Even though I was now a woman both physically and mentally, I wasn\u2019t ready to wear the dress or the business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter settling on the final option, capris pants, and a blouse, I went into the bathroom to get dressed.  I was a little worried about working the bra but found that I was able to put it on without a problem.  <i>Duh, they probably gave me the knowledge to do that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was satisfied, I walked back into the bedroom to find Leslie sitting on my bed.  Looking at me, with a weird expression on her face, Leslie said, \u201cWow, you fill out that bra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until now, I\u2019d taken her remarks with a grain of salt, figuring she was just being complimentary.  But now I was starting to get a little annoyed by what Leslie was saying.  \u201cDo you mind if I ask you something, Leslie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever it is, the answer's yes.\u201d Her weird expression turning into a big smile, Leslie perked up and said, \u201cA thousand times yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, right there, is what I want to ask you about.\u201d Sitting next to Leslie, I said, \u201cEver since I woke up, you\u2019ve been acting strange around me.  Hell, you were practically drooling over my pictures of the office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned back into a frown; she probably expected me to have said something else.  \u201cOh right, that.\u201d Composing herself, Leslie said, \u201cSorry if I made you uncomfortable; it\u2019s just this pregnancy has thrown my hormones completely out of whack.  I thought I could handle myself better since my period mood swings weren\u2019t bad, but pregnancy is a whole other ballgame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that I had overreacted a bit, I looked at her and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry; I-I just thought...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love my wife, Amelia; she\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d Turning serious, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019d never do anything to hurt her, especially not after the pain I caused my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we both sat in silence for a few minutes, I said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be getting started?\u201d chuckling, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ve only got a few days before I leave for LA; not to mention my dinner with my parents tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes going wide, Leslie said, \u201cOh right, I completely forgot about that; guess I had a case of pregnancy brain for a moment.\u201d Standing up, Leslie said, \u201cFollow me into the bathroom; I\u2019ll teach you how to do your hair and makeup.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t think I wanted to look like Mimi from the Drew Carey Show; and, after seeing a picture of her, I agreed with her.  To her surprise, I didn\u2019t need much in the way of lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me for asking, but wasn\u2019t Kevin one of those manly guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, rather he, wasn\u2019t exactly manly; but he wasn\u2019t feminine either.\u201d Gently putting on some mascara, looking at Leslie in the mirror, I said, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re already surprisingly good with the make-up.\u201d Looking at me, quizzically, Leslie said, \u201cI was just curious, is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen Kelsey and I were 10 years old, we both got mono and were stuck at home for a month.\u201d Looking over at Leslie, I said, \u201cShe was going through one of those girly phases and wanted to use me to practice with make-up.  Being the kind, older brother; I had no choice but to oblige.  I got pretty good at doing it myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour sister must\u2019ve been a very good teacher because you\u2019re doing better than me when I first changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might be insulted by that; if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I\u2019m a woman now.\u201d Looking at the three choices of lipstick on the counter, I said, \u201cThe only thing she didn\u2019t teach me about was lipstick; because Mom wouldn\u2019t let her have any at that age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame her.\u201d Sitting on the closed toilet, Leslie said, \u201cI was the same way with my daughter when she was growing up.  Part of it was because of my conservative upbringing, but I forbade her from wearing anything too revealing and she only wore a small amount of make-up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Leslie gave me the color she thought would go well with my outfit, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking; what was your previous life like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had your typical southern Catholic upbringing; gays and abortion were evil, that sort of thing.  I can only imagine what my folks would think of me now; being in a lesbian relationship with a baby on the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering your upbringing, I assume you were married at some point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEllen was a lovely woman; a great wife and a loving mother.\u201d Sighing, Leslie said, \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t died from cancer, she probably would\u2019ve divorced me because of the way I treated my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Leslie was starting to get emotional, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about this, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright; it\u2019s good to let it out now and then.\u201d Wiping some stray tears from her eyes, Leslie said, \u201cOf course, being pregnant makes it that much easier to start crying without much notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour or so, Leslie was satisfied that I knew more than enough.  The hardest part was walking in the heels; they\u2019d given me the knowledge to walk in them, but Leslie said I needed to get used to walking in them to get some muscle memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave myself a quick once over, touching up my make-up and putting my hair into a bun.  Walking out of the bathroom, I said, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a woman after my own heart.\u201d Wincing, Leslie said, \u201cDon\u2019t mind me; it\u2019s the pregnancy hormones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked out into the main room, I said, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s time to go meet my parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they texted me a few minutes ago to let me know they were downstairs.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cLet\u2019s grab your purse, and then we\u2019ll \u2013 oh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly grew concerned as Leslie sat down on the couch.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d running over to her, I said, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie didn\u2019t say anything; instead, she took my hand and held it to her belly.  Soon after, I felt a powerful kick from the baby.  \u201cOh my.\u201d  I\u2019d always had an interest in pregnant women, nothing perverted mind you.  Now I found myself imagining being pregnant myself; which, thanks to the nanites, was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you might like that.\u201d Slowly getting to her feet, Leslie said, \u201cThis little guy drives me crazy sometimes; especially when he uses my bladder as a drum set.  But then, when I\u2019m feeling depressed about something, I feel him kick and it reminds me that I\u2019ve got a person growing inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a boy, huh?\u201d smiling, I said, \u201cHow about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a better job raising him than my parents did.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cSomeday, if one of his kids happens to be gay maybe he won\u2019t repeat my mistakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be a great mother, Leslie.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cAnd I hope I get a chance to meet the little guy someday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d chuckling, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019m calling you as soon as I go into labor; I don\u2019t care if you have to get a red-eye flight from LA, I want you here when I have the baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a purse that Liz and the others had left for me, I said, \u201cI think we\u2019ve kept my parents waiting long enough, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cHow will we recognize them once we get down there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know them through their daughter Heather; she\u2019s a former co-worker who set me up with my wife.\u201d Looking straight ahead, with the occasional wince breaking her concentration, Leslie said, \u201cThey also have a 14-year-old son they adopted; he went through the program about 5 years ago, shortly before I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me; but if they already have two children of their own, why are they pretending to be my parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator stopped briefly on the 6th floor but no one got on.  As the doors closed, Leslie said, \u201cMy wife and I had dinner with them a few months ago; where they talked about wanting to join the Host program.\u201d Turning to look at me, she said, \u201cThey said they wanted to do it in memory of their eldest daughter, Deanna, who died from brain cancer last year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed Leslie was tearing up a little; and figured that she must\u2019ve been close to Deanna.  \u201cWere the two of you close?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had no family left after what happened with my daughter; and my surviving relatives would probably slam the door in my face if I ever went to visit.\u201d Looking at me, wiping tears from her eyes, Leslie said, \u201cHeather and her family took me in; gave me a home when I had none.  When it came time for my wedding, you can probably imagine how hard it was for me to choose between them to be my maid of honor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mentioned something about them adopting another New Horizons client, what\u2019s he like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuncan\u2019s an amazing kid, nothing like how he was before he entered the program.\u201d Looking at me, as the elevator finally arrived at the lobby, Leslie said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to go into detail, but let\u2019s just say he didn\u2019t have the best life before New Horizons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us stepped out in the lobby, I turned to see Leslie wincing again.  \u201cHey, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine; it\u2019s just the baby is alternating between kicking my bladder and sitting on my sciatic nerve.\u201d Wincing, Leslie said, \u201cEvery time he moves it\u2019s like someone\u2019s jabbing a hot needle in my leg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving Leslie a moment to let the pain subside, the two of us walked through the lobby towards the restaurant.  It wasn\u2019t long before we spotted a middle-aged couple waving at us in front of the restaurant.  As the two of us walked over, the woman quickly hugged Leslie and said, \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you, sweetie.\u201d With a smile, she turned her attention to Leslie\u2019s belly and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have that much longer to go; how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo months to go; and I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t counting the days.\u201d Turning to me, Leslie said, \u201cStan and Joanna Simmons; allow me to introduce Amelia Webber, your daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a 20-minute wait before we were able to get a table, so the four of us sat at the bar while we waited.  We passed the time by getting to know each other; they were polite and didn\u2019t ask a lot of personal questions.  But I didn\u2019t want to be impolite so I told them what I was comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we were brought to our table and drinks had been ordered, Joanna dug through her purse and pulled out her phone.  While she did something on it, she looked at me and said, \u201cHeather and Duncan wanted to be here, but they\u2019re currently on their annual brother-sister vacation.\u201d Looking at me, she continued, \u201cThey go on vacation, just the two of them, every year; this year they\u2019re white-water rafting in Colorado.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeslie didn\u2019t tell me a whole lot about Duncan, but it\u2019s nice to see that he got a second chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna started to tear up briefly, so Stan placed his hand on hers.  Turning to me, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what fate could have befallen Duncan had he not gone to New Horizons.\u201d With a faint smile, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not a religious man, but I thank God every day for bringing Duncan into our lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she composed herself, Joanna handed me her phone and said, \u201cI have some photos of Heather and Duncan if you feel like looking at them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I scrolled through the photos it became clear that <i>some</i> was an understatement; there had to be over two hundred photos of them on Joanna\u2019s phone.  They ranged from Halloween photos to family vacations and what I could only assume was Heather\u2019s college graduation.  Handing the phone back to her, I said, \u201cYou have a lovely family, Joanna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Amelia.\u201d With a smile on her face, she said, \u201cAfter dinner, I\u2019d love to get a photo with you, so I can show it to your brother and sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner came a short time later; I didn\u2019t want to ruin my new figure so I ordered a chicken salad.  Between bites, I turned my attention to Stan and said, \u201cI have to say, Stan; you\u2019re a pleasant change from my first father.\u201d Taking a bigger than normal sip of my wine, I said, \u201cHe ran out of my family when I was 8 years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA man who abandons his family is no man at all.\u201d Looking at me, Stan said, \u201cAmelia, I promise to treat you as though you were my flesh and blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner progressed quickly after that, we alternated between eating and talking.  By the time the waitress came around with the dessert menu, I was already referring to them as Mom and Dad.  It felt weird to think they were replacing my original family, but it was necessary; after all, I was no longer related to anyone in the Scott family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we were finished with dinner, we took the photo that Mom had wanted and they left.  Leslie had to leave as well, so I said goodbye to her.  As I waited for the elevator to return to my room, I found myself looking forward to seeing them again.</span></div></div>",

Looking at the clock, I saw that it was just after 8:30 AM.  \u201cWho could that be?\u201d Throwing the covers off, I was immediately faced with the sight of my naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my memory of the night before came back.  I\u2019d had a little bit of wine after I came back to the room (which would explain my headache), after which I decided to explore my new body.  I guess I got so carried away that I didn\u2019t even get dressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, putting on the bathrobe, I slowly walked to the door.  Looking through the peephole, I saw Leslie standing there with a bag on her arms.  Opening the door, I said, \u201cLeslie, it's 8:30 in the morning.  Adding the fact that I\u2019m hungover, I\u2019m not in the mood for more training today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, I\u2019m not in the mood to train you today.  Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest.\u201d Walking into the room, Leslie said, \u201cI figured we\u2019d take advantage of the amenities here, so I made us a spa appointment for 10:00; then I thought we\u2019d hang out at the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great.\u201d Closing the door, I said, \u201cDo you mind keeping it down a little bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I know what you must be going through.\u201d Peaking in the bedroom, seeing the bed in disarray, Leslie looked back at me.  \u201cLooks like you had a little fun last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory involving the detachable showerhead flashed in my mind.  Turning crimson from embarrassment, I said, \u201cI <i>may</i> have done some exploring last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to be embarrassed, Amelia; you used to be a teenage boy, it\u2019s only natural.\u201d Chuckling, Leslie said, \u201cHell, I did the same thing my first night.  The second night, I went to a gay bar and brought some girl back to my room for a one-night stand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing where Leslie was going with that, I shook my head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not even remotely ready to have sex with a guy; I haven\u2019t even been a woman for 24 hours yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on girl, let\u2019s get changed and go to the pool.\u201d Looking at the clock, which said 8:42, Leslie said, \u201cThere\u2019s a tankini hanging in the closet for you to wear.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sure there\u2019d be occasions where a bikini was appropriate but I figured that I\u2019d generally want to dress sensibly.  I\u2019m not going to be one of those girls who always show off their figure to get guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was standing in front of the mirror, getting a good look at myself when there was a knock on the bathroom door.  \u201cCome on, Amelia; we don\u2019t want to be late for our spa appointment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Spoilsport</i>.  With a sigh, I opened the door and said, \u201cCan you blame me for wanting to admire myself in the mirror?\u201d looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cYou mean to tell me that you didn\u2019t do the same thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie stood in the doorway, looking me over, for a moment until she said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t hold it against you.\u201d Handing me some clothes, Leslie said, \u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019ve been under some stress lately; what with the pregnancy and my wife\u2019s schoolwork keeping us from...you know.  I could use a day to relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the clothes on over my suit, Leslie and I left the room.  As we walked down the hall towards the elevator, I looked at her and said, \u201cDo you always spend this much time with a client?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot normally, no.\u201d looking at me, as she pressed the button, Leslie said, \u201cThere\u2019s just something about you that I like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to when we were designing my new body, I said, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s got nothing to do with being attracted to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we stepped into the elevator, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ll admit that\u2019s part of it; but mostly it\u2019s because we\u2019ve similar upbringings.  We were both raised by single parents; granted, I was raised by a father whose life lessons led to me alienating my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the elevator reached the lobby, I said, \u201cSounds to me like you need this more than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked out of the elevator, Leslie nodded and said, \u201cI just wish I could take advantage of more of the spa\u2019s services; but, alas, my pregnancy prevents me from doing that.\u201d With a grin, Leslie said, \u201cAlthough there\u2019s nothing wrong with a facial and a mani/pedi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking through the list of services before you arrived.\u201d Turning down the hall towards the spa, I said, \u201cI kind of want to try that mud bath; but if last night\u2019s any indication, my body might be too sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe increased sensitivity is only temporary, it\u2019ll wear off by tomorrow.\u201d Looking at me, Leslie said, \u201cYou should do the mud bath, I think you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us walked into the spa; where we saw a guy, about our age, standing behind the counter.  If seeing my new female appearance wasn\u2019t enough to make me realize how much had changed, then I definitely realized it when I found myself turned on by the guy.  Leaning over to Leslie, whispering in her ear, I said, \u201cHe\u2019s cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, he is rather easy on the eyes.\u201d With a raised eyebrow, Leslie said, \u201cIf I were straight, I\u2019d be all over him.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Heading out to the pool deck, which overlooked the water and had one of those bars that you could swim up to.  I picked a lounge chair and stretched out of the soak up the sun; not even bothering to think about where Leslie was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, a cabana boy came up to me and said, \u201cMay I offer you something from the bar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering until yesterday I\u2019d been an underage teenage boy, I didn\u2019t have experience in the alcoholic beverage department.

So delicious, in fact, that I gleefully accepted a second one.  I was in a very good mood by time the second one was half gone.  So good, in fact, I wanted to share my good time with the cabana boy.  As he walked by, with another guests order, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a real nice body.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cYou want to hold it against me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn hindsight, I imagine that he got this a lot; but he still played it cool.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cI-I beg your pardon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering to my feet, I said, \u201cYou wanna come back to my room?\u201d grabbing the straps of my tankini, I said, \u201cOr we do it right here, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Leslie intervened before things got out of hand; stepping between me and the cabana boy.  \u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s enough for one day, sweetie.\u201d Turning to the cabana boy, she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about my friend; she\u2019s a bit over-served.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabana boy beat a hasty retreat while Leslie pulled me away from the pool.  \u201cW-Wha\u2019s going on?\u201d slurring a little bit, I said, \u201cWha\u2019s the big idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were in private, Leslie looked at me and said, \u201cHow much did you have to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only had too mo-hoo-toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well there are three things you need to know: One, you can\u2019t handle your liquor.  Two, you\u2019ve got no game at all.  And three, acting like that at a family pool is a very good way to get yourself removed from the hotel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch. I think I need a little help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you upstairs to your room; you take a nap, then we\u2019ll get you some coffee, and then I\u2019ll teach you how to flirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in my inebriated state, I found the idea of Leslie teaching me to flirt hilarious.  \u201cYou?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving me one of those \u2018are you kidding me\u2019 looks, Leslie said, \u201cJust because I\u2019ve put on an extra 20 pounds, doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t get people to look at me.\u201d Grabbing my hand, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you tonight after you\u2019ve sobered up?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Getting out of bed, I walked into the next room to find Leslie sitting on the couch reading a book of baby names.  \u201cStill trying to settle on a name for the baby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah; one minute I have a name I like, but then the next minute I hate it.\u201d Sighing, as she put the book down, Leslie said, \u201cAt first I wanted to name the baby Theodore, after the man I used to be; but then I realized he didn\u2019t deserve that honor.

It was clingy in all the right places and even lifted my breasts ever so slightly.  As I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, looking at my reflection, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about much things had changed in such a short time.  I\u2019d gone from being an unhappy teenage boy to a woman in her 20s; one who was being taken to a bar to learn how to flirt with guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter touching up my makeup, I carefully got into the heeled boots that Leslie left for me.  I was worried about walking in them but found that I had no problem doing so.  Then I remembered they\u2019d given me that knowledge.  Walking out into the main room, I saw Leslie talking on her phone.  \u201cWe should be at the bar shortly; I\u2019m just waiting on Amelia.\u201d Seeing me in the doorway, she said, \u201cI gotta go, she\u2019s standing in the doorway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Leslie hung up her phone, I said, \u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my wife, Grace.\u201d Putting her phone away, Leslie said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to meet us at the bar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I followed Leslie towards the door, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s great, I can\u2019t wait to meet her.\u201d Stopping mid-stride, I said, \u201cWait, does she know about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the basics; you were a teenage boy but now you\u2019re a woman.\u201d Opening the door, Leslie said, \u201cI figured you\u2019d want to tell her the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out the door, with a grin, I said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll tell her how you\u2019ve been practically flirting with me all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, please; you\u2019d know if I was flirting with you.\u201d Walking down the hall, Leslie said, \u201cThat reminds me, you\u2019re going to get a lot of attention in that outfit; good and bad.  So be prepared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you picked it for me to wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much; I wanted you to get used to people taking an interest in you.\u201d With a grin, Leslie said, \u201cBesides, it doesn\u2019t hurt that you look amazing in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie was right; I was getting a lot of attention because of my outfit.  It was still weird to think this was my life now; I wondered <br>\r\nhow these folks would react if they learned that the woman they were flirting with used to be a teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d been at the bar for almost 25 minutes; Leslie was sitting at a nearby booth, while I was sitting up at the bar.  I was sipping a bottle of Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade when a guy, a few years younger than myself, walked over.  \u201cHey gorgeous, what\u2019s a lovely lady like yourself doing here all alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I\u2019m a novice at flirting, but even I knew those pick up lines were dated.  Deciding to play along, I said, \u201cI\u2019m here with a friend of mine; just trying to experience the local nightlife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you and your friend would like to come back to my place; my buddies and I could show you a good time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the way he said that made me feel uneasy.  Before I could rebuff him, however, Leslie appeared next to me and said, \u201cGirl, there you are; I\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy took one look at Leslie\u2019s belly and walked off.  Taking my drink back to the table, I said, \u201cThanks for that; I got a weird vibe from that guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard him talking to some of his friends; good thing too because I think they planned on taking advantage of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat, I said, \u201cAre all guys going to be like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs someone who used to be like these guys, I can tell you; there will be some who you\u2019ll want to stay away from.\u201d Sighing, Leslie said, \u201cBut there are good guys out there as well; you just have to find the right one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me; weren\u2019t you supposed to teach me about flirting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose now\u2019s as good a time as any.\u201d Pointing towards the bar, Leslie said, \u201cYou see that girl at the end; the one with the tattoos on her right arm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking where Leslie was pointing, I saw a girl sitting at the bar no more than 5 feet away from us.  Turning back to Leslie, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know; I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s your type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Leslie got up and walked over to the girl.  It was just quiet enough that I could make out what they were saying.  Looking at the girl, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you from my booth; I think you\u2019re one of the most beautiful women I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not too bad yourself.\u201d Smiling, the girl said, \u201cDo you live in town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t live that far from here.\u201d Leaning closer, Leslie said, \u201cWhat do you say we go back to my place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was riveted by the scene before me; to my surprise, Leslie was having luck with a woman.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for the woman at the bar, though; I don\u2019t think she realized that Leslie was married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just going to ask you the same thing; how about we go to my place instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came next was a complete surprise to me; as Leslie said, \u201cWell then, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s the same place then.\u201d Leaning forward to <br>\r\nkiss the woman, Leslie said, \u201cPerhaps we can have a little fun tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure what was going on; I was in shock as Leslie and the woman came over to the table.  Looking at me, the woman said, <br>\r\n\u201cI think we owe her an explanation, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to the woman next to her, Leslie said, \u201cAmelia; this is my wife, Grace.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We stayed for a while until the bar got a little rowdy for our tastes, so we went back to my hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie decided to lie down shortly after we got back to the room; so that left me alone with Grace.  After changing out of the dress, I walked out into the bedroom to find Grace lying on the bed next to Leslie.  Seeing the way she was around her, I could tell that Grace cared deeply for Leslie.  Walking over to her, I said, \u201cHow about we grab a couple of beers and go chat on the balcony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently climbing out of bed, so as not to wake Leslie, Grace said, \u201cHoney, you read my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the beers in hand, the two of us adjourned to the balcony.  As we sat down, I looked at Grace and said, \u201cLeslie was rather tight-lipped about your life; if it\u2019s alright, I\u2019d like to hear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be nearly as interesting as yours, but I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d Sipping the beer, Grace said, \u201cI\u2019m the 2nd oldest of four kids and the only girl.  My dad served in the Army, go figure, so we moved around a lot.  I was never really in one place long enough to make friends, so I hung out with my brothers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s how Grace and I spent the next 30 minutes; talking about her childhood and how she and her siblings all joined the military.  The more she talked, the more I got the sense that she strongly disliked those who attacked someone for their religion or sexual orientation.  Which had me wondering why she was married to someone like Leslie?  Taking a sip from my beer, I said, \u201cForgive me if I\u2019m out of line here, but I can\u2019t figure out exactly why you\u2019re married to someone like Leslie.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, she\u2019s a wonderful person <i>now</i>; but in her former life she would\u2019ve been vehemently anti-homosexual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me; when I found out the truth, about who she used to be, I considered just ending the date then and there.  The last thing I wanted to do was date a formerly bigoted middle-aged man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI spoke with Heather, the mutual friend who set us up.  She assured me that Leslie\u2019s desire to change was genuine; that she wanted to experience the type of life that her daughter was living.\u201d Leaning back in the chair, Grace said, \u201cSo I took a chance and asked her on a second date.  I\u2019m glad that I did; forgive the corniness, but she\u2019s the love of my life.  When the time comes for her daughter to learn the truth, I hope she sees that Leslie has changed for the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil that moment I hadn\u2019t given much thought to how Kelsey and my mom would respond to me becoming a woman.  \u201cIt\u2019s funny you mention that because I\u2019m rather worried about how my family will react when they learn that I\u2019ve become a woman.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cAll this was their idea so, deep down, I hope they\u2019ll be supportive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ask this; but since you brought it up.\u201d Leaning forward, Grace said, \u201cWhat was so wrong with your old life that your mother and sister thought this would be a good idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver since I turned 13, I\u2019ve just been unhappy; just going through the day to day motions.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, there were moments where I was happy, but they were few and far between.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me if I\u2019m off base, but going to a place like New Horizons seems just a tiny bit drastic.\u201d Sighing, Grace said, \u201cI was still trying to figure out whether or not I was straight at your age.  There were certainly times where I got depressed, but I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve gone to the lengths that you went to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no turning back now, so I guess I\u2019m stuck with the consequences of my decision.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cJust out of <br>\r\ncuriosity, when exactly did you figure <i>it</i> out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Grace to realize what I was getting at; but once she did, she sighed and said, \u201cAbout a year after I enlisted I found myself alone in the base gym when this girl from my unit, a recent recruit, walked in.\u201d pausing, Grace said, \u201cWe got to talking; long story short, we ended up dating for two years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re no longer together, so what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt turns out that I was a lesbian, but she wasn\u2019t.\u201d taking a deep, labored breath Grace said, \u201cShe thought she was, but she figured out about 3 months into our relationship that she wasn\u2019t.  Rather than come clean right then and there, she led me on for another 15 months.  Last I heard she was working as a teacher in Seattle with her husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems to me like things worked out well in the end; you\u2019re married to Leslie and you\u2019re about to have a child together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe talked for a little while longer until I mentioned what happened with the guy at the bar.  \u201cI\u2019m still new to all this, so I have no clue how to figure out whether or not a guy is a creep.\u201d  Sighing, I said, \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Leslie stepping in, I probably would have left with the guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, I would\u2019ve intervened before it got to that point.\u201d Getting up, Grace said, \u201cBut if you\u2019re interested, I can teach you some self-defense moves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything I\u2019d learned about her, I had some misgivings about Grace teaching me.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cGrace, I\u2019m 130lbs soaking wet; I doubt there\u2019s much I can do to defend myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI served in the Army for 4 years, and had 3 brothers trust me when I say I can show you some things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s what we were doing when Leslie walked out onto the patio; Grace was on her knees and I had her arm bent behind her back.  Looking at us, Leslie said, \u201cI heard all the noise and, for a moment, I thought you were doing something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing Grace\u2019s arm, with a grin, I said, \u201cOh we were doing that earlier; I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t hear us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry look on Leslie\u2019s face told me that my joke was in poor taste.  Before she could do anything, Grace stepped between us and said, \u201cBabe relax, she was just kidding.\u201d Pausing, Grace said, \u201cI was just teaching her some self-defense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down, Leslie looked at me and said, \u201cThat reminds me, I\u2019ll buy you a thing of pepper spray for your purse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Feeling apologetic, I said, \u201cSorry about that joke; I don\u2019t know why I thought it would be funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of joke you tell a pregnant woman, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and Leslie left a short time later; after promising they\u2019d be here tomorrow with the others to see me off.  After saying goodbye to them, I closed the door and smiled \u2013 I\u2019d be starting my new life tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up this morning, as I\u2019d done every morning for the last few days, with a smile on my face.  Today was the big day \u2013 the day I\u2019d been working towards ever since I walked into New Horizons.  I was leaving for Los Angeles and my new life as 26-year-old Amelia Webber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will admit to a tinge of remorse about leaving; after all, I\u2019d spent my entire life in this area.  But, as I sat up in bed, I knew it was for the best.  Besides it wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d never see Kelsey and my mom again, I\u2019d come back to visit once I felt the time was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, I went into the bathroom to shower; I was in the process of getting undressed when there was a knock at the door.  Walking back into the room, I looked at the clock and saw that it was only 7:45.  After putting on the bathrobe, I walked to the door \u2013 the whole time wondering who could be visiting at this hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the peephole, I saw a bellboy standing outside holding what appeared to be a garment bag.  Opening the door, I said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding me the garment bag, the bellboy said, \u201cThis was left for you at the front desk ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Gently placing the bag on the back of a nearby chair, I said, \u201cLet me get some money for a tip, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went over to the desk where I\u2019d left my purse the night before.  I searched through it but had a hard time finding any cash.  As I replayed the events of last night to figure out where it might have gone, I caught a glimpse of the bellboy staring at me in the mirror.  I was ready to ignore the lewd looks he was giving me, until he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re having trouble finding money, I\u2019m willing to accept <i>other</i> arrangements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling disgusted, I couldn\u2019t help but shudder at that comment.  <i>God, men can be such pigs.</i>  I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle slightly at that thought; I had been a man only a few days earlier.  With that being said, I\u2019d never talk to women like that.  Placing the $15 back in my purse, I turned and around said, \u201cYou just talked yourself right out of a tip; next time, don\u2019t talk to a woman like that.\u201d Standing in the doorway, I said, \u201cNow leave before I complain to your manager.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bellboy, visibly annoyed, turned and walked away.  Even as he walked down the hall, I heard him grumble what sounded like \u201cDumb bitch.\u201d  Deciding not to make good on my threat, I closed the door and turned my attention to the garment bag.  Opening it up, I saw that it contact a lovely, and recently pressed, tan skirt suit; along with a matching pair of heels at the bottom.  I noticed a note inside the bag; which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You\u2019re a mature woman now; might as well dress the part.<br>\r\n-- Eliza</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging the outfit up, I returned to the bathroom to get ready.</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t help but look at my reflection and try to picture what I used to look like only a few days earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the process of finishing up some mascara when there was a knock at the door.  For a fleeting moment, I thought it was that creepy bellboy again until I heard Eliza\u2019s voice.  \u201cAmelia, are you awake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the room to the door, I saw Eliza standing in the hall with Miranda, Leslie, and Grace.  With a smile, I opened the door and said, \u201cHey guys, come on in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone walked by, I noticed Leslie eyeing me as she walked by.  \u201cThat suit looks amazing on you, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Closing the door, I said, \u201cI know I was made to not find this awkward or uncomfortable, but part of me still feels weird about wearing women\u2019s clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did want to dress like a professional.\u201d Standing next to Grace, Leslie said, \u201cTrust me, give it a few more days and all that awkwardness will disappear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of idle conversation, we all sat down in the main room.  Looking at me, Eliza said, \u201cI\u2019d imagine you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re all here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe thought had crossed my mind.\u201d Crossing my legs, I said, \u201cI just figured it was you guys being friendly; showing me how to be a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter casting a glance towards Eliza, Miranda turned to me and said, \u201cWe did want to show you the ropes, but we also wanted to be your friends.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cWe do something similar for all our clients; tailor our relationship with them to fit what their new identity would be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor example, had you decided to become an older guy; we would have become your wing girls.\u201d Smiling, Leslie said, \u201cOr surrogate children had you become an elderly woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Eliza said, \u201cThat\u2019s just a convoluted way of saying that we are your friends, or at least someone you can confide in.\u201d grabbing her bag, Eliza pulled out a laptop and camera, \u201cThat reminds me, we\u2019ve set up several social media accounts for you; Facebook, Twitter, etc.  We just need to take a photo for your profile picture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the obligatory profile photo, we all scrunched together for a group photo \u2013 five girlfriends hanging out.  Once the photos were uploaded to the various accounts, I scrolled through Facebook and saw that I already had some friends, including those present.  \u201cHow can I have friends already?  I\u2019ve never met any of these people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of them are fake accounts controlled by a computer program we developed, but most are real people.\u201d Looking at me, Leslie said, \u201cMuch like with your \u2018parents\u2019 we have employees who pretend to be friends when needed.  In your situation, we\u2019ve even paid people to say they were High School or College classmates, fellow cheerleaders, and I think one or two sorority sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m impressed; you guys do think of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me.\u201d Grabbing an envelope from her bag, Eliza said, \u201cInside you\u2019ll find your driver\u2019s license, social security card, and a passport.  I\u2019ve also got you a first-class ticket to LA that leaves in about 4 hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the envelope, I said \u201cFirst class, huh?  I\u2019ve always wondered what it would be like to sit in those seats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda and Eliza looked at Leslie for a moment; she stared at them blankly for a moment until she suddenly said, \u201cOh right; your living arrangements are taken care of, you\u2019re renting a room in a 25-year-old woman\u2019s condo.  Everything will be there when you arrive; clothes, makeup, and personal effects.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve also verified your interview for tomorrow morning at 9:30.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to feel a little overwhelmed by everything; so much so that I started tearing up.  After Grace gave me a tissue, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank you, ladies, enough for everything you\u2019ve done for me the last few days.\u201d Wiping my eyes, I said, \u201cWhen my mom and sister told me about this, I wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea.  But now, I\u2019ve never been surer about anything in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the first day of the rest of your life, Amelia.\u201d Hugging me, Leslie said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to do great out in LA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Eliza said, \u201cWe should probably get going, the hotel has to clean the room for our next client.\u201d Looking at me, <br>\r\nshe said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a rental car downstairs for you; feel free to drive around a little before going to the airport.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After waving goodbye to them, I drove out of the parking lot; surprised by how well I was handling the car.  I\u2019d never driven before today; before becoming Amelia, I\u2019d been months away from getting my learner's permit.  It wasn't till a moment later I realized they\u2019d put the knowledge in my head \u2013 just like with my bra, my hair and make-up, and my ability to walk in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t resist the temptation so, once I came to a stoplight, I let my hair down and lowered the top.  Once I started moving again, I relished the feeling of the wind in my hair.  After driving along the beach for a few minutes, casually checking out some of the guys, I decided to take Eliza\u2019s advice and drive around my former hometown.  After all, it was going to be a while before I came back to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip on the highway wasn\u2019t long; before I knew it, I was driving through downtown passed all my old hangouts.  At a stop sign, by the park, I noticed Kyle and David crossing the street in front of me.  I had to force myself to play it cool, but that was difficult once they noticed me.  I wasn\u2019t sure what they were more impressed with \u2013 the attractive young woman in the car or the car itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave them both a polite wave before driving off; not long after, I found myself driving through my old neighborhood.  It was the last day before school started tomorrow, so most of the kids were outside playing while they could.  Some of them I knew quite well, having babysat for many of them.  I couldn\u2019t help but think that I\u2019d have an easier time controlling Tommy Johnson now than I did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon found myself in front of my old house; I saw Mom\u2019s car was gone, while Kelsey was out front practicing her cheer routines.  I parked across the street and watched as she put herself through her paces \u2013 wrapping it all up with a perfect Double-9 jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she took a sip from a water bottle and saw me watching her from across the street.  Without even thinking, I touched my lips with two fingers and turned them in her direction.  It was our secret handshake, one that we\u2019d done since we were kids.  I suppose now it served to tell her that I was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reciprocated and then stared at me confused.  Then the realization hit her and, even from across the street, I heard her say, \u201cKevin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started jogging towards me; but I drove off before she got too close, I\u2019d overstayed my welcome and wasn\u2019t ready to reintroduce myself just yet.  Besides; my flight left in 3 hours and I still needed to check-in for my flight.  <i>Maybe I'll get a drink at the bar or something.</i></span></div></div>",

I\u2019d only flown three times in my life; who\u2019d have thought my 4th would be as a woman.  I gave the driver a nice tip as thanks for helping me when I stumbled off the shuttle.  I\u2019d heard horror stories about women twisting their ankles in heels; let\u2019s just say I was grateful that I was able to walk it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my suitcase in tow, I made my way inside to check-in.  Taking into consideration the fact that school started tomorrow, I was surprised by the number of families around.  Waiting in line, I realized that they were probably just flying home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman behind the counter was a few years younger than me; chatty but not annoyingly so.  She did compliment me on my outfit, however; which I thought was nice.  The ladies at NHI had enrolled me in TSA Pre-Check, so I made it through security in less than 5 minutes.  Once I was through security, I walked over to the departure board noticed that my flight was running about 30 minutes late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grumbled to myself in annoyance \u2013 I wanted to start my new life; not sit around the airport.  Next to me, I heard a man say, \u201cDammit.\u201d  Choosing not to engage, figuring he was upset about a delay, I walked past him as he went to join a woman standing nearby with two young children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter buying some a book at the store, not one of those mushy harlequin romance novels, I decided to stop by the bar for a drink.  Taking to heart Leslie\u2019s remark about me not holding my liquor, I figured it would be a good idea to improve my tolerance.  That being said, I didn\u2019t want to drink so much that I wouldn\u2019t be on the plane; so I settled for a hard cider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the better part of an hour at the bar, watching the people as they walked past on the way to their destinations.  I\u2019ll admit that it was kind of a turn-on: knowing that they saw me as an attractive young woman and not the teenage boy I used to be.  I knew most of the people at the bar, including some of the women, wouldn\u2019t be so interested in me had they known the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was finishing up my second hard cider when I heard footsteps behind me; followed by an intoxicated, yet familiar voice saying, \u201cH-Hello be-beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Great.</i></span>  Putting my drink down, I turned and found the man I\u2019d seen at the departure board standing in front of me; not even attempting to hide the fact that he was looking at my chest.</span></div></div>",

I was also aware of the fact that I\u2019d had three encounters with creepy men in the last 12 hours.  I turned towards the bartender, a middle-aged man, who gave me an apologetic look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting my drink down, I decided to get the man to leave as quickly as possible.  I wasn\u2019t about to let some married man flirt with me.  Turning to the man, I said, \u201cWhat can I do for you, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man inched closer to me; even putting a hand on my thigh as he slurred his speech.  \u201cWhada ya say we goes somewhere...somewhere private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must\u2019ve been my punishment for my actions at the pool yesterday; I was experiencing what I put that poor cabana boy through.  I somewhat aggressively removed the man\u2019s hand from my waist, said hand having moved further down my leg as the man talked.  While the bartender went to the other end of the bar, I assumed to call the cops, I looked at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not going to happen; since you\u2019re old enough to be my father.\u201d Sighing, repulsed, I said, \u201cOn top of all that, you\u2019re drunk and you\u2019re married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that wasn\u2019t enough for the man to get the hint, as he responded.  \u201cWe can just have a quickie. I know a quiet spot...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly heard the hurried sound of approaching footsteps, followed by an angry woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cHarold! Get away from that woman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up and breathed a sigh of relief as I saw the man\u2019s wife walking into the bar.  Seeing the look on her face, I assumed she was going to be angry with me as well.  The bartender had the same assumption because he came out from behind the bar and said, \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019ve already called airport police; your husband has been acting very inappropriately towards this woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman glared at her husband for a moment before calming down, ever so slightly, and turning to me.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss; this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done something like this.\u201d Turning back to her husband, she said, \u201cJust for this, Harold; my mother will be staying with us \u2013 for four months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took another twenty minutes for everything to be cleared up; the man was arrested for public intoxication and removed from his flight, while the wife decided that she and the kids would continue to Boston.  After I gave my statement to the police, and the woman apologized again, the bartender came up to me and said, \u201cWould you like something from the bar, ma\u2019am?  It\u2019ll be on the house of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Finishing off the last of my drink, I left a $10 bill on the bar.  \u201cI think I\u2019m just going to sit at the gate and read my book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you have a pleasant flight, ma\u2019am; and I\u2019m sorry about what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked through the terminal, I heard my cell phone ringing in my purse.  Digging it out, I saw that it was Miranda calling.  <br>\r\nAnswering the call, I said, \u201cHey Miranda, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much; had a few new clients come in this morning.\u201d Pausing, Miranda said, \u201cI was just calling to make sure you got to the airport okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I continued walking, I recounted everything that happened since I left.  When I got to the part about Kelsey, I said, \u201cIn hindsight, I probably shouldn\u2019t have let her see me, but I couldn\u2019t leave without seeing her one last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s understandable; after all, she was your twin sister for 15 years.\u201d Sighing, Miranda said, \u201cMight I suggest you give yourself a few days to adjust to LA before contacting them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to do that anyway, but that\u2019s good advice.\u201d  Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI just hope I\u2019ve had my last encounter with creepy men for a while.  First, that guy at the bar last night and then the bellboy this morning implying I could sleep with him in place of a tip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an attractive woman, Amelia; I\u2019m sorry to say, but creepy guys are kind of par for the course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle creepy guys that are my age, but I could do without older men hitting on me.\u201d Taking a seat at the gate, I said, \u201cI was at the airport bar, having a relaxing drink when this man came up who was old enough to be my father.  He was drunk but the worst part was that he was married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWhy are men such pigs, Miranda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t help you there, girlfriend; I was born female, so I have no understanding about how the male mind works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what you will about Kevin\u2019s father; the man may have run off on his family, but he never hit on younger girls.\u201d Leaning back, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you girls when I land in LA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d Chuckling, Miranda said, \u201cGood luck out there, Amelia.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The 5 \u00bd hour flight to LA was largely uneventful; except for some turbulence as we flew through a storm over Colorado.  Towards the end of the flight, I was awakened by a crying baby a few seats behind me.  <i>Guess I can\u2019t get away from that even in First Class.</i>  As I settled back in my seat, I realized something \u2013 instead of being annoyed by the crying, I found myself feeling sympathy for the baby.  I even had a different reaction to witnessing the mother breastfeeding the baby in the galley; instead of Kevin\u2019s more prurient reaction to seeing a woman's bare breast, I found myself imagining myself taking care of my own child someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we landed, I decided to use the bathroom before heading to baggage claim.  As I left the bathroom I bumped into a celebrity crush of Kevin\u2019s.  I mean that literally, I bumped into her as I left the bathroom.  Looking at her, temporarily thrown off by the sight of her, I said, \u201cSorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly Hawthorne played the younger lead actor in a show Kelsey and I used to watch; about a brother/sister crime-fighting team.  I\u2019d always wanted to meet her in person; but now that I did, I wish I hadn\u2019t.  Far from the sweet, and gentle character that she played on TV \u2013 in real life she was a bit of a jerk.  \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, I said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>said</i>, watch where you're going!\u201d looking at me, daggers in her eyes, she said, \u201cWhat are you; deaf <i>and</i> stupid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was silent as she went on her way; once she was gone I set about gathering my things off the floor.  I was about to grab my passport when I saw someone else grab for it.  \u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am; let me get that for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, I found myself face to face with Jake Tucker \u2013 the other lead character, and Kelsey\u2019s celebrity crush.  As Kevin I could never figure out why Kelsey liked him so much, but now I could see why.  It turns out that the cameras don\u2019t do him any justice.  He was quite handsome.  Blushing a little, I grabbed my passport and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d With a smile and a wave, he was off; leaving me staring as he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the pieces of paper I\u2019d been given contained directions on where to find my car; directions which I followed to another 2017 Mustang convertible on the 3rd level of the parking garage.  After feeding the address of my new home into the GPS, I put the top down and left the airport just as the sun started to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived at the address about 45 minutes later; a modest 2 story house in a quiet neighborhood about 25 minutes from downtown.  After ringing the doorbell, I was greeted by a woman my age wearing lounge pants and a t-shirt.  Judging from her appearance I figured I had woken her up.  \u201cHi, I\u2019m Amelia Webber.\u201d Offering my hand, I said, \u201cAre you Caitlin Saunders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, were you expecting Oprah?\u201d with a gruff tone, she said, \u201cCome on in, I\u2019ll show you to your room.  Your stuff got here yesterday afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Caitlin led me upstairs, I said, \u201cThis is a great house you\u2019ve got here, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll love living here.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting me, Caitlin said, \u201cYour rent for this month\u2019s been taken care of; it\u2019s due on the 1st of the month.  Bounce one check, and your shits on the front lawn.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cClean up after yourself, I\u2019m not going to be your maid.  If you see something in the fridge with my name on it, that means, if you want any, you've got to go out and buy it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I followed her down the hall, I started to worry that I\u2019d bitten off more than I chewed.  Caitlin didn\u2019t seem to be a very cheerful person.  As we arrived outside a closed door, I said, \u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve gotten off on the wrong foot.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019d like for us to be friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin grumbled as she opened the door; walking back down the hall to another room.  I jumped a bit as she slammed the door shut.  Looking inside the room, I saw almost a dozen boxes scattered around a brand new mattress.  I guess Caitlin wasn\u2019t interested in unpacking for me either.  <i>Good thing they labeled all the boxes</i>, I thought as I opened up the first box.. <i>What a difference L.A. is from New Jersey.</i></span></div></div>",

I had just finished putting away three boxes of clothes when I decided to tackle my toiletries.  One of the perks that I was grateful for was that my room came with its own ensuite bathroom; something that Caitlin\u2019s room also had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the process of putting away my feminine hygiene products, all the while dreading my first menstrual cycle, when I heard footsteps in the hall.  Walking back into my room, I poked my head out the door and saw Caitlin walking, I saw Caitlin coming from her room \u2013 dressed in a similar outfit to mine.  Seeing me looking at her, she said, \u201cI\u2019m heading into work; I left a set of keys in the kitchen if you feel like leaving the house.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the less than stellar start we had earlier, I was desperate to have a positive relationship with this woman.  After all, I gave up everything to start a new life for myself; I wasn\u2019t going to let someone with a confrontational attitude ruin that for me.  Stepping out of the bathroom, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, Caitlin, what do you do for a living?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI work in casting over at Paramount; it\u2019s nothing too glamorous but it sometimes gets me in the room with some big-name celebrities.\u201d With a hint of a smile, Caitlin said, \u201cJust last week I spent the day with Chris Pratt while we auditioned young girls to play his daughter in an upcoming movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of being in a room all day with Chris Pratt had an unexpected reaction; if my erect nipples were any indication, I was getting turned on.  \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be not to flirt with all the actors you meet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said it never crossed my mind; after all, I am a woman.\u201d Pausing, Caitlin said, \u201cBut then I find myself struggling to imagine how I\u2019d be able to pay my bills if I lost my job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to continue the conversation with Caitlin in an attempt to get to know her better; but then I realized that she was trying to leave for work.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you after work then.\u201d With a smile, I said. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to do a little more unpacking and then head into the city to get the lay of the land.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin didn\u2019t say anything in response, only smiling at me as she walked down the stairs.  Once she was out the door, I leaned against the wall and sighed.  I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she didn\u2019t like me very much.  I was about to go back into the bathroom when I heard my cell phone ringing down the hall.  Going to my room, I saw that Leslie was calling me.  Answering it, I said, \u201cHey Leslie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must\u2019ve sounded a tad depressed over the phone, because Leslie immediately said, \u201cUh oh, what\u2019s wrong?  You don\u2019t like someone who just started a new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on my bed, I spent the next 15 minutes talking about everything that\u2019s happened to me since I left the hotel; culminating in my less than positive first meeting with Caitlin.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do, Leslie; 7 hours into my new life and I\u2019ve already been hit on by someone old enough to be my father, called a dumb bitch by an actress I used to be attracted to and, on top of that, I\u2019m pretty sure my roommate doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take things slowly, Amelia; you\u2019re expecting too much from your first day on your own.\u201d Sighing, Leslie said, \u201cMy first day on my own wasn\u2019t all that good either; let\u2019s just say I quickly learned being a young lesbian in the Deep South wasn\u2019t going to cut it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you suggest I do then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, you\u2019re in Los Angeles; chances are you\u2019ll bump into a random celebrity on the street.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cGo out and explore a little; get acquainted with your new home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I could do that; after all, I\u2019ve always wanted to come out here on vacation.\u201d Sitting on the bed, I said, \u201cNot that I don\u2019t mind the call; but I doubt you called just to say hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn pregnancy brain, I completely spaced on that.\u201d Chuckling, Leslie said, \u201cYour, uh, former family placed an obituary in the local paper; we didn\u2019t see it until after you\u2019d already left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that was coming but I hadn\u2019t thought about how I\u2019d react to the news. \u201cOh wow; they didn\u2019t wait long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll email it to you, but they\u2019re saying that Kevin died suddenly in his sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, walking around a little bit, I said, \u201cI know they did all this last minute and everything, but I can\u2019t help but think they could\u2019ve come up with something a little more interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight I suggest discussing that with them once you make contact?\u201d pausing, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, honey; go enjoy the sights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up the phone, I decided to take Leslie up on her suggestion.  So I changed out of the skirt suit and into a pair of shorts and a t-shirt.  Grabbing everything I\u2019d need for a day on the town, I locked up the house and drove towards downtown.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just after Noon and I was casually strolling along the Venice Beach Boardwalk.  I\u2019d visited a few of the major tourist spots; like the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theater.  I was starting to get a little hungry so I crossed the street to a small caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving my order, a small chicken salad with an iced tea, I couldn\u2019t help but do some people watching.  I was well aware of the fact that I was now a heterosexual woman, but there were still times when I was surprised to find myself checking out some random guy as he walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy food came 10 minutes later; I had just taken a sip of my iced tea when I heard a voice next to me say, \u201cWell hello again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up I saw the guy from the airport; before I could stop myself, I dropped my tea on the ground.  Already mortified beyond belief, I became more so when I saw that some of my drink had gotten on his shoes.  Grabbing my napkin, I reached down and started wiping it off while a server came to clean up my mess.  \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Gently grabbing my hand, the man said, \u201cThese are just a cheap pair of sneakers; who cares if they get dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man took a seat across from me, I sat back down and said, \u201cI\u2019m usually not that clumsy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; stuff like this happens all the time.\u201d Chuckling, the man said, \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d rather have iced tea on my shoes than have someone\u2019s coffee on my shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA server brought me a new iced tea; as I continued eating my lunch while we talked.  After hearing about Leslie\u2019s experience on her first date, I was glad the salad gave me something to do while he spoke.  The more I looked at him, the more I realized why other girls thought he was so attractive.  \u201cI\u2019ve been watching your show since High School; I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have a little crush on you back then.\u201d  With a smile, I wiped some dressing on my face and said, \u201cIf someone told me that I\u2019d be sitting at a caf\u00e9 chatting with Malcolm Tucker, I would have thought them insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip from his soda, Malcolm smiled and said, \u201cSo you\u2019re a fan of the show?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt bad about lying to the guy; even if it was only about some minor details.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve never missed an episode.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cIt amazes me how the writers have been able to keep it so fresh after 10 seasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere have been some instances where storylines were reused; but yeah, I guess they have done a decent job.\u201d Sighing, Malcolm said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a lot of fun working on the show; but to be honest, I\u2019m getting tired.  My contract came up for renegotiation last month; I\u2019ve kind of been stalling about whether or not to renew it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of the show coming to an end didn\u2019t sit well with me, but I couldn\u2019t blame the guy for getting fatigued.  Looking at Malcolm, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what would you like to do after the show ends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just finished filming a movie last month; it comes out around Thanksgiving.\u201d Sighing, Malcolm said, \u201cIf it\u2019s successful, I\u2019d like to transition to the big screen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to what Malcolm had said about his enjoyment from working on the show, I recalled my encounter with his costar at the airport.  \u201cI have to admit; after bumping into your costar at the airport, it\u2019s hard to believe working with her could be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid Elena leave you with a bad first impression?\u201d looking at me, Malcolm said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, but she\u2019s a really sweet person once you get to know her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at that idea.  \u201cSorry, but what chance does a small-town girl from New Jersey have to get to know a TV star.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking for almost an hour; so I\u2019d say the chances are really good.\u201d Pausing, Malcolm said, \u201cIt just dawned on me that you know who I am, but I don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s remedy that, shall we?\u201d extending my hand, I said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my hand, Malcolm said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Amelia.\u201d Looking past me, he said, \u201cWhat do you know, it looks like you\u2019ll get a chance to meet Elena after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I saw Elena Johnson walking towards us; her demeanor much different from when I\u2019d encountered her at the airport.</span></div></div>",

Did you make a new - Oh, my God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as all color drained from Elena\u2019s face; which led to a smirk, and a wink, from Malcolm.  \u201cI take it then that you remember Amelia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this morning.\u201d Taking a seat next to me, Elena placed a hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019m not the biggest fan of flying; so I can get rather testy, and my PMDD doesn\u2019t help at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d never heard of that before now, it wasn\u2019t something Kelsey experienced to my knowledge.  \u201cPMDD?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it stands for premenstrual dysphoric disorder; imagine the worst period you\u2019ve ever had, and multiply that by 50 for me.\u201d Sighing, Elena said, \u201cI was a walking time bomb this morning; unfortunately you found yourself in my crosshairs.  I\u2019m sorry about that, miss... I'm sorry what did you say your name was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile silently hoping I never experienced PMDD, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how I\u2019d only been in LA for a few hours and I was already on a first-name basis with two celebrities.  \u201cAmelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Elena Johnson, but I suspect you already know that.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cThanks for not going to TMZ after our first meeting, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, that was the last thing on my mind this morning.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI just moved out here from New Jersey, so I was more focused on getting settled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis interest piqued, Malcolm said, \u201cWhat brings you out here from Jersey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork; I\u2019m hoping to get into the entertainment industry.\u201d Seeing a flash of concern across Elena\u2019s face, I turned to her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m going for something behind the scenes, I\u2019ve got an interview at a talent agency tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\nWhile Elena breathed a sigh of relief, Malcolm said, \u201cReally? What agency?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment I forgot the name of the agency; try as I might, I couldn\u2019t remember it.  \u201cYou know what, I-I\u2019ve completely blanked on the name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem, I hope you nail the interview.\u201d Smiling, Elena said, \u201cWhat were you guys talking about when I showed up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing major, just my plans for once the show\u2019s over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you, Mr. Big Shot with your big screen movie.\u201d  Groaning, Elena said, \u201cAll I\u2019ve got is a role in some Christmas movie on Hallmark Channel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey it\u2019s a start, right?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cWhat's it about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Christmas movie on the Hallmark Channel, so the same thing as every other movie they\u2019ve done.\u201d Sighing, Elena said, \u201cSome big-shot executive, with an 8-figure salary, returns home and throws it all away to be with some boy she knew in High School. I play the part of the guy\u2019s kid sister; who fixes them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey if Kevin Bacon and Holly Hunter can get their start being killed in slasher movies, you can make a Hallmark Christmas movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Elena said, \u201cYou sound just like my agent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not there yet, but that\u2019s the dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of us continued talking, I began to notice something: when I was talking, Malcolm was focused on my lips.  When he, or Elena, spoke he would look at me \u2013 not just my boobs and butt, the way so many men had, but <i>all{/i) of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe kept talking until my salad and iced tea were gone, and then we went our separate ways.</i></span></div></div>",

As I drove onto the freeway, I found myself remembering that LA was notorious for rush hour traffic; and hoped I didn\u2019t have an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully I didn\u2019t experience much in the way of traffic; getting back to the house just before 5:00 to find that Caitlin\u2019s car was in the driveway.  As I got out of the car, I remembered my desire to have a friendship with Caitlin.  After locking my car, I walked up to the front door and let myself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I did, I heard Caitlin\u2019s voice coming from down the hall; it sounded like she was talking to someone.  Going down the hall, I found Caitlin spread out in the breakfast nook having a conversation with someone over the phone.  \u201cShe seems like a nice enough girl, Mom; but after what happened with Carly, I want to exercise some caution.\u201d Looking up from the phone, Caitlin saw me standing in the doorway.  Throwing me a wave, she returned to the phone call, \u201cNo Mom, I haven\u2019t spoken with Carly or Brandon since they moved out; and frankly I don\u2019t know if want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling thirsty, I walked over to the fridge and opened it; grabbing a can of diet coke from the door.  As I opened it, I heard Caitlin say, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, Mom; I\u2019ve got to start making dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she hung up the phone, I looked at her and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop on your conversation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Getting up, Caitlin placed the phone back on the charger.  \u201cI\u2019m making chicken tetrazzini for dinner, you want some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, that sounds nice.\u201d As Caitlin walked by me, I said, \u201cAbout this morning; I want us to be friends, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel we got off on the wrong foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s not rush into things, Amelia; I\u2019ve been burned because of that before.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cYou seem like a nice girl, but I think we should get to know each other a little better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that cautious attitude have anything to do with Carly or Brandon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin looked me; a look of anger briefly flashing across her face.  \u201cCarly was my college roommate, and Brandon was my boyfriend.\u201d Sighing, Caitlin said, \u201cThe three of us lived here, together, for three years; until I found out that they\u2019d been sleeping with each other behind my back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh; I guess I can understand you're being cautious around me then.\u201d Looking at Caitlin, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of girl to sleep with someone\u2019s boyfriend, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner took about an hour to make, even with some help from me.  She was still somewhat reserved, but Caitlin had opened up a little bit.  The two of us were sitting at the table, eating and talking.  \u201cYou know a decent amount about me, Amelia; but I don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d Looking at me, taking a bite, Caitlin said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell, really; I\u2019m from New Jersey and I\u2019m the first in my family to go to college.\u201d  Sighing, I said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with the life I had back east, so I went to New Horizons and they helped me get my life back on track.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve only heard a little bit about what they do, something about making changes to a person\u2019s life or something like that.\u201d Chuckling, Caitlin said, \u201cI honestly never gave them much thought until one of their reps came by, offering me $1500 a month to let you live here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if they\u2019re giving you $1500 a month, shouldn\u2019t that more than cover my rent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you don\u2019t beat around the bush; do you.\u201d Putting her fork down, Caitlin said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; let\u2019s see how things go for the next few weeks.  If we don\u2019t kill each other, I\u2019ll put the $1500 towards your monthly rent; all you\u2019ll have to do is chip in some money for utilities and groceries.  How\u2019s that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on my face, I nodded and said. \u201cI think I can live with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you\u2019ve asked me some personal questions, I hope you don\u2019t mind if I do the same.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cWhat exactly did New Horizons do to help you get your life back on track?  Pay off your debt?  Take care of some legal troubles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hesitant to come clean about this so early, but I figured there was no harm in it.  \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t anything like that.\u201d Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cThey changed me from a 14-year-old boy to the 26-year-old woman you see before you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

By the time I was finished, Caitlin was pacing around the kitchen floor.  \u201cLet\u2019s say I believe you, which I don\u2019t by the way; why would a 14-year-old boy decide to give up 12 years of his life and become a woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t give that much thought; I just figured I\u2019d try for something completely different from my former life.\u201d With a slight grin, I said, \u201cWhat could be more different than becoming a 26-year-old woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me if this is at all inappropriate, but I just have to ask.\u201d Walking over to me, Caitlin knelt in front of me and said, \u201cAre you... how should I put this, 100% female?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as much a woman as you are; right down to my ovaries and my uterus.\u201d With a pause, I said, \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m due for my first period in a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Caitlin asked me a few more questions before I went upstairs to retrieve the photos I\u2019d gotten from Kelsey.  As she looked at them, Caitlin said, \u201cI chickened out on getting a tattoo, but here you went through such a dramatic transformation.\u201d Putting the photos down, she said, \u201cThat must\u2019ve been hard to leave your family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was, but we all knew where I could\u2019ve ended up had I not gone through with this.\u201d Gathering up the photos, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019ll never see them again; I\u2019ll wait a few months before I fly back to see them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Caitlin looked at me now, I saw no hint of the girl I\u2019d first met this morning.  Taking a seat next to me, Caitlin said, \u201cI know we just met, but it means a lot that you trusted me with your story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you took it all in stride; I was worried that you\u2019d react negatively.\u201d Breathing a sigh of relief, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have someone, out here, who I can talk to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is California, girl; and it\u2019s the 21st century.\u201d Looking at me, a smile on her face, Caitlin said, \u201cOur state motto could be changed to \u2018Cool, yo' and no one would bat an eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt still means a lot that you\u2019re so understanding about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one thing I\u2019m curious about; you\u2019ve only been a woman for a few days, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure where Caitlin was going with this so, looking perplexed, I said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019ll be 5 days tomorrow.  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much do you know about being a woman?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you knew very much going in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuring the procedure, they gave me all the basic knowledge I\u2019d need; hair and makeup, how to handle a bra and walking in heels.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to learn about flirting; and, as one my girlfriends would say, I can\u2019t hold my alcohol yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can help you with the flirting; especially considering what happened with my last boyfriend.\u201d Getting up, Caitlin retrieved a bottle of wine and some glasses.  Walking back over to me, she said, \u201cBut I think I can help you with the second; what do you say to some inexpensive wine and a chick flick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin and a chuckle, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve heard all day.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Okay, so maybe the movies were playing in the background while we drank wine and talked.  We both spoke about our childhoods and families; I wouldn\u2019t say we were friends yet, but I figured we were well on our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up the next morning to my alarm clock, I found that I didn\u2019t feel as hung-over as I had previously.  After making a mental note to stick with wine instead of hard liquor, I climbed out of bed and made my way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to step into the shower when I heard a commotion outside; going over to the window, I noticed a handful of older children getting onto a waiting school bus.  I then remembered that today would\u2019ve been Kevin\u2019s first day back at school; I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how things would go for Kelsey and my friends now that word of my \u2018death\u2019 had gotten out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then reminded myself that that was no longer my concern; Kevin\u2019s life was behind me now, I was living Amelia\u2019s life.  As I climbed into the shower, my thoughts turned to my interview this morning and I\u2019ll admit that I was a tad nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the kitchen about 30 minutes later; looking professional in my new skirt suit and heels.  Caitlin was standing over by the coffee maker; looking up at me, she smiled and said, \u201cWow, you weren\u2019t kidding about them giving you everything you\u2019d need to be a woman.\u201d With a chuckle, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been a woman my entire life; I\u2019ve never gotten my hair or makeup to look remotely as good as yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess they wanted to give me every advantage they could.\u201d Walking over to the counter, I said, \u201cDo you mind if I borrow one of our travel mugs for the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo right ahead; I\u2019ve got plenty of them.\u201d Watching as I filled one of the mugs with coffee, Caitlin said, \u201cHow are you feeling about the interview?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling hopeful, and a little nervous.\u201d Putting the lid on the mug, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been to an interview before, so I have no idea what I\u2019m walking into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I tell people when they\u2019re auditioning; just take it one step at a time.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Caitlin said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Noticing the time, I said, \u201cI should probably get going; I don\u2019t want to get stuck in traffic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I started walking out of the room, Caitlin called out, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop by the studio afterward; we can get an early lunch and I\u2019ll show you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of getting a behind the scenes tour of a major studio was appealing.  Turning around in the doorway, I said, \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll give your name to security so they\u2019ll let you in.\u201d with a smile, Caitlin said, \u201cGood luck.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The talent agency took up three floors of a 10 story office building downtown; I was sitting in a well-lit waiting room with several other people, including a man and two other women.  The longer I sat there, the more anxious I started to get \u2013 I began to wonder if the others in the room could tell I wasn\u2019t what I seemed.  I then reminded myself that that was absurd; after all, I was both physically and mentally a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy interview was the second to last one; both the man and one of the women were called in before me.  I started to get nervous again, this time because of the interview itself.  It didn\u2019t help that the man came out of the room drenched in sweat. He\u2019s not getting the job.  To help with my anxiety, I decided to strike up a conversation with the other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, I walked over and sat down next to her, \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m pretty nervous about all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, a slightly younger woman of Asian descent, turned to face me.  I was taken aback when I saw the look of contempt on her face.  \u201cI\u2019m not nervous at all; one call from my father and I can get any job I want in this town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all I needed to hear to know that this woman was incredibly spoiled; she was probably only interviewing for the job because her \u2018daddy\u2019 was making her.  I didn\u2019t want to be rude, but I also didn\u2019t want to talk with her.  Getting up, with a fake smile, <br>\r\nI said, \u201cWell good luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully I didn\u2019t have long to wait; barely a minute after I got back to my seat, the second candidate came walking down the hall along with another young woman.  After thanking the candidate for coming, the woman looked into the room.  \u201cAmelia Webber?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here goes nothing.</i> Getting to my feet, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s me, I\u2019m Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took it as a good sign that my interview lasted longer than the first two combined; although I was still incredibly nervous the entire time.  The woman I was interviewing with, Meredith Geller, was slightly older than my\u2026rather Kevin\u2019s mom had been.  The position I was interviewing for was to be her assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time I was answering questions, I feared that she would realize my degrees and job experience were faked.  To be fair, the job experience was faked but the degrees were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just finished answering one of those \u2018where do you see yourself in 5 years\u2019 questions; saying that I hoped to become a talent agent as well, maybe eventually open an agency of my own someday.  For some reason or another, Meredith liked my answer.  \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got all the information I need.\u201d Getting to her feet, Meredith reached out her hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the job, Ms. Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that I was relieved would be an understatement; all my anxiety and nervousness had been for naught.  After realizing that I\u2019d gone almost a minute without responding, I quickly grabbed Meredith\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThank you so much, ma\u2019am; you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us walked out of the room; where she introduced me to the woman I\u2019d be replacing.  By pure coincidence, the spoiled woman from before was walking out of the nearby bathroom when Meredith said, \u201cBrianna; I\u2019d like for you to meet your replacement, Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brianna got to her feet, I swear I saw the other woman giving me a death stare.  She turned and walked out in a huff, while Brianna said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine, Brianna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the two of us, Meredith said, \u201cBrianna is leaving us for an administrative job at Pixar; she\u2019s leaving some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re up to the task Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed for a few more minutes; chatting with Brianna and learning that my training would start on Monday.  I was grateful for that because it gave me four days to relax beforehand.  After once again, thanking Meredith I gathered my things and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew she was probably busy, so I decide to simply text Leslie \u2013 <i>I got the job!</i>  Getting into my car, I plugged in the address for Paramount and drove off for my lunch with Caitlin.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d become mildly annoyed by the traffic by time I drove through the gate at Paramount.  After giving my name to the guard, I was given directions to where I needed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI parked my car in one of the visitor spots outside of Caitlin\u2019s office and walked inside.  After taking the elevator up to Caitlin\u2019s floor, I walked up to the receptionist.  Trying my best to look professional, I said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Amelia Webber, I\u2019m here to see Caitlin Saunders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Ms. Saunders doesn\u2019t take walk-ins, ma\u2019am.\u201d Looking at me, the receptionist said, \u201cI can give you her number if you\u2019d like to make an appointment for an audition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little annoyed by the thought that I was someone walking in from the streets in the hopes of getting an audition.  \u201cSorry, I think there\u2019s been a mistake; I\u2019m not here for an audition.  I\u2019m Caitlin\u2019s roommate; we\u2019re having lunch together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist went pale as a ghost, as if she\u2019d made a horrible mistake, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, ma\u2019am; I\u2019ll let her know you\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a seat in the waiting area while I waited for Caitlin to come out.  The receptionist, probably trying to make up for her mistake, offered me water but I politely declined.  I was only waiting a few minutes before Caitlin walked down the hall.  Upon seeing me, a smile on her face, she came over and hugged me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, she led me down the hall to her office.  While we were walking, she turned to me and said, \u201cHow\u2019d the interview go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on my face, I said, \u201cI nailed it, I start training on Monday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl I knew you were going to nail that interview.\u201d Stepping in her office, which was a pretty decent size, Caitlin said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a seat; I just have to send out some emails and then we\u2019ll go to lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took a seat, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not that hungry yet; I was wondering if we could take that tour first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from her computer, Caitlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s totally up to you, we\u2019ll do whatever you feel like.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As we waited for the elevator to arrive, I decided to pass the time by regaling Caitlin with the story of my encounter with that woman at the interview.  \u201cI\u2019m sure you probably see people like this all the time; but while I was waiting for my turn to be interviewed, I decided to strike up a conversation with this other woman in the waiting room.\u201d sighing, I said, \u201cWhen I asked her if she was nervous, she told me that her father could get her any job she wanted with just a phone call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, I hate people like that; they\u2019re so spoiled.\u201d The elevator arrived at that moment.  As we walked inside, Caitlin said, \u201cI remember, last year, auditioning this teenager for a spot on some reality TV that didn\u2019t even make it to air.  She was terrible but I had to give her an audition because her father was some big executive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt amazes me that people think that\u2019s how the world works; that they\u2019ll get anything they want solely because of who they\u2019re related to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not exactly the same, but you\u2019re only out here because you went to New Horizons.\u201d Looking at me, as the elevator started its descent, Caitlin said, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t become a woman and moved out here, who knows who could have gotten that job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood there I realized that, in a way, Caitlin was correct.  The big reason I got this new job was that I went to New Horizons.  Then again, they just changed me and gave me the necessary education; I was the one that wowed Meredith at the interview.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m like that other woman, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gravity of what she said must\u2019ve dawned on Caitlin; as her eyes went wide and she looked at me.  \u201cNot exactly; sure you got that job with help from someone else, but you\u2019re nothing like that other woman.\u201d With a short pause, Caitlin said, \u201cAt least from what little I\u2019ve seen, and heard about your former life, you\u2019re the polar opposite of that woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Caitlin didn\u2019t believe that; that she actually thought I was in the same boat as that other woman.  But in an attempt to change the conversation, and keep the two of us from arguing in an elevator, I said, \u201cSo what\u2019s the food like here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely overpriced, but it\u2019s actually quite good.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cI can guarantee it\u2019s better than anything you\u2019d get for lunch at school.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m on the shortlist to replace my boss when he retires next year.\u201d Sighing, Caitlin said, \u201cReally the only regret I have is staying with my ex for 5 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought back to the terrible luck my mom had dating after my dad left; a lot of her dates bailed the moment they learned she had two young kids.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for Caitlin having put all that time and effort into a relationship, only for her ex to cheat on her.  \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been <i>that</i> bad; after all, you were together for 5 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis coming from a former 14-year-old boy who, on her first day as a woman, thought it would be wise to strip in front of half a dozen children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that little story would come back to bite me; I just figured it would take longer.  Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cFirst off; I was drunk.  Secondly; there were only two kids at the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked as if Caitlin was about to say something else; until she got all jumpy for a moment.  \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but a <i>very</i> cute guy just walked into the room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that perhaps it was a co-worker of Caitlin\u2019s that she liked, I turned around to look; only to discover that it was Malcolm.  The sight of him walking through the buffet line caused me to blush.  I don\u2019t know what came over me, but I stood up and hollered, \u201cMalcolm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room turned to face me; as Caitlin, looking mortified, grabbed me and pulled me back into my seat.  \u201cWhat are you doing!?  He\u2019s an actor, you can\u2019t just...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin stopped midsentence as Malcolm stopped in front of our table.

Once she got her voice back, her mouth agape, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re on a first-name basis with Malcolm Tucker; star of <i>Double Trouble</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat at our table, Malcolm said, \u201cWe met at the airport yesterday; she dropped her passport and I retrieved it for her.\u201d With a grin, he said, \u201cThen we met again at a caf\u00e9 in Venice Beach, where she slipped a glass of iced tea on my shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Caitlin, I said, \u201cAfter Elena showed up, the three of us spent almost an hour talking with each other.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I suppose I couldn\u2019t blame her, but I couldn\u2019t help but be a little annoyed by her acting like a fangirl.  She wouldn\u2019t stop asking Malcolm questions about the show, or other celebrities that he\u2019d worked with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm, to his credit, answered every question; but I couldn\u2019t help but notice he was focusing his attention on me.

Malcolm was not flirting with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was so flirting with you, Amelia; and, at least subconsciously, I think you were flirting with him as well.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cForget for a moment that you used to be a teenage boy; have you ever known a guy to spend 30 minutes talking with an attractive woman about the weather?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I thought about it, the more I realized that Caitlin may have a point.  With the looks that he'd been giving me yesterday, plus the fact 30 minutes of idle conversation over lunch, there was a distinct possibility that Malcolm was at least interested in me.  \u201cEven if we were flirting with each other, he\u2019s way out of my league.\u201d Sighing, as we crossed the road going towards a row of parked golf carts, I said, \u201cHe\u2019s an actor and I\u2019m a glorified secretary; I couldn\u2019t get a guy like that in a million years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe heart wants what the heart wants, Amelia.\u201d Taking a seat in one of the carts, Caitlin said, \u201cMark my words, very soon Malcolm will be asking <i>you</i> on a date.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It hadn\u2019t occurred to me until then that communicating by email was my only option.  Looking at the window, I saw it was from Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Oh my God, I was beginning to think you\u2019d forgotten about us.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the moment of truth; would I respond or ignore the message.  I, of course, had no intention to simply ignore the message; so I took a deep breath and typed out my response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe \u2013 <b>Sorry about that; as you might imagine, the last few days have been pretty crazy.  How are things back in Jersey?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short pause before Kelsey\u2019s response appeared on the screen.  Kelsey \u2013 <b>You probably already know about it but Mom placed an obituary in the paper yesterday.  We\u2019ve been getting a lot of phone calls and visits from people; including people you probably wouldn\u2019t have expected.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what Mom and Kelsey were going through; knowing that I wasn\u2019t dead.  Actually, in a sense, I guess I was \u2013 Kevin died on that hospital bed.  <b>That must be an awkward situation for you guys to be in; telling people I\u2019m dead when I\u2019m not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah it is, but it\u2019s a price we\u2019re willing to pay for you to be happy.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat response served to show how much my family loved me, and what they were willing to sacrifice for me.  A stray tear rolled down my cheek as I started typing.  <b>There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll ever be able to repay you and mom for this.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation remained like that for a short time; as Kelsey caught me up on everything that\u2019s happened since I left.  I couldn\u2019t help but think, however, that she was holding something back.  I had an idea of what it might be, but I couldn\u2019t prove it until she said: <b>Was that you that I saw parked across the street yesterday morning?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at that message for a moment, taking a sip of my wine while I thought about my response.  Taking a deep breath, I reached forward and started typing: <b>Yeah, that was me.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey didn\u2019t respond for a few moments; likely trying to wrap her head around the fact that I was now a woman.  <b>Why did you drive off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I was nervous; I wasn\u2019t sure how you\u2019d react to the new me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI always knew there was a possibility that you\u2019d come out of this a woman, but I have to admit, I\u2019m a bit surprised.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then proceeded to type out a lengthy description of what happened after they dropped me off.  <b>I wanted my new life to be different, and being a 26-year-old woman was very different from my old life.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I suppose I shouldn\u2019t fault you for wanting something different.</b> There was a slight pause before another response came through.  <b>I didn\u2019t get a very good look at you before you drove off; any chance you could send me a picture?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery picture I\u2019d taken since yesterday had been uploaded to my computer; so I chose the one of me with the girls from NHI and the one that Malcolm took with me and Caitlin.  That last one I sent solely to see how Kelsey would respond.  <b>Here are some photos.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Kelsey responded.  <b>Did you seriously get to meet Malcolm Tucker?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as I wrote my response.  <b>That\u2019s right; I bumped into him and Elena Johnson at the airport yesterday.  That photo was from earlier today; I was meeting my housemate for lunch and he joined us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m so jealous of you right now.</b> There was another brief pause, followed by another response.  <b>You look great in those photos by the way; I can honestly say that\u2019s the first genuine smile I\u2019ve seen you give in a long time.</b> Another pause. <b>I never thought I\u2019d say this about you, but you make an attractive woman.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the time on my computer and saw that it was almost 3:00; which meant that it was 6:00 for Kelsey.  <b>I\u2019m sure Mom\u2019s probably getting dinner ready for you guys; I\u2019ll let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll talk you to later on, Kev...wait, what\u2019s your name now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia Webber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll talk to you later, Amelia.

I thought we were making progress towards a friendship, but it turns out she was just using me to further <i>her</i> career.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then proceeded to explain everything that\u2019s happened between me and Caitlin since I arrived.  That went on for 20 minutes, during which time I would occasionally raise my voice.  Once I was finished, Mom said, \u201cWhile I don\u2019t appreciate anyone treating my daughter like that, I can see where Caitlin is coming from.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cIt sounds like she was quite close to her college roommate; so much so that her faith in people was shattered after she learned of her boyfriend\u2019s infidelity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know why that hadn\u2019t occurred to me until that moment.  Now that I saw it from that perspective, I realized that Caitlin\u2019s supposed hostility towards me was just a defense mechanism.  \u201cI guess I could give her some space; after all, we did just meet yesterday.\u201d With a chuckle, I said, \u201cI guess I got so caught up in wanting to make new friends, I forgot that some people want to take things slow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the front door open at that moment; I turned and caught a glimpse of Caitlin walking down the hall towards the kitchen.  I turned my attention back to the phone as Mom started speaking again, \u201cI\u2019m sure you two will become friends in time, just take things slowly.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cBefore I let you go, sweetie; are you going to be free tomorrow afternoon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m still new to Los Angeles so I might want to explore some more.\u201d Getting up from the couch, I said, \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour brother and sister are stopping by for your father\u2019s birthday; I figured you\u2019d want to meet them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a momentary brain cramp until I remembered they were also the \u2018parents\u2019 to a teenage boy attending a private school in New York.  I suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt to meet him and my sister.  \u201cSure, why not; I\u2019d love to meet them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent, let\u2019s plan to have a video call around 3:30 your time.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked into the kitchen, I said, \u201cTalk to you later mom, love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I ended the call, Caitlin looked at me and said, \u201cI assume that wasn\u2019t Kevin\u2019s mom you were talking with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d assume correctly, although I did have a chat with my sister earlier.\u201d Placing my things on the counter, I said, \u201cLook, about what happened at the studio...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize; I realize that I was out of line.\u201d Stepping forward, Caitlin said, \u201cI would like to be your friend, Amelia; and not just because you work for a talent agency.

As I situated myself in a more comfortable position, I thought to myself.  <i>It\u2019s safe to say the last couple days have been markedly different from my life in New Jersey, but I think I\u2019m done with the surprises for a while</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon found myself walking along a deserted beach; although there being no one around was the last thing on my mind.  I was just enjoying walking in the sand, the gentle waves washing over my feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted some movement out of the corner of my eye; I looked to see someone swimming to shore.  I felt my pulse quicken <br>\r\nwhen I saw that it was Malcolm, now on his feet and walking towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he reached me, I opened my mouth to say hello but he pulled me close and kissed me full on the mouth.  I responded in kind by running my hands over his toned body.  As the two of us continued kissing, he began to take off my swimsuit.  I, in turn, began to pull his off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were both naked, Malcolm gently guided me down onto a blanket; then he proceeded to climb on top of me.  As the two of us lay on the beach, making love, I felt the pleasure building within me.  It grew stronger and stronger, until...well, you get the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream ended and I found myself back in my bedroom; a tinge of disappointment that it was over.  I\u2019d had maybe one or two orgasms wake me up as Kevin, but they were nothing compared to what I felt right now.  I felt it all; not just in my sex but also in my breasts and in the way my lips tingled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lay there in bed, waiting for my heart to slow down, two things became crystal clear to me.  1) There was no doubt in my mind that I was now attracted to men. 2) I was one of those lucky women who could experience multiple orgasms.</span></div></div>",

When I finally went back to bed, I found my wistfully wishing that it would happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I quickly wished that I hadn\u2019t.  I lay there in bed, halfheartedly listening to the birds chirping outside, feeling achy and bloated.  What disappointed me the most, however, was how my breasts no longer felt as they had after the dream \u2013 now they felt like sandpaper rubbing against the inside of my shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing that New Horizons could have done to prepare me for this; for I\u2019d lived with Mom and Kelsey long enough to know what was going on.  I could incontrovertibly say that I was now a woman \u2013 for I was experiencing PMS.  I lay in bed for a few more minutes until the bloated feeling became too much for me to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly climbed out of bed and made my way into the bathroom.  After what seemed like an eternity, but was no more than 5 minutes, I felt markedly better than I had earlier.  Don\u2019t get me wrong; my breasts were still tender and I was achy, but I no longer felt bloated.  I got up and went to the medicine cabinet, having remembered seeing a bottle of Midol in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the recommended dosage, I looked through my things but couldn\u2019t find any tampons.  I quickly figured New Horizons, or rather whoever purchased my things, had forgotten to get them for me.  Making a mental note to buy some, I got undressed and stepped into the shower; hoping against hope that it would help me feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I rummaged through my closet to find an outfit to wear, I spotted a two-piece bathing suit hanging on the inside of the closet door.  I stopped what I was doing and focused on the bathing suit; thinking to myself about spending the day at the beach.  I quickly decided that was how I was going to spend my day; after all, southern California is famous for its beaches.  Plus, I thought to myself, <i>it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get a little color.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked downstairs a few minutes later; wearing the bikini bottom under a pair of shorts and nothing but the bikini top on my chest.  I walked into the kitchen to find Caitlin making a pot of coffee.  Seeing me, all but ignoring my outfit, she said, \u201cGood morning sleepyhead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her confused until I saw the nearby clock say that it was 9:30.  \u201cGuess I was more exhausted then I thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know if I had an annoyed expression on my face or what; but Caitlin took one look at me and said, \u201cAre you feeling alright?\u201d<br>\r\nHelping myself to a cup of coffee, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got PMS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a moment I was worried it might be something serious.\u201d Looking relieved, Caitlin said, \u201cThat\u2019s no big deal; so do a million other girls in town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took a sip of my coffee, point-blank, I said, \u201cHow many of them were teenage boys a week ago?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, sorry.\u201d Wincing, Caitlin looked at me and said, \u201cYou probably have a lot of questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, no; growing up with a twin sister, I probably know more about the menstrual cycle than most guys.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI just hope I\u2019m not one of those girls whose periods are notoriously severe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment where the two us just sipped our coffees, Caitlin said, \u201cSo what\u2019s on the agenda for you today?  When it\u2019s my time of the month, I like to scarf down chocolate and watch game shows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat does sound appealing, I might do that later.\u201d Putting the coffee mug in the sink, I said, \u201cFor now I figured I\u2019d take advantage of the nice weather and hit the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was beginning to wonder why you were strolling around in a bikini top.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cDo you mind if I tag along?  I bought a new swimsuit this week and I\u2019ve been dying to use it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cIt\u2019ll give us a chance to get to know each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cThere are some chairs and an umbrella in the garage; why don\u2019t you get us some snacks and I\u2019ll meet you out front in 10 minutes.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We\u2019re wasting valuable flirting time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Caitlin, astonished, as I turned into another row.  \u201cWhat happened to last night; when you said you weren\u2019t ready for another relationship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat trouble could a little harmless flirting do?\u201d looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cBesides it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to bring a guy home with me; I just have some pent up sexual energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted an open parking spot a short distance away; as I drove towards it, I said, \u201cYou do what you want; I\u2019m here to relax, just flirt with some cute guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark my words, Amelia; you\u2019ll be flirting with some random guy before noon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was trying to convince myself that Caitlin was wrong, as I pulled into the parking spot; but deep down I knew she was right.  Besides, as she said, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little harmless flirting.  At the very least I\u2019d get some practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were parked, Caitlin started taking our stuff out of the trunk while I put up the car's top.  I placed the umbrella bag around my shoulder, took one of the chairs, and grabbed one end of the cooler as Caitlin grabbed the other.  We then proceeded towards the crosswalk going towards the beach.</span></div></div>",

It was while swimming that I remembered what Leslie said about my body\u2019s hyper-sensitivity going away with time.  I was still experiencing new sensations but nothing like I had before; although I did thoroughly enjoy the feeling of the water coursing over my body while I swam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I said, it\u2019s been about an hour since we arrived; we had just finished applying some tanning lotion and were going to work on our tans.  Spreading out on my towel, I turned to Caitlin and said, \u201cI can see why girls like tanning so much; this is pretty relaxing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStick with me, Amelia; I\u2019ll teach you everything you need to know about being a girl.\u201d leaning on her arm, Caitlin said, \u201cThe first lesson; when you\u2019re lying on your stomach, be sure to undo your top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing my mistake, I sat up and reached back to undo the strap holding my top on.  Once that was done, I lay back down on the towel and said, \u201cWould people have gotten suspicious if I hadn\u2019t done that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with suspicion, Amelia; it\u2019s got more to do with having an even tan.\u201d Caitlin let out a brief chuckle as she looked at me, \u201cI don\u2019t see why you\u2019re so worried about this; unless you straight up told someone the truth they\u2019d have no clue you used to be a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs got comfortable again I realized that Caitlin was right; I was a woman both physically and mentally, there\u2019s no way anyone would be able to tell otherwise.  \u201cI guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt for me to lighten up a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us spent the next hour on our stomachs, listening to some country music playing somewhere further down the beach.  I\u2019d always had a thing for country music, and it was nice to see that Caitlin shared my interest in the genre.  We also spent the time talking about whatever came to mind; mostly in the spirit of getting to know each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we rolled over onto our backs, Caitlin looked over and me and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to know since you moved in; how are you enjoying being a woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying it so far; aside from the PMS and my looming period.\u201d Looking at her Caitlin, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s so different from being a guy; part of me wonders if that\u2019s just the conditioning that New Horizons put me through while I was changing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose the million-dollar question now is \u2013 are you happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the sky while thinking about that question.  The whole reason I went through with this was to lead a happy life.  I may have been a woman for a week, at this point; but I\u2019d only been living that new life for the last two days.  Turning back towards Caitlin, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s still early; but, in the grand scheme of things, I\u2019d say I\u2019m happy.  I start a great job on Monday and my roommate, who was a little standoffish at first, is turning out to be a nice person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see your opinion of me has improved; for what it\u2019s worth, my opinion of you has also improved.\u201d Looking at me, a smile on her face, Caitlin said, \u201cI\u2019m beginning to see the possibility of us becoming close friends.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After hastily redoing my top, I got up and made a beeline for the water.  Once that was finished, I went back to the towel and lay down once more; arranging my top in just the right way so I wouldn\u2019t have strap marks while also keeping my \u2018girls\u2019 covered.  Once that was done, I lay back and let my mind float away while I listened to Garth Brooks sing about pina coladas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was abruptly pulled back to reality when someone landed on my outstretched legs.  Sitting up, just enough to not risk exposing myself, I saw a little girl wiping sand off her arms.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a faint smile, the girl said, \u201cI tripped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a woman about my age, who I assumed was the girl\u2019s mother, came running up.  \u201cMaeve, apologize to the nice lady for running around without looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile replaced with a tinge of guilt, Maeve looked at me and said, \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, you\u2019re forgiven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maeve turned to walk away, she looked back and said, \u201cYou're pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat compliment made me smile; just going to show how much things changed.  I was now the type of person that little girls would idolize.  \u201cThanks, you\u2019re pretty too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maeve went back to join her mother, I recognized her as a minor celebrity; her only big role was playing on the lead on a <br>\r\nshow where a teenage boy found himself turned into a girl.  The show wasn\u2019t all that great, so I wasn\u2019t surprised that it only lasted for a season.

Looking at her, I said, \u201cI can understand why you wouldn\u2019t like Keith; but what\u2019s wrong with Rob?  He seems like a nice guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRob is a nice guy, I\u2019ve got no problem with him.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s just Keith reminds me too much of my ex; get him a little drunk and he starts flirting with every girl he sees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on what little I knew about Caitlin\u2019s ex, I could see why she didn\u2019t care much for guys like that.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d taking a breath, I said, \u201cAs I said, I think Rob\u2019s a pretty nice guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me; what happened to Malcolm?\u201d raising an eyebrow, Caitlin said, \u201cYesterday you were fawning over him at the commissary; now you\u2019ve moved onto Rob?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease; like Malcolm and I were ever going to happen.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWhat are the chances that a star like him would date someone like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious right now?\u201d looking around to make sure we were alone, Caitlin said, \u201cGirl, you were a 14-year-old boy last week; now look at you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood there, I realized that Caitlin had a point; if I could go from being a teenage boy to a grown woman, what\u2019s to stop me from dating a celebrity.  \u201cOkay fine, you\u2019re right; but in the meantime, I\u2019m going to play the field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should head back to the table; the boys are probably starting to wonder where we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing my phone from my top, I looked at the time and saw that it was almost 2:00.  \u201cWe should probably get back home; I\u2019ve got a video call with my folks at 3:30.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine with me; I think I\u2019ve had enough beach fun for one day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went back to the table to find Keith barely staying upright; he was worse at holding his liquor than me.  We told them both that we had to leave; Caitlin politely declined to give Keith her number, while I was more than happy to give mine to Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying our goodbyes, Caitlin and I returned to gather our things before heading to my car for the drive home.  Today wasn\u2019t perfect, especially for Caitlin, but all in all, I enjoyed it.  I got to meet a good looking guy and got to spend time getting to know my roommate.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caitlin and I got back to the house with almost 45 minutes to spare before my call, so I decided to pass the time by taking a shower.  After stepping out of the shower, I was about to step into the bedroom when I suddenly remembered to make sure the curtains were closed.  I\u2019d heard enough stories, and seen enough TV shows, to know I didn\u2019t want to give every kid in the neighborhood a glimpse of me naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was certain that the curtains were closed, I walked over to the closet to find an outfit to wear.  This was the first time I was meeting my \u2018siblings\u2019 and, while it wasn\u2019t a formal event, I didn\u2019t want to wear something casual.  I had just settled on a pair of pants, and a light blue top, when I heard my cell phone beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to my desk, I picked the phone up and smiled when I saw that it was from Rob.  <b>Hi Amelia, it\u2019s Rob from the beach.  You guys seemed to leave in a hurry; I hope it wasn\u2019t because of Keith.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he wasn\u2019t wrong, Keith\u2019s behavior did have something to do with it, but the main reason had been my pending video call.  <b>If I could offer some advice, don\u2019t let him drink that much.  But no, Keith wasn\u2019t the main reason we left.  I have an upcoming video call with my folks; it\u2019s my dad\u2019s birthday today.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most of our friends have tried to control Keith\u2019s drinking; but he liked to party in college, I guess he just never grew out of it.</b> There was a brief pause before he sent another message.  <b>I hope I\u2019m not off base here, but I thought you and I seemed to hit it off.  Would you be interested in seeing a movie Monday night?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment I was thankful that Caitlin wasn\u2019t around; because I\u2019m pretty sure I was blushing.  It was one thing to have a guy flirt with me; it was another thing entirely for a guy to ask me out on a date.  All this just served to remind me that I was no longer a 14-year-old boy from New Jersey.  With a smile on my face, I typed back \u2013 <b>Sure, I\u2019d love to.  I get off work at 4:30.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my laptop started ringing; I looked over and saw that someone was trying to start a Skype call.  As I sat down at the desk, I saw that Rob had responded.  <b>Great, send me your address and I\u2019ll come by around 6:00.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly sent Rob my address before putting my phone down.  After composing myself, I answered the call; the screen suddenly changed to show my folks sitting on a couch, Heather and Duncan standing behind them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The birthday call went pretty much as you would\u2019ve expected; after introductions had been made, they all moved to the dining room table, where Mom placed a small cake in front of Dad.  After that, we sang happy birthday and Dad opened his presents.  That last part made me upset, \u201cSorry Dad, I wasn\u2019t able to get you anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about that, Amelia.\u201d Smiling at me, holding up a brand new fishing reel, Dad said, \u201c<i>You</i> are my birthday present.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the extremely corny reply, while I noticed Heather had a momentary frown.  She\u2019d been looking at me funny since the call began; I wanted to ask what her problem was but didn\u2019t want to ruin Dad\u2019s party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally got my chance, 10 minutes later, when Mom and Dad left the room so us \u2018siblings\u2019 could talk.  As they both sat down in front of the camera, Heather said, \u201cSo you\u2019re our new sister, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t exactly seem thrilled about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen <i>my</i> parents told me they were joining the Host Program, I thought they were going to be matched with someone like Duncan.\u201d Looking at me, Heather said, \u201cBut instead they were matched with you; a girl in her mid-20s with stars in her eyes.  I bet you couldn\u2019t wait to move out to California.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was more than a little taken aback by Heather\u2019s remark; to be honest, it reminded me a lot of how Caitlin treated me at first.  Before I could call her out on that, I heard Mom\u2019s voice in the background, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Heather; we talked about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Mom, probably standing just off-screen, Heather said, \u201cCome on, Mom; how can you guys not see it?  You guys are using Amelia to fill the hole left by Deanna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said that\u2019s enough, young lady.\u201d Walking on-screen, glaring at Heather, Mom said, \u201cAmelia and your sister are two very different people.  What would Deanna say if she saw you acting this way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather took one look at me before getting to her feet and walking off; leaving everyone else speechless.  After a moment, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should go; it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t want to talk with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly sweetheart, she\u2019ll come around.\u201d Gesturing to Duncan, Mom said, \u201cBesides, your brother has been dying to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mom left Duncan and me alone as she walked off.  I got my first good look at him; somewhat muscular with red hair.  After a moment, I said, \u201cHave you been dying to meet me, or was that just Mom\u2019s way of making sure I didn\u2019t hang up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I have been dying to meet you.\u201d Leaning closer, Duncan said, \u201cIt\u2019s not often I get to meet another New Horizons alumni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine Mom and Dad told you some stuff about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey told me a little; just that you were unhappy in your former life and that your family brought you to New Horizons.\u201d Pausing, Duncan said, \u201cThey probably weren\u2019t comfortable telling me a lot of the personal stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the gist of it right there; my former father left when I was 9 years old, I doubt I\u2019d even recognize him if I saw him on the streets.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI was never diagnosed with it but, after I hit puberty, I\u2019m pretty sure I was clinically depressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan looked at me for a moment, clearly trying to figure out how to respond to what I just said.  I could tell that it wasn\u2019t the answer he\u2019d been looking for, judging from the bemused look on his face.  \u201cWow, you had it pretty easy compared to me.\u201d With a heavy sigh, Duncan said, \u201cMe; I was an 18-year-old gay man living in Texas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan went on to explain what led him to visit New Horizons; there were times where I noticed him barely holding it together.  It seemed that he was the middle of three boys in a staunchly conservative family outside of Houston.  He\u2019d been in a relationship with a boy in his class for almost two years but hadn\u2019t come out to his family yet.  His boyfriend eventually convinced him to come out to them; believing they would be supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt turns out they were less than supportive; my dad and older brother took turns beating me and calling me every derogatory name in the book.\u201d Wiping away tears, Duncan said, \u201cMy mom, who didn\u2019t entirely agree with my lifestyle, distracted my dad and brother enough for me to get out of the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently wondered how he must\u2019ve felt around Leslie at first, but decided not to touch on that.  \u201cWhat happened next?  Did you go to the cops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, like they were going to help; my hometown was <i>very</i> conservative.\u201d Sighing, Duncan said, \u201cNo, I ended up going to my boyfriend\u2019s house and having a big argument with him.  I realize now he was only trying to help me, but at the time I blamed <br>\r\nhim for what happened to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan continued by saying he broke up with his boyfriend that night and, with what little money he had, he decided to start a new life somewhere else.  Things only got worse after that; no matter where he went, his dad would find him and send hateful letters in the mail.  Eventually, it got to be too much, so he OD\u2019d on sleeping pills.  \u201cAs you can see, my suicide attempt wasn\u2019t successful.\u201d Taking a breath, Duncan said, \u201cI was living in Maryland at the time; the doctor at the ER, after learning my story, told me about New Horizons.  The rest, as they say, is history.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to see that you\u2019ve found yourself a loving family, Duncan.\u201d With an uncertain look on my face, I said, \u201cAre you still...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not gay anymore; that caused me nothing but trouble.\u201d With a chuckle, Duncan said, \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing this girl from school for the last 2 months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that we were done with that emotional conversation, Duncan and I spent the next 20 minutes just shooting the breeze.  I didn\u2019t tell him about my upcoming date with Rob, but I did mention meeting Malcolm and Elena.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure about Elena at first, but they\u2019re probably the most down to earth celebrities you could hope to meet out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how lucky you are, Amelia.\u201d With a smile, Duncan said, \u201cThe old me used to have the biggest crush on Malcolm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to say something in response when I heard Heather\u2019s voice in the background.  \u201cCan I have a minute with Amelia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sis.\u201d Getting up, Duncan looked back at me and said, \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Amelia; can\u2019t wait to see you in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nice talking to you as well, Duncan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan walked off-screen as Heather took a seat in front of the laptop.  Going off what happened earlier, I was worried that she was going to start yelling at me.  I was relieved, however, when I didn\u2019t see the same angry look as before.  Taking a deep breath to compose herself, Heather said, \u201cI want to apologize for how I acted earlier; it\u2019s just that this is Dad\u2019s first birthday since Deanna died.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cThe two of us were born just over 10 months apart; so we were quite close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a pretty good idea what you mean; I have, or rather I had, a twin sister.\u201d Thinking about Kelsey brought a smile to my face.  \u201cMy mom had to give consent since I was underage, but I suspect that Kelsey was the driving force behind me going to New Horizons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom told me you left behind a sister, but she didn\u2019t say anything about you guys being twins.\u201d Looking at me, a hint of empathy on her face, Heather said, \u201cThat must\u2019ve been difficult for you to leave her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe grew apart a little when we started High School; she was the popular one while I was the depressed loner with few friends.  But we were always there for each other, especially after our dad left us.\u201d Tearing up a little bit, I said, \u201cIt hurts that there\u2019s nothing I can ever do to show just how grateful I am for this new life she gave me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s how the conversation steered towards Heather and me discussing our respective siblings.  Heather explained how Deanna was a writer with dreams of making it big in Hollywood.  She even showed me an old photo of her and Deanna so I could see what she looked like.  \u201cYou remind me a lot of her, Amelia; I guess that\u2019s part of the reason why I got so defensive earlier.\u201d Pausing, Heather said, \u201cBut mom\u2019s right; the differences outweigh the similarities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving spent a good portion of the last hour learning about Deanna, I felt that I knew her quite well.  \u201cI wish I could have had the chance to meet her in person, she sounds like a wonderful person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe would\u2019ve loved to have met you too; I\u2019m sure you two would\u2019ve been inseparable.\u201d  Heather briefly looked off-screen before turning back to the camera, a disappointed look on her face.  \u201cI wish we could continue this conversation, but Mom\u2019s calling us for dinner.  It was lovely talking to you, Amelia; I think I\u2019ll enjoy having you as a sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that remark; saying, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, sis.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After ending the call with my folks, I sat at my desk for a few moments.  It was only then that I remembered the text from Rob.  Scrambling for my phone, I looked down and saw that I had agreed to go on a date with Rob.  <i>Oh wow</i>, looking at my phone, I thought to myself, <i>I have to slow down with all these big milestones</i>.  I was only half-joking about that; I was relishing the new experiences I was having, but if I kept going at this rate I\u2019d probably be pregnant by the end of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat at the desk, staring out the window for a moment, as I processed everything \u2013 I, a former 14-year-old boy, had just agreed to go on a date with a handsome guy I met at the beach.  If Kelsey and Mom were here, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be surprised.  As I sat there, I found that I wasn\u2019t shocked by the development; instead of I was giddy with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting my phone back on its charger, I got up and walked out of the room.  Going downstairs, I caught a glimpse of Caitlin reading a book in the sunroom.  With a big smile on my face, unbeknownst to me, I walked in and took a seat across from Caitlin.  Putting her book down, she looked at me and said, \u201cSomeone\u2019s in a good mood; I guess the phone call went well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe phone call went great; I got a chance to meet my siblings, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m in a good mood.\u201d No longer able to contain myself, I said, \u201cRob texted me earlier and asked me on a date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin took one look at me and said, \u201cLet me guess, you agreed to it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d The concerned look on Caitlin\u2019s face was enough to put a damper on my mood.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhy? Was that a bad idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine; Rob seems like a great guy.\u201d Putting her book down, Caitlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s just, and forgive me for saying this, you have no experience dating men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I had an opportunity to do that in my old life; being a teenage boy after all.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m inexperienced, but what better way to learn than to jump right in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that philosophy doesn\u2019t work when it comes to dating.\u201d Taking a breath, Caitlin said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you get ready for the date; if only because I don\u2019t want you to find yourself in over your head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I knew Caitlin and I weren\u2019t at the \u2018friends\u2019 stage yet, I was touched that she was still willing to help me.  \u201cI\u2019d appreciate any advice you can give me.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThis is my first date ever, so I\u2019d like for it to go well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin got up and walked out of the room before returning with a piece of paper in her hands.  Handing it to me, she said, \u201cHere\u2019s my number; if you think the date\u2019s going sideways, give me a call and tell me to feed the dog.  I\u2019ll come to get you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI appreciated the gesture, but I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t think Caitlin was going overboard.  Taking the paper, making a note to put the number in my phone, I said, \u201cDo you think it\u2019ll be <i>that</i>  bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmelia, a guy\u2019s worst case dating scenario is that she turns out to be fat or ugly.\u201d Turning serious, Caitlin said, \u201cThe worst-case for women is that I\u2019ll be called to the morgue to identify your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to get nervous once I heard that; as all sorts of scenarios started to play out in my mind.  Looking at Caitlin, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t think Rob\u2019s the type to do that, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe seemed like a genuinely nice guy; despite his poor taste in friends.\u201d Groaning, Caitlin said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a great time on the date, but it never hurts to be prepared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was thinking about Leslie had said about her first date; and I had no intention of that happening to me.  \u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t mention New Horizons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnder no circumstances should you mention New Horizons.  He seems like a nice guy, but I don\u2019t think Rob would take too kindly to learning the truth about his date.\u201d Taking a breath, looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cAssuming it goes that far, I\u2019d wait until at least the 3rd or 4th date before you tell him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter agreeing to not mention New Horizons, the topic turned to what my outfit would be.

That\u2019s all in just the last 3 days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about what Caitlin said as we continued down the escalator, and she was right, I\u2019ve come a long way in such a short time.  \u201cPlus I can\u2019t ignore the fact that you and I have become friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I\u2019d mentioned being friends in the past, Caitlin would try to deflect.

Stopping in front of a display of jeans, Caitlin said, \u201cSo you\u2019re going to need three kinds of outfits; depending on what type of date it is.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cFor movie dates, you\u2019ll need short skirts, nothing longer than your knees, and tops that either match or coordinate.  If he brings you to a fancy restaurant, you\u2019ll need something more elegant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was beginning to feel overwhelmed, I never knew there was this much involved with picking a date-night outfit.  \u201cWhat about something in between; say a movie and a casual dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the old reliable comes in: the little black dress.\u201d Smiling, Caitlin said, \u201cThat ones good for almost any occasion, so you\u2019ll need one in your closet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already have one, actually; I wore it to a bar in New Jersey.\u201d Half-heartedly examining a pair of pants, I said \u201cBut tell me; if they\u2019re good for everything, why not just have a closet full of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf a little is good then more must be better, huh?\u201d shaking her head, Caitlin said, \u201cListen if you wore nothing but of LBDs; you\u2019ll either look like you just returned from the walk of shame, or you write a bunch of books about how men should make all the decisions, while women should be barefoot and pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized how both of those situations would\u2019ve been less than ideal; after all, I didn\u2019t do all this to become a homemaker.  Looking at her, feeling suitably chastened, I said, \u201cI am your clay. Mold me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin helped me to pick out some outfits before sending me to the dressing room to try them on.  New Horizons may not have given me any dating outfits (after all Leslie had to get me the LBD), but they did give me a good eye for style, so I knew which colors went well together and what would look best on me. Once I was dressed, I showed each outfit to Caitlin, turning this way and that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time we got to the dresses, Caitlin was saying, \"Give us a turn, honey. Let's see it from every angle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I spun around, I looked at her and said, \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, you\u2019re enjoying this just as much as me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled.  It was true, I was enjoying showing off my clothes; for the first time, I understood why Kelsey would do this with Mom.  After paying for the clothes we picked out, the two of us started towards the shoe department.  We barely walked into the department when someone said, \"Caitlin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us turned around, I noticed Caitlin\u2019s expression turn sour as she said, \u201cFancy meeting you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...needed some new outfits.\u201d Sighing, the woman said, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d<br>\r\nI had no idea who this woman was, but Caitlin wasn\u2019t happy to see her.  \u201cWell, the feeling isn't mutual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my presence known, to figure out who this woman was and to prevent a potential incident, I said, \u201cExcuse me, but I feel like I just walked in on a movie that's half over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Amelia, where are my manners.\u201d Sighing, Caitlin said, \u201cStacy, this is Amelia Webber; my new roommate.  Amelia, this is Stacy Buckley, my ex-best friend who was banging my boyfriend behind my back.</span></div></div>",

I went about putting everything away from shopping, stopping only to respond to a text from Leslie.  <b>Sorry I never got back to you yesterday; the network went down at work.  That\u2019s great about the job though, I knew you\u2019d get it.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin and I had been home for an hour before I got up the courage to check up on her.

Walking closer to the bed, ever so cautiously, I saw that Caitlin was looking at a well-worn photo album; filled with pictures of what I assumed was her growing up.

It wasn\u2019t long before she was crying into my shoulder as I sat there hugging her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I awoke at dawn the next morning to go for a jog around the neighborhood.  I figured the mild weather was the perfect opportunity for me to explore.  After changing into a decent jogging outfit, I filled my water bottle and left a note on Caitlin\u2019s door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, I took a few moments to warm up in the front yard; taking note both of how limber my body was now, as well as looks I was getting from the few people also awake at the time.  A few of the guys looking at me were rather attractive, but I stopped short of acknowledging them \u2013 after all, I already had a date coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my earbuds in, and Spotify playing in the background, I started running down the sidewalk.  Now Kevin had by no means been out of shape; but now, after 5 minutes of persistent jogging, I realized that I wasn\u2019t even out of breath yet.  After another 10 minutes, I came across a small park about a mile from the house.  Peaking over the fence, I decided to check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was jogging along a small pond, completely oblivious to my surroundings, when something tappe my shoulder.  After letting out a startled yelp I turned around and saw Elena, wearing a similar outfit to mine, standing a few feet away with an amused look on her face.  Once I got over my shock, I pulled out an earbud and walked over to her.  As I did, she said, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip from my water bottle, I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you lived around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, a big TV star can\u2019t live in the suburbs?\u201d Chuckling, Elena pointed behind me and said, \u201cI live about \u00bd a mile down the way; you should come by sometime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena and I went to sit down on a nearby park bench, which gave us both a chance to catch our breath.  While that was going on, <br>\r\nI found myself once again wondering why Malcolm and Elena were so interested in spending time with me.  It was pretty straightforward with Malcolm; since he found me attractive.  But I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it with Elena.  \u201cForgive me, but why would you want to hang out with me?  It\u2019s not like I\u2019m some big shot celebrity or anything like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly the reason why I want to hang out with you.\u201d Turning to face me, Elena said, \u201cYou\u2019re not some celebrity with an ego the size of Mount Rushmore; you\u2019re just a regular, everyday woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered if Elena\u2019s opinion of me would change if she knew the truth; but, for now, I didn\u2019t bother thinking about that.  \u201cYou just want a friend who\u2019s down to earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came next was Elena explaining how, although she loved her job, she was started to get burnt out.  \u201cI\u2019ve been on TV, in one way or another, since I was 5 years old.\u201d Looking at me, taking a deep breath, she said, \u201cI never experienced a normal childhood, which is something I\u2019ve always regretted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I heard that, I briefly considered telling her about New Horizons; until I realized that would require an explanation as to how I knew about them.  In the end, however, I placed a hand on her shoulder and said, \u201cIf you ever feel like living vicariously through me, then I\u2019m more than willing to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Amelia.\u201d With a smile on her face, Elena said, \u201cThat really means a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at my watch, I saw that almost an hour had passed since I left the house.  \u201cI hate to do this, but I have to get going.\u201d Getting to my feet, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; why don\u2019t you come over to my place tonight, you can meet my roommate and we can all hang out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like an awesome idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two us parted ways after exchanging phone numbers, and I started my jog back to the house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost as soon as I got back, Caitlin approached me and said, \u201cSo I bit the bullet and invited Stacy over to talk.  She\u2019ll be here in 20 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d closing the front door, I said, \u201cI can leave if you feel like talking in private.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment it looked as though Caitlin was going to take me up on my offer; which I was more than willing to go through with.  Instead, looking at me, she said, \u201cNo, you can stay.\u201d With a sigh, she said, \u201cHaving an impartial third party might be smart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking past Caitlin towards the stairs, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be impartial, but I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was back in my room about 25 minutes later, having just finished taking a shower.  As I went to get dressed, I heard a car door close outside followed shortly after by the ringing doorbell.  Looking at the clock, I figured it was Stacy; until I heard Caitlin\u2019s voice say, \u201cTodd, what the hell are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear in Caitlin\u2019s voice was all I needed to hear as I ran for the door; pulling it open as a man\u2019s voice said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Stacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t care that I was wearing nothing but a towel as I ran down the stairs.  My only concern right now was Caitlin.  As I rounded the corner into the family room, I saw her holding a lamp in her hands \u2013 probably to use in self-defense.  \u201cShe\u2019s not here, asshole; I kicked you both out, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the slurring in Todd\u2019s voice, I quickly figured that he\u2019d either started drinking earlier or hadn\u2019t stopped from the previous night.  \u201cPlease, you expect me to believe that?\u201d slowly stepping closer, Todd said, \u201cShe\u2019s your best friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was, until I found out you two were sleeping together.\u201d Raising the lamp, Caitlin said, \u201cNow, once again, get the hell out of my house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided then and there to get involved, in an attempt to keep things from getting worse.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Caitlin and Todd turned to look at me; Caitlin was surprised to see me in nothing but a towel, while Todd focused on my breasts.  While I quickly readjusted the towel, Todd said, \u201cStay outta this, little lady; it doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, buddy; Caitlin\u2019s my friend.\u201d Stepping closer, I said, \u201cNow do as she said and get the hell out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin looked at me with fear in her eyes, saying, \u201cAmelia, don\u2019t...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even finish her sentence, Todd shoved Caitlin against the wall.  That was the straw, as I advanced towards him.  He tried to take a swing at me, but he was in no condition to do so.  I soon had him on the floor, arm bent behind his back.  \u201cThat wasn\u2019t smart, asshole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin had recovered enough at that point to call the police.  Once she was certain they were on their way, she said, \u201cYou can think this over in the drunk tank, Todd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops came to take Todd away about 10 minutes later; after quickly getting dressed, I gave the police my statement and joined Caitlin on the porch swing.  Placing an arm around her, I said, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy backs sore, but I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Leaning against me, Caitlin said, \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn moves like that?  From New Horizons?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly; although maybe I\u2019ll suggest you put that in the program.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cActually the woman who helped me design my body; her wife is an Army veteran who does private security on the side. She taught me some moves in case men get a little feisty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the next time you talk to her, can you thank her for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still pretty wound up; so, when I noticed a car pull into the driveway, I grew concerned.  I calmed down, ever so slightly, when I saw Stacy get out of the car.  Walking up the sidewalk, she took one look at Caitlin and said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Rather than continue the conversation in public, the three of us went inside.  Taking their friendship into account, I stayed back to let Stacy be the one to comfort Caitlin.  While the two of them went into the family room, I made my way into the kitchen to give them some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was perfectly content with staying there, scrolling through Pinterest, when I heard Caitlin said, \u201cAmelia, could you come in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPocketing my phone, I got up and walked into the other room.  Before I could say anything, Stacy got to her feet and hugged me.  \u201cCaitlin told me what happened with Todd; I\u2019m shocked that he\u2019d do something like that.  But,\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you were here to stop him from hurting Caitlin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly didn\u2019t know what to do in that moment; I spent most of yesterday afternoon despising Stacy for what she\u2019d done to Caitlin.  But now, seeing how upset she was, I realized that she was as much a victim as Caitlin had been.  As the two of us sat down, I looked at her and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of woman I am; I protect the people I care about.\u201d With a smile, I turned my attention to Caitlin and said, \u201cEven though we only just met, I want you to know that I care about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to sit next to me, Caitlin said, \u201cYou may have come on really strong when I first met you; but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us embraced on the couch for a few minutes, with no one saying a word so not to ruin the moment.  Wiping some tears from her eyes, Caitlin turned towards Stacy and me, \u201cAmelia, I hope you don\u2019t mind; but I was hoping to ask Stacy if she\u2019d like to move back in.\u201d taking Stacy\u2019s hand in hers, Caitlin said, \u201cI don\u2019t care anymore that she slept with Todd; she\u2019s my best friend and I want to support her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment I feared that meant I\u2019d have to move out, until I remembered there was an empty room across from mine; that Caitlin said had been used as Todd\u2019s man cave.  Once I realized that, I smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine with that; and I promise to help her as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, Amelia; after all, we just met.\u201d Looking at me, Stacy said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be an imposition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be; Caitlin said that room\u2019s been empty for months.  Besides,\u201d smiling, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not you\u2019ll be asking me to clean up after your all-night porn marathons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy chuckled, while Caitlin looked mortified.  \u201cCaitlin told you about Todd\u2019s porn habit, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a few more minutes of talking, Stacy went into the bathroom to wash up.  As I looked at Caitlin, cleaning up a dozen or so discarded tissues, I had an idea.  Getting up to follow her into the kitchen, I said, \u201cHey Caitlin, is it alright if I invite someone over?\u201d pausing, in a hushed tone so Stacy wouldn\u2019t hear, I said, \u201cI\u2019m still pretty knew to this whole woman thing, so I\u2019m a bit out of my league here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter throwing the tissues in the garbage, Caitlin looked at me and said, \u201cSure, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the excited response that I\u2019d hoped for, but it was good enough for me.  \u201cGreat, just promise me that you guys won\u2019t go crazy when she gets here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I went to retrieve my phone, Caitlin followed me and said, \u201cOh now I can\u2019t wait to see who it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to find Elena\u2019s number in my phone; and considerably less for her to answer.  \u201cHey Amelia, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey; change of plans, do you think you can come over now?\u201d stepping outside the front door, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got some friends here who could use some girl time, and I\u2019m a little out of my league.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, text me the address and I\u2019ll come right over.\u201d Turning serious, Elena said, \u201cDoes this situation require wine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, big time.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s one of <i>those</i> situations.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking at me, she said, \u201cSo who\u2019s this friend you invited over, Amelia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little apprehensive about telling her; Stacy was going to find out soon anyway.  \u201cIt\u2019s Elena Johnson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy\u2019s jaw dropped when I said that, \u201cAre you serious right now?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cYou know Elena Johnson, star of <i>Double Trouble</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could answer for myself, Caitlin stepped in and said, \u201cNot only that; but she knows Malcolm Tucker as well.\u201d Gesturing to me, Caitlin said, \u201cWe ran into him at the commissary and they were totally flirting with each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow; I would\u2019ve slept with Todd earlier had I known it\u2019d lead to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught the glare Caitlin was giving Stacy, as she said, \u201cToo soon, Stacy; way too soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Wincing as she realized her mistake, Stacy said, \u201cGuess I went overboard a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang at that moment; leading me to say, \u201cJust promise you guys won\u2019t go crazy when you meet her, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they both nodded in agreement, I went to the door.

I sat up as my eyesight adjusted, stopping briefly in response to the waves of pleasurable sensations I suddenly felt as I moved around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, I saw two breasts poking through from underneath a hospital gown.  Peeking under the gown, I saw two decent sized breasts attached to my chest.  I was momentarily confused; not because I had them, but because of their size.  <i>I thought they\u2019d be bigger.</i>  I was far from an expert on breasts; but after seeing them on the screen, I imagined D cup breasts would\u2019ve been bigger.  Instead, they looked only slightly larger than what Kelsey had about 8 months earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so something must\u2019ve gone wrong.\u201d Looking around the room, not really paying much attention to my voice, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s probably why they\u2019ve got me in this hospital room instead of the hotel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million questions started pouring through my head as I tried to figure out what had happened.  Having seen my breasts and my new equipment I knew that I was a girl now; so, what else could it have been.  Suddenly a few stray strands of hair appeared in my vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few on them in my hand, I was surprised to that instead of the dark blonde hair I\u2019d chosen; I ended up as a brunette.  <i>This isn\u2019t exactly what I picked out</i>, I thought as I looked my reflection some more,<i> But it does look good on me</i>. Faced with several notable mistakes, I started to wonder what else had gone wrong.  Climbing out of bed, I made my way into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was alone, I looked at the mirror and was shocked by what I saw looking back at me.  I looked nothing like the woman that Leslie and I had designed; in fact, I looked exactly like the woman in the dream.  She, rather I, was tall for a woman; with brunette hair, nice albeit smaller breasts, and an overall decent figure.  As I looked over my body from multiple angles, I thought to myself, <i>Paris, London, Milan; look out because here I come.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood there, I began to realize something else was different.  This wasn\u2019t the body that I had chosen; yet not only was I not upset by that fact; I was also starting to enjoy it.  To hammer that last fact home, I found myself doing some sexy poses in the mirror \u2013 pouty lips, smiling as I mussed up my hair and things of that nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d looking at my reflection, I said, \u201cI could definitely make this work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sound of someone knocking on the door brought me back to reality; followed by Leslie\u2019s voice saying, \u201cAmelia, are you in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpset by the sudden interruption, I quickly put the hospital gown back on and walked to the door.  Taking a breath, I opened the door and saw Leslie standing just outside with Miranda and Liz standing behind her.  Looking at her, hands on my waist in a suggestive manner, I said, \u201cHey Leslie; so, like, I guess something went wrong?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Taking a seat on the bed, looking at them, I said, \u201cSomeone please say something; you\u2019re all totally freaking me out right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat there, I became increasingly aware that I was starting to talk like some scatterbrained individual.  <i>What\u2019s going on here?</i>  Eventually, after about a minute or two, Liz finally stepped forward and said, \u201cHow do you feel, Amelia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good, all things considered.\u201d Taking notice of the fact that I was speaking normally again, I said, \u201cYou guys mind explaining how I ended up looking like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what we\u2019ve been able to find out; a computer error caused the template you designed with Leslie to be replaced with one she designed for the client right before you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it was a simple computer error; you guys can fix that, right?\u201d sighing, I said, \u201cThis is an attractive body, but I\u2019d much rather have the one I designed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking over for Liz, with sadness in her eyes, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible, Amelia; as I told you earlier, the procedure is a one-time thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy shock was quickly replaced by anger, as I realized that I was going to be stuck like this.  Suddenly my scatterbrain personality took over again, \u201cSo you\u2019re, like, saying I\u2019m stuck like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Leslie could respond, Miranda stepped up to me.  \u201cAre you feeling alright, Amelia?\u201d looking at me closely, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s the second time in 5 minutes that your speech patterns have changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; one minute I\u2019m like all scatterbrained and the next I\u2019m talking normally.\u201d Realizing that it had changed mid-speech, I said, \u201cSee; suddenly I\u2019m fine again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie and Miranda turned to Liz for an explanation.  \u201cThe best explanation I can come up with is that what\u2019s left of Kevin\u2019s personality is conflicting with this body\u2019s personality.\u201d Looking at me, Liz said, \u201cMy best quest would be that because of the computer error, the imprinting of the personality wasn\u2019t completed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie, Miranda, and I were all totally confused by what Liz just said.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cCould you explain that again in English?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo personalities are fighting for dominance inside your mind, Amelia; eventually the one came with this body will completely take over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything else, a woman in a nurses\u2019 outfit barged into the room.  I could hear screaming in the distance as she walked over to where the others were standing.  \u201cThe other patient just woke up; as you can probably tell, she\u2019s not too happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiz and I will be right there.\u201d Heading towards the door, Miranda turned to Leslie and said, \u201cGet Amelia dressed and bring her to the conference room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Liz and Miranda left, Leslie handed me the bag she\u2019d been holding this whole time.  A quick look inside showed a pair of leggings and what looked like a crop top.  Seeing how revealing the clothes were, I looked at Leslie in disbelief.  \u201cDo you seriously expect me to wear this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were picked out by the person who was supposed to get that body.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI figured you might like them as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the close in hand, I walked back towards the bathroom; stopping briefly to look at Leslie.  \u201cThe other patient \u2013 she was supposed to get this body, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d With a curt nod, Leslie said, \u201cInstead she got the body you were supposed to get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood in front of the mirror a few minutes later, looking at my reflection in the mirror.  The leggings, together with the pushup bra and the crop top, looked good on me.  \u201cI suppose I could get used to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore turning to leave, I pulled the top down just enough to show a little bit of cleavage \u2013 <i>No sense in letting these girls go to waste.</i></span></div></div>",

Without thinking, I did a quick spin and said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew from the look on her face that Leslie was enjoying my outfit; after all, she was into girls and I was rather attractive now.  \u201cY-You look great.\u201d Her face a deep red, Leslie said, \u201cDo yo-you have to wear that top so low?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sense in letting these girls go to waste.\u201d Leaning forward just enough to show Leslie a little more cleavage, I said, \u201cDo you like what you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn some level I felt bad about teasing Leslie; after all, she was a married woman.  But on another level, I found myself enjoying the idea that she found me attractive.  I noticed Leslie started to lean closer before she pulled herself back; shaking her head, she said, \u201cWe should get going before I do something I\u2019ll regret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie and I were silent as we walked through the building to the conference room.  As we were walking, I found myself occasionally staring at Leslie\u2019s butt as we walked.  Now I\u2019d found her attractive as Kevin, but for some reason, I felt as if my attraction to her had increased since I woke up.  \u201cSo, what can you tell me about the person who was supposed to get this body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much I\u2019m afraid, not without her permission at least.\u201d Looking at me, as we started walking up a flight of stairs, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be plenty of time, once the meeting is finished, for you two to talk things over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off the stairs and continuing down the hall, I said, \u201cAfter that screaming that we heard earlier, I hope she\u2019s calmed down some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got my answer a moment later as Leslie and I entered the conference room.  I saw a professionally dressed woman with an angry look on her face sitting at the table with Miranda, Liz, and two older men that I didn\u2019t recognize.  Having only seen an image on a computer screen it took me a moment to realize I was looking at what should\u2019ve been my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman took one look at me and jumped to her feet; making her way towards me, her voice seething with anger, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be my body, you little bitch!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the woman got right in my face, I could understand why she was angry about the situation; after all, we had both ended up with the wrong bodies.  What I could not seem to figure out was why I was not as upset about it as her.  Instead of being upset about the situation, it was almost like I did not even care.  The only thing on my mind was the possibility that the woman standing in front of me was my competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up and down the woman\u2019s body; well-aware that a computer error had kept it from being mine.  The more I sized her up, however, the more relaxed I felt.  Sure her boobs were bigger than mine, but her limbs were shorter.  She wasn\u2019t tiny but she\u2019d never make it as a model.  Realizing that she was no threat to me, with a scoff, I said, \u201cHoney, you <i>wish</i> this was your body; it\u2019s like 100x better than that worn out one you\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman just stuttered as she took her seat, while Leslie sat next to me with concern in her eyes.  Once everyone was seated, the older of the two men looked at me and the other woman.  \u201cLadies, I\u2019d first like to apologize for this unfortunate mix up.\u201d Sighing, the man said, \u201cA mistake like this hasn\u2019t occurred since the company was founded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the way the man was talking made his apology ring hollow.  He was probably more concerned about the company then what happened to us.  Placing my arms on my chest, subconsciously pushing up against my breasts, I said, \u201cSo, like, are you going to reverse this?\u201d with a sigh, I said, \u201cI\u2019m well aware this body is incredibly attractive; but, like, the need to constantly talk like I\u2019m some dumb bimbo is totally annoying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie\u2019s eyes were focused on my chest for a moment; before she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Amelia; but, like I told you earlier, tits irrever...I mean, it\u2019s irreversible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room stared at Leslie for a moment; the second man said, \u201cMrs. Cummings, please control yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing in embarrassment, Leslie bowed her head and said, \u201cSorry sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in my intended body turned to the men and said, \u201cMy promiscuous friend here has a point sir; what can be done if this can\u2019t be reversed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s not much we can do, Ms. Grimes; your new personalities are already starting to take hold.\u201d  Looking down at some paperwork, the older man said, \u201cThere\u2019s only one viable option left; and that\u2019s for you both to assume the lives associated with your bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile \u2018Ms. Grimes\u2019 didn\u2019t seem all that upset that, I was understandably angry.  \u201cSo, like that\u2019s it?  She gets to have a successful career in Los Angeles, while I\u2019m stuck as some slut?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man turned to Leslie and said, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing her head in shame, Leslie said, \u201cNo sir, I didn\u2019t have time to tell her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was already on my feet at that point, wanting to put as much distance between me and this place as I could.  I only stopped when the man said, \u201cMs. Webber, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s been a misunderstanding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I said, \u201cOh really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be some slut, as you so eloquently put it.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cMs. Grimes\u2019 goal with that body was to become a fashion model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll have my image plastered on magazines and billboards.\u201d Crossing my arms, I said, \u201cHow is that any different from walking around looking slutty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be making as much as $3000 a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked, certain that I hadn\u2019t heard the man correctly.  \u201cI\u2019ll get $3000 a week just for showing my girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have put it so crudely, but yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to feel better about my situation; especially after hearing I could potentially make more in a week than my mom made in a month.  Walking back to the table, I sat down and said, \u201cWell since you put it that way, I\u2019m totally fine with that.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As I took my seat once more, I noticed Ms. Grimes looking at me for a moment.  I do not know why she was looking at me, but for some reason, I was rather enjoying it.  Turning her attention back to the two men, Ms. Grimes said, \u201cThere is one thing I\u2019m not entirely certain about; why is my friend here acting this way?\u201d turning to look at me, she said, \u201cThe way you\u2019re acting right now wasn\u2019t what I originally had in mind for that body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt relieved when I heard that.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is I shouldn\u2019t be feeling the need to show off my body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell not exactly; I wanted to be a model, so flaunting one\u2019s body goes along with that.\u201d Looking at me, Ms. Grimes said, \u201cBut, and I mean no offense, you\u2019re taking that to a whole new level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the men turned to Liz, who was busy looking over something on her tablet.  \u201cI think I might be able to explain the personality issue, Amelia.\u201d Looking up at me, she said, \u201cIt seems you didn\u2019t just get the wrong body; you were given the wrong personality as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that, I could escape the idea that this company needed to do some serious work to make their system better.  \u201cLet me guess, I got the personality of a promiscuous valley girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it in a nutshell, yes.\u201d Sighing, Liz said, \u201cYou see before we alter a client\u2019s personality, we make a copy of the original to use as a template.  You were given the personality of a 23-year-old girl from Burbank, California.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed a quick sigh of relief before turning to Ms. Grimes and saying, \u201cThis whole time I was, like, wondering why you\u2019d want to become some ditzy airhead.  Guess it was all a mistake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, you\u2019ll run into a lot of girls like that in modeling.\u201d Turning to face me, Ms. Grimes said, \u201cI actually wanted to be a college-educated model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing his throat to grab my attention, one of the big wigs said, \u201cMs. Webber; if you\u2019re interested, we can see about giving you the intended personality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, please do.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI knew some girls in school who talked like this; it was like so annoying\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting went on for a short time after that.  The big wigs gave Ms. Grimes and I each $150,000 to compensate us for the mix-up; which I already knew was going to go towards starting my modeling career and buying a decent condo wherever I ended up.  After that they had us switch identities; so she became 26-year-old Amelia Webber, while I became 22-year-old Sienna Grimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the meeting was coming to an end, I raised my hand to speak.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is normal; but while I was unconscious for the procedure, I had a dream where one minute I was my old self at the mall and the next I was topless doing a photoshoot on a beach.  What\u2019s up with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply the mind\u2019s way of dealing with the physical changes going on; to better acclimate you to your new appearance once you wake up.\u201d Chuckling, Liz said, \u201cIn all the years I\u2019ve done this job, you\u2019re the first person to ask about the dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting ended soon after; before she left, Amelia suggested we meet at the hotel bar this evening.

I suppose I should clarify that I was not too much like to my depressed former self; after all, that was the reason I went through with this in the first place.  I guess what I meant to say is that I am smarter and no longer had the urge to use \u2018like\u2019 or \u2018so\u2019 in every sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to the money they gave us, New Horizons arranged to have Amelia and myself upgraded to luxury suites at the resort we were staying at.  My room was larger than any hotel room I\u2019d ever stayed at before; it had a main room with an attached kitchen as well as a bedroom with an attached patio.  The closet had clothes that were much more modest than what I\u2019d worn earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter choosing a modest yet form-fitting dress, I took the elevator down to the hotel bar to meet with Amelia.  She was already waiting for me at a table when I arrived.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cI like that dress way better than the outfit you wore earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should get used to wearing revealing outfits, but on some level, I knew that was too revealing.\u201d Sitting down, I said, \u201cThis just feels more appropriate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia chuckled for a moment; before saying, \u201cForgive me; I just remembered you used to be a teenage boy.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s funny to hear you say that about such a feminine outfit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around for a moment, relieved to see that no one appeared to have heard that.  \u201cDo you mind keeping it down a little bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, most of these were already drunk before I got here.\u201d As the waiter returned with two beers, Amelia said, \u201cSo Sienna, why don\u2019t you tell me a little about yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia and I spent the better part of the next 2 hours getting to know each other over drinks.  As it turned out she originally wasn\u2019t that much older than Kevin had been; she had just graduated High School a few months earlier.  It seemed that she\u2019d been the frequent target of bullies for her weight, so she decided to make a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say that liposuction might\u2019ve been the better way to go; but then again, if I wanted to, I could\u2019ve chosen to go to therapy.  One thing I\u2019d noticed over that 2 hours was that, with every beer I drank, I found myself increasingly interested in Amelia.  Wanting to test a theory, I looked around the pool at everyone; and discovered rather quickly that I was more interested in the girls than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip of my beer, I said, \u201cForgive me, Amelia; but when you designed this body...did you want to be attracted to girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d ask that; I saw you look at me and some of the other girls.\u201d Nodding, Amelia said, \u201cYeah; I figured it would be fun being a lesbian fashion model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that would make things a little interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar closed shortly before 10:00; leaving Amelia and me to stumble back to our rooms.  As luck would have it, our suites were across from each other.  As I fumbled for my room key, Amelia looked at me and said, \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get the body you originally wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not; especially not after learning how much money I can make.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cBut, if you\u2019re interested, I know a way you could make it up to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d stepping closer, Amelia said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over, I pulled her in for a kiss; which she readily reciprocated.  It wasn\u2019t long before we were inside my room, a trail of clothes leading from the door to my bed.</span></div></div>",

Now that I was experiencing one, I can say without a doubt that it wasn\u2019t fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head was throbbing when I woke up, which was made worse by the sun shining through the windows and everything sounded like I was in a traffic jam.  To make matters that much worse, lying in bed and waiting it out wasn\u2019t a possibility.  Realizing I was about to throw up, cursing my existence with every step I took, I stumbled my way into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce my stomach was empty, I went to the sink and brushed my teeth; just as Amelia stumbled into the bathroom.  Watching as she hurled into the toilet, I was momentarily surprised to see her until I remembered that we\u2019d spent the night together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way into the kitchen, where I started the coffee pot before downing two aspirin.  Amelia walked into the room as I took a seat at the dining room table.  Joining me at the table, she said, \u201cKill me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beep from the coffee pot told me it was ready; so, after handing the bottle of aspirin to Amelia, I went over and poured us each a cup.  Handing one cup to Amelia, seeing the color slowly return to her face, I said, \u201cHow was it for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was fun.\u201d Taking a sip from her coffee, Amelia said, \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t design this body to be a lesbian, did you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, it never occurred to me.\u201d Moving over to the couch, I said, \u201cYou want to hear something funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoining me on the couch, Amelia said, \u201cSure, why not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were my first; I mean...ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that funny.\u201d Gently brushing hair from my eyes, she said, \u201cYou were my first, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned forward and tenderly kissed Amelia on the lips; something which she quickly reciprocated.  As the two of us kissed, I found myself wanting to ask if I could see her again; until I remembered she was moving to LA while I\u2019d be off somewhere pursuing my modeling career.  Chances were good that she\u2019d see me in a magazine or on a billboard; but it saddened me to think I\u2019d never see her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur kissing was interrupted by a knock on the door.  After adjusting my bathrobe, I opened the door to find Leslie and the ladies from New Horizons standing there.  \u201cGood morning, Sienna.\u201d Stepping inside, Leslie said, \u201cNormally we give our clients everything they\u2019d need for their new lives the first day.  But, with the mix-up, we thought we\u2019d postpone it until today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw Amelia the moment we walked into the main room; prompting her to quickly adjust her own bathrobe.  Looking at me, her eyebrow raised, Eliza said, \u201cWere we interrupting anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d blushing, Amelia said, \u201cWe were just talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza and Miranda didn\u2019t say anything, but I suspected that they weren\u2019t buying it.  I thought we were in the clear, until Leslie spotted the trail of clothes leading to the bedroom.  \u201cOh. Well,\u201d blushing, Leslie said, \u201cI guess that explains why there was no answer at your room, Ms. Webber.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The two of us were sitting on the bed, files in hand, with the TV playing quietly in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t realize just how much work would go into creating a new life from scratch, but it was clear New Horizons knew what they were doing.  While I already knew everything about Amelia\u2019s life, I knew little about my new life except for the fact that I was a lesbian fashion model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that I was the youngest of three girls; my parents wanted me to go to college like my sisters, but I wanted to be a model instead.  During High School I was the typical girly girl; star cheerleader, always interested in the latest fashion.  I even had a boyfriend for a time, until I came out as a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I got through my background, I turned my attention to the section about where my life was headed now.  As it turned out, I was going to staying local; New Horizons had arranged for me to sign with a modeling agency in New York City, and provided me with a decent apartment in the Manhattan.  There was a note saying that I had a photo shoot scheduled for three days from now, so I made a mental note to not forget that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I put my file down, Amelia looked at me and said, \u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised by this; considering what they did for us, but New Horizons certainly has some pull.\u201d Showing me her file, she said, \u201cI barely managed to scrape my way through High School was B average, but suddenly I\u2019ve got a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s from Dartmouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeslie said they have connections with various schools around the country.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must\u2019ve looked upset about something, because Amelia looked at me and said, \u201cHey, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was far from alright; I knew going in that Amelia and I wouldn\u2019t end up together, but it was becoming clearer by the minute that we\u2019d soon be parting ways.  \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t make me sound clingy, or anything.  But,\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you too, Sienna; and not just because of the mind-blowing sex.\u201d Gently caressing my face, Amelia said, \u201cHow many people can say they know absolutely everything about another person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it; we each ended up with the life meant for the other, a life that each of us designed down to the tiniest detail.\u201d <br>\r\nLooking at me, Amelia said, \u201cA couple could be married for 50 years and not have that level of understanding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned over and rested my head on Amelia\u2019s shoulder, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that we\u2019re going to be living on opposite sides of the country.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the clock on my nightstand, Amelia said, \u201cMy flight to LA doesn\u2019t leave for a few more hours; there\u2019s nothing stopping us from spending some more time together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on my face, I leaned over to kiss Amelia, \u201cYou read my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just before noon when I woke up again.  Rolling over in bed, I was saddened to see that Amelia wasn\u2019t lying in next to me.  Getting out of bed, I was disappointed to see that she was nowhere to be seen.  A quick peak outside showed that housekeeping was cleaning her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen, I saw a note on the counter:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Sienna,<br>\r\nI\u2019m sorry for saying goodbye like this.  But if you\u2019d been awake, I was afraid you\u2019d convince me to stay.  What we shared is something I\u2019ll remember always.<br>\r\nLove,<br>\r\nAmelia<br>\r\nPS \u2013 Once I\u2019m settled in, I\u2019ll call you.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amelia leaving meant my day was already off to a bad start; the fact that it was raining only served to dampen my mood.  After checking out of the hotel, I found a cab to take me to my new condo in Manhattan.  I\u2019d never once ventured into the city despite having grown up only an hour away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride to my condo took longer than I\u2019d expected; until I remembered NYC was notorious for traffic problems.  Eventually the cab driver dropped me off at one of those luxury condo buildings overlooking Central Park.  After checking it with the office, and finishing some paperwork, I took the elevator up to the 15th floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the hall towards my condo, I noticed an attractive looking red head stepping into the hallway.  I tried to be conspicuous about it, but you can bet I checked her out as she walked by.  I watched her walk down the hall as I arrived outside my door, thinking, <i>Let\u2019s see where the night takes me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I let myself into my new condo, I was instantly impressed by how large it was \u2013 there was a kitchen just off the hall leading into the main room, with a set of stairs leading up to what I quickly realized was my bedroom overlooking the main room.  <i>Oh wow</i>, looking out over the railing, I thought, <i>this place is incredible.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the rest of the place out, I started thinking about Kevin\u2019s home life and how the house he\u2019d grown up in paled in comparison to this place.  Walking into the kitchen, I had to tell myself not to think about that \u2013 <i>this is my life now; I\u2019m not that depressed teenager from New Jersey anymore.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI relaxed on the couch for a little while, channel surfing, before deciding that I needed to get out for a bit.  But unfortunately it was still raining, so that kind of limited my options \u2013 until I remembered there was an indoor pool in the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes, but I eventually found a bikini that I liked; after getting changed, I grabbed some things and rode the elevator up to the 20th floor.  As I stepped out of the elevator, I thought it strange that I didn\u2019t hear any kids splashing or screaming; until I remembered this building catered to primarily singles and young, childless couples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing my things in an empty chair, I went to the deep end and dove in.  After getting over my shock from the cold water, I swam a few laps before taking a seat on the steps in the shallow end.  I took that opportunity to surveil the area; finding a few girls that peaked my interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water eventually got too cold for me, so I climbed out and went back to my chair.  After drying off, I sat down and opened a harlequin romance novel that Leslie had suggested.  I wasn\u2019t thrilled to find out that I now had an interest in these books, but I figured I\u2019d get used to it given time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had only just started reading when some stood in front of my chair, blocking my view of Central Park through the window.  I looked up and saw a young standing in front of me; one I quickly recognized as having watched me in the pool.  Removing an earbud from my ear, I said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually do this type of thing; but I was watching you in the pool earlier.\u201d Blushing, the man said, \u201cI-I was wondering if perhaps you\u2019d like to have dinner sometime?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it was \u2013 my first experience being hit on by a guy.  He wasn\u2019t all that bad looking; a little on the pudgy side but no means overweight.  I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have found him attractive as Amelia; but he wasn\u2019t doing anything for me right now.  \u201cI hate to burst your bubble, but I\u2019m a lesbian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be I\u2019m not the first guy you\u2019ve said that to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not; but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d Leaning closer, in a hushed tone, I said, \u201cThe only way we\u2019d work out, is if you were a brunette with big tits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt eventually dawned on the guy that I was telling the truth, \u201cWould it be inappropriate if I still asked you to dinner?\u201d looking at me, he said, \u201cI only ask because it seems like you could use a friend right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found myself considering the guy\u2019s offer; dinner would certainly help get my mind off Amelia, and I could use a friend.  \u201cSure, dinner sounds great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome.  By the way,\u201d Reaching his hand out, the guy said, \u201cmy name\u2019s David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, David,\u201d shaking his hand, I said, \u201cI\u2019m Sienna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and I spoke for a few more minutes before parting ways; but not before agreeing to meet in the lobby in two hours.  I read my book for a few minutes before figuring I should go get ready; I needed to shower and find an outfit to wear.</span></div></div>",

I was nursing a Bud Light when he took a seat next to me, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be at least an hour before we can get a table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell by his tone that David was subtly asking if that was okay with me, \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me; more time to work up an appetite.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter giving his order to a hostess, David looked at me and said, \u201cSo Sienna, why don\u2019t you tell me a little about yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot to tell, really; I\u2019m the youngest of three girls and I\u2019m an aspiring model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s jaw dropped as he looked at me, \u201cDamn, now it really sucks that you\u2019re a lesbian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor you, maybe; but definitely not for me.\u201d Taking a sip of my beer, I said, \u201cGetting paid to be around scantly clad women at photo shoots is a dream come true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostess returned at that moment with David\u2019s beer; as he tipped her, he said, \u201cHave you been in any magazines that I\u2019d know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not; I\u2019m still new to the modeling world.\u201d Starting to feel the affects of the beer, I said, \u201cI got my first professional shoot in a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on me, David said, \u201cI wonder how my High School bullies would feel, if they knew I was having dinner with an attractive model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart went out to David upon hearing he\u2019d been bullied; I\u2019d only know him for a little while, but I could tell he was a nice guy.  He could probably stand to lose a few pounds, but he wasn\u2019t unattractive.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me a little about yourself, David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell, really; I\u2019m an accountant for Citi.\u201d Taking a big sip of his beer, David said, \u201cUntil recently I\u2019d been seeing this girl for 3 years, until I found out she was cheating on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, I couldn\u2019t help but think of Amelia, \u201cI can sympathize with that; I, uh, just recently parted ways with someone very special to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d looking at me, David said, \u201cHow long were the two of together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I thought about it, the more I regretted bringing Amelia into the conversation; having her leave after a one-night stand was nothing compared to David\u2019s experience.  \u201cWe weren\u2019t a couple in the traditional sense; but she knew me better than anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost 90 minutes without a table, David and I decided to cut our losses.  We ordered sandwiches and found a bench overlooking the fountain at Washington Square Park.  By the end of the evening, it was as though David and I were old friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe took a cab back to our building, where David graciously walked me to my room.  While fumbling with my keys, I turned to David and said, \u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, David said, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, I took a step inside and turned back to look at David, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll be honest; I\u2019m feeling pretty lonely right now and wouldn\u2019t mind having someone to wake up to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that David was hesitant; and I couldn\u2019t blame him.  After a moment, he smiled and said, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you really want, then I\u2019ll stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of us were inside, I closed the door and kicked off my heels.  Taking David\u2019s hand in mine, I led him upstairs to my bedroom.  Let\u2019s just say, although David wasn\u2019t enough to convert to my heterosexuality; he was definitely good enough to scratch that particular itch.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d been to NYC a few times as Kevin, so I knew I wasn\u2019t missing much in terms of touristy stuff.  With my photo shoot scheduled for tomorrow morning, I decided it was best to just stay in the condo and relax for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed and helping myself to a healthy breakfast, I grabbed my laptop and went out on my enclosed porch.  Booting up the laptop, I quickly got a notification telling me that I had several emails.  Hoping to find one from Amelia, I was disappointed when all I saw were emails from Leslie and some woman who identified herself as my agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the latter for a moment, I opened the email from Leslie; briefly surprised to see that it appeared to be business related rather than personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello Ms. Grayson,</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all the chaos of the last few days, we neglected to inform you of the secure site you could use to communicate with loved ones from your former life.

I wanted to get a better understanding of who I was before letting them back into my life.  So, after saving the information on my desktop, I opened the email from my agent:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Ms. Grayson,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Erica Rodriquez with Brady Talent.  Normally I like to meet with a prospective client before taking them on, but you came highly recommended by my boss.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I gave my decision some serious thought; after all, this was a life-altering decision I was making.  After a few moments, with a nervous smile, I said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go with Option 4; the older male.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had briefly considered the other options but couldn\u2019t imagine myself in any of those situations.  I couldn\u2019t imagine being a 5-year-old girl; solely because I didn\u2019t want to grow up again.  Then there was the concern that I\u2019d hate that life and it would\u2019ve been for naught.  I\u2019d already been a 13-year-old boy; hell, that was the reason I was doing this.  Even if I changed my gender and became a 13-year-old girl, what was keeping that life from the same as my old life?  I didn\u2019t want to be a 26-year-old woman; I remembered my mom telling me stories about her 20s and that didn\u2019t appeal to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that left only the older man and the older woman.  I remembered what Duncan had told me, and thought about how happy he seemed as Helen, but that life wasn\u2019t for me.  I didn\u2019t want to give up 40 years of my life.  With no other choices, I settled on the man.  Once I made that decision, I promised myself that I was going to be a better man then my father had been.  I wasn\u2019t going to follow in his footsteps and run out on his family.  I was going to be a loving father, one who\u2019d be there for his kids; even if that meant building that family myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure, Kevin?\u201d Dr. Willard must\u2019ve sensed my anxiety.  \u201cOnce you go through with the procedure, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew in my heart that I had made the right decision.  \u201cI\u2019m sure, Doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I suppose congratulations are in order; you\u2019ve just made one of the biggest decisions of your life.\u201d  As she jotted something in my file, she looked at me and said, \u201cForgive me, but you don't look as happy as I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, Dr. Willard, I\u2019m happy.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m just very nervous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not surprising; after all, you\u2019ve got a whole new life ahead of you.\u201d Looking at me, kindly, Dr. Willard said, \u201cNormally I\u2019d take you directly to one of our Life Designers, but I believe they\u2019re all at lunch; so I\u2019ll take you to the waiting room instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she grabbed the file, I followed Dr. Willard out of the room; going down an unfamiliar hallway.  \u201cForgive me, Dr. Willard; but aren\u2019t we going the wrong way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were in our intake waiting room before; since you\u2019re in the process of becoming a new person, we\u2019ve got a private waiting room down the hall for people like you.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cThis way if someone doesn\u2019t meet our standards, we won\u2019t expose them to people who did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we arrived outside a door that said <i>VIP Waiting</i>, I said, \u201cI guess that makes sense, wouldn\u2019t want someone knowing something they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Opening the door, Dr. Willard said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you here, Kevin; I wish you luck and hope you find happiness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked inside the waiting room, which was not as spartan as the other one, and took a seat.  Several other people were waiting as well; including a middle-aged woman, a boy about my age, and an elderly man.  Every one of us was nervous, but we were anxiously awaiting the start of our new lives.</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t long before I was the only one left in the empty room.  Spotting a mirror nearby, reflecting sunlight directly into my eyes,  Getting up, I walked over and found myself looking at my reflection \u2013 one that had been my constant companion for 14 years.  It dawned on me that I was about to give it up for a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t realize there was someone else in the room until I heard a voice behind me.   \u201cYou saying your goodbyes, Mr. Scott?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh...\u201d turning around, I saw a pregnant young woman standing in the doorway.  I recognize her as one of the women I\u2019d seen earlier.  \u201cCall me...uh Kevin. I was just... uh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Mr...sorry, Kevin; that\u2019s what its there for.  My name\u2019s Leslie Cummings, I\u2019ll be your Life <br>\r\nDesigner.\u201d Stepping to the side, she said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me, we\u2019ll get to work designing your new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Leslie out of the room and down the hall; entering a large office space with six desks evenly spaced, although only three of them were currently being used.  Leslie led me to a desk in the corner; I took a seat as she slowly settled into her chair.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen now, Ms. Cummings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Leslie.\u201d Moving her keyboard over, Leslie said, \u201cThis is where we work on designing your new life.  Have you given any thought to what you want it to be like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m only here because my mom and sister thought I needed to do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, we\u2019ll start at the beginning.\u201d Tapping a pen against her lips, Leslie said, \u201cWhat would you like your name to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst and last, please.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cYou could keep Kevin, but I recommend against it; it\u2019ll make the adjustment easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about that for a few moments, until my thoughts drifted to my old friends.  I finally decided on a way to honor them both; looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cCall me David Williams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the better part of the next hour answering all of Leslie\u2019s questions; from hair color to skin color.  I eventually settled on being light-skinned with dark brown hair and an athletic build.  I didn\u2019t have to worry about gaining weight or anything, thanks to Leslie making some tweaks to give me an excellent metabolism into my old age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions were pretty straight forward until Leslie came to one that I couldn\u2019t answer.  Looking at me, all serious, she said, \u201cPenile size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoking slightly, I said, \u201cEx-Excuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to blush, we\u2019re both adults here.  How well endowed would you like to be, David?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cIf it helps, I used to be quite well endowed myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the nature of this company, I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when I heard that.  But I was.  \u201cYou used to be a man?  What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was a widower in my mid-40s; one day my daughter came out to me and well, I didn\u2019t take it very well.  I ended up alienating her and my family.\u201d Sighing, Leslie said, \u201cEventually I found myself at NHI clinic in Alabama; where I decided that I wanted to have a life like my little girl.  So that\u2019s how I became a 22-year-old lesbian; my wife and I have been married for 3 years and, as you\u2019ve probably noticed, I\u2019m currently expecting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll this time I thought people came here only because they were unhappy with their lives.\u201d Looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cWas such a drastic change worth it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I loved my daughter\u2019s mother very much; but Grace, I\u2019m fairly certain she\u2019s my soulmate.\u201d Leaning back, Leslie said, \u201cAs for my daughter; I\u2019ve gained a deeper understanding of her, and even see her once a week at my Lamaze class \u2013 even if she doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, we went back to the questions; eventually settling on a straight male with average-sized junk.  I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when Leslie said girls will be all over me looking at the way I was about to.  \u201cIf you say so, Leslie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I <i>was</i> a guy for 43 years; I know what the ladies like.\u201d Turning her monitor towards me, Leslie said, \u201cDo you want to see the new you, David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore me on the screen was a very handsome and athletic-looking man.  Looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cI know we decided on 37, but could you make me 39 instead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I used my friends to come up with my name, and my sister gave me some photos to remember her; the only other person in my life was my mom and she\u2019s 39.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie made the adjustment and the image on the screen shivered and adjusted slightly matching the new age.  Once that was done, she said, \u201cNow it\u2019s time to choose your career.  What do you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeslie, I\u2019d like to be...\u201d</span></div></div>",

If you\u2019re willing, we can set you up with your firm in Chicago; with strings attached of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of strings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNew Horizon has been looking to expand to the mid-west for a few years; if you accept, we\u2019ll hire your firm to design and build our Chicago-based clinic.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win; you\u2019ll gain a footing in Chicago and New Horizon will be in a position to serve the Chicago market.  We\u2019d also like to be able to place new workers at your firm; younger architects, interns, Secretary or Office temp workers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are my other options?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same situation; but we\u2019d place you in another city.\u201d</span></div></div>",

While that\u2019s happening, I\u2019ll set you up with an IV that will give you both a sedative and the nanites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this where I\u2019ll get those skills that Leslie mentioned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course; we\u2019ll give you everything you\u2019ll need to succeed as a 39-year-old man.\u201d As I sat in the chair, she said, \u201cBefore we begin is there anything you need to do as Kevin Scott? Do you need to make any phone calls; or is there anything that you want to keep?  Whatever you don\u2019t want will be sent back to Kevin\u2019s family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered the envelope that Kelsey had given me. Pulling it from my pocket, I said, \u201cThis has pictures of me and my twin sister; I\u2019d like to hold onto them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, after changing into a hospital gown, I was in the chair with an IV in my arm.  After I gave the signal that I was ready, Liz pressed a button.  \u201cWhen you wake up you\u2019ll officially be Mr. David Williams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dreamt that I was back home watching a movie with Kelsey, Kyle, and David; some cheesy blockbuster that I wasn\u2019t entirely interested in.  Suddenly Mom walked into the room and asked, \u201cWhy don't we watch a family movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy voice a little deeper, I said, \u201cSure thing.\u201d Turning around, I saw that Kyle and David were gone; only Kelsey remained.  She over to me with a movie in her hands, \u201cWhat about this one, Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could answer, Kelsey, disappeared; leaving me alone with my mom\u2026I mean, Abigail.  I sensed that I was closer to her age now; and I knew that she wasn\u2019t my mother anymore.  Suddenly, as the others had before, she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew memories began to appear; thankfully they weren\u2019t overriding my old memories.  I saw myself as a kid, albeit with darker hair, building a sandcastle. Then I was a teenager making a shed; followed by my first kiss at a local movie theater.  After that memories came in rapid succession; high school, college, my first solo project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up in a hospital bed, with Liz standing nearby.  Seeing me, she said, \u201cMorning sunshine; or should I say Happy Birthday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, feeling the five o'clock shadow on my face; with a hand, I brushed the stubble, grinning at the idea that I could now grow a beard if I wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long was I out?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 6 hours; the older you become, the longer you\u2019re unconscious.\u201d Grabbing a nearby bag, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve got some clothes for you; once you\u2019re dressed, we\u2019ll get you discharged and you will be on your way, Mr. Williams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got dressed fairly quickly; feeling oddly cold.  I threw on a pair of khakis and dress socks; along with a blue dress shirt.  Once that was finished, Liz led me out of the room and down the hall.  I saw Dr. Harris approaching and walked up to her.  Shaking her hand, I said, \u201cThank you so much, Dr. Harris.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re most welcome, Mr. William; after all, we\u2019ve needed a Chicago branch for a while now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me, when do I leave for Chicago?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got you a flight ______.</span></div></div>",

Everything will be covered by us, so feel free to make use of the amenities.\u201d Smiling, Dr. Harris said, \u201cWe have transportation coming to take you there, and the hotel has an airport shuttle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Harris walked off a few minutes later; as a young woman, in her late teens, walked into the lobby.  Liz led me down the hall to the waiting room where I\u2019d seen Helen.  As I took a seat, fidgeting ever so slightly, I thought about Helen and hoped she got to see her sister off.  I had the room to myself until the young girl from earlier entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t say anything as she took a seat; I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what led her to come here.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cAre you looking to start over as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve already started my new life; I\u2019m just waiting for my ride to the hotel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m David, by the way.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you Miss uh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBerkhart.\u201d Regaining some composure, she said, \u201cI'm Katrina Berkhart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you Miss Berkart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d looking at me, nervously, she said, \u201cI mean the transformation and all that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt only hurts if you\u2019re leaving loved ones behind, but physically you feel no pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina appeared to brighten a bit as a man appeared in the doorway; likely relieved that it was going to be painless.  Looking at me, the man said, \u201cMr. Williams, I\u2019ll be your driver for the evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, I turned to Katrina and said, \u201cI hope you find happiness, Ms. Berkhart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving across town, I found myself in the lobby of a resort I\u2019d only glimpsed in passing.  Walking up to the counter, I said, \u201cHello, I\u2019m David Williams; I believe I have a reservation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, Mr. Williams; we\u2019ve been expecting you.\u201d Looking up from his computer, after typing my name in, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got you in room 626; one of our deluxe suites, I trust that  will be acceptable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled as I realized this was the first time I\u2019d checked into a hotel on my own; until today I hadn\u2019t been old enough to do it.  \u201cThat will be just fine, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding me a small envelope, the man said, \u201cHere\u2019s your key; you\u2019ll find our bar on the top floor and the pool down the hall.\u201d Smiling, he said, \u201cThere are several restaurants in the shopping mall across the street; along with a movie theater.  I hope you enjoy your stay, Mr. Williams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking the man, I walked through the hotel to check out some of the amenities before heading to my room.  I waited for the elevator for 10 minutes before deciding to take the stairs.  By the time I reached the 4th floor, I was winded, and by the 6th I was struggling for air.  I may have been fit and athletic but I was still 39 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy room was quite large; consisting of a king-size bed, a hot tub, and a shower; along with a balcony and a full kitchen.  I was about to take a seat on the couch when there was a knock at the door.  Walking over, I saw a bellhop standing there with a package.  \u201cThis was just delivered for you, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving the bellhop a small tip, I closed the door and carried the package into the living room.  Opening the box, I saw a letter inside: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Mr. Williams,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe trust that you\u2019ll enjoy your accommodations.  Inside this package, we have put three sets of clothes of varying formality, a swimsuit along with a Cubs &amp; White Sox hats.  We apologize there is no business suit, but there will be one at your home in Chicago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hope you\u2019ll remain in contact with us; as we enjoy making new friends.  Many of the girls go to the movies on Thursdays; you\u2019re more than welcome to join us but we\u2019ll understand if you don\u2019t want to be seen with several gorgeous young women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease take care, Love, from everyone.<br>\r\nNH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the note; a guy my age might look out of place hanging out with those young women.  After taking a short nap, followed a refreshing shower, I decided to get a good look at my new body.  For the first time in my life, I was proud of the man I saw in the mirror - a feeling that hadn't existed several hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still early in the evening, so I wondered what I was going to do next \u2013 I certainly didn\u2019t want to spend my evening in the room.</span></div></div>",

My mouth was wide open; never before had I found a woman like her to be attractive.  Sure she was pretty but when I'd been Kevin, I would have found her too old and my eyes would have been focused on her average top half.  Now I was thinking solely about wife material.  She saw me staring at her and smiled as she walked past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her as I rode the elevator down the pool.  This was the first time I\u2019d been attracted to an older woman that wasn\u2019t a celebrity or a porn star.  As the elevator reached the bottom floor, I got out and made my way to the pool area.  What I saw there was pure chaos; kids running around and making noise, teens wishing they were somewhere else, and a hot tub filled with parents lamenting the fact they\u2019d had kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo them it was chaos, but this was everything I\u2019d ever wanted; a chance to have a family of my own.  I took a seat near the far corner, only to have a small girl of around 9-years-old accidentally fall into my lap.  She looked at me apologetically; so I said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d  I wanted to say more, but a woman who I assumed was her mother was staring daggers at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending a few minutes in the pool, I decided to give up; it was too loud and crowded for me.  Disappointed I climbed out of the pool, put my shirt on, and walked back to my room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I gave up on going out and exploring as I changed out of my swimsuit. It was getting late and my day had been unforgettably busy. I  ordered take-out Chinese food and had it delivered to my room. Soon after finishing my meal I fell asleep to the drone of television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up with the sun was a novel experience. As Kevin, I had tried to sleep as long as possible, but as soon as the sunlight reached my window I stirred. Groggy I got up and took a shower. Once cleaned up and dressed I still couldn't shake the grogginess from my head, and a growl from my stomach told me I was hungry. I peered into the rooms mini-fridge at the take-out food, but my stomach wouldn't accept it. It was then that I realized how early it was. The hotel would have breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakfast room was on the main floor off the lobby. As I exited the elevator the smell of coffee cleared my head. My stomach growled again as if saying \"that is what we want\".  I gathered a full plate breakfast food and a cup of coffee and found a small table in the corner of the room. I watched older couples sit and slowly gnawed on their breakfast, while business men rushed in grabbing a piece of toast and quickly returned to the lobby. Occasionally I got up to refill my coffee cup, and with each cup began to feel more awake. I found a newspaper on one of the tables and became engrossed in the business section, especially with an article on building trends in the mid--west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on I returned to my room. I spotted the note that I had been sent when New Horizon had sent me clothes.  The Idea of  meeting with several beautiful women for a few hours sounded like fun. I did however a few hours to kill before they would be off work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo kill time I found the hotel gym. It was a relatively small room, set back behind the pool area. Three treadmills, an arm hoist and a squat rack was about it for machines, though several free weight racks lined the walls. Seeing the room empty, I stepped on to a treadmill.  I had never been into fitness before but after trying the treadmill, I couldn't think of why I ever didn\u2019t like fitness.  I ran for miles with no problem. After seeing the five mile mark hit I really began to appreciate how fit my new life was. I would have been heaving for air after a mile as Kevin, but now I was warmed up and ready to hit the racks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat was pouring down my forehead when the gym door opened. I looked up as the woman from the elevator last night walked in. This time she wore spandex pants and a loose t-shirt with her hair pulled up into a high ponytail. I averted my eyes as she noticed me. I was determined to not be caught staring a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to be macho, I put a few more weights on the rack just in case she was watching, and was rewarded with a smile when she noticed. The woman then stepped onto a treadmill and began to run. My eyes drifted towards her, but when I saw her looking I quickly focused on my own work out. After an hour of  working out I could feel the fatigue set in. Once I finished my set I began to put the weights back onto a rack. The woman stopped her own set and smiled at me.<br>\r\n\u201cI saw you last night didn\u2019t I?\u201d she said. Her voice, smooth and welcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah. I had just arrived and was heading to the pool\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof. how did it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was loud, a bit chaotic. I didn't stay long.\u201d I said playing it cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Diana,\u201d she said, stepping forward to shake my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is nice to meet you David. How long are you here for?\u201d Diana asked casually. Though there was an interest in her eyes and I noticed she looked down at my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fly home Saturday morning\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh me too. Hey, I can see that you are getting ready to go so I won\u2019t hold you up but  if you are not busy Friday night I will be up in the Upstairs Bar. If you want to join me, I certainly wouldn't mind the company\u201d Diana said handing me a small card that had her name and what I assumed was her phone number on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I said putting her card into my pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d and left for the door, surprised that on day two  and my first full day as David I was already having better luck with the ladies than I had ever had as Kevin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Considering it was a weekday evening, I was surprised to see how packed the Mall was.  I found a bench outside the theater to sit on while I waited for the girls from New Horizons to arrive.  I didn\u2019t have to wait before I heard a familiar voice.  \u201cDavid, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, I saw Leslie Cummings walking towards me with three other women; one of whom had tattoos down most of her right arm.  I got up as they arrived, hugging Leslie as I said, \u201cI needed to get out of the hotel room; there\u2019s only so much to do there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can sympathize.\u201d Taking a seat next to me, a huge smile on her face, she said, \u201cLadies, this is David Williams; an architect from Chicago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure he is.\u201d Looking at me, the tattooed woman said, \u201cI\u2019ll bet he used to be someone else a few days ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you ever get tired of knowing everything?\u201d sighing, Leslie said, \u201cDavid, this know-it-all next to me is my wife Grace.  She\u2019s retired Army Intelligence; so although she knows not to ask who you were, she\u2019s smart enough to know the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, I looked at Grace cautiously; until she smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your secret\u2019s safe with me.  After all, you\u2019re just like my wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not exactly, I didn\u2019t use to be a homophobic ass.</i>  Leslie continued with the introductions, turning to the woman next to her. \u201cThese are my co-workers Erin and Carrie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet all of you.\u201d  I felt weird knowing that I was now suddenly a decade older than everyone here, whereas a few days earlier I\u2019d been a decade younger.  I caught Erin and Carrie looking at me with the kind of expression I\u2019d seen Kelsey give to guys she liked.  They quickly giggled and turned away when they realized I saw them.  \u201cSo, um, what movie are we seeing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold your horses, David; we\u2019ve got some business to attend to first.  There\u2019s a situation at work we think you can help us with, but we\u2019ll understand if you refuse.\u201d Gesturing to Erin and Carrie, Leslie said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 12-year-old boy who we\u2019re unable to place in a local home, and it\u2019ll be a few days before we can contact families further out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m listening; although I\u2019m not sure what this has to do with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeslie mentioned that you wanted to start a family; if you were willing, this boy could become your son.\u201d Looking at me, Leslie said, \u201cIf you say yes, we could even alter his genetics so that you two are related. What do you say? Do you want to be a father?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help smiling as a pregnant Leslie asked if I wanted to be a Father. \u201cHow would you make us related?\u201d<br>\r\nErin interjected and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing, we\u2019ll take a sample of your DNA; we\u2019ll splice it with the boy\u2019s so that, at least paternally, you\u2019ll be related.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you agree, then we can take care of everything tomorrow, and you two will leave for Chicago on Saturday like planned.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at all four ladies; trying to process everything that was going on.  I\u2019d only been a grown man for a few days, now they were asking me to become a father.  After a moment I realized there was little chance I wouldn\u2019t agree with this.  Looking at them, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d  Taking a pause, I said, \u201cWhat is his name? How old is he?\u201d I asked as questions began to fill my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, calm down David; his name is Andrew and he\u2019s 12 years old.\u201d Looking at me, seeing the gears spinning in my head, Leslie said, \u201cAndrew can tell you the rest tomorrow if he wants to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized that I was now responsible for someone other than myself.  \u201cWhen can I pick him up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send a driver to pick you up around 8:30 to bring you to the Clinic; once we\u2019re finished, we\u2019ll have someone take you both back to the hotel.\u201d With a sense of finality in her voice, Leslie said, \u201cNow. what movie do you girls want...oh right, and David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Carrie voted to see a new rom-com; so did Leslie, but I suspected for different reasons.  Grace and I wanted to see the new action thriller, but we were outvoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe left the theater about 2 hours later; Carrie and Erin were laughing and Leslie was crying.  Grace seemed annoyed but I suspected that she\u2019d enjoyed the movie.  As for me, I was so caught up with the prospect of becoming a father that I\u2019d missed the first half of the movie.  I must\u2019ve fallen asleep at some point because I woke up to Grace elbowing me in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping her hand into Grace\u2019s Leslie said, \u201cWell that was fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs anyone up for drinks?\u201d pausing, Carrie said, \u201cHow does Pina Coladas at Applebee's sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndicting her stomach, Leslie said, \u201cSorry, but that\u2019ll be a hard pass for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, sorry.\u201d Turning to me, the same flirtatious look from earlier, Carrie said, \u201cHow about you, David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m going to pass; I\u2019m not as young as I used to be.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI appreciate the offer though, but I\u2019m going to turn in.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lobby was quite busy the next morning; with people coming and going.  I was sitting in a recliner by the fireplace when I heard a familiar voice behind me.  \u201cWell good morning, David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I smiled when I saw Diana approaching me from the elevator; wearing a dress that showed off her figure.  \u201cGood morning, Diana; you\u2019re looking lovely this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit startled by that; complimenting an older woman\u2019s appearance wasn\u2019t something I usually did.  But then again, I wasn\u2019t the same teenage boy I\u2019d been a few days earlier.  To her credit though, Diana smiled and said, \u201cThank you; are you off to work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, not exactly.</i>  \u201cI\u2019m waiting for a company driver to pick me up at any moment.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cHow about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFingers crossed, I\u2019m hopefully off to close a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d curious, I said, \u201cWhat is it that you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana wasn\u2019t even hiding it; with a raised eyebrow and a smile on her face, it was obvious that she was flirting with me.  \u201cMeet me at the bar tonight, and I\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the lobby doors, she turned to wave and said, \u201cSounds like a date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later I was walking into New Horizons for the second time in my life.  I walked up to the receptionist from yesterday, who said, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Williams; Dr. Weintraub and Mrs. Cummings are expecting you.\u201d Pointing down the hall, she said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll take a seat in the waiting room, I will let them know you are here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked down to the waiting room; but before I could even walk in, I saw Leslie waving me down.  As she got closer, she said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you could make it, David; are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her down the hall, I said, \u201cAre we going to see Andrew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into an examination room, Leslie said, \u201cNot yet; there are still some things we need to do for both of you.\u201d Gesturing to an examination table, Leslie said, \u201cHave a seat, Liz will be in shortly do collect a sample.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz walked in a few minutes later; looking at her, I said, \u201cHow are we doing this, Liz?  Do you need a blood sample or a um...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing so crude as all that, David.\u201d Smiling, Liz said, \u201cNow open wide and say Ah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the sample was taken, Liz led me back to the waiting room.  As she turned to leave, I said, \u201cHow long will this take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat depends; we\u2019re rewriting DNA that\u2019s already been changed once before. It is perfectly doable, but much like writing over something in pencil that you already erased once, we have to be careful not to blend the new \u201clead\u201d with the old.\u201d Looking at me, Liz said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at between 45 minutes to 6 hours, recovery included, depending on how similar your DNA is already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath. \u201cThanks, Liz.\u201d she smiled at left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two hours went by with no word from the back; although I did see five people enter the waiting room before they were taken back.  The first was a teenage girl I\u2019d remembered seeing in school; she was a year or two older than me, kind of a loner so I never got to learn her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came an older woman, probably in her mid-60s; she smiled at me as we sat there.  After that came a guy in his early 20s; judging by his appearance, I figured he wasn\u2019t doing much with his life. The fourth was a middle-aged man, similar to my age. The fifth client was another teenage girl, though I had never seen her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle-aged man reappeared a short time later; looking angry as he walked past the room.  All I could hear as he walked by was something about like \u201cmid-life crisis my ass.\u201d  I figured that meant they\u2019d determined that they couldn\u2019t help him.  After that came a busty, blonde girl who looked to be in her early 20s; smiling at me as she walked past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after an athletic-looking college-age man came out; winking and grinning at me as he passed.  I suspected that he used to be the older woman who\u2019d passed the time by staring at me.  It was nearly 45 minutes before another person, a woman in her late 40s, walked past the window. The only clue I had that she wasn't who she looked like was her arms crossed under her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie walked out shortly after with a small boy, no older than 5 or 6,  I began to get up when she shooed me back down and continued to walk past me to the reception counter.  She then came back a moment later, and said, \u201cAndrew\u2019s awake and asking for you; are you ready to meet your son?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Leslie peeked through the doorway before turning towards me and gestured me in.  The room was brightly lit; I saw Leslie and Liz standing off to the side, looking towards the center of the room.  On the examination table was a 12-year-old boy; one that I recognized immediately. He looked just like a younger me; not Kevin, but David.  He had the same hair, the same nose, and the same grin as he examined himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrew, this is your father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew looked up me for the first time, his eyes lit up with surprise as he looked at me.  His smile grew exponentially bigger as he jumped off the table.  \u201cDad!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knelt on one knee, looking at him.  \u201cThat\u2019s right, Andrew; I\u2019m your father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was choking back tears as Andrew ran over and hugged me.  We remained like that for a while, until Leslie said, \u201cDavid, there are some forms that you both need to sign; after that, you\u2019re free to leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mid-afternoon when the driver dropped Andrew and me at the hotel.  The lobby was empty as we walked to the elevator.  Looking up at me, Andrew said, \u201cDad, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Hungry...I\u2019m Dad.\u201d I smiled at my first dad joke, while Andrew just rolled his eyes.  Looking at him, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get something once we get to the room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got to the room, Andrew dropped a duffle bag inside the door as he went off to explore.  I was looking through the menus for local restaurants when I heard him exclaim, \u201cWhoa! This room has a Jacuzzi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was excited to see him excited; I didn\u2019t know anything about his past, but I was glad to see him happy.  As he walked back into the main room, I pointed to the menus and said, \u201cHave a look at these; I\u2019ll let you choose where we go for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew took a seat at the desk as he looked over the menus.  Glancing back at me, he said, \u201cYou were right by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled, I said, \u201cCome again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you were right.\u201d Looking at me, a smile on his face, Andrew said, \u201cThe transformation didn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI racked my brain trying to figure out what Andrew was saying; then it hit me.  \u201cYou were Katrina Berkhart, the girl from the waiting room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly all I could think about was the look of utter defeat on Katrina\u2019s face in the waiting room.  It made the look of utter joy on Andrew\u2019s face all the more special.  \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s only fair that you know; after all, you\u2019re my father now.\u201d Andrew hesitated for a second before saying, \u201cBut before we talk, could we go here and get some food first.\u201d Andrew held up a menu of a burger joint a short walk from the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, son.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As he put the fries in the fridge, he said, \u201cThose burgers were great; and I think the shakes were probably the best I\u2019d ever had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took note of the amount of energy that Andrew now had, I knew it was only a matter of time before he crashed.  \u201cIt was, but don\u2019t complain when your stomach is upset tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us took a seat on the couch; Andrew sat next to me fidgeting.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything, Andrew; I\u2019ll love you just the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you deserve to know who I used to be.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Andrew said, \u201cAs you know my name was Katriana Berkhart; I was 19 years old and a sophomore in college.  For as long as I...Katrina could remember, she wanted to be a school teacher.  Everything was going great; I had perfect grades, a loving family, friends, and an amazing boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes locked onto Andrew\u2019s; trying to convey concern and love. \u201cI take it something happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything was great until last week; I was at a party with some sorority sisters and my boyfriend, there was tons of music and drinking.  Slowly my friends left with guys and my boyfriend led me upstairs.  I realize now that I\u2019d had too much to drink, so I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly when my boyfriend and I started to fool around.\u201d Sighing, Andrew said, \u201cEverything changed after that; it turns out my boyfriend filmed our night together and leaked it online.  Once I found out, like an idiot, I decided to confront my boyfriend; he just laughed and asked if I wanted to film another.  He dumped me on the spot when I refused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I whispered. \u201cThat sounds rough\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, it gets worse.\u201d Taking a deep breath, she said, \u201cI was beyond upset, as you might imagine; so I called my mom to explain what happened.  She told me to come by the house to talk.  I beat them there and was waiting on the front porch when it happened. I saw their car in the corner. As they entered the intersection a car came from nowhere and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew, once Andrew went quiet, what had happened.  Andrew started crying, so I pulled him in for a hug and said, \u201cAndrew, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew weakly smiled. \u201cThere is one more thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face turned pale. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter my parent's funeral, the university revoked my scholarship because of the video; and suggested that I find another major.\u201d Sobbing, Andre said, \u201cMy roommate found me on the floor, I\u2019d overdosed on sleeping pills.  Long story short, after the hospital visit my roommate brought me to New Horizons; where I met you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything that happened to you, son.\u201d Hugging him, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s make a new life together; how\u2019s that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great...Dad.\u201d after taking a moment to calm down, he said, \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said we both needed to learn about each other\u2019s past; I told you mine, now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but it\u2019s not as tragic as your story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes son, I was unhappy.\u201d  I proceeded to tell Andrew everything about my life; from my father leaving to my sister and mom realizing that I needed a change.  Once I was finished, I showed Andrew some of the pictures Kelsey gave me. \u201cThis was me and my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring intently at the photo, Andrew said, \u201cWow, your sister\u2019s hot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrew!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I...I\u2019m not sure why I feel that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized just how different things would be for Andrew now; whereas I\u2019d gotten older and more mature, Andrew had jumped the gender fence and was brought right back to the cusp of puberty.  \u201cI guess it would be my duty as your father to guide you through puberty. You are a growing boy, remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew walked off and returned with a framed photograph.  \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of Katrina\u2019s parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the photo and realized that it was a high school graduation photo; Katrina looked so happy standing next to her parents.  The man in the photo had kind eyes but a gruff demeanor, the woman was stunning; with a bright smile and clear happy eyes. I couldn't help but take notice of her.  Turning to Andrew, feeling the need to mess with him, I said, \u201cNow your mom was hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, mortified, Andrew said, \u201cThat\u2019s gross, Dad.\u201d It was clear from his smile that he was messing around.  \u201cI just thought of something; what exactly will we tell people about my mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a moment, I said, \u201cWhat if we tell people she died shortly after you were born; it\u2019ll explain why we don\u2019t have a lot of photos or memories of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that works. But can we say she died in a car crash when I was very little?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw the meaning behind his words. He wanted to use part of Katrina\u2019s parent\u2019s death as part of his story. I couldn't blame him. My name and age were all due to honoring people in my past life. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll go with that. Your mother died in a car accident shortly after you were born.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After we finished our man-to-man chat, as was the case with most children his age, Andrew decided that he\u2019d had enough of me for one day.  So while he got changed and went down to the pool, I decided to pass the time by contacting my family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI logged into New Horizon\u2019s secure site and found the communications page.  The moment the page loaded I noticed that Kelsey was already logged in, so I clicked her name and typed out a message.  <b>Hey sis, it\u2019s me.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million thoughts poured through my mind while I waited for Kelsey to respond; mainly focusing on how supportive she would be.  I didn\u2019t have to wait very long for her response.  <b>Kevin!?  I was wondering when you\u2019d get in contact.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was always the impatient one; I\u2019d only been gone for a few days but she was acting like I\u2019d been gone longer.  <b>Sorry, I\u2019ve been getting used to the new me.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can imagine. There was a brief pause before she typed again. <b>I read some confidential stories online; about how some male clients left the Clinic as women.  Did you?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yes, I did.</b> Unable to resist messing with her, I said, <b>I\u2019m now a 22-year-old aspiring fashion model.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of growing up together had given Kelsey the ability to know when I was messing with her; even over a text message.  <b>Very funny; what did you end up as?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must\u2019ve been a special occasion at the restaurant because while people were eating they came around and took photos.  I logged into my email to download the photo of myself and Andrew.  Before I could write anything about the message, I accidentally pressed the send button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently cursed myself for making that mistake; although that turned into a verbal expletive when I saw Kelsey\u2019s response.  <b>Who\u2019s that adult in the photo?  Mom says he\u2019s cute.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI retched a little bit when I saw that; as I quickly typed out a response to address that error.  <b>That\u2019s me; the young boy is my son Andrew.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a few moments until I noticed someone else logging on \u2013 Mom.  <b>Did you just say that young boy is your son?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yeah, he\u2019s another New Horizons client; they couldn\u2019t place him with a family so they asked if I\u2019d take him. </b>Pausing to take a breath, I continued, <b>Thanks to the wonders of science, he and I are biologically related.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey typed out a response at that point.  <b>I\u2019m glad you said that wasn\u2019t you; it makes me feel better about thinking that he\u2019s cute.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>He\u2019s 12 years old, Kelsey.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>So, I\u2019m 14? I can\u2019t think a younger boy is cute?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis topic was getting too weird for me, so I said, <b>Can we change the subject?  It\u2019s bad enough he thinks you\u2019re cute; I don\u2019t need him learning that you think the same way.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chat continued for a little while longer until Mom said it was time for dinner.  I said goodbye and logged off just as Andrew walked back into the room.  Walking up to me, dripping wet, he said, \u201cDad, can I have some money?  A bunch of us from the pool want to see a movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was amazed by how quickly I went into parenting mode.  Looking at Andrew, I said, \u201cAre there going to be any adults there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this kid\u2019s older sister is going to be there.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cPlease dad, can I go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and walked over to my wallet.  Handing $30 to Andrew, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t spend it all on snacks, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, dad.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I walked off the elevator, and into the bar, just after 6:45.  I didn\u2019t see Diana yet, so I made my way to the bar and ordered a drink.  I was sitting, facing the entrance when I saw two familiar faces walk in \u2013 the busty blonde and the older woman from New Horizons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the busty blonde made her way towards the opposite end of the bar, where a younger man was sitting, the woman saw me staring at her and made a bee-line towards me.  I started to get nervous as she got closer; due in large part to the determined looked on her face.  Without even asking, she took a seat next to me and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I see you at New Horizons today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you did.\u201d Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, which one were you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her drink, the woman looked at me and said, \u201cYou get straight to the point, don\u2019t you?\u201d taking a sip, she said, \u201cI <i>was</i> that 22-year-old man in the corner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know why, but for some reason, I\u2019d suspected that was who the woman used to be.  As much as I wanted the conversation to end, I found myself drawn into it.  The woman, now going by Helena, explained that she was written out of the will by her former family.  She freely admitted that she was a trust fund baby; whose only serviceable skill was throwing parties and sleeping with girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished explaining everything, I was stunned.  People like me and Andrew went to New Horizons to make a better life for ourselves, but Helena had gone there to get back her former lifestyle.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you went to New Horizons for such a selfish reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease sweetie, like you wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing in my position.\u201d Taking a sip of her drink, Helena said, \u201cAs I said, I had no discernible skills so there was no way I\u2019d be able to continue my lifestyle of choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting more annoyed with each passing second; this woman took advantage of New Horizons for her own selfish needs.  I was surprised that she passed the evaluation; that man with the mid-life crisis was more deserving than Helena.  \u201cSo what now; use your looks to bag yourself a rich husband who will pamper you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s it in a nutshell; perhaps I\u2019ll even find a way to get some revenge on my former parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly dawned on me why Helena had come over to me.  \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you thought I would be willing to play along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe thought had occurred to me; but honestly, I was just hoping you\u2019d want to have sex with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could even respond to that absurd proposition, I was interrupted by the sudden appearance of the busty blonde standing next to me with her arms wrapped around some guy from the bar.  \u201cCan I have the room key, mom?  This handsome devil and I want to have a little fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the room key from her purse, Helena said, \u201cHere you go, sweetie; have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two walked off, I turned to Helena and said, \u201cYou two are mother and daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to believe that she used to be a dull, unattractive teenage girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stunned; that busty blonde used to be my former classmate.  I didn't know her that well, but I was more than surprised by the drastic changes she went through.  Before I could say anything, Diana appeared next to me and said,  \u201cHi sweetie, sorry I\u2019m late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena gave Diana a smug, angry look while I got up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I just passed the time talking with this interesting woman.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After a moment, I decided to fudge the truth a little bit.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a mutual friend, but I\u2019ve never spoken to her before now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ordering herself a drink, a smile on her face, Diana said, \u201cIf you ask me, I think she wanted to get better acquainted with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Diana\u2019s face grew when she saw me blushing; I\u2019d be lying if part of me hadn\u2019t found Helena to be physically attractive for her age, but her personality was a big turn off.  As I took a sip of my drink, I found myself thinking about how much things had changed for me in just the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would have imagined, earlier this week, that I\u2019d be a grown man having a drink with an attractive woman old enough to be my mother?  Add to that the fact that I suddenly found myself with a 12-year-old son, and a promising career waiting for me in Chicago, it was safe to say that I was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so caught up in my thoughts that I hadn\u2019t realized Diana was trying to get my attention.  \u201cDavid, eyes up here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d snapping back to reality, I said, \u201cWas I\u2026oh God, I\u2019m so sorry; that was rude of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, no one\u2019s stared at these girls since High School.\u201d Playfully emphasizing her chest, Diana said, \u201cYou were staring more into space than me; I just found that phrase tends to get a man\u2019s attention pretty quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cYou were saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was asking what you did for a living and where home was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an architect; I\u2019m opening a small firm in Chicago next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled when I saw her give an impressed look.  \u201cYou own your own firm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t opened it yet, but I\u2019ve got some possible contracts lined up.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat about you, Diana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI work in advertising; the business side, not the creative side.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m a regional manager for several branches throughout New England and New York; I\u2019m technically based out of St. Louis but I\u2019m traveling 50 weeks out of the year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*******************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana and I spent the evening getting to know each other over dinner.  As time went by I found myself getting more confident, as I would flirt with her and she\u2019d respond in kind.  After a while, I realized it was getting late.  Getting up from the table, I said, \u201cI had a lovely evening, Diana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs did I, David.\u201d Looking directly into my eyes, she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason why it couldn\u2019t continue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart skipped a beat; I knew enough about romance to know what she was implying.  \u201cDo you mean go back to my room and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, if you want to; you\u2019ve been nothing but a gentleman all evening.\u201d Looking at me, seductively, Diana said, \u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, you\u2019ve been driving me crazy all night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t believe my luck; a gorgeous woman wanted to come back to my hotel room \u2013 and it was her idea.  Offering my hand to Diana, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking my hand, Diana pulled me towards the elevator; her hips swaying as she pulled me through the hallway to the elevator.</span></div></div>",

Her breath had a hint of alcohol but it wasn\u2019t overpowering.  Once the elevator reached my floor, I backed out and the two of us ran down the hall to my room like a bunch of teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fumbled briefly with my room key; finally opening the door so Diana and I could enter.  \u201cWow, your room is much nice than mine.\u201d Looking around, admiring the suite New Horizons had given me, Diana said, \u201cDo you mind if I freshen up in your bathroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently nodded as I took a seat on my bed; only pausing to breathe once I heard the bathroom door close.  \u201c<i>Was this happening? </i>\" I thought to myself. \"<i>Can I do this? Is this how adults hook up? Will she be able to tell I'm inexperienced? </i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy concerns were all for naught as the door opened to reveal Diana standing there in nothing my lingerie.  My reaction harkened back to the first time I met her; thinking she was one of the most beautiful women in the world.  \u201cI take it, by your expression, that you like them?\u201d smiling, Diana said, \u201cI bought this especially for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, all I could think to say was, \u201cYou look hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute, you sound like a schoolboy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she meant it to be funny, I took that as a warning \u2013 I needed to watch how I spoke from now on.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cWell you\u2019ve seen my underwear, it\u2019s only fair that I see yours.\u201d Sauntering over, she placed a hand on my waist and said, \u201cDo you need some help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t say a word as she worked on my belt, allowing me to start undressing.  Once I was finished, I sat on the bed in all my glory.   \u201cLook at that; I knew you looked athletic but I didn\u2019t think you were that fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in only my boxers I meekly blushed as I murmured my gratitude. \u201cT-Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m ready; and from the look of things so are you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana leaned over and pushed me down on the bed; as I let my body take over.  We spent the first few minutes kissing each other until we felt it was time.  I was mesmerized by the site of her naked chest; as I\u2019d never seen one up close before.  Letting my body take over once more, I was about to go to work when the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my heart skip a beat when I heard Andrew say, \u201cDad, I\u2019m back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Andrew\u2019s footsteps approaching the bedroom door, which I foolishly forgot to close.  In the meantime, Diana was freaking out.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew walked into the room at that point; covering his eyes as he realized what was happening.  \u201cOh God, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought the worst was over as Andrew left the room; only to realize that wasn\u2019t the case when Diana wriggled herself out from under me and covered herself with a sheet.  \u201cWho was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my son, Andrew; he was at the movies with some kids.\u201d Looking at the clock, I saw that it was 10:45.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I guess I lost track of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou forget to mention you have a son, and all you can say is sorry?\u201d scrambling to get dressed, Diana said, \u201cIs there anything else you haven\u2019t told me?  Like, perhaps, that you're married?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not married; my wife died shortly after he was born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, but having a child is something you might want to tell people about.\u201d Looking at me, hurt, Diana said, \u201cI thought you were better than that, David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve been more upfront; but I usually never get this far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a stretch of course, but I must\u2019ve said something right based on Diana\u2019s expression.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry David, but I...I can\u2019t do this.\u201d Gathering the last of her things, she said, \u201cIt was fun...at first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was alone for a few minutes after Diana left; until Andrew slowly walked in with a nervous look on his face.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry Dad, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Andrew; it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI behaved like an idiot and didn\u2019t think things through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a moment; until Andrew said, \u201cIf it helps, she was pretty hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to reprimand him for saying that, but the smile he had on his face changed my mind.  Shaking my head, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m ready to raise a teenage son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Dad, it\u2019s not my first time.\u201d Sitting next to me, Andrew said, \u201cBesides this time around won\u2019t be as bad; there won\u2019t be drastic physical changes, just a rush of hormones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to lecture him once more, but decided against it.  \u201cWe have an early flight tomorrow; why don\u2019t you get ready for bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew got up and walked into the bathroom to brush his teeth.  After a moment, he came out holding a card in his hand.  \u201cDad, was that woman\u2019s name Diana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding the card to me, Andrew said, \u201cShe left a business card in the bathroom.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As the elevator arrived, I felt a pang of regret when Diana didn\u2019t step out of it.  Memories from the night before flashed through my mind as I stepped inside; memories of how I screwed things up with Diana by not being more open with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator when down the lobby, I looked over and saw Andrew typing away on his phone.  \u201cWho could you possibly be texting at 8:00 in the morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a friend, Dad; don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m your father, Andrew; it\u2019s my job to worry.\u201d As Andrew put his phone away, I said, \u201cWho were you texting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew hesitated for a moment, clearly unsure of what to do next.  After a moment, he said, \u201cPromise you won\u2019t get mad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been his age until quite recently, I knew it was never a good sign when someone said that.  Looking at him, with a stern look on my face, I said, \u201cAndrew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI reached out to my old roommate last night; the one who brought Katrina to the Clinic.  I wanted to say goodbye to her before we left; to show her that I was okay.\u201d Looking at me, Andrew said, \u201cShe\u2019s downstairs in the lobby right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since this began, I found myself justifiably angry with my son.  \u201cAndrew Williams, you should know better than to do that without asking me.\u201d With the sternest voice possible, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want my 12-year-old texting some 20-year-old woman that I\u2019ve never met before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the shocked expression on his face, that wasn\u2019t the reaction Andrew had been hoping for.  \u201cMegan\u2019s not <i>some</i> woman, Dad; she\u2019s my best friend.\u201d Looking at me, Andrew said, \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t think I needed your permission to contact her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re 12 years old, Andrew; everything you do requires my permission.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cRight now I\u2019m more upset about the fact that you gave her sensitive information about yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you seriously think she\u2019ll use that against me?\u201d glaring at me, Andrew said, \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for her, you wouldn\u2019t have a son.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just stared at me, clearly regretting what he said.  After a moment, he finally said, \u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a 12-year-old boy, Andrew; it\u2019s not at all appropriate for a boy your age to be in contact with an older woman.\u201d Sighing, as I knelt in front of him, I said, \u201cHow would Katrina\u2019s father have reacted if she\u2019d done what you did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that my words were influencing him, as tears began to well up in his eyes.  I also noticed a look of defiance as well; a look I knew all too well.  \u201cShe\u2019s the only connection I have left to my past life, dad; she\u2019d never use that information against me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what drove me to do it, but I looked at Andrew said, \u201cKatrina didn\u2019t think her boyfriend would release a sex tape of her, and we both know how that turned out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI regretted saying that the moment it came out of my mouth; especially after Andrew started crying in front of me.  Between tears, his voice rife with anger and sadness, Andrew said, \u201cHow dare you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrew, I-I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d Placing a hand on his shoulder, I said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, son.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew looked at me as I started crying as well.  \u201cI just wanted to say goodbye to her; I didn\u2019t get to do that at the clinic.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLet me talk to her first, okay?\u201d beginning to understand why Andrew did what he did, I said, \u201cIf she\u2019s the kind of girl you say, then I\u2019ll let you say your goodbyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood back up, I saw the anger in Andrew\u2019s eyes slowly turn to hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we checked out of the room, Andrew and I walked through the lobby until he grabbed my arm.  Pointing towards a window overlooking the pool, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s her, dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a petite woman, wearing leggings and a shirt with her college logo on it.  \u201cStay here, Andrew; I\u2019ll go talk to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could even move, Andrew grabbed my hand and prevented me from leaving.  He just looked me in the eye; with the same look of pain and hope still there.  I smiled at him and he let go.  Walking up to the girl, who was looking at her phone, I said, \u201cMegan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatrina?\u201d looking up from her phone, she said, \u201cIs that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not Katrina; my name is David.\u201d Taking a seat across from her, I said, \u201cI asked to meet with you before I allowed you to see my son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan\u2019s eyes furrowed before a look of understanding dawned on them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m Megan Hunt.\u201d Offering her hand, she said, \u201cI brought Katrina to New Horizons to keep her from killing herself.  She was my best friend; both in this life and my last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that I let myself feel at ease \u2013 knowing she was a former client herself made me feel better.  \u201cI need to know that I can trust you, Megan; what are your plans once you learn who Katrina became?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d never tell anyone the truth if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking; I simply want to say goodbye.\u201d Looking at me, Megan said, \u201cI know she\u2019s no longer the Katrina I grew up with; but, with your permission, I\u2019d like to stay in contact with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, my instincts told me that I could trust her.  Turning around, I gestured from Andrew to come over; a big grin on his face as he ran over to us.  As he stopped next to me, I turned to Megan said, \u201cMegan, this is my son Andrew; but you knew him as Katrina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Megan pulled Andrew into a huge hug; which he struggled with for a moment before relaxing.  After a moment, Megan broke the hug and said, \u201cYou look adorable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to look at me, Andrew said, \u201cDad, can I have a minute alone with Megan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Gesturing to a nearby chair, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back briefly as I walked away, only to find them hugging again.  \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for this, Meg; you saved my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was only returning the favor, Kat; after all, I couldn\u2019t let my best friend die when I knew I could save her.\u201d Getting a good look at Andrew, Megan said, \u201cI see you jumped the gender fence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI chose the 12-year-old girl option, but decided to change my gender.\u201d His voice oozing with contempt, Andrew said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want what that asshole did to me to ever happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t a fan of the language Andrew was using, but I understood that he was talking about his former boyfriend.  \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll grow up to be a complete gentleman; you\u2019ll have girls fawning all over you in high school.\u201d Smiling, Megan said, \u201cYou got lucky in the dad department; he must care about you if he\u2019s so protective of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew glanced at me and smiled; turning back to Megan, he said, \u201cYou think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember what Kat\u2019s father was like; I think David is 100x better than he ever was.\u201d Pausing, Megan said, \u201cIs it just a coincidence that the two of you look similar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, it\u2019s not a coincidence.\u201d Smiling, Andrew said, \u201cNew Horizons worked their magic to make me his biological son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in that case, you\u2019re going to be quite handsome when you\u2019re older.\u201d With a grin, Megan said, \u201cYour dad is pretty attractive for his age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t supposed to be listening to their conversation, but I couldn\u2019t help but blush at that remark.  Megan was attractive as well; if I were 15 years younger, I would\u2019ve been all over her.  Megan must have realized that I was listening in because she looked at me and smiled while Andrew said,  \u201cMeg, that\u2019s disgusting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Andrew was getting embarrassed, I decided it was time for me to come to the rescue.  Walking over to them, I said, \u201cSay goodbye, Andrew; we\u2019ve got to head to the airport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears filled both their eyes as Andrew went in for a big hug.  \u201cI love you, Megan; thank you for saving me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let the two of them hug for a moment; until it was time to go.  \u201cAndrew, you\u2019ve got my permission to contact Megan again once we\u2019re settled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time I was the recipient of one of Megan\u2019s hugs; as she embraced me and, without Andrew hearing, whispered in my ear, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the airport wasn\u2019t long; after the shuttle dropped us off, we quickly made our way through security with our carry-on bags.  I\u2019d never flown before, and I\u2019d heard horror stories about airports; so I was relieved to see things were going smoothly.</span></div></div>",

The stewardess came around 20 minutes into the flight with the drink car; I was tired so I ordered a coffee.  After a few sips of the coffee, I decided to rest my eyes for a bit as the clouds passing by outside lulled me to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was awakened about 20 minutes later to the feeling of Andrew poking my arm.  \u201cDad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my eyes still closed, and my voice sounded more tired than I\u2019d meant it to, I said, \u201cYes, Andrew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...um, wanted to thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d suddenly wide awake, I turned to look at him, \u201cFor what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor letting me stay in contact with Megan, it means a lot to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip of the lukewarm coffee, with a bitter after taste in my mouth, I said, \u201cYou two were close, weren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were closer than you might think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said the thought of Katrina and Megan together hadn\u2019t crossed my mind for a brief instant.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said before, Megan was the one that brought me to New Horizons; she explained the entire process to me.\u201d Looking at me, Andrew said, \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering how she knew all that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me some credit, Andrew; I know she was a client.\u201d Seeing the shocked expression on Andrew\u2019s face, I continued, \u201cShe mentioned how you were best friends in both of her lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I was growing up most of my friends thought that I was an only child; I just had a brother they didn\u2019t know about.\u201d Tearing up, Andrew said, \u201cMy brother Jacob was 7 years older than me, he died of cancer when I was 9 years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed an affectionate hand on Andrew\u2019s shoulder as he continued.  \u201cMy parents both worked long hours, so Jacob was the one who took care of me; as a result, he didn\u2019t have many friends.  One day he collapsed at school and doctors told us that he had terminal brain cancer.\u201d Sobbing, Andrew said, \u201cHe tried to hide it as things got worse, but I could tell that he was scared.  One day my mom picked me up with an afterschool program and told me that Jacob had died.  We had a funeral for him; after that, I grew up as an only child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane shuddered momentarily as we went through a patch of turbulence.  \u201cThen came college orientation where I met this girl who I got along with instantly \u2013 Megan.\u201d Looking at me, wiping his eyes, Andrew said, \u201cWe decided to become roommates and she became my best friend.  She always knew just want to say to make me feel better.  That\u2019s how I found out that she used to be my older brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So that\u2019s why Andrew was so upset; he didn\u2019t want to lose his brother again.</i>  Looking at Andrew, I said, \u201cWait a minute; New Horizons has only been open 5 years, how could Megan have gone to them 10 years ago?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess they were looking for test subjects to ensure the procedure was safe; because Megan told me how Mom brought her to some hospital in the dead of night.  The choices were limited back then, apparently, but Jacob chose to become a girl my age.\u201d Sighing, Andrew said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about how I acted earlier; it\u2019s just I didn\u2019t want to lose the only connection to my parents that I had left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can\u2019t fault you for that.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cWho knows, perhaps Megan will be part of our life in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the flight crew announced that we\u2019d begun our descent; it wasn\u2019t long before Andrew and I got our first glimpse of Chicago as we came in over the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing our luggage, and using the bathroom, Andrew and I walked to the long-term parking lot where New Horizons said we\u2019d find our car.

Our house was out in the suburbs, which was nice as it meant we had a yard and some space away from our neighbors. The neighborhood however looked beautiful. Tall trees lined the streets, nice cars in the driveways, and children playing in their yards. I knew Andrew was itching to explore but as of yet we had been busy.  Our house was a blank slate. All walls were white, flooring was unfinished, and no furniture to speak off.  A note in our car had told us that would be the case along with a check for several thousands of dollars. That check was to be used for furnishing the house. There was plenty of money even if Andrew and I spent our money a bit lavishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of picking out materials, and working with contractors to install everything, it was time to go to my new office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy office was several miles from home but an easy commute. Situated still in the suburbs I didn't have to face all of the traffic and commuters heading into the city. As I pulled into my building's parking lot I saw one other vehicle. I was expecting that though. A phone call last night told me I was meeting some New Horizon executives to go over my building and to start designing  theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I parked a middle-aged man and a young woman got out of the car. The man was tall, had thinning hair and a bushy mustache. The woman was slender and looked east Asian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm David Williams, how can I help you folks today?\" I said extending my hand as they approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Arnold Galt, we spoke on the phone last night\" Arnold said as I recognized and shook his hand. \" and this is my associate Miranda Zhang. She will be taking over as head in the chicago branch once we have finalized our project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unlocked the door and led them inside. Arnold began giving me a tour of the building. It felt a little strange being told that something was mine but knowing nothing about it. To top it off  be shown around by a client who made the whole process possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the tour Ms. Zhang, Mr Galt and I were seated in my office. \"We want something modest, something that won't attract too much attention, but it needs to stand out so people realize we are there\" Arnold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What he means is we want something modern looking but subdued. Something where people won't pay attention to the clients who want to use our facility, but won't mistake who we are.\" Miranda said, clarifying Arnold's comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as ideas began to form in my head. \"How about the interior? Do you want things streamlined or compartmentalized? The clinic I attended had me running all over the building, but I couldn't tell you if that was purposefully done by the clinic or poor designs by the planner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold looked thoughtfully at Miranda. \"It's your building Miranda, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smiled. \"Make it streamlined, but I would like separate wings each capable of independent operation, we don't need another Miami\" she said as Arnold nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are limited on space, are you sure you want the building to have wings leading out or would you rather have two separate main halls running parallel with rooms alternating entrances between the halls filling the center? A cross-section hallway could make ease of travel if you need to get to the other hall without needing to backtrack all the way up the trunk.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that better. Could you make up some renderings of some possible designs and give us a few options?\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Ms. Zhang. If you give me a few days to work on it. I should come up with a few suitable designs and be ready to present them next week.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I leave now I can miss the rush hour\" i thought, convincing myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later I was pulling into the garage. It seemed everyone had the same opinion and while I didn't have far to go, cutting across traffic was not fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew im home, are you here?\" I called while entering the house. I saw his book bag at the same time as his reply \"yeah dad I'm in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing homework? I called back seeing his books poking out of his backpack. The sound of his TV was evident from his room. \"Do your work first Andrew then you can play.\" I said repeating the phrase my mother must have told me a billion times. Andrew grumbled down the stairs as I walked to the kitchen. \"oh it can't be that hard, what do you have middle school math?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its pre-algebra\" Andrew sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pre-algebra? Oh, you tested out of your regular math didn't you. Ha, thats hilarious they probably thing your a math genius\u2026. Its almost like you've learned all of this before.\" I teased as he came to the kitchen table with his homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont remember any of it now, dad. But I think because I once did, it comes to me quicker.\" Andrew said  \"besides all my teachers assume that because you're a mathematics guy with all the architecture and engineering and stuff that I am too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably a good thing to let them assume.\" I said throwing in a frozen casserole in the oven. \"Dinner will be ready in an hour. I'll be in the study.\" I told him as I walked out of the kitchen. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been the better part of a month since Andrew and I arrived in Chicago.  The firm was off to a good start, with one more contract apart from New Horizons.  Andrew was doing decent enough in school, although his teachers keep emailing me about a supposed attention problem.  He had made a few friends in the neighborhood and although he has not mentioned anything yet, I am beginning to suspect he might have a crush on a female classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have been in semi-frequent contact with my former family; Kelsey was still coming to terms with the fact that I was now old enough to be her father, while Abigail was constantly trying to give me parenting tips.  I know her heart was in the right place, considering we were both single parents, but I was getting tired of the constant advice.  Put that together with the awkward sexual tension and I found myself having a weird relationship with my former family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Friday before Columbus Day Weekend and I was sitting in the baggage claim of O\u2019Hare International Airport.  It seemed that Megan had a long weekend, so she had asked me a few weeks back if she could fly out to Chicago and spent it with us.  I did not have a problem with it, so I readily agreed to her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was idly checking my phone when I heard a familiar voice holler, \u201cUncle David!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barely had a chance to look up from my phone before I was hugged by Megan.  After a moment, I returned the hug and said, \u201cHow was your flight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty uneventful, although I was sitting next to this really cute guy.\u201d Looking around, running a hand through her hair, Megan said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Andrew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s at home working on a history project.\u201d Grabbing Megan\u2019s bag, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the whole \u2018Uncle David\u2019 thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, with a grin, Megan said, \u201cI dunno; it seemed appropriate at the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me; were your parents okay with you coming out here?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cThey know about Andrew, but they\u2019ve never met me before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we headed towards the baggage claim, Megan said, \u201cThey were a little uncertain at first; but then I mentioned how you were a fellow New Horizon alum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter retrieving a surprising amount of luggage for a 3-day trip, Megan and I made our way to the short-term parking lot.  Once I paid the parking fee, I started driving back to the house while Megan admired the sights as we drove along the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe drove in silence for about 10 minutes before I decided to speak up, \u201cSo, Megan, why\u2019d you pack so much for a 3-day trip?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Megan said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know a lot about girls, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a twin sister before this; but no, I don\u2019t have a lot of first-hand knowledge.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cSo what\u2019s with the luggage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like having a lot of options to choose from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I drove off the highway, I felt like Megan was hiding something from me.  I wanted to ask what was going on but felt it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate; after all, we\u2019d scarcely spoken for more than 20 minutes since we met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate must\u2019ve been on my side; because as I turned onto my street, I saw an unfamiliar car parked in front of the house.  I started to get a little annoyed; thinking perhaps Andrew had invited friends over without asking me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling into the garage, and helping Megan with her bags, I walked into the house ready to confront Andrew.  I heard voices coming from down the hall, so I walked that way.  \u201cAndrew, would you mind explaining\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped midsentence as I walked around the corner into the living room; stopping in my tracks when I saw Kelsey and Abigail standing in front of my fireplace.  Looking at me, Abigail said, \u201cSurprise!\u201d</span></div></div>",

It implied that mom was my sister and I hadn't really considered that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey and Mom moved in for a hug and I felt their embrace. Some of the stress I was feeling melted a way. It was good to see them in person. \"How long are you here for?\" I asked, breaking away from their hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the long weekend. Kelsey has school on Tuesday and a date afterwards.\" Abigail said, as kelsey blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A date?\" I was a bit surprised. I hadn't known Kelsey was interested in anyone. \"With whom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kelsey could answer Abigail answered. \"She started going out with Kyle.\" She gave me a knowing smile before continuing, \" he has been helping out around the house since \"Kevin's\" passing, and grown closer to Kelsey. I think they were comforting eachother after you were gone.\" Then in a fake but stern voice said, \" But he better not comfort you in other ways\u2026 im to young to be a grandma.\" Causing both Kelsey and I blush. I knew and had shared with Kelsey how much of a crush Kyle had on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, not in front of my son\" I said gesturing to Andrew who was looking red in the ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking a bit subdued, she said \"sorry Andrew dear.\" Then turning to me, \"and you should probably stop with the mom talk. You're old enough to be my twin\" a small tear filled her eye again. \"Call me Abigail or Abby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Abby\" I said giving her another hug.  After a moment or two, a gurgling noise could be heard.  Andrew clutched his stomach. \"I guess that means dinner time.\" Seeing Megan standing in the corner and Kelsey and Abby  in front of me I realized my normal planned meal wouldn't feed all of us. \"Well, family\" I said gesturing to everyone, \"do we want to eat-in or eat-out?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, we decided to compromise; Abby and I would go get some pizza to bring back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked down the driveway to my car, Abby took a quick look back at the house before looking at me.  \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s smart leaving Andrew alone with Kelsey and Megan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing to worry about; Andrew promised me that he\u2019d behave.\u201d Getting in the car, I said, \u201cHe said they were just going to sit by the pool and talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she climbed into the car, I got the feeling Abby was going to say something; until she stopped herself.  \u201cI was about to ask what they could possibly talk about; but then I remembered Andrew used to be a girl.\u201d  Looking at me, she said, \u201cThat knowledge is going to make him quite popular with girls at school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Abby as I backed out of the driveway, I said, \u201cAndrew\u2019s only 12 years old, Abby; he\u2019s not ready to start dating yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was settled, the conversation turned to idle chit-chat.  \u201cSo how are things at work, David?\u201d looking at me, Abby said, \u201cWere you and that Ms. Zhang woman able to finalize a plan for her building?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually met with her a few days ago to finalize everything; we break ground next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d Pausing, looking rather uncomfortable about something, Abby said, \u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve made quite a life for yourself out here; who would have thought becoming a 38 year old man with a teenage son was the key to making you happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into the restaurant\u2019s parking lot, I said, \u201cAs I told you already, Abby; raising Andrew wasn\u2019t part of my original plan.\u201d Turning the car off, I looked at her and said, \u201cI probably would\u2019ve been fine without a son; but now that I have one, I can\u2019t see my life without him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was the same way when you and Kelsey were born; I was terrified by the thought of being a parent, until I held both of you in my arms.\u201d Looking at me, with a chuckle, Abby said, \u201cLook at me; it\u2019s been almost three weeks and I\u2019m still talking as if you\u2019re my son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll change in time; it took me a week to stop thinking of you as my mother.\u201d Getting out of the car, I said, \u201cOf course it helped that I\u2019m now only a few months younger than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a smart idea; that might open up a whole new set of problems.\u201d Walking around the car, Abby said, \u201cConvincing myself that you\u2019re still my son is the only thing keeping me from acting on certain...feelings that I\u2019ve been having.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that brought me back to the first time I contacted them, shortly after my transformation.  Prior to learning the truth, Abby had mentioned thinking that I was attractive.  I had hoped those feelings had gone away, but it seems they hadn\u2019t.  What\u2019s more; being around her was causing me to have the same feelings.  \u201cIt\u2019s probably best not to think about that; it would just make things awkward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride back to the house was filled with an awkward silence; neither Abby nor myself said a word the entire ride back.  As we pulled into the driveway once more, hearing music playing in the backyard, I turned off the car and looked at Abby.  \u201cPerhaps it would be best if you and Kelsey stayed at a hotel, Abby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d shocked, Abby looked at me and said, \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re feeling conflicted about your feelings towards me; and, if I\u2019m being honest, so am I.\u201d  sighing, I said, \u201cThe two of you staying at a hotel is probably the only way to keep us from doing something we\u2019ll regret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby was silent for a moment; until she leaned over and kissed me.  I briefly pulled away, startled by unexpected kiss.  But then something happened that surprised both myself and Abby \u2013 I leaned forward and returned the kiss.  We kissed for a moment until a tapping noise behind me broke our concentration.  Abby and I turned to find Andrew standing outside the door with Kelsey and Megan \u2013 all three of their faces in shock.</span></div></div>",

Kelsey was just sitting there; probably wondering what might\u2019ve happened had we not been interrupted.  Once we were finished, <br>\r\nMegan caught my eye and nodded, \u201cHey guys, what do you say we get some ice cream?\u201d turning back to me as she ushered the others towards the door, she said, \u201cUncle David, can I borrow your car?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the keys already in hand, I gave them to her and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving me a brief hug, she looked at me and said, \u201cGood luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it was just Abigail and me, alone in a quiet house.

Grabbing a dirty plate, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not that lazy teenage boy anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail was quiet for a moment; it didn\u2019t take long to realize she\u2019d just given me a once over.  \"I can see that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to look at Abigail. I said, \u201cDid you know that we\u2019re not related anymore?  New Horizon\u2019s process completely changes a person\u2019s DNA.\u201d Looking at her, as small tears formed on her face, I said, \u201cI could\u2019ve become a Black woman, an Asian man, or even a busty blonde if I wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I read all about it before bringing you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that I may have grown up as Kevin; but I also, thanks to new memories, grew up as David as <br>\r\nwell.  The only part of Kevin Scott that stills exists is our memories of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had to watch as they put an empty coffin in the ground; but hearing that makes me realize my son is truly gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rushed to embrace her as I realized I made have been insensitive.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d Holding her close, I said, \u201cI can never repay you for everything you\u2019ve done for me; I\u2019m here, raising a son of my own, because you wanted me to be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us hugged for a few minutes; taking comfort in each other\u2019s arms.  After a moment, she looked up at me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not Kevin, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my head, I said, \u201cNot any longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was going to say more when I was cut off by a kiss on the lips; this time, however, I didn\u2019t hesitate before returning it.

Meeting them halfway, I said, \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t need to come by, I wasn\u2019t going to be here much longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know; but this was on the way, so we decided to stop by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous night, Andrew had expressed an interest in going to the Museum of Science &amp; Industry.  The five of us had planned to make a day of it.  \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; give me a few minutes to lock up, and then we can leave.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We had just finished walking through the mine exhibit when we started getting hungry.  The food court was only a short distance away, so it was decided that we\u2019d head there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others were sitting at a nearby table overlooking the lake, I was waiting in line to pay for the food.  I was minding my own business when I felt a tap on my shoulder, followed by a voice saying, \u201cDavid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it was Megan or Abigail, I turned around only to find myself staring at Diana.  I hadn\u2019t seen or heard from her since that night at the hotel.  Coming to my senses, I said, \u201cDia-Diana, hi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw you looking at the model train diorama earlier; I wanted to come over and say hi, but I saw you were with another woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take a genius to realize she meant Abigail; but it did take me a little longer to recognize the hint of jealously in Diana\u2019s voice.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cOh that\u2019s just my cousin Abigail, she\u2019s out visiting for the weekend with her son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Staying with me as the line moved forward, Diana said, \u201cWhose that older girl with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my niece Megan, she\u2019s also visiting for the weekend.\u201d With a chuckle, I said, \u201cMy house is very crowded at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made idle conversation as continued through the line; neither of us brought up the night at the hotel.  It seemed Diana was in Chicago for a family gathering; she was passing time at the museum before catching a flight back.  Once I paid for the food, I led Diana over to introduce her.  Before I could even say anything, Abigail looked Diana over and said, \u201cWhose this, David?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Andrew blushed slightly giving a small wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone pushed together a little bit more so Diana could have a seat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's business?\" Diana asked. After taking a bite of her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, trying to swallow my food before speaking. \"Things are going well\" I managed to say.  I picked up a few of those prospective clients I mentioned last time we talked. That made opening up my firm go very smoothly. My only hiccup happened today actually. We had a break-in this morning.  I'm not sure if anything was stolen or if it was just an attempt to vandalize but I got that on my plate this week.  What about you? Advertising going well?\" I asked.  I began to block out my surroundings and my family as I listened to Diana speak and tell me about her life. Business was good but her dad wasn't well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm transferring to Chicago. I'll be taking the same position I'm in but will be working in an office a bit more. I start  here before Thanksgiving. It works out great because I can still work but be here for my family when needed at the same time.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up a little straighter as she said she was coming back to Chicago. Abby noticed and raised her eyebrow at me, letting off a small smile showing what I hoped was approval.   \"I'm glad you will be staying in Chicago.  I'm not glad about the reasoning, I hope your dad will recover, ``I said quickly, \" but it's always nice to be near family and friends, ``I said, propping my own eyebrow up. As if I was asking if I was included in her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at me. \"I think I'd like to get together sometime when I am back in town. If you want to give me your number i'll call you next time I'm around.\" She said, as I handed her my business card. \"Thanks.\" She said as she got her wallet out if her purse. She pulled a card out and put mine in its place. \"Here is mine.\" She said handing me her own card.  \"I'm sorry to cut and run. I hope we can catch up and maybe try again next time I'm here. But I got to catch the train, in order to make it to the airport.  It was nice meeting all of you.\" Diana said as she got up to excuse herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched her disappear into the crowd before turning back to the rest of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...who was that?\" Abby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Diana.\" I said answering her question but not her implication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a knockout, good for you Uncle David\" Megan grinned at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled,\" thanks. We've only had one date, and that ended poorly.\" I looked at Andrew who said nothing but blushed. \"It's a miracle she reached out to me in a crowd. I didn't think I'd ever see her again.  Anyways where to next?\" I said stretching my back as I said it.  I was trying not to have to go into the story but I wasn't sure if Kelsey and Abby would drop the subject. \"More museums? aquarium? Shopping on the magnificent mile perhaps?\" I said looking at the girls and Andrew.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kevin is an unhappy teenager, often imagining what it would be like to lead another life. One day his mom and sister give him a gift to do just that - a reservation with New Horizons; a company that specializes in giving people the life they've always dreamed of. There is, however, a catch; if Kevin goes through with this, there's a chance he'll never see his family again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Use proper grammar<br>\r\n2. No descriptive sex scenes (keep it PG)<br>\r\n3. Be creative with storylines but keep close to the original idea.<br>\r\n4. Use the 1st person perspective (I, I'm, I'll, etc) - keep it from Kevin's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will be an outline of the characters.</td>",
