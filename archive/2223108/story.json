            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Have you ever wished you could trade your old, boring life for a brand new one? That was the question posited by the numerous advertisements for a company called <i>New Horizons</i>.  The company started about 5 years earlier; the brainchild of some eccentric millionaire.  The idea behind the company was that if you were unhappy with your current life, or simply bored with it, they\u2019d create a new one tailor-made for you.  The catch was that you\u2019d have to say goodbye to your old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll be honest; there have been times, over the last year or so, that I was very tempted to make an appointment for a consultation.  Now before you get the wrong idea, I love my family very much; so I didn\u2019t take such a serious decision lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lived in a small town in southern New Jersey; probably no more than 20 minutes to the beach and 15 minutes to Delaware.  My dad left years ago, so it was just me, my mom (Abigail), and my twin sister (Kelsey).  I know what you\u2019re probably thinking; what\u2019s so wrong with my life that I\u2019d be tempted to get a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the answer to that is rather complicated.  I wasn\u2019t popular but I\u2019ve had two friends (Kyle Williams and David Beltran) since pre-school.  I wasn\u2019t bullied (much) at school, and my home life was decent enough.  It\u2019s just that, for whatever reason, ever since I turned 13; I just wasn\u2019t happy with my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI often found myself, out in public, watching random people and imagining what it would be like to have their life for myself.  I would never admit to it in public, but there were a few times where I imagined what it would be like to live some random woman\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know; maybe one day I\u2019ll finally have the courage to make that appointment.</span></div></div>",

As I sat up in bed, I noticed the telltale smell of bacon and sausage coming from downstairs.  Today was one of those days where I almost didn\u2019t want to get out of bed; but the smells coming from downstairs, coupled with the fact that I had plans with Kyle and David, were enough to get me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed, I trudged downstairs to the kitchen; to find that Mom and Kelsey were sitting at the table eating breakfast.  I noticed that they were both giving me strange looks as I sat down, but I didn\u2019t think much of it.  That was until I heard them whispering to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlapping some bacon onto my plate, I said, \u201cWould you guys mind telling me why you\u2019re looking at me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Kelsey turned to face each other; after getting a nod of approval from Kelsey, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that you\u2019re unhappy with your life, Kevin.  Everyone knows that you\u2019ve tried your best to put on a happy front, but it\u2019s not working.\u201d  Getting up, Mom retrieved an envelope from the counter.  Handing it to me, Mom said, \u201cThere\u2019s something in <br>\r\nthis envelope that your sister and I think will help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was being cryptic for some reason, but I opened the envelope anyway.  The envelope was of a decent size; so I wasn\u2019t surprised when a pamphlet slid out onto the table.  I was, however, surprised when I saw that it was from <i>New Horizons</i>.  In shock, I looked at Mom and said, \u201cW-What\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you know what it is, sweetie.\u201d Her expression turning sorrowful, Mom said, \u201cRight there is the key to a better, happier life for you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But Mom was right, that wasn\u2019t going to happen now.  \u201cI suppose they deserve to know what\u2019s going on; I\u2019d had to leave them out of the loop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 45-minute drive to the office; so if you want to say goodbye to them, be back here by 10:45.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to leave the kitchen, I barely made it 5 feet before turning around.

We\u2019d known each other since pre-school, so they were well aware of just how unhappy I was with my life.  Arriving at our meeting spot, the fountain in the town square, I rode up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was the first one to see me; waving at me as I got closer.  \u201cHey man, where\u2019s your beach stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to talk, you guys.\u201d Stopping in front of them both, sighing, I said, \u201cSomething\u2019s come up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us went to a quiet area nearby, where I told them everything.  The expressions on their faces mirrored what I\u2019d seen on mom and Kelsey.  Once I was finished, after they\u2019d had a chance to process what I told them, Kyle said, \u201cAre you really going through with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really going through with it.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI have an appointment in a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I know you\u2019ve been unhappy for a while, but I never thought you\u2019d go this far.\u201d Looking at me, David said, \u201cYou realize that you may never see us again, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cYou guys have been my best friends for years; I\u2019ll miss you both so much, but this is something I need to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Kyle nor David was the emotional type, so I was a little surprised when they started tearing up and hugging me.  That got me going as well; the three of us were all crying for a minute or so.  \u201cI love you, man; you\u2019re my brother.\u201d Looking at me, Kyle said, \u201cI want you to know that David and I will be there for Kelsey and your mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, man.\u201d Choking up, I said, \u201cT-That means a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned to leave, David came up to me and said, \u201cPromise me one thing, man; wherever you end up, please lead a happy life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Since it was fairly likely that I wouldn\u2019t be back in town, Mom decided to drive to some of my favorite places in town,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey and mom would take turns reminiscing about some memorable events that happened at each location.  I participated too; I may not have been happy with my overall life, but there were some joyous moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particularly memorable moment that we talked about, was an incident at our 8th birthday.  We had a party in the park, all of our friends came.  Everything was going well until my uncle sat down at the picnic table; the table was off balance and fell over, causing me to get covered in birthday cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom turned towards the highway, Kelsey looked at me and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m never going to have any more memories of you, after today.\u201d Taking my hand, tearing up, Kelsey said, \u201cYou\u2019re my twin brother, my first best friend; wherever you end up, I know in my heart that you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to go through with this, Kelsey; Mom can just turn around and go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe both know that\u2019s not going to happen, Kev.\u201d Sighing, Kelsey looked at me and said, \u201cWe both know what could happen if you don\u2019t go through with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew what Kelsey was getting at; if things got worse for me, what\u2019s to say I wouldn\u2019t resort to suicide somewhere down the line.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI guess that doesn\u2019t leave me with much choice, does it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through her purse, Kelsey pulled out a small envelope.  \u201cI read that they let clients keep some mementos from their former life.\u201d Handing the envelope to me, Kelsey said, \u201cHopefully this will keep you from forgetting where you came from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the envelope, I found that it contained a dozen or so photos; mostly of Kelsey and me.  Holding the envelope close, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll treasure this for the rest of my life, Kelsey.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I stopped briefly as the door closed, looking back at my family for the last time.  <i>You can do this, Kevin.</i>  After waving to them, I turned and walked up to the receptionist counter.  \u201cHi, m-my name is Kevin Scott; I have a noon appointment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist, a cute looking girl in her early 20s, looked at the screen for a moment.  \u201cAh yes, there you are.\u201d Pointing down a long hallway, she said, \u201cGo down the hall to the waiting room, 4th door on the right.  Doctor Harris, one of our intake specialists, will be with you shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Pausing, I turned to her and said, \u201cYou probably can\u2019t tell me; but how often do people my age come through here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 1/3 of our clientele are around your age; ranging from 12 to 20 years old.\u201d Looking at me, before returning to her work, she said, \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is for your happiness; no one here will hold that against you.  I hope you have a good life, Mr. Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking the receptionist, I walked down the hallway towards the waiting room.  As I walked by the glass window, I saw a woman in her mid-to-late 60s sitting inside.  She looked up at me as I walked passed; I could almost swear I saw a look of recognition in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took a seat, a few spaces down from the woman, I grabbed a magazine from the wall.  I was about to open the magazine when the woman got up and took the seat next to me.  \u201cYou\u2019re awfully young to be here, young man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well my life hasn\u2019t been the best.\u201d Sighing, without looking from the magazine, I said, \u201cMy mom and sister thought this would be in my best interest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must\u2019ve been a very difficult decision for your mother to make.\u201d Pausing, the woman said, \u201cIf one of my children said they were coming here, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d handle never seeing them again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to get a little uneasy about the way the woman was looking at me; I didn\u2019t know her, but she seemed to think she knew me.  \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude; but why are you looking at me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a confused look on the woman\u2019s face, but that was quickly replaced by a look of realization.  \u201cHow silly of me; I forgot you wouldn\u2019t recognize me like this.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Helen Collins, but you knew me was Duncan Wilcox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped.  The woman sitting next to me, in her late 60s, just said that she was Duncan Wilcox; the star QB at school during my Freshman year.  He disappeared halfway through the school year; with his family and everyone else thinking that he died in an accident.  But here he was \u2013 a senior woman.</span></div></div>",

I watched as she put on a pair of reading glasses and picked up a celebrity gossip magazine.  \u201cWhat happened to you?  Everyone in town, including your own family, thinks you\u2019re dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured I might as well be; after the accident ruined my knee.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cI\u2019d be able to walk again, but I'd never play football again.  Can you picture Duncan Wilcox not playing football? I sure couldn't.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but this place could\u2019ve made that possible again.\u201d Gesturing to her, I said, \u201cBut why this?  Why become a little old lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness.\u201d Showing me an interview with cast members from a popular show on the CW, she said, \u201cWhy would anyone let their children watch this show?  I heard more foul language in 15 minutes then I would\u2019ve cared to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funny thing was; the show was something that Duncan would have liked.  \u201cWhy become an older woman, Duncan...I mean, Helen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had such fond memories of my grandmother; once I finished  my psychological evaluation, I realized I wanted to be more like her.\" Something in the magazine caught her attention again.  \u201cOh dead, there was so much sex and nudity in this movie.  Whatever happened to leaving it to the audience\u2019s imagination?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she talked, the more I realized they\u2019d altered her personality as well; she was every bit an older woman, complete with the way she talked and acted.  \u201cThat\u2019s what happened to Duncan; but what about your life now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been happier, Kevin; I\u2019ve been married to a wonderful man for almost 2 years now.  In fact, our oldest daughter just gave birth to twins; so I guess that makes me a grandmother.\u201d Pausing, Helen said, \u201cI flew up from Florida last night so I could see my family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell them you\u2019re alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goodness no, they would never accept that.  My father was one of those men are men types; he wouldn\u2019t like that his oldest son is now an older woman.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cNo, I heard through the grapevine that my sister got into Yale; she leaves today and I felt like seeing her off.  The company is providing me with a driver for the day; I\u2019m just waiting for them to get here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re happy, Helen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Kevin; I hope that you find some happiness as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a woman in her 30s, dressed in an impeccable skirt suit, walked into the room.  Stepping towards me, her hand outstretched, she said, \u201cMr. Scott?  I\u2019m Dr. Eliza Harris; would you please come with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently got up and followed her out of the room; as I did, I heard Helen say, \u201cI\u2019m glad they told me she\u2019s a singer; the way she\u2019s dressed, I would have assumed she was a streetwalker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at just how complete Helen\u2019s transformation was; I wondered what they could do for me.</span></div></div>",

The point is, your new tailor-made life begins the moment you leave this building.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it a requirement that I leave my friends and family behind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not; but most of our clientele decide to go in that direction.\u201d Turning serious, Dr. Harris said, \u201cAs you know, there are laws in place to govern this industry; and one of those laws states that you need a signed document, from a therapist, stating that you\u2019re truly unhappy and need a do-over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t aware of that until now.  Wincing, I said, \u201cSo I\u2019ll need to get professional help before I can start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry, Kevin; we\u2019ve got several therapists on staff who can evaluate your view of your current life.\" Calmly, Dr. Harris said. \u201cUnderstand that once you go through with this, there\u2019s no turning back.  That\u2019s why we need to be absolutely certain that this is what you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see one of your therapists, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Standing up, a smile on her face, she said, \u201cI believe Dr. Willard is free; she\u2019s one of our more thorough therapists.\u201d</span></div></div>",

One of them, a petite red-head, looked to be about 7 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all glanced at me as they walked past; no doubt realizing what I was here for.  I threw them a casual wave as Dr. Harris stopped in front of a door that said <i>Evaluation Department</i> on it.  She opened the door and we walked inside a small room, slightly bigger than the waiting room; consisting of a sitting area and three doorways leading into offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll but one of them was closed, as Dr. Harris me towards it.  A quick glance through the door showed an attractive woman sitting behind a desk, looking at something on her computer.  I found it interesting that every employee I\u2019d seen here so far was a woman.  Knocking on the open door, Dr. Harris said, \u201cMiranda, do you have a moment?\u201d gesturing to me, Dr. Harris said, \u201cI have a potential client in need of an evaluation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I could use a break from this anyway.\u201d Looking up from her computer, sighing, Dr. Willard said, \u201cWho knew booking a wedding venue 2 years in advance was so time-consuming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Willard got up to walk over to us, Dr. Harris said, \u201cMiranda Willard, this is Kevin Scott; a 15-year-old boy who is, as his mother said, perpetually unhappy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met a teenager yet who didn\u2019t seem to be perpetually unhappy.\u201d With a brusque tone, Dr. Willard said, \u201cHello, Mr. Scott; it\u2019s my job to determine whether or not you qualify for our services.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you get to it, then.\u201d Stepping towards the doorway, Dr. Harris looked at me and said, \u201cGood luck Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dr. Harris closed the door, Dr. Willard pointed towards her couch.  \u201cHave a seat, Mr. Scott; let\u2019s get right into it, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour and two boxes of tissues later, Dr. Willard and I were both struggling to regain our composure.  I went into detail about how I loved my family and friends but felt that the life I had wasn\u2019t the one for me.  Dr. Willard, far from the brusque and seemingly combative person I thought she was; turned out to be a caring and understanding woman.  Dr. Harris wasn\u2019t kidding about her being thorough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter signing some paperwork, Dr. Willard turned to me and said, \u201cI want to apologize, Kevin, for putting you through all of this; but, as you were told earlier, we have to be certain this is the best course of action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably noticed that I was entering your answers into my computer; we have a program that uses that information to come up with four possible new identities for our clients.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cBefore I show you the results; you\u2019re able to change certain aspects.  For example, one of your possible choices is that of a 5-year-old girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time I\u2019d been answering those questions, I found myself wondering if something like that was a possibility.  Looking at Dr. Willard, I said, \u201cReally?  One of my options is a little girl\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Dr. Willard continued, \u201cNow say you want to be a 3-year-old girl, or even a 5-year-old boy; we can change that.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cJust know; once you make your decision, it can\u2019t be undone.  You\u2019ll be brought down to the hall to one of our Life <br>\r\nDesigners; where you\u2019ll help design your new life from the ground up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was definitely far more to this than I thought, but it wasn\u2019t enough to scare me off.  I deserved to be happy, after all.  Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to see my options, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Willard silently turned her computer monitor towards me; on the screen, I saw four options to choose from:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A - 5-year-old girl<br>\r\nOption B - 13-year-old boy<br>\r\nOption C - 26-year-old woman<br>\r\nOption D - 37-year-old man<br>\r\nOption E - 53-year-old woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a fair amount of time to come to a decision; after all, the life I chose would be mine for the rest of my life.  After what seemed like an eternity, but was in fact only 5 minutes, I looked at Dr. Willard and said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go with _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s perfectly normal; after spending their first life as one gender, many clients want to spend the next life as the other.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cFor people in your position, who choose to become young children again, see it as an opportunity to make different life choices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that makes sense.\u201d Shrugging, I said, \u201cI mean; there\u2019s nothing more different from a 15-year-old boy than a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you still have your doubts; one of my colleagues in <i>Life Design</i> was born male.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIf she\u2019s willing to do so, perhaps she\u2019ll tell you her story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it would be nice to talk with someone with firsthand experience.\u201d Thinking back to my conversation with Helen, I said, \u201cI met an older woman in the waiting room, who I knew from school.  She told me a little about her new life, but was more focused on critiquing the latest trends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, Helen Collins.\u201d Nodding, Dr. Willard looked at me and said, \u201cShe chose one of our most extensive personality alterations; I\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any remaining personality traits from her old life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe seems perfectly happy though, so I guess that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one more thing we need to figure out before I bring you down to Life Design.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cYou need to pick a name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike first and last?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just the first name.\u201d pausing, Dr. Willard said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re becoming a young child, we\u2019re going to place you with a pre-determined family.  They\u2019ll raise you as their daughter, and in time you\u2019ll come to think of them as your parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something I hadn\u2019t thought about; I would need parents as a little girl.  I certainly wasn\u2019t going to do all of this to end up on the street or in foster care.  Leaning back in the chair, once again, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been 100% sure why, but I\u2019ve always liked Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, Sophie; it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s only fair to warn you; from here on out, everyone you meet here will converse with you as a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I suppose that\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the file from her desk, Dr. Willard got and said, \u201cOkay Sophie, sweetheart, let\u2019s go design your new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned a bit as I got up; rolling my eyes as I followed behind Dr. Willard.  She wasn\u2019t kidding when she said they\u2019d talk to <br>\r\nme like I was already a little girl.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As she took her seat behind her desk, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cYou know me: always willing to share.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Turning to me, Dr. Willard said, \u201cIt was lovely to meet you, Sophie; I wish you nothing but happiness in your new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a seat as Dr. Willard left the room.  Once it was just the two of us, I looked at Mrs. Cummings and said, \u201cYou used to be a man?  What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a big argument with my daughter, and I realized I wasn\u2019t seeing things from her point of view.  So I came here, to New Horizons, and became a 22-year-old woman.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cNow I work here, helping to give people the same second chance that I got.  I\u2019ve even got myself a wife and a baby on the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Mrs. Cummings gently stroked her belly.

Looking at Mrs. Cummings, I said, \u201cYou must be so happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cummings nodded, before saying, \u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed, though; I was hoping for a little girl.

I should\u2019ve realized how much work would be involved, but I was still thrown off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that we worked on was my physical appearance; with some input from Mrs. Cummings, I settled on blue-green eyes with strawberry-blonde hair that reached just above my shoulders.  One thing that I suggested, which I always thought looked adorable on little kids, was a smattering of freckles on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was done, we turned to my height; I didn\u2019t want to go overboard, so I decided on the typical height for a 5-year-old girl \u2013 just shy of 3\u00bd feet.  It seemed trivial to me, but one of the options that Mrs. Cummings asked was whether I wanted to be left or right-handed.  Since I was already undergoing a drastic change, I decided to take it one step further and change from right to left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all that was finished, we waited for Mrs. Cummings\u2019 computer to create a rendering of what I\u2019d look like.  \u201cOkay, Sophie; so what the computer is doing right now is taking all the answers you gave me and using that to create a picture of what you\u2019ll look like as a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been a good sport up to this point, but I was starting to get annoyed by Mrs. Cummings' efforts to dumb down everything she said.  I took a semester of Animation 101 my freshman year; I knew what a computer rendering was.  But I figured it was only wise to play along; after all, I was going to be a little girl soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer beeped after another few minutes.  Mrs. Cummings looked at the computer and I saw a smile form on her face.  \u201cSophie, sweetie, you\u2019re going to be one adorable little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to blush, I said, \u201cR-Really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the computer monitor to show me, she said, \u201cSee for yourself, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned forward to get my first look at the little girl I\u2019d soon become.  To say I was floored would have been the understatement of the century; I was stunned by what I saw on the screen before me. The little girl on the screen, wearing a green dress, was downright adorable.  Tearing up, I brought a hand to my mouth.  \u201cT-That\u2019s going to be me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Sophie; that\u2019s going to be you.\u201d Handing me some tissues, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cWe just have to figure out what kind of girl you want to be, then I\u2019ll bring you down the hall to the procedure room.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I even started skipping at one point; I wasn\u2019t even a little girl yet, and I was subconsciously acting like one.  We stopped outside a door marked <i>Transfigurations</i>. After knocking twice on the door, Leslie opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a woman about the age I\u2019d soon be; professional except for her bubblegum pink hair. \u201cSophie, sweetie, this is Dr. Lizzie Weintraub; she\u2019s going to turn you into a little girl.\u201d Handing the woman the drive, Leslie said, \u201cLiz, this little sweetheart is Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Sophie; I\u2019m so glad that I could be here to help you.\u201d  Plugging the drive into a computer, she said, \u201cDid Mrs. Cummings explain to you what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t, and I had forgotten to ask.  Shaking my head, I said, \u201cNo ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst I\u2019m going to give you something help you sleep, then some teeny-tiny robots will go in and make you into a little girl.\u201d taking my hand. Dr. Weintraub said, \u201cNow say goodbye to Mrs. Cummings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently waved bye to Mrs. Cumming as Dr. Weintraub led me into another room.  Before the door closed, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cGood luck, Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding me a hospital gown to wear, Dr. Weintraub said, \u201cYou\u2019ll wear this for now; when you wake up, you\u2019ll be wearing something more appropriate for your size.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cDo you need a moment before we begin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I went to change behind a curtain, I said, \u201cNo ma\u2019am, I\u2019ve already said all my goodbyes; I\u2019m just ready to get started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing, I handed my things off to Dr. Weintraub, who said, \u201cIs there anything here that you\u2019ll want to keep?  Otherwise, we\u2019ll send it back to Kevin\u2019s family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the photos, I said, \u201cMy sister gave me an envelope with some photos, I\u2019d like to keep that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly found the envelope and placed it in a plastic container by the door. As I climbed onto the bed, she ran an IV into my arm.  After that came what I assumed was the nanites.  With the sedative starting to take effect, Dr. Weintraub said, \u201cSleep tight, Sophie.  When you wake up, you\u2019ll be Sophie all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving me a quick peck on the cheek, she dimmed the lights and left the room. I then closed my eyes and let the sedative do its work, so the nanites could do theirs.</span></div></div>",

Looking at me, a spoonful of cereal in her hands, she said, \u201cSo, what you do yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying around a little with my cereal, I said, \u201cI played basketball with David and Kyle; they let me win a few times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Smiling, Kelsey said, \u201cWhat else happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe went to the mall.\u201d  <i>Was my voice getting higher?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly unfazed by the changes in my voice, Kelsey continued, \u201cWhat else did you do, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sweetie?</i>  \u201cThen we went swimming; I was ascard of the pool, but Kyle stayed with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy voice was higher, and getting higher with every sentence.  Oddly, Kelsey didn\u2019t seem to notice; she just continued asking me what I did yesterday.  After I was finished with breakfast, I brought my dishes to the sink.  However, when I got there, I found that I was too short to see over the counter; I had to get up on my tippy-toes to do it.  <i>How was I supposed to do the dishes like this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing up from behind me, Kelsey said, \u201cI\u2019ve got this, sweetie.\u201d Taking the dishes from me, still the same size as before, she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go pick out a movie for us to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching the movie, the two of us went to the park.  Kelsey pushed me on the swing and let me feed the ducks; we had fun.  Back home, Kelsey ordered us a pizza.  I was bummed that it was a small pizza until I realized I couldn\u2019t even eat <i>that</i> by myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pizza, we played Candy Land until it got dark.  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for bed, sweetie; it\u2019s time for your bath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly filled with energy, I ran upstairs to the bathroom and got undressed.  It didn\u2019t faze me at all that I was a girl.  As I sat in the bath, playing with some toys while Kelsey washed me, I looked at her and said, \u201cWill I get a chest like yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour time will come, kiddo.\u201d Giggling, she said, \u201cJust give it a few years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce my bath was done, Kelsey dried me off and I got into my favorite pink pajamas.  She then tucked me in and read me a bedtime story.  Once that was over, feeling drowsy, I said, \u201cGood night, Kelsey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing me on the forehead, Kelsey said, \u201cGood night, Sophie.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t help but be amazed by how tiny my hands had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, I quickly realized that I wasn\u2019t in Dr. Weintraub\u2019s lab anymore; instead, I was in a hotel room.   \u201cThis is a nice room,\u201d I said; giggling at the sound of my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted a clock on the table next to me; I tried to read it but found that I couldn\u2019t tell time anymore.  I had no idea what 7:45 meant; although judging from the sunlight, I figured I had slept through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mouth tasted icky after sleeping for so long, so I decided to brush my teeth.  Pulling the sheets back, I giggled again at the sight of my little feet.  Climbing out of bed, I ran into the bathroom; where I found a stool sitting in front of the bathroom sink.  Stepping up on the stool, I got my first look at my new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all there; my strawberry-blonde hair, my blue-green eyes, and my freckles.  I\u2019d seen it all before on Mrs. Cummings' computer, but this was different \u2013 this was <i>real</i>.  <i>I</i> was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started brushing my teeth and was halfway through when I realized I\u2019d been using my left hand.  I was just finishing up when I heard a knock on the door.  In the distance, I could hear Dr. Harris say, \u201cSophie?  Are you up, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull of energy, I practically ran to the door.  \u201cI\u2019m up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and I saw Dr. Harris enter; along with Dr. Willard, Mrs. Cummings, Dr. Weintraub, and another woman, with tattoos on her right arm. Dr. Harris had a cupcake with her, with a candle shaped like a number 5 in it. Once everyone was in the room, they all sang \"Happy Birthday.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d never been particularly excited about getting presents but now it was different.  Before anyone could stop me, I tore into the box and saw that it contained a pretty lavender-colored dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding it up, a smile on my face, I said, \u201cIs this for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is all for you, sweetie.\u201d Smiling, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cA pretty girl like you deserves a pretty dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tattooed lady, who I still didn\u2019t know, handed me the bag.  \u201cThis is for you too, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly grabbing the bag, I opened it and found that it contained a teddy bear.  I instinctively grabbed it and hugged it tightly.  \u201cI can\u2019t thank you all enough for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d Looking at everyone, I said, \u201cFor the first time in a long time, I\u2019m truly happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, Dr. Harris and the others left; leaving only myself in the room with Mrs. Cummings and the tattooed lady.  They took a seat on the couch, sitting awfully close to each other, as they gestured for me to join them.  Gesturing to the tattooed lady, Mrs. Cummings said, \u201cSophie, sweetie; this is Grace, my wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little bashful, I looked at Grace and simply said, \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you, Sophie.\u201d Smiling, Grace said, \u201cLeslie told me about how you were unhappy in your former life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKevin\u2019s daddy left when he was 8 years old.\u201d Frowning, I said, \u201cHis Mommy raised him and his sister on her own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy being a single parent.\u201d Sighing, Leslie said, \u201cLord knows I didn\u2019t do a good job of it the first time around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, you have to stop beating yourself up over that; it\u2019s in the past.\u201d Looking at Leslie, Grace said, \u201cAll you have to do now is focusing on being an amazing mother to our unborn son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us talked for a while after that; for some reason, they kept talking about how great they\u2019d be as parents.  After a while, they suggested we all spend the day together.  I jumped at the opportunity because it would give me a chance to wear my new dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s how I ended up leaving the hotel, which turned out to be only a short distance from the beach, with Grace and Leslie.  I held both of their hands as we walked down the sidewalk; we got some looks from people, but we didn\u2019t care.</span></div></div>",

We did, however, get some food and drinks at the pavilion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, we walked down the street together.  In addition to them buying me more clothes, I got a chance to see the two of them together.  I could tell that they loved each other; and it wasn\u2019t just the hugs and kisses.  It was how they spoke to, and looked at, each other.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel they\u2019d both be sad had Mrs. Cummings not become a woman. <i>Their baby\u2019s coming to a house of love.

You've swept me off my feet, and nothing would make me happier than to be your mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit me how much my life had changed in just two days. When I woke up yesterday, I was a teenage boy, with a single mom and a twin sister. Then they took me to New Horizons, and I designed myself to be a little girl. When I woke up this morning, I was that little girl. Sure, I said I wanted two parents, but I meant a mommy and a daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr did I? I remembered what I thought just this morning: <i>Their baby's coming to a house of love. I hope I can find a home like that.</i> Well, here it was, exactly what I wished for. They loved each other, and they loved me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like yesterday, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life. I went to them, wrapped one arm around each of them, and said, \"Mommy! Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hugged me back, and then Mommy Leslie said \"Ooh!\" and touched her belly. \"Your little brother wants to celebrate, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put my hand on her belly, and I felt my baby brother kicking. \"So, do I get to come home with you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite yet, honey,\" Grace said. \"We've got to tell New Horizons, so they can get the paperwork done. We've also got to make our second guest bedroom into something a little more like a little girl's bedroom. But that shouldn't take too long, and then we'll bring you home with us. In the meantime, do you think you can stay in this suite at least one more night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed like it was a joke, but I was serious. I wanted to go home with my two new mommies, not stay in a hotel room, even one as nice as this. But I knew they had to get their home ready for me. After all, they were getting ready for my little brother, and they knew about him before they knew about me.</span></div></div>",

Not because of the distance, but because of the wait. \"Anticipation,\" Mommy Grace called it. She was driving, because Mommy Leslie didn't like putting her belly behind the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there,\" Mommy Leslie promised. \"This is our street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took interest in the street, so I would know it when I was walking around. \"The trees look kinda like hearts,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Leslie looked out her window. \"Now that you mention it,\" she said, \"they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Grace looked. \"I know. See the power lines? The trees grew up to the lines, then grew out on either side. That's why they've got a heart shape to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFinally, we pulled into the driveway, and Mommy Grace hit a button to open the garage door. Inside, I saw two big bikes, and one little girl's bike with training wheels. \"Mommy Leslie doesn't ride much right now,\" Mommy Grace said. \"But you and I can ride together. And I'm sure you can't wait until the training wheels are off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, my mommies showed me around. There was the family room, where we would watch TV; the dining room, where we would have special dinners; the breakfast room, where we would eat most of the time; and the kitchen. There was a bathroom, and a hall leading to Mommies' bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a different direction was another hall, with three doors. One was another bathroom. Another had a crib and a rocking chair. The door at the end was closed, and had letters on it. \"S-O-P-H-I-E,\" I read. \"Sophie. That's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your room, Sophie,\" Mommy Leslie said. \"Take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a big room, with a bed, a dresser, and a closet. There were a table and chairs in one corner, all set for a tea party. There was even a guest already, a doll whose package said her name was Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bookcase with picture books and storybooks. On top of the bookcase was a pair of shoes. \"Ballet slippers,\" Mommy Leslie said. \"Once you're all settled in, we'll sign you up for lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mommies,\" I said, hugging them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was home.

That means, in an hour and a half, what time will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"12:00!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. And, since it's 10:30 in the morning, that means that 12:00 has another name. At night, we call it midnight; during the day, we call it noon. So, since lunch is at noon, how long is it until lunchtime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An hour and twenty-nine minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed. \"The time on the clock changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?

But unfortunately, we had to leave; so I walked with the rest of the class to the pickup area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was one of the last ones to leave, so Mrs. Detweiller had us stick together until our parents showed up.

I looked really pretty in it.  Once that was done, I joined the others on the floor in one of the rooms; where we waited for our teacher to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven everything that\u2019s gone on today, I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when Kelsey walked into the room behind the teacher.  After introducing herself, the teacher turned to Kelsey and said, \u201cMs. Scott is one of my advanced students; she\u2019ll be helping me teach this class.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cKelsey, why don\u2019t you tell the children about yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forward, Kelsey said, \u201cWell, like Ms. Sullivan said, my name\u2019s Kelsey; I\u2019m 15 years old, been doing ballet for 9 years and cheerleading for 3.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI actually got into ballet on a dare; growing up I was a bit of a tomboy and my twin brother, Kevin, said I couldn\u2019t do <i>anything</i> feminine.  Well the jokes on him; because I\u2019ve performed the lead in the last two recitals and I\u2019m co-captain on the cheer squad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn to be upset; it\u2019s only been a few days since I left, but I could tell that Kelsey was struggling to hold herself together.  I wanted nothing more than to go up and tell her who I was, but I knew it wasn\u2019t the right time for that.  After that, we all introduced ourselves before we got down to doing some exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was standing up against the wall, a short time later practicing standing on my toes, when Kelsey came up behind me.  \u201cYou\u2019re <br>\r\ndoing a very good job, Sophie; but you might want to work on strengthening your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Ms. Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Kelsey.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cAren\u2019t you the little girl with the two moms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you looked familiar.\u201d Kneeling in front of me, Kelsey said, \u201cYou remind me a lot of myself at your age; I was a natural at ballet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting, Kelsey; I\u2019m right here.  As I looked at her, I found it difficult not to just come out and say that I was her brother.  But, once again, I knew the time wasn\u2019t right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce class ended, Kelsey walked me over to Mommy Leslie and said, \u201cMa\u2019am, you\u2019ve got a wonderfully talented little girl here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful of you to say.\u201d Smiling, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cShe was very nervous about starting this class, but I\u2019m glad to see it was all for nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting bored with the conversation, I said, \u201cMommy, can we get ice cream on the way home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, sweetie; Mommy Grace and I have plans with some friends tonight, so we need to get home.\u201d Pausing, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of last minute, so I hope I can find a babysitter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words had barely left Mommy Leslie\u2019s mouth when Kelsey said, \u201cI can babysit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Mommy Leslie said, \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something special about your little girl, ma\u2019am; something I can\u2019t quite put my finger on.\u201d Sighing, Kelsey said, \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not exactly looking forward to going home right now; my mom\u2019s been pretty depressed the last few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was torn; between wanting to spend time with Kelsey, and not wanting to.  Before I could make my opinion known, Mommy <br>\r\nLeslie said, \u201cOkay then; call your mother and let her know, then I\u2019ll bring you both to the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Tousling my hair, Kelsey said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have fun, Sophie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kelsey ran off, Mommy Leslie looked at me and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey was my twin sister.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sophie's bedtime is 8:30, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Mrs. Cummings,\" Kelsey said. \"Any medical issues I should know about? Y'know, like food allergies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nary a one,\" Mommy Leslie said. \"You've got our phone number, in case of an emergency. There are frozen dinners in the freezer. And don't let her play with the tablet for more than an hour.\" She turned to me. \"You'll be a good girl for Kelsey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mommy.\" What Kelsey didn't know was that being a good girl included not telling her that I used to be the twin brother she was mourning. If she figured it out for herself, that was okay, but I wasn't supposed to lead her to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got a hug and a kiss from each of my mommies, and then they said goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were gone, Kelsey asked, \"What do you want to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna see my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI led her to my room and showed her around. \"This is my dresser. I got most of my clothes in here. This drawer is for my ballet things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. I keep my ballet things apart from my other clothes, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I already knew that. It was where I got the idea. But I didn't say so. \"Sometimes I come in this corner to read one of my books, or play on Mommy's tablet. And sometimes, I have tea parties with Anna. That's her right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Anna. Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dress-up clothes are in the closet, for if I'm going to a party, or if I feel like being a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my toy chest. This on top is my new baby dolly. She drinks, cries, and wets. I got her for if I get bored when my mommies have to take care of my baby brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your mommies as examples, I'm sure you'll be a wonderful mommy, yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought us to my bed, with my Frozen 2 pajamas laid out for me. \"This is Teddy. He sleeps with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delighted, Teddy.\" She reached for the table drawer, where I kept the pictures she gave me before I became Sophie. \"What's in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed the drawer shut again. \"That's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said, backing away. \"I didn't mean to pry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you. So, that's my room. What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about an hour before your supper. I'll let you play with the tablet, then call you when supper's ready. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when she called me to supper, I saw that an hour had gone by. I gave her the tablet (no gadgets at the table, anyway), and sat down for my supper, which was chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper, we watched a movie. Well, <i>I</i> watched the movie. Kelsey did her homework. When the movie was over, Kelsey played Candy Land with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kelsey said, \"It's getting close to your bedtime. We'd better give you a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelsey washed me, I said, \"I had fun today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you did,\" she said. \"My twin brother stopped having fun a while back, and he got really sad from it. I wouldn't want you to be sad like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good ballet teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed my forehead. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she dried me off, I put on my pajamas and got into bed. Kelsey tucked me in, then she read me <i>The Little Engine That Could</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Kelsey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slept for a little while, until my mommies came in, and they kissed me goodnight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the first week of school, Amelia, Scott, and I became good friends. I introduced them to both my mommies when either one would come pick me up. They introduced me to their parents, and the parents started talking about a playdate for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't get along at all with Danny Maher, though. That was clear in the second week of kindergarten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Detweiler had us drawing pictures with crayons, and I was drawing a picture of my family. I was really focused on my picture, and I barely heard when Mrs. Detweiler said, \"Danny, back to your picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did notice, though, when Danny pulled my hair. I swung out the back of my hand, and definitely hit him. Mrs. Detweiler separated us before it got any further, and took Danny to the principal's office. I figured that was the end of it, and went back to my picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine my surprise when Mrs. Detweiler came to me and said, \"The principal wants to talk to you, Sophie. Your moms are on their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't understand why I was in the principal's office. Danny Maher started it. Why was <i>I</i> in trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I started worrying about what my mommies would do. Would they take away my toys? Maybe decide I couldn't be in ballet anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mommies finally came. \"Good afternoon, ladies,\" Principal Pasternak said. \"I'm sure you're wondering why I called you. Your little Sophie has gotten herself into an altercation with another student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it happen?\" Mommy Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He pulled her ponytail, and she hit him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand,\" Mommy Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did I lose you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said Sophie got herself into trouble. Then, you told us a story where she defended herself. Draw me a map from the one point to the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Cummings, we teach non-violence in this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a laudable goal, but Sophie is the victim. She should not be treated as if her actions are equal to those of the boy who attacked her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed with relief. Mommy Grace understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Cummings,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're aware of the statistics linking childhood bullying and abusive relationships later in life. Don't you want to protect your students from that situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Pasternak sighed. Mommy Grace had him boxed in. \"Perhaps I overreacted in this case.\" Turning to me, he said, \"I'm sorry, Sophie.\" Turning to Mrs. Detweiler, he asked, \"Can she return to class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're about to dismiss for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dismissed, Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to tell him that,\" Mrs. Detweiler said, as she walked us back to kindergarten. \"But he insisted it was the principle of the thing. No pun intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Leslie chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dealt with my share of guys like that in the army,\" Mommy Grace said. \"Between that and the reading I've been doing getting ready for the baby, I was ready for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Mrs. Detweiler said, \"if he thought that Sophie was starting trouble, he should've seen me growing up. I was quite the little hel - I mean, troublemaker as a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding,\" Mommy Leslie said. \"I still remember the time you decided to cut a girl's hair with safety scissors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Detweiler stopped. \"Where did you hear about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Grace bent down to me. \"I think Mommy just put her foot in it.\"</span></div></div>",

But now it's all out in the open, so I guess I have to ask: What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Detweiler was quiet for a while, just looking Mommy Leslie in the eyes. Finally, she walked over and gave her a hug. \"I can't forget the things you said and did,\" she said. \"But, for the sake of my child, and your children,... I can, and I do, forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Leslie kissed Mrs. Detweiler on the cheek. \"Thank you, Sara. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of them cried for a while, with Mommy Leslie taking longer to stop, because of the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mrs. Detweiler stopped crying, she turned to Mommy Grace and asked, \"Did you go to New Horizons, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Grace shook her head, and held up her tattooed arm. \"This is the only customization I've undergone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Detweiler knelt in front of me. \"You, Sophie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to start over.

I was a total nervous wreck, and blabbed everything to her. Darn near scared her off. But she gave me a second chance, and we haven't looked back since. I'm so lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lucky's the word, alright,\" Emily said. \"Sara had a rougher time of it.

I guess it was a little more raw for her than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was in the bottle?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pills. I was in a bad place inside. The only parent I'd ever known said he didn't love me anymore, so I felt like nobody loved me. After... after that, I realized that I didn't really want to die, so I called for help. Emily came, I got therapy, and the rest is history. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. My mommy from before and my twin sister, they were ascared that I was going to a bad place. So they took me to New Horizons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I forgot you told me about that.\" She gave me a side hug. \"I just thought of something: My dad is your mommy, right? That kind of makes me your big sister, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can't let anybody else know about this. That would mean your mommy's privacy, and my job. So, during school, I'll be Mrs. Detweiler, and, when school is out, I'll be Sara. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went back to the living room, where Mommy Grace was holding Mommy Leslie, and Emily was looking like she knew she did something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara sat down next to Mommy Leslie. \"My therapist told me something very clever,\" she said. \"He said I should write a letter to you, detailing everything you did that I didn't like. Then, I should take the letter and burn it. It worked, too: I realized that the reason those feelings haunted me was because I was carrying them. Once I put them out and let go of them, they didn't have any power over me. I was free to build my life, the way I wanted. I actually heard the chains breaking, and I knew I could be a better person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I hurt you, baby,\" Mommy Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for what I said,\" Emily said, coming closer to us. \"I'm sorry, to all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I threatened to leave you, Grace,\" Mommy Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I accused you of rushing into everything,\" Mommy Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all stood there, hugging each other, until it was time for Sara and Emily to go.</span></div></div>",

I'd had two more ballet classes; in which I found out that I was a quick learner.  I spent most of my time at school hanging out with Amelia and Scott; the three of us had quickly become inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy Grace was busy with something from school, while Mommy Leslie had dinner plans with Mrs. Detweiller; so I wasn\u2019t surprised when I got off the bus to find Kelsey waiting for me at the bus stop.  I quickly ran up and hugged her, yelling, \u201cKelsey! Kelsey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, kiddo.\u201d Kneeling in front of me, Kelsey said, \u201cHow was school today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was fun!\u201d holding up a piece of paper, I said, \u201cI drawed a photo of my mommies and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, we should put that on the fridge for them to see, shouldn\u2019t we.\u201d Taking my hand, Kelsey said, \u201cI\u2019ve got some snacks waiting for you at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked up the street to my house, I found myself thinking about how much my relationship with Kelsey had changed \u2013 we\u2019d gone from being twins to me being a little girl that she babysat for.  Of course, it helped that she didn\u2019t know that I had been her brother.  Mommy Leslie had emailed Kelsey and her mommy a few days earlier; telling them that I was safe and happy with my new family \u2013 while not going into too much detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shortly after 4:30 and I had just come in from playing in the backyard; all covered in dirt and mud.  Kelsey was sitting at the kitchen table, working on homework, when she saw me standing there.  \u201cWe should probably get you cleaned up, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a bath where a fair amount of water ended up on the bathroom floor; thanks, in large part, to Kelsey and me splashing each other.  Once we were both dried off, she carried me down the hall to my bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that I felt a lump in my throat; the drawer where I kept my photos was wide open.  It wouldn\u2019t have been a problem had the drawer not been next to my dresser, where Kelsey was rummaging to find an outfit for me to wear.  After choosing a pair of shorts and a Paw Patrol shirt, Kelsey was closing the dresser drawers when she noticed the photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to panic as she placed my clothes on the bed and took out the photos.  Looking them over for a moment, she looked at me and said, \u201cWhere did you find these, Sophie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I\u2019d given a lot of thought to what I would say in this situation.  At that moment, I was terrified \u2013 both because I\u2019d been caught and because I was afraid of how Kelsey would react.  As I started tearing up, I looked at her and said, \u201cYou gave them to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey just stared at me in silence for a moment; her mouth agape.  After a few moments, all she could manage to say was, \u201cKevin?\u201d</span></div></div>",

They even made you left-handed, like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled.

And how do you feel about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad she's happy. That's why we took Kevin to New Horizons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the doorbell rang. Mommy Grace answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again,\" Mommy Abigail said. \"I'm just here to see if Kelsey is ready.\" As soon as she saw me, she dropped to one knee. \"You must be Sophie. Kelsey's told me so much about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's more to tell,\" Kelsey said. \"Mom,... Sophie used to be Kevin.\"</span></div></div>",

I was so worried that I scared her off; until she kissed me and asked me on a second date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it certainly looks like you two are happy.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI know New Horizons doesn\u2019t exactly allow clients much contact with their former families; but does your daughter know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie\u2019s smile quickly turned to a frown; as she said, \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to tell her for the last two years, but I never had the courage to do it.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cShe thinks I died in some tragic car accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel terribly for this woman I just met.  \u201cLeslie, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be, I brought this all on myself.\u201d Sighing, with a tinge of remorse in her voice, Leslie said, \u201cBesides, I get to see her once a week; even if she doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry; I\u2019m still trying to process everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d looking at her, feeling somewhat confused, I said, \u201cHow do you see her every week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCassie and I signed up for Lamaze classes a couple of months ago; you know, to help me prepare to push something the size of a watermelon through something the size of a grape.\u201d Grabbing some tissues, Leslie said, \u201cImagine my surprise when Grace, my daughter, came into the classroom with a pregnant woman.  We got to talking; and long story short, she got married 2 years ago; after which she and her wife decided to have a baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must have been awkward for you and your wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as much as you\u2019d think; being the only two lesbian couples in the class, we\u2019ve managed to strike up a friendship.\u201d Looking at me, Leslie said, \u201cAmy keeps trying to convince me to come out to my daughter, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to do that yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever it happens; I hope it works out for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Looking at a clock on her desk, Leslie gasped and said, \u201cOh wow; that took way longer than I expected.  We should probably get to work designing your new life, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t mind talking with Leslie; I felt a sense of kinship with her, seeing how we both used to be men.  <i>Look at that, I\u2019m not even a woman yet and I\u2019m already talking like that.</i>  \u201cI suppose now\u2019s as good a time as any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s get to it, shall we?\u201d Turning to her computer, a faint smile on her face, Leslie said, \u201cFirst things first; what do you want your new name to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been thinking about that on and off since my decision; struggling with several good possibilities.  I wanted to make a good choice because this would be my name for the rest of my life.  After a few more seconds of thinking, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve decided on Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Amelia.\u201d Her smile getting bigger, Leslie said, \u201cI always make this little comment to the new women that come through here; \u201cThe Bible says God created man before He created woman. Everybody knows the second draft is better than the first.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So begin the lengthy, and sometimes arduous task of designing my life as Amelia Webber.  I suppose I should\u2019ve realized how much work was involved in something like this, but I was still thrown off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first parameters that we worked on revolved around my basic body shape.  I\u2019d already settled on being a Caucasian woman, so we continued from there.  I didn\u2019t want to go overboard, but I let Leslie talk me into some otherwise objectionable decisions \u2013 for example, I didn\u2019t want <i>huge</i> breasts but Leslie still managed to convince me otherwise; so instead of the 34C I was leaning towards, we went with 36D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I asked why Leslie was so insistent about that, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve always had a thing for well-endowed women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t mind the occasional input; but this is <i>my</i> body we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you turning me into your dream girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, you\u2019re no fun; but I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d Turning back to her computer, Leslie said, \u201cNext on the list is height; what are you now, about 5\u20199\u201d?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled to myself; amused that Leslie was already treating me like a woman.  I suppose it was something the company did; to help clients get used to their new lives.  If I\u2019d chosen to be a little girl, I\u2019m sure she would have talked to me like I was a child.  Thinking about her question, I leaned back and said, \u201cI\u2019m just shy of six feet, actually; I just slouch a lot.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThis time around, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019d like to go shorter; somewhere around 5\u20196,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice, you could always get a decent pair of heels to look taller.\u201d Inputting the information, Leslie said, \u201cHow about hair color and length?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a thing for girls with dark blonde hair; so how about that, maybe an inch past my shoulders.\u201d Looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cI\u2019m curious, how exactly will I be transformed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe specialists will use the criteria we\u2019re creating to program nanites; which they\u2019ll inject into your body.  The procedure only takes about 15 minutes; but as someone who\u2019s gone through it, I can tell you that it\u2019s physically taxing.  Don\u2019t be surprised if you sleep for a few hours afterward.\u201d Glancing at the screen, Leslie said, \u201cWe\u2019re all set with the physical parameters; the computer is coming up with a representation of what you\u2019ll look like.  After that\u2019s done, we can move onto actually figuring out exactly who Amelia Webber wants to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore we get to all, I\u2019ve got a question; how exactly will they alter my personality?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not well versed in the science behind it, but I know they use some machine to rewrite your brain to fit the new personality.\u201d Chuckling, Leslie said, \u201cHow else would they turn a bible-thumping conservative into a proud lesbian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all sounds so complicated; what\u2019s to keep them from accidentally erasing the memories from my old life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re forbidden from doing that without a court order.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be Amelia Webber but you\u2019ll still remember your life as Kevin Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the computer beeped, and I saw a grin form on Leslie\u2019s face.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cDamn girl; you\u2019re going to be one attractive woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed a little at that; if Leslie thought I was attractive, then I suppose I made the right decisions.  \u201cThis is going to be the new me; I just wanted to look good, is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, honey; if you decide to be lesbian or bi, I\u2019d be begging my wife to either let you move in with us or to let us move in with you.\u201d Looking at me, Leslie said, \u201cAre you ready to see the new you, Amelia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting butterflies in my stomach.  Fidgeting a little bit, I said, \u201cI-I\u2019m ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Leslie turned the monitor towards me; and I got my first look at the woman I would soon become.  To say I was floored would have been the understatement of the century; I was stunned by what I saw on the screen before me.  The woman looking back at me was downright gorgeous, exactly as I\u2019d pictured her as I answered Leslie\u2019s questions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After I spent a few minutes looking at images of what I would soon look like, Leslie and I got to work figuring out my new personality and what kind of life I wanted to have.  I won\u2019t bore you with the details; but suffice it to say, I was going to be a straight woman who liked yoga, jogging, and hanging out with friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was also going to have a professional demeanor at work; dressing in a skirt or pantsuit.  When not at work I\u2019d dress casually, but wasn\u2019t above dressing up for dates or girls nights.  Leslie was finalizing that information when two women, who I assumed were her coworkers Erin and Carrie, walked into the room.  As they sat at their desks, one of them said, \u201cGirl, why are you always working through lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast minute assignment from Miranda.\u201d Gesturing to me, Leslie said, \u201cErin King, Carrie Miller; let me introduce Amelia Webber, formerly Kevin Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions were made Erin came behind Leslie\u2019s desk and casually looked at the monitor.  \u201cDamn honey, you\u2019re going to be gorgeous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Blushing from embarrassment, I said, \u201cSome of that was Leslie\u2019s idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that; she always tries to persuade new women to get bigger breasts.\u201d Glancing at Leslie, who was blushing deeply, Erin said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t take too much of her advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you ladies mind?\u201d getting frustrated, Leslie said, \u201cAmelia and I were just about to finalize her career and education when you came in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies, we\u2019ll let you ladies get back to work.\u201d Looking at me, Erin said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently nodded as Erin and Carrie went back to their desks.  Once they were gone, I turned to Leslie and said, \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that I don\u2019t quite understand; you said that I\u2019ll be given whatever knowledge I\u2019ll need to live my life.  But how will I start a career if an employer finds out that my resume is a lie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey; we\u2019ve got contacts in colleges all over the country.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cWith one call, I can get you a degree from any one of them.  I can even get you into a sorority if you wanted to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well I suppose that makes sense.\u201d Looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cI never realized just how complicated this all was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a new life for you from scratch; things like that aren\u2019t easy.\u201d Turning to her keyboard, keeping one eye on me, Leslie said, \u201cSo the first question; what kind of career would you like to have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question gave me pause, as I tried to figure out an answer to it.  After a moment, I said, \u201cMy Aunt, or rather Kevin\u2019s Aunt, has made a pretty successful career as a financial executive in New York.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI always thought that would be a fun career to have, but I was never good with math.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing some work on her computer, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ve found several possible job openings with companies that we\u2019ve deemed safe for our clients.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie, once again, turned her monitor to let me see the possible job opportunities:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Executive Assistant; Innovative Talent Agency, Los Angeles<br>\r\nOption 2: Customer Service Representative; Boeing, Chicago<br>\r\nOption 3: Human Resources; Verges Financial Group, NYC<br>\r\nOption 4: Paralegal; Law Offices of Dennard &amp; McShane, Washington, DC<br>\r\nOption 5: Office Manager, Target Corporate Offices, Minneapolis<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving it some thought, I sat back and looked at Leslie.  \u201cI think I\u2019ll go with _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We stopped outside a door marked <i>Transfigurations</i>.  After knocking twice on the door, Leslie opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a woman about the age I\u2019d soon be; professional except for her bubblegum pink hair.  \u201cAmelia, this is Dr. Lizzie Weintraub; the head of Transfigurations here.\u201d Handing the woman the drive, Leslie said, \u201cLiz, this is soon to be Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Amelia; I\u2019m glad I can be of service to you.\u201d Plugging the drive into a computer, she said, \u201cI imagine that Leslie told you what you can expect from this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Dr. Weintraub; she mentioned sleeping for hours after it was finished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all girls here, Amelia; you can call me Liz.\u201d Gesturing towards a nearby door, she said, \u201cFollow me, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking Leslie for everything, I followed Liz through the door into a room whose main feature was a chair.  It resembled a reclining chair that was stuck in the reclined position.  As she handed me a hospital gown, Liz said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a few minutes; I\u2019ve found that clients like to say one last goodbye to their former lives.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cOnce that\u2019s done, take off all your clothes; including socks and underwear.  After you put the gown on, you\u2019ll lie back on the chair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Liz; I\u2019d like to get started right away.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve already said my goodbyes to every aspect of my life as Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded silently as she left the room; giving me privacy while I got undressed.  Once I settled onto the chair, she came back into the room.  Putting my clothes in a bag, she said, \u201cIs there anything in here that you\u2019d like to keep?  Otherwise, we\u2019ll return it to Kevin\u2019s family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the photos, I said, \u201cMy sister gave me an envelope with some photos, I\u2019d like to keep that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly found the envelope and placed it in a plastic container by the door.  \u201cWould you like a sedative before the nanites are administered?  Some of our clients don\u2019t wish to watch their bodies changing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sedative would be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz quickly ran an IV into my room; followed by a syringe of what I assumed was the nanites.  As she attached some wires to my head, she said, \u201cWhen you wake up, it\u2019ll be Amelia Webber\u2019s birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving me a quick peck on the cheek, she dimmed the lights and left the room.  I then closed my eyes and let the sedative do its work, so the nanites could do theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dreamt that I was hanging out in my living room with Kelsey, Kyle, and David; the four of us were watching a movie and eating popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a popcorn kernel fell out of my hand and down my front, I figured I\u2019d have to pull it from between my legs like I usually did.  Instead, I found that I had to dig it out of my cleavage.  <i>Did I have cleavage when I sat down?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the movie was over, Kelsey and I went into the bathroom to freshen up.  I took a moment to admire myself in the mirror; I was a good-looking young woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think my books will be like yours when I'm your age?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kelsey, smiling, I said, \u201cJust take a look at your mother, that\u2019ll tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I dawned on me; weren\u2019t Kelsey and I twins?  Why I would be talking about her mother as if she weren\u2019t mine?  Then I realized how absurd that sounded; we couldn\u2019t be twins because I was a good 10 years older than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the bathroom to find that Kyle and David were gone.  Where did they go?  Then I realized, they would\u2019ve hung out with Kevin; but I wasn\u2019t Kevin Scott anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was Amelia Webber.</span></div></div>",

I then got it in my head to check out my new body, so I pulled the sheets off and made my way into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face was just as it had been on Leslie\u2019s screen; only seeing it on a screen didn\u2019t compare to seeing it in person.  <i>Damn girl, you look good.</i>  I was still wearing the hospital gown, so I couldn\u2019t see what I looked like underneath.  Of course, I\u2019d already seen computer images of that, but nothing can beat the real thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to disrobe and examine myself when there was a knock at the door.  Quickly fixing the gown, annoyed at the interruption, I walked through the room to the door.  Smelling a faint scent of smoke outside, I first thought perhaps there was a fire in the building.  Looking through the peephole, I saw Dr. Harris holding a small cake while Dr. Willard, Leslie, and Liz stood behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy memory still a little hazy, I opened the door.  Before I could say anything, all four women started singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d as they walked into my room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before too long Eliza (Dr. Harris, Miranda (Dr. Willard), Leslie, Liz, and I were talking like we were old friends.  We were talking about basically anything that we could think of.  I always wondered how my mom could find herself drawn into such ideal chit-chat; now that I was a woman, I realized just how easy it could be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone but Leslie left about an hour later; saying that they had to get back to work.  After saying goodbye to them, I closed the door and walked back into the room.  Looking at Leslie, sitting on the couch, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, Leslie; but why are you still here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all decided that I\u2019d be the one to train you in how to be a woman.\u201d Leaning back against the couch, Leslie said, \u201cSeeing how I know firsthand what you\u2019re going through, they thought it would be easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Sitting next to her, pretending to be a little sad, I said, \u201cHere I thought it was because you liked me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do like you, Amelia; which is funny to say since we just met this afternoon.\u201d Getting up from the couch, Leslie said, \u201cNow follow me, we need to get you dressed; because that hospital gown is doing nothing to hide your figure, and it\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet in the room had a small assortment (3 outfits) of clothes to choose from.  Even though I was now a woman both physically and mentally, I wasn\u2019t ready to wear the dress or the business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter settling on the final option, capris pants, and a blouse, I went into the bathroom to get dressed.  I was a little worried about working the bra but found that I was able to put it on without a problem.  <i>Duh, they probably gave me the knowledge to do that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was satisfied, I walked back into the bedroom to find Leslie sitting on my bed.  Looking at me, with a weird expression on her face, Leslie said, \u201cWow, you fill out that bra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until now, I\u2019d taken her remarks with a grain of salt, figuring she was just being complimentary.  But now I was starting to get a little annoyed by what Leslie was saying.  \u201cDo you mind if I ask you something, Leslie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever it is, the answer's yes.\u201d Her weird expression turning into a big smile, Leslie perked up and said, \u201cA thousand times yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, right there, is what I want to ask you about.\u201d Sitting next to Leslie, I said, \u201cEver since I woke up, you\u2019ve been acting strange around me.  Hell, you were practically drooling over my pictures of the office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned back into a frown; she probably expected me to have said something else.  \u201cOh right, that.\u201d Composing herself, Leslie said, \u201cSorry if I made you uncomfortable; it\u2019s just this pregnancy has thrown my hormones completely out of whack.  I thought I could handle myself better since my period mood swings weren\u2019t bad, but pregnancy is a whole other ballgame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that I had overreacted a bit, I looked at her and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry; I-I just thought...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love my wife, Amelia; she\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d Turning serious, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019d never do anything to hurt her, especially not after the pain I caused my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we both sat in silence for a few minutes, I said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be getting started?\u201d chuckling, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ve only got a few days before I leave for LA; not to mention my dinner with my parents tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes going wide, Leslie said, \u201cOh right, I completely forgot about that; guess I had a case of pregnancy brain for a moment.\u201d Standing up, Leslie said, \u201cFollow me into the bathroom; I\u2019ll teach you how to do your hair and makeup.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing Leslie taught me was how to apply my make-up properly.  She didn\u2019t think I wanted to look like Mimi from the Drew Carey Show; and, after seeing a picture of her, I agreed with her.  To her surprise, I didn\u2019t need much in the way of lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me for asking, but wasn\u2019t Kevin one of those manly guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, rather he, wasn\u2019t exactly manly; but he wasn\u2019t feminine either.\u201d Gently putting on some mascara, looking at Leslie in the mirror, I said, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re already surprisingly good with the make-up.\u201d Looking at me, quizzically, Leslie said, \u201cI was just curious, is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen Kelsey and I were 10 years old, we both got mono and were stuck at home for a month.\u201d Looking over at Leslie, I said, \u201cShe was going through one of those girly phases and wanted to use me to practice with make-up.  Being the kind, older brother; I had no choice but to oblige.  I got pretty good at doing it myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour sister must\u2019ve been a very good teacher because you\u2019re doing better than me when I first changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might be insulted by that; if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I\u2019m a woman now.\u201d Looking at the three choices of lipstick on the counter, I said, \u201cThe only thing she didn\u2019t teach me about was lipstick; because Mom wouldn\u2019t let her have any at that age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame her.\u201d Sitting on the closed toilet, Leslie said, \u201cI was the same way with my daughter when she was growing up.  Part of it was because of my conservative upbringing, but I forbade her from wearing anything too revealing and she only wore a small amount of make-up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Leslie gave me the color she thought would go well with my outfit, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking; what was your previous life like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had your typical southern Catholic upbringing; gays and abortion were evil, that sort of thing.  I can only imagine what my folks would think of me now; being in a lesbian relationship with a baby on the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering your upbringing, I assume you were married at some point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEllen was a lovely woman; a great wife and a loving mother.\u201d Sighing, Leslie said, \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t died from cancer, she probably would\u2019ve divorced me because of the way I treated my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Leslie was starting to get emotional, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about this, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright; it\u2019s good to let it out now and then.\u201d Wiping some stray tears from her eyes, Leslie said, \u201cOf course, being pregnant makes it that much easier to start crying without much notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour or so, Leslie was satisfied that I knew more than enough.  The hardest part was walking in the heels; they\u2019d given me the knowledge to walk in them, but Leslie said I needed to get used to walking in them to get some muscle memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave myself a quick once over, touching up my make-up and putting my hair into a bun.  Walking out of the bathroom, I said, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a woman after my own heart.\u201d Wincing, Leslie said, \u201cDon\u2019t mind me; it\u2019s the pregnancy hormones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked out into the main room, I said, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s time to go meet my parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they texted me a few minutes ago to let me know they were downstairs.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cLet\u2019s grab your purse, and then we\u2019ll \u2013 oh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly grew concerned as Leslie sat down on the couch.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d running over to her, I said, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie didn\u2019t say anything; instead, she took my hand and held it to her belly.  Soon after, I felt a powerful kick from the baby.  \u201cOh my.\u201d  I\u2019d always had an interest in pregnant women, nothing perverted mind you.  Now I found myself imagining being pregnant myself; which, thanks to the nanites, was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you might like that.\u201d Slowly getting to her feet, Leslie said, \u201cThis little guy drives me crazy sometimes; especially when he uses my bladder as a drum set.  But then, when I\u2019m feeling depressed about something, I feel him kick and it reminds me that I\u2019ve got a person growing inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a boy, huh?\u201d smiling, I said, \u201cHow about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a better job raising him than my parents did.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cSomeday, if one of his kids happens to be gay maybe he won\u2019t repeat my mistakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be a great mother, Leslie.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cAnd I hope I get a chance to meet the little guy someday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d chuckling, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019m calling you as soon as I go into labor; I don\u2019t care if you have to get a red-eye flight from LA, I want you here when I have the baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a purse that Liz and the others had left for me, I said, \u201cI think we\u2019ve kept my parents waiting long enough, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Then Leslie led me to a middle-aged couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they saw us, they stood up. \"Leslie, it's so good to see you again,\" the woman said. \"Let me look at you. When are you due?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two more months,\" Leslie replied. \"And I don't mind telling you, I am counting the weeks. Stan and Joanna Webber, this is Amelia.

Looking at the clock, I saw that it was just after 8:30 AM.  \u201cWho could that be?\u201d Throwing the covers off, I was immediately faced with the sight of my naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my memory of the night before came back.  I\u2019d had a little bit of wine after I came back to the room (which would explain my headache), after which I decided to explore my new body.  I guess I got so carried away that I didn\u2019t even get dressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, putting on the bathrobe, I slowly walked to the door.  Looking through the peephole, I saw Leslie standing there with a bag on her arms.  Opening the door, I said, \u201cLeslie, it's 8:30 in the morning.  Adding the fact that I\u2019m hungover, I\u2019m not in the mood for more training today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, I\u2019m not in the mood to train you today.  Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest.\u201d Walking into the room, Leslie said, \u201cI figured we\u2019d take advantage of the amenities here, so I made us a spa appointment for 10:00; then I thought we\u2019d hang out at the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great.\u201d Closing the door, I said, \u201cDo you mind keeping it down a little bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I know what you must be going through.\u201d Peaking in the bedroom, seeing the bed in disarray, Leslie looked back at me.  \u201cLooks like you had a little fun last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory involving the detachable showerhead flashed in my mind.  Turning crimson from embarrassment, I said, \u201cI <i>may</i> have done some exploring last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to be embarrassed, Amelia; you used to be a teenage boy, it\u2019s only natural.\u201d Chuckling, Leslie said, \u201cHell, I did the same thing my first night.  The second night, I went to a gay bar and brought some girl back to my room for a one-night stand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing where Leslie was going with that, I shook my head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not even remotely ready to have sex with a guy; I haven\u2019t even been a woman for 24 hours yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on girl, let\u2019s get changed and go to the pool.\u201d Looking at the clock, which said 8:42, Leslie said, \u201cThere\u2019s a tankini hanging in the closet for you to wear.\u201d</span></div></div>",

With a sigh, I opened the door and said, \u201cCan you blame me for wanting to admire myself in the mirror?\u201d looking at Leslie, I said, \u201cYou mean to tell me that you didn\u2019t do the same thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie stood in the doorway, looking me over, for a moment until she said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t hold it against you.\u201d Handing me some clothes, Leslie said, \u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019ve been under some stress lately; what with the pregnancy and my wife\u2019s schoolwork keeping us from...you know.  I could use a day to relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the clothes on over my suit, Leslie and I left the room.  As we walked down the hall towards the elevator, I looked at her and said, \u201cDo you always spend this much time with a client?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot normally, no.\u201d looking at me, as she pressed the button, Leslie said, \u201cThere\u2019s just something about you that I like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to when we were designing my new body, I said, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s got nothing to do with being attracted to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we stepped into the elevator, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ll admit that\u2019s part of it; but mostly it\u2019s because we\u2019ve similar upbringings.  We were both raised by single parents; granted, I was raised by a father whose life lessons led to me alienating my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the elevator reached the lobby, I said, \u201cSounds to me like you need this more than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked out of the elevator, Leslie nodded and said, \u201cI just wish I could take advantage of more of the spa\u2019s services; but, alas, my pregnancy prevents me from doing that.\u201d With a grin, Leslie said, \u201cAlthough there\u2019s nothing wrong with a facial and a mani/pedi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking through the list of services before you arrived.\u201d Turning down the hall towards the spa, I said, \u201cI kind of want to try that mud bath; but if last night\u2019s any indication, my body might be too sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe increased sensitivity is only temporary, it\u2019ll wear off by tomorrow.\u201d Looking at me, Leslie said, \u201cYou should do the mud bath, I think you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us walked into the spa; where we saw a guy, about our age, standing behind the counter.  If seeing my new female appearance wasn\u2019t enough to make me realize how much had changed, then I definitely realized it when I found myself turned on by the guy.  Leaning over to Leslie, whispering in her ear, I said, \u201cHe\u2019s cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, he is rather easy on the eyes.\u201d With a raised eyebrow, Leslie said, \u201cIf I were straight, I\u2019d be all over him.\u201d</span></div></div>",

My masseuse was a bona fide miracle worker; if I\u2019d been anything other than straight, I would have proposed to her right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne shower later, and I was ready to relax by the pool.  Heading out to the pool deck, which overlooked the water and had one of those bars that you could swim up to.  I picked a lounge chair and stretched out of the soak up the sun; not even bothering to think about where Leslie was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, a cabana boy came up to me and said, \u201cMay I offer you something from the bar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering until yesterday I\u2019d been an underage teenage boy, I didn\u2019t have experience in the alcoholic beverage department.  Looking over the menu, I said, \u201cWhat would you recommend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bartender makes an excellent mojito, ma\u2019am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d heard someone at the restaurant order one of those last night; it looked rather interesting.  \u201cAright then, I\u2019ll try one of those.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was back with the drink within minutes; and let me tell you, it was delicious.  So delicious, in fact, that I gleefully accepted a second one.  I was in a very good mood by time the second one was half gone.  So good, in fact, I wanted to share my good time with the cabana boy.  As he walked by, with another guests order, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a real nice body.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cYou want to hold it against me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn hindsight, I imagine that he got this a lot; but he still played it cool.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cI-I beg your pardon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering to my feet, I said, \u201cYou wanna come back to my room?\u201d grabbing the straps of my tankini, I said, \u201cOr we do it right here, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Leslie intervened before things got out of hand; stepping between me and the cabana boy.  \u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s enough for one day, sweetie.\u201d Turning to the cabana boy, she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about my friend; she\u2019s a bit over-served.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabana boy beat a hasty retreat while Leslie pulled me away from the pool.  \u201cW-Wha\u2019s going on?\u201d slurring a little bit, I said, \u201cWha\u2019s the big idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were in private, Leslie looked at me and said, \u201cHow much did you have to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only had too mo-hoo-toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well there are three things you need to know: One, you can\u2019t handle your liquor.  Two, you\u2019ve got no game at all.  And three, acting like that at a family pool is a very good way to get yourself removed from the hotel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch. I think I need a little help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you upstairs to your room; you take a nap, then we\u2019ll get you some coffee, and then I\u2019ll teach you how to flirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in my inebriated state, I found the idea of Leslie teaching me to flirt hilarious.  \u201cYou?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving me one of those \u2018are you kidding me\u2019 looks, Leslie said, \u201cJust because I\u2019ve put on an extra 20 pounds, doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t get people to look at me.\u201d Grabbing my hand, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you tonight after you\u2019ve sobered up?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I couldn't believe that I almost got naked in front of children.  I was grateful that Leslie had stepped in when she did.  Getting out of bed, I walked into the next room to find Leslie sitting on the couch reading a book of baby names.  \u201cStill trying to settle on a name for the baby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah; one minute I have a name I like, but then the next minute I hate it.\u201d Sighing, as she put the book down, Leslie said, \u201cAt first I wanted to name the baby Theodore, after the man I used to be; but then I realized he didn\u2019t deserve that honor.  With two months until he\u2019s born, I\u2019m running out of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen me and...sorry, when Kevin and Kelsey were born, their parents waited until the last minute to decide on a name.\u201d taking a seat next to Leslie, I said, \u201cIf I might make a suggestion, how about Kyle David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat made you think of those names?\u201d then it hit her, as she was looking at me.  \u201cOh right, those were your friend\u2019s names.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it ever get easier?\u201d Sitting back on the couch, I said, \u201cWill I ever be able to think of Kevin as being a different person than who I am now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does get easier as time goes by, but it never really goes away.\u201d Looking at me, smiling, Leslie said, \u201cJust think of Kevin\u2019s life as the impetus for your life as Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I thought about it, the more I realized Leslie was right.  Failing to acknowledge Kevin\u2019s role in my new life would be a horrible idea.  \u201cI\u2019ll have to keep that in mind.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cNow back to that name idea; what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle David Cummings; I like how it just rolls off the tongue.\u201d  Checking her phone, Leslie said, \u201cHurry up and get changed, we\u2019re going out to the club; that way I can show you how to flirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the idea of Leslie teaching me how to flirt.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I still can\u2019t see you teaching me how to flirt.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cOnce anyone, man or woman, sees that wedding ring and your belly they\u2019ll lose interest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me; I think you\u2019ll change your mind after tonight.\u201d  Getting to her feet, Leslie said, \u201cNow come on, go get changed; I left a dress hanging in the bathroom for you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was clingy in all the right places and even lifted my breasts ever so slightly.  As I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, looking at my reflection, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about much things had changed in such a short time.  I\u2019d gone from being an unhappy teenage boy to a woman in her 20s; one who was being taken to a bar to learn how to flirt with guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter touching up my makeup, I carefully got into the heeled boots that Leslie left for me.  I was worried about walking in them but found that I had no problem doing so.  Then I remembered they\u2019d given me that knowledge.  Walking out into the main room, I saw Leslie talking on her phone.  \u201cWe should be at the bar shortly; I\u2019m just waiting on Amelia.\u201d Seeing me in the doorway, she said, \u201cI gotta go, she\u2019s standing in the doorway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Leslie hung up her phone, I said, \u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my wife, Grace.\u201d Putting her phone away, Leslie said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to meet us at the bar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I followed Leslie towards the door, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s great, I can\u2019t wait to meet her.\u201d Stopping mid-stride, I said, \u201cWait, does she know about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the basics; you were a teenage boy but now you\u2019re a woman.\u201d Opening the door, Leslie said, \u201cI figured you\u2019d want to tell her the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out the door, with a grin, I said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll tell her how you\u2019ve been practically flirting with me all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, please; you\u2019d know if I was flirting with you.\u201d Walking down the hall, Leslie said, \u201cThat reminds me, you\u2019re going to get a lot of attention in that outfit; good and bad.  So be prepared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you picked it for me to wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much; I wanted you to get used to people taking an interest in you.\u201d With a grin, Leslie said, \u201cBesides, it doesn\u2019t hurt that you look amazing in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie was right; I was getting a lot of attention because of my outfit.  It was still weird to think this was my life now; I wondered <br>\r\nhow these folks would react if they learned that the woman they were flirting with used to be a teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d been at the bar for almost 25 minutes; Leslie was sitting at a nearby booth, while I was sitting up at the bar.  I was sipping a bottle of Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade when a guy, a few years younger than myself, walked over.  \u201cHey gorgeous, what\u2019s a lovely lady like yourself doing here all alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I\u2019m a novice at flirting, but even I knew those pick up lines were dated.  Deciding to play along, I said, \u201cI\u2019m here with a friend of mine; just trying to experience the local nightlife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you and your friend would like to come back to my place; my buddies and I could show you a good time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the way he said that made me feel uneasy.  Before I could rebuff him, however, Leslie appeared next to me and said, \u201cGirl, there you are; I\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy took one look at Leslie\u2019s belly and walked off.  Taking my drink back to the table, I said, \u201cThanks for that; I got a weird vibe from that guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard him talking to some of his friends; good thing too because I think they planned on taking advantage of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat, I said, \u201cAre all guys going to be like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs someone who used to be like these guys, I can tell you; there will be some who you\u2019ll want to stay away from.\u201d Sighing, Leslie said, \u201cBut there are good guys out there as well; you just have to find the right one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me; weren\u2019t you supposed to teach me about flirting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose now\u2019s as good a time as any.\u201d Pointing towards the bar, Leslie said, \u201cYou see that girl at the end; the one with the tattoos on her right arm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking where Leslie was pointing, I saw a girl sitting at the bar no more than 5 feet away from us.  Turning back to Leslie, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know; I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s your type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Leslie got up and walked over to the girl.  It was just quiet enough that I could make out what they were saying.  Looking at the girl, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you from my booth; I think you\u2019re one of the most beautiful women I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not too bad yourself.\u201d Smiling, the girl said, \u201cDo you live in town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t live that far from here.\u201d Leaning closer, Leslie said, \u201cWhat do you say we go back to my place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was riveted by the scene before me; to my surprise, Leslie was having luck with a woman.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for the woman at the bar, though; I don\u2019t think she realized that Leslie was married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just going to ask you the same thing; how about we go to my place instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came next was a complete surprise to me; as Leslie said, \u201cWell then, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s the same place then.\u201d Leaning forward to <br>\r\nkiss the woman, Leslie said, \u201cPerhaps we can have a little fun tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure what was going on; I was in shock as Leslie and the woman came over to the table.  Looking at me, the woman said, <br>\r\n\u201cI think we owe her an explanation, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to the woman next to her, Leslie said, \u201cAmelia; this is my wife, Grace.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We stayed for a while until the bar got a little rowdy for our tastes, so we went back to my hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie decided to lie down shortly after we got back to the room; so that left me alone with Grace.  After changing out of the dress, I walked out into the bedroom to find Grace lying on the bed next to Leslie.  Seeing the way she was around her, I could tell that Grace cared deeply for Leslie.  Walking over to her, I said, \u201cHow about we grab a couple of beers and go chat on the balcony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently climbing out of bed, so as not to wake Leslie, Grace said, \u201cHoney, you read my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the beers in hand, the two of us adjourned to the balcony.  As we sat down, I looked at Grace and said, \u201cLeslie was rather tight-lipped about your life; if it\u2019s alright, I\u2019d like to hear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be nearly as interesting as yours, but I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d Sipping the beer, Grace said, \u201cI\u2019m the 2nd oldest of four kids and the only girl.  My dad served in the Army, go figure, so we moved around a lot.  I was never really in one place long enough to make friends, so I hung out with my brothers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s how Grace and I spent the next 30 minutes; talking about her childhood and how she and her siblings all joined the military.  The more she talked, the more I got the sense that she strongly disliked those who attacked someone for their religion or sexual orientation.  Which had me wondering why she was married to someone like Leslie?  Taking a sip from my beer, I said, \u201cForgive me if I\u2019m out of line here, but I can\u2019t figure out exactly why you\u2019re married to someone like Leslie.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, she\u2019s a wonderful person <i>now</i>; but in her former life she would\u2019ve been vehemently anti-homosexual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me; when I found out the truth, about who she used to be, I considered just ending the date then and there.  The last thing I wanted to do was date a formerly bigoted middle-aged man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI spoke with Heather, the mutual friend who set us up.  She assured me that Leslie\u2019s desire to change was genuine; that she wanted to experience the type of life that her daughter was living.\u201d Leaning back in the chair, Grace said, \u201cSo I took a chance and asked her on a second date.  I\u2019m glad that I did; forgive the corniness, but she\u2019s the love of my life.  When the time comes for her daughter to learn the truth, I hope she sees that Leslie has changed for the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil that moment I hadn\u2019t given much thought to how Kelsey and my mom would respond to me becoming a woman.  \u201cIt\u2019s funny you mention that because I\u2019m rather worried about how my family will react when they learn that I\u2019ve become a woman.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cAll this was their idea so, deep down, I hope they\u2019ll be supportive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ask this; but since you brought it up.\u201d Leaning forward, Grace said, \u201cWhat was so wrong with your old life that your mother and sister thought this would be a good idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver since I turned 13, I\u2019ve just been unhappy; just going through the day to day motions.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, there were moments where I was happy, but they were few and far between.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me if I\u2019m off base, but going to a place like New Horizons seems just a tiny bit drastic.\u201d Sighing, Grace said, \u201cI was still trying to figure out whether or not I was straight at your age.  There were certainly times where I got depressed, but I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve gone to the lengths that you went to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no turning back now, so I guess I\u2019m stuck with the consequences of my decision.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cJust out of <br>\r\ncuriosity, when exactly did you figure <i>it</i> out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Grace to realize what I was getting at; but once she did, she sighed and said, \u201cAbout a year after I enlisted I found myself alone in the base gym when this girl from my unit, a recent recruit, walked in.\u201d pausing, Grace said, \u201cWe got to talking; long story short, we ended up dating for two years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re no longer together, so what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt turns out that I was a lesbian, but she wasn\u2019t.\u201d taking a deep, labored breath Grace said, \u201cShe thought she was, but she figured out about 3 months into our relationship that she wasn\u2019t.  Rather than come clean right then and there, she led me on for another 15 months.  Last I heard she was working as a teacher in Seattle with her husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems to me like things worked out well in the end; you\u2019re married to Leslie and you\u2019re about to have a child together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe talked for a little while longer until I mentioned what happened with the guy at the bar.  \u201cI\u2019m still new to all this, so I have no clue how to figure out whether or not a guy is a creep.\u201d  Sighing, I said, \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Leslie stepping in, I probably would have left with the guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, I would\u2019ve intervened before it got to that point.\u201d Getting up, Grace said, \u201cBut if you\u2019re interested, I can teach you some self-defense moves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything I\u2019d learned about her, I had some misgivings about Grace teaching me.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cGrace, I\u2019m 130lbs soaking wet; I doubt there\u2019s much I can do to defend myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI served in the Army for 4 years, and had 3 brothers trust me when I say I can show you some things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s what we were doing when Leslie walked out onto the patio; Grace was on her knees and I had her arm bent behind her back.  Looking at us, Leslie said, \u201cI heard all the noise and, for a moment, I thought you were doing something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing Grace\u2019s arm, with a grin, I said, \u201cOh we were doing that earlier; I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t hear us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry look on Leslie\u2019s face told me that my joke was in poor taste.  Before she could do anything, Grace stepped between us and said, \u201cBabe relax, she was just kidding.\u201d Pausing, Grace said, \u201cI was just teaching her some self-defense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down, Leslie looked at me and said, \u201cThat reminds me, I\u2019ll buy you a thing of pepper spray for your purse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Feeling apologetic, I said, \u201cSorry about that joke; I don\u2019t know why I thought it would be funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of joke you tell a pregnant woman, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and Leslie left a short time later; after promising they\u2019d be here tomorrow with the others to see me off.  After saying goodbye to them, I closed the door and smiled \u2013 I\u2019d be starting my new life tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up this morning, as I\u2019d done every morning for the last few days, with a smile on my face.  Today was the big day \u2013 the day I\u2019d been working towards ever since I walked into New Horizons.  I was leaving for Los Angeles and my new life as 26-year-old Amelia Webber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will admit to a tinge of remorse about leaving; after all, I\u2019d spent my entire life in this area.  But, as I sat up in bed, I knew it was for the best.  Besides it wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d never see Kelsey and my mom again, I\u2019d come back to visit once I felt the time was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, I went into the bathroom to shower; I was in the process of getting undressed when there was a knock at the door.  Walking back into the room, I looked at the clock and saw that it was only 7:45.  After putting on the bathrobe, I walked to the door \u2013 the whole time wondering who could be visiting at this hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the peephole, I saw a bellboy standing outside holding what appeared to be a garment bag.  Opening the door, I said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding me the garment bag, the bellboy said, \u201cThis was left for you at the front desk ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Gently placing the bag on the back of a nearby chair, I said, \u201cLet me get some money for a tip, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went over to the desk where I\u2019d left my purse the night before.  I searched through it but had a hard time finding any cash.  As I replayed the events of last night to figure out where it might have gone, I caught a glimpse of the bellboy staring at me in the mirror.  I was ready to ignore the lewd looks he was giving me, until he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re having trouble finding money, I\u2019m willing to accept <i>other</i> arrangements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling disgusted, I couldn\u2019t help but shudder at that comment.  <i>God, men can be such pigs.</i>  I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle slightly at that thought; I had been a man only a few days earlier.  With that being said, I\u2019d never talk to women like that.  Placing the $15 back in my purse, I turned and around said, \u201cYou just talked yourself right out of a tip; next time, don\u2019t talk to a woman like that.\u201d Standing in the doorway, I said, \u201cNow leave before I complain to your manager.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bellboy, visibly annoyed, turned and walked away.  Even as he walked down the hall, I heard him grumble what sounded like \u201cDumb bitch.\u201d  Deciding not to make good on my threat, I closed the door and turned my attention to the garment bag.  Opening it up, I saw that it contact a lovely, and recently pressed, tan skirt suit; along with a matching pair of heels at the bottom.  I noticed a note inside the bag; which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You\u2019re a mature woman now; might as well dress the part.<br>\r\n-- Eliza</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging the outfit up, I returned to the bathroom to get ready.</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t help but look at my reflection and try to picture what I used to look like only a few days earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the process of finishing up some mascara when there was a knock at the door.  For a fleeting moment, I thought it was that creepy bellboy again until I heard Eliza\u2019s voice.  \u201cAmelia, are you awake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the room to the door, I saw Eliza standing in the hall with Miranda, Leslie, and Grace.  With a smile, I opened the door and said, \u201cHey guys, come on in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone walked by, I noticed Leslie eyeing me as she walked by.  \u201cThat suit looks amazing on you, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Closing the door, I said, \u201cI know I was made to not find this awkward or uncomfortable, but part of me still feels weird about wearing women\u2019s clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did want to dress like a professional.\u201d Standing next to Grace, Leslie said, \u201cTrust me, give it a few more days and all that awkwardness will disappear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of idle conversation, we all sat down in the main room.  Looking at me, Eliza said, \u201cI\u2019d imagine you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re all here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe thought had crossed my mind.\u201d Crossing my legs, I said, \u201cI just figured it was you guys being friendly; showing me how to be a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter casting a glance towards Eliza, Miranda turned to me and said, \u201cWe did want to show you the ropes, but we also wanted to be your friends.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cWe do something similar for all our clients; tailor our relationship with them to fit what their new identity would be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor example, had you decided to become an older guy; we would have become your wing girls.\u201d Smiling, Leslie said, \u201cOr surrogate children had you become an elderly woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Eliza said, \u201cThat\u2019s just a convoluted way of saying that we are your friends, or at least someone you can confide in.\u201d grabbing her bag, Eliza pulled out a laptop and camera, \u201cThat reminds me, we\u2019ve set up several social media accounts for you; Facebook, Twitter, etc.  We just need to take a photo for your profile picture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the obligatory profile photo, we all scrunched together for a group photo \u2013 five girlfriends hanging out.  Once the photos were uploaded to the various accounts, I scrolled through Facebook and saw that I already had some friends, including those present.  \u201cHow can I have friends already?  I\u2019ve never met any of these people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of them are fake accounts controlled by a computer program we developed, but most are real people.\u201d Looking at me, Leslie said, \u201cMuch like with your \u2018parents\u2019 we have employees who pretend to be friends when needed.  In your situation, we\u2019ve even paid people to say they were High School or College classmates, fellow cheerleaders, and I think one or two sorority sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m impressed; you guys do think of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me.\u201d Grabbing an envelope from her bag, Eliza said, \u201cInside you\u2019ll find your driver\u2019s license, social security card, and a passport.  I\u2019ve also got you a first-class ticket to LA that leaves in about 4 hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the envelope, I said \u201cFirst class, huh?  I\u2019ve always wondered what it would be like to sit in those seats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda and Eliza looked at Leslie for a moment; she stared at them blankly for a moment until she suddenly said, \u201cOh right; your living arrangements are taken care of, you\u2019re renting a room in a 25-year-old woman\u2019s condo.  Everything will be there when you arrive; clothes, makeup, and personal effects.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve also verified your interview for tomorrow morning at 9:30.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to feel a little overwhelmed by everything; so much so that I started tearing up.  After Grace gave me a tissue, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank you, ladies, enough for everything you\u2019ve done for me the last few days.\u201d Wiping my eyes, I said, \u201cWhen my mom and sister told me about this, I wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea.  But now, I\u2019ve never been surer about anything in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the first day of the rest of your life, Amelia.\u201d Hugging me, Leslie said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to do great out in LA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Eliza said, \u201cWe should probably get going, the hotel has to clean the room for our next client.\u201d Looking at me, <br>\r\nshe said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a rental car downstairs for you; feel free to drive around a little before going to the airport.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was a kick to see all the kids playing in their yards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't resist driving by my old house, and I saw Kelsey working on her cheer routines. She was working it, putting herself through her paces, and wrapped up with her Double-9 jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, she looked up and saw me. Without thinking, I touched my lips with two fingers, then turned them in her direction.

I\u2019d only flown three times in my life; who\u2019d have thought my 4th would be as a woman.  I gave the driver a nice tip as thanks for helping me when I stumbled off the shuttle.  I\u2019d heard horror stories about women twisting their ankles in heels; let\u2019s just say I was grateful that I was able to walk it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my suitcase in tow, I made my way inside to check-in.  Taking into consideration the fact that school started tomorrow, I was surprised by the number of families around.  Waiting in line, I realized that they were probably just flying home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman behind the counter was a few years younger than me; chatty but not annoyingly so.  She did compliment me on my outfit, however; which I thought was nice.  The ladies at NHI had enrolled me in TSA Pre-Check, so I made it through security in less than 5 minutes.  Once I was through security, I walked over to the departure board noticed that my flight was running about 30 minutes late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grumbled to myself in annoyance \u2013 I wanted to start my new life; not sit around the airport.  Next to me, I heard a man say, \u201cDammit.\u201d  Choosing not to engage, figuring he was upset about a delay, I walked past him as he went to join a woman standing nearby with two young children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter buying some a book at the store, not one of those mushy harlequin romance novels, I decided to stop by the bar for a drink.  Taking to heart Leslie\u2019s remark about me not holding my liquor, I figured it would be a good idea to improve my tolerance.

I was also aware of the fact that I\u2019d had three encounters with creepy men in the last 12 hours.  I turned towards the bartender, a middle-aged man, who gave me an apologetic look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting my drink down, I decided to get the man to leave as quickly as possible.  I wasn\u2019t about to let some married man flirt with me.  Turning to the man, I said, \u201cWhat can I do for you, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man inched closer to me; even putting a hand on my thigh as he slurred his speech.  \u201cWhada ya say we goes somewhere...somewhere private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must\u2019ve been my punishment for my actions at the pool yesterday; I was experiencing what I put that poor cabana boy through.  I somewhat aggressively removed the man\u2019s hand from my waist, said hand having moved further down my leg as the man talked.  While the bartender went to the other end of the bar, I assumed to call the cops, I looked at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not going to happen; since you\u2019re old enough to be my father.\u201d Sighing, repulsed, I said, \u201cOn top of all that, you\u2019re drunk and you\u2019re married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that wasn\u2019t enough for the man to get the hint, as he responded.  \u201cWe can just have a quickie. I know a quiet spot...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly heard the hurried sound of approaching footsteps, followed by an angry woman\u2019s voice saying, \u201cHarold! Get away from that woman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up and breathed a sigh of relief as I saw the man\u2019s wife walking into the bar.  Seeing the look on her face, I assumed she was going to be angry with me as well.  The bartender had the same assumption because he came out from behind the bar and said, \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019ve already called airport police; your husband has been acting very inappropriately towards this woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman glared at her husband for a moment before calming down, ever so slightly, and turning to me.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss; this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done something like this.\u201d Turning back to her husband, she said, \u201cJust for this, Harold; my mother will be staying with us \u2013 for four months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took another twenty minutes for everything to be cleared up; the man was arrested for public intoxication and removed from his flight, while the wife decided that she and the kids would continue to Boston.  After I gave my statement to the police, and the woman apologized again, the bartender came up to me and said, \u201cWould you like something from the bar, ma\u2019am?  It\u2019ll be on the house of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Finishing off the last of my drink, I left a $10 bill on the bar.  \u201cI think I\u2019m just going to sit at the gate and read my book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you have a pleasant flight, ma\u2019am; and I\u2019m sorry about what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked through the terminal, I heard my cell phone ringing in my purse.  Digging it out, I saw that it was Miranda calling.  <br>\r\nAnswering the call, I said, \u201cHey Miranda, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much; had a few new clients come in this morning.\u201d Pausing, Miranda said, \u201cI was just calling to make sure you got to the airport okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I continued walking, I recounted everything that happened since I left.  When I got to the part about Kelsey, I said, \u201cIn hindsight, I probably shouldn\u2019t have let her see me, but I couldn\u2019t leave without seeing her one last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s understandable; after all, she was your twin sister for 15 years.\u201d Sighing, Miranda said, \u201cMight I suggest you give yourself a few days to adjust to LA before contacting them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to do that anyway, but that\u2019s good advice.\u201d  Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI just hope I\u2019ve had my last encounter with creepy men for a while.  First, that guy at the bar last night and then the bellboy this morning implying I could sleep with him in place of a tip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an attractive woman, Amelia; I\u2019m sorry to say, but creepy guys are kind of par for the course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle creepy guys that are my age, but I could do without older men hitting on me.\u201d Taking a seat at the gate, I said, \u201cI was at the airport bar, having a relaxing drink when this man came up who was old enough to be my father.  He was drunk but the worst part was that he was married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWhy are men such pigs, Miranda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t help you there, girlfriend; I was born female, so I have no understanding about how the male mind works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what you will about Kevin\u2019s father; the man may have run off on his family, but he never hit on younger girls.\u201d Leaning back, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you girls when I land in LA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d Chuckling, Miranda said, \u201cGood luck out there, Amelia.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The 5 \u00bd hour flight to LA was largely uneventful; except for some turbulence as we flew through a storm over Colorado.  Towards the end of the flight, I was awakened by a crying baby a few seats behind me.  <i>Guess I can\u2019t get away from that even in First Class.</i>  As I settled back in my seat, I realized something \u2013 instead of being annoyed by the crying, I found myself feeling sympathy for the baby.  I even had a different reaction to witnessing the mother breastfeeding the baby in the galley; instead of Kevin\u2019s more prurient reaction to seeing a woman's bare breast, I found myself imagining myself taking care of my own child someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we landed, I decided to use the bathroom before heading to baggage claim.  As I left the bathroom I bumped into a celebrity crush of Kevin\u2019s.  I mean that literally, I bumped into her as I left the bathroom.  Looking at her, temporarily thrown off by the sight of her, I said, \u201cSorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly Hawthorne played the younger lead actor in a show Kelsey and I used to watch; about a brother/sister crime-fighting team.  I\u2019d always wanted to meet her in person; but now that I did, I wish I hadn\u2019t.  Far from the sweet, and gentle character that she played on TV \u2013 in real life she was a bit of a jerk.  \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, I said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>said</i>, watch where you're going!\u201d looking at me, daggers in her eyes, she said, \u201cWhat are you; deaf <i>and</i> stupid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was silent as she went on her way; once she was gone I set about gathering my things off the floor.  I was about to grab my passport when I saw someone else grab for it.  \u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am; let me get that for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, I found myself face to face with Jake Tucker \u2013 the other lead character, and Kelsey\u2019s celebrity crush.  As Kevin I could never figure out why Kelsey liked him so much, but now I could see why.  It turns out that the cameras don\u2019t do him any justice.  He was quite handsome.  Blushing a little, I grabbed my passport and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d With a smile and a wave, he was off; leaving me staring as he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the pieces of paper I\u2019d been given contained directions on where to find my car; directions which I followed to another 2017 Mustang convertible on the 3rd level of the parking garage.  After feeding the address of my new home into the GPS, I put the top down and left the airport just as the sun started to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived at the address about 45 minutes later; a modest 2 story house in a quiet neighborhood about 25 minutes from downtown.  After ringing the doorbell, I was greeted by a woman my age wearing lounge pants and a t-shirt.  Judging from her appearance I figured I had woken her up.  \u201cHi, I\u2019m Amelia Webber.\u201d Offering my hand, I said, \u201cAre you Caitlin Saunders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, were you expecting Oprah?\u201d with a gruff tone, she said, \u201cCome on in, I\u2019ll show you to your room.  Your stuff got here yesterday afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Caitlin led me upstairs, I said, \u201cThis is a great house you\u2019ve got here, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll love living here.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting me, Caitlin said, \u201cYour rent for this month\u2019s been taken care of; it\u2019s due on the 1st of the month.  Bounce one check, and your shits on the front lawn.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cClean up after yourself, I\u2019m not going to be your maid.  If you see something in the fridge with my name on it, that means, if you want any, you've got to go out and buy it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I followed her down the hall, I started to worry that I\u2019d bitten off more than I chewed.  Caitlin didn\u2019t seem to be a very cheerful person.  As we arrived outside a closed door, I said, \u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve gotten off on the wrong foot.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019d like for us to be friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin grumbled as she opened the door; walking back down the hall to another room.  I jumped a bit as she slammed the door shut.  Looking inside the room, I saw almost a dozen boxes scattered around a brand new mattress.  I guess Caitlin wasn\u2019t interested in unpacking for me either.  <i>Good thing they labeled all the boxes</i>, I thought as I opened up the first box.. <i>What a difference L.A. is from New Jersey.</i></span></div></div>",

I was bringing some crushed boxes out to the trash when I saw Caitlin, looking more presentable then she had earlier.  I watched as she walked past me on the way to her car.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going into work for a few hours; if you have to leave, make sure to lock up.  I placed a set of keys on your dresser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to have a positive relationship with this woman, I said, \u201cWhat do you do for a living, Caitlin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin groaned for a moment before she said, \u201cI\u2019m a digital designer for Paramount; I help design the posters you see at movie theaters.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s actually why I\u2019ve got to go into work; my boss doesn\u2019t care for a poster I worked up for the new Tom Cruise movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to continue the conversation but Caitlin got in her car and drove off.  I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she didn\u2019t like me very much.  Walking back into the house, I said closed the door as I heard my cell phone ringing in my room.  Running upstairs, I saw that Leslie was calling me.  Answering it, I said, \u201cHey Leslie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like the voice of someone who just started a new life.\u201d Concerned, Leslie said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Amelia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my roommate likes me very much.\u201d  I then went into a 15-minute speech about how rude and abrupt Caitlin had been ever since I arrived.  When I was finished, I said, \u201cI know we just met and everything, but I\u2019ve got to say I wish I knew how to make this girl like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust take it slowly, Amelia; you don\u2019t want to scare her off.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cIn the meantime, don\u2019t worry so much about Caitlin; you\u2019re in Los Angeles, why don\u2019t you go see the sights or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I could do that; after all, I\u2019ve always wanted to come out here on vacation.\u201d Sitting on the bed, I said, \u201cNot that I don\u2019t mind the call; but I doubt you called just to say hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour former family placed an obituary in the local paper this morning; we didn\u2019t realize it until after you already left.\u201d Sighing, <br>\r\nLeslie said, \u201cI\u2019ll email it to you, but the basic gist is that Kevin died suddenly in his sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I know this was all last minute; but you think they could\u2019ve come up with a better cause of death?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel free to discuss that with them.\u201d Pausing, Leslie said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, honey; go enjoy the sights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up the phone, I decided to take Leslie up on her suggestion.  So I changed out of the skirt suit and into a pair of shorts and a t-shirt.  Grabbing everything I\u2019d need for a day on the town, I locked up the house and drove towards downtown.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d visited a few of the major tourist spots; like the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theater.  I was starting to get a little hungry so I crossed the street to a small caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving my order, a small chicken salad with an iced tea, I couldn\u2019t help but do some people watching.  I was well aware of the fact that I was now a heterosexual woman, but there were still times when I was surprised to find myself checking out some random guy as he walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy food came 10 minutes later; I had just taken a sip of my iced tea when I heard a voice next to me say, \u201cWell hello again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up I saw the guy from the airport; before I could stop myself, I dropped my tea on the ground.  Already mortified beyond belief, I became more so when I saw that some of my drink had gotten on his shoes.  Grabbing my napkin, I reached down and started wiping it off while a server came to clean up my mess.  \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Gently grabbing my hand, the man said, \u201cThese are just a cheap pair of sneakers; who cares if they get dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man took a seat across from me, I sat back down and said, \u201cI\u2019m usually not that clumsy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; stuff like this happens all the time.\u201d Chuckling, the man said, \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d rather have iced tea on my shoes than have someone\u2019s coffee on my shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA server brought me a new iced tea; as I continued eating my lunch while we talked.  After hearing about Leslie\u2019s experience on her first date, I was glad the salad gave me something to do while he spoke.  The more I looked at him, the more I realized why other girls thought he was so attractive.  \u201cI\u2019ve been watching your show since High School; I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have a little crush on you back then.\u201d  With a smile, I wiped some dressing on my face and said, \u201cIf someone told me that I\u2019d be sitting at a caf\u00e9 chatting with Malcolm Tucker, I would have thought them insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip from his soda, Malcolm smiled and said, \u201cSo you\u2019re a fan of the show?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt bad about lying to the guy; even if it was only about some minor details.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve never missed an episode.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cIt amazes me how the writers have been able to keep it so fresh after 10 seasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere have been some instances where storylines were reused; but yeah, I guess they have done a decent job.\u201d Sighing, Malcolm said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a lot of fun working on the show; but to be honest, I\u2019m getting tired.  My contract came up for renegotiation last month; I\u2019ve kind of been stalling about whether or not to renew it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of the show coming to an end didn\u2019t sit well with me, but I couldn\u2019t blame the guy for getting fatigued.  Looking at Malcolm, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what would you like to do after the show ends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just finished filming a movie last month; it comes out around Thanksgiving.\u201d Sighing, Malcolm said, \u201cIf it\u2019s successful, I\u2019d like to transition to the big screen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to what Malcolm had said about his enjoyment from working on the show, I recalled my encounter with his costar at the airport.  \u201cI have to admit; after bumping into your costar at the airport, it\u2019s hard to believe working with her could be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid Elena leave you with a bad first impression?\u201d looking at me, Malcolm said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, but she\u2019s a really sweet person once you get to know her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at that idea.  \u201cSorry, but what chance does a small-town girl from New Jersey have to get to know a TV star.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking for almost an hour; so I\u2019d say the chances are really good.\u201d Pausing, Malcolm said, \u201cIt just dawned on me that you know who I am, but I don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s remedy that, shall we?\u201d extending my hand, I said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my hand, Malcolm said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Amelia.\u201d Looking past me, he said, \u201cWhat do you know, it looks like you\u2019ll get a chance to meet Elena after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I saw Elena Johnson walking towards us; her demeanor much different from when I\u2019d encountered her at the airport.</span></div></div>",

What agency?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment I forgot the name of the agency; try as I might, I couldn\u2019t remember it.  \u201cYou know what, I-I\u2019ve completely blanked on the name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem, I hope you nail the interview.\u201d Smiling, Elena said, \u201cWhat were you guys talking about when I showed up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing major, just my plans for once the show\u2019s over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you, Mr. Big Shot with your big screen movie.\u201d  Groaning, Elena said, \u201cAll I\u2019ve got is a role in some Christmas movie on Hallmark Channel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey it\u2019s a start, right?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cWhat's it about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Christmas movie on the Hallmark Channel, so the same thing as every other movie they\u2019ve done.\u201d Sighing, Elena said, \u201cSome big-shot executive, with an 8-figure salary, returns home and throws it all away to be with some boy she knew in High School. I play the part of the guy\u2019s kid sister; who fixes them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey if Kevin Bacon and Holly Hunter can get their start being killed in slasher movies, you can make a Hallmark Christmas movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Elena said, \u201cYou sound just like my agent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not there yet, but that\u2019s the dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of us continued talking, I began to notice something: when I was talking, Malcolm was focused on my lips.  When he, or Elena, spoke he would look at me \u2013 not just my boobs and butt, the way so many men had, but <i>all{/i) of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe kept talking until my salad and iced tea were gone, and then we went our separate ways.</i></span></div></div>",

As I drove onto the freeway, I found myself remembering that LA was notorious for rush hour traffic; and hoped I didn\u2019t have an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully I didn\u2019t experience much in the way of traffic; getting back to the house just before 5:00 to find that Caitlin\u2019s car was in the driveway.  As I got out of the car, I remembered my desire to have a friendship with Caitlin.  After locking my car, I walked up to the front door and let myself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I did, I heard Caitlin\u2019s voice coming from down the hall; it sounded like she was talking to someone.  Going down the hall, I found Caitlin spread out in the breakfast nook having a conversation with someone over the phone.  \u201cShe seems like a nice enough girl, Mom; but after what happened with Carly, I want to exercise some caution.\u201d Looking up from the phone, Caitlin saw me standing in the doorway.  Throwing me a wave, she returned to the phone call, \u201cNo Mom, I haven\u2019t spoken with Carly or Brandon since they moved out; and frankly I don\u2019t know if want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling thirsty, I walked over to the fridge and opened it; grabbing a can of diet coke from the door.  As I opened it, I heard Caitlin say, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, Mom; I\u2019ve got to start making dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she hung up the phone, I looked at her and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop on your conversation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Getting up, Caitlin placed the phone back on the charger.  \u201cI\u2019m making chicken tetrazzini for dinner, you want some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, that sounds nice.\u201d As Caitlin walked by me, I said, \u201cAbout this morning; I want us to be friends, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel we got off on the wrong foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s not rush into things, Amelia; I\u2019ve been burned because of that before.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cYou seem like a nice girl, but I think we should get to know each other a little better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that cautious attitude have anything to do with Carly or Brandon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin looked me; a look of anger briefly flashing across her face.  \u201cCarly was my college roommate, and Brandon was my boyfriend.\u201d Sighing, Caitlin said, \u201cThe three of us lived here, together, for three years; until I found out that they\u2019d been sleeping with each other behind my back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh; I guess I can understand you're being cautious around me then.\u201d Looking at Caitlin, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of girl to sleep with someone\u2019s boyfriend, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner took about an hour to make, even with some help from me.  She was still somewhat reserved, but Caitlin had opened up a little bit.  The two of us were sitting at the table, eating and talking.  \u201cYou know a decent amount about me, Amelia; but I don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d Looking at me, taking a bite, Caitlin said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell, really; I\u2019m from New Jersey and I\u2019m the first in my family to go to college.\u201d  Sighing, I said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with the life I had back east, so I went to New Horizons and they helped me get my life back on track.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve only heard a little bit about what they do, something about making changes to a person\u2019s life or something like that.\u201d Chuckling, Caitlin said, \u201cI honestly never gave them much thought until one of their reps came by, offering me $1500 a month to let you live here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if they\u2019re giving you $1500 a month, shouldn\u2019t that more than cover my rent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you don\u2019t beat around the bush; do you.\u201d Putting her fork down, Caitlin said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; let\u2019s see how things go for the next few weeks.  If we don\u2019t kill each other, I\u2019ll put the $1500 towards your monthly rent; all you\u2019ll have to do is chip in some money for utilities and groceries.  How\u2019s that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on my face, I nodded and said. \u201cI think I can live with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you\u2019ve asked me some personal questions, I hope you don\u2019t mind if I do the same.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cWhat exactly did New Horizons do to help you get your life back on track?  Pay off your debt?  Take care of some legal troubles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hesitant to come clean about this so early, but I figured there was no harm in it.  \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t anything like that.\u201d Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cThey changed me from a 14-year-old boy to the 26-year-old woman you see before you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I started to feel weirded out, worried that she was going to have a less than positive reaction.  When she finally spoke again, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no possible way you could\u2019ve been a 14-year-old boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaitlin, I promise I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI was extremely unhappy in my former life, bordering on the suicidal, so my former family brought me to New Horizons.  After answering some questions, and being injected with some nanites, I became the woman you see before you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then went on to explain the process I went through to become Amelia; from the interview to the psychological evaluation and life design to the procedure itself.  By the time I was finished, Caitlin was pacing around the kitchen floor.  \u201cLet\u2019s say I believe you, which I don\u2019t by the way; why would a 14-year-old boy decide to give up 12 years of his life and become a woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t give that much thought; I just figured I\u2019d try for something completely different from my former life.\u201d With a slight grin, I said, \u201cWhat could be more different than becoming a 26-year-old woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me if this is at all inappropriate, but I just have to ask.\u201d Walking over to me, Caitlin knelt in front of me and said, \u201cAre you... how should I put this, 100% female?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as much a woman as you are; right down to my ovaries and my uterus.\u201d With a pause, I said, \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m due for my first period in a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Caitlin asked me a few more questions before I went upstairs to retrieve the photos I\u2019d gotten from Kelsey.  As she looked at them, Caitlin said, \u201cI chickened out on getting a tattoo, but here you went through such a dramatic transformation.\u201d Putting the photos down, she said, \u201cThat must\u2019ve been hard to leave your family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was, but we all knew where I could\u2019ve ended up had I not gone through with this.\u201d Gathering up the photos, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019ll never see them again; I\u2019ll wait a few months before I fly back to see them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Caitlin looked at me now, I saw no hint of the girl I\u2019d first met this morning.  Taking a seat next to me, Caitlin said, \u201cI know we just met, but it means a lot that you trusted me with your story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you took it all in stride; I was worried that you\u2019d react negatively.\u201d Breathing a sigh of relief, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have someone, out here, who I can talk to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is California, girl; and it\u2019s the 21st century.\u201d Looking at me, a smile on her face, Caitlin said, \u201cOur state motto could be changed to \u2018Cool, yo' and no one would bat an eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt still means a lot that you\u2019re so understanding about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one thing I\u2019m curious about; you\u2019ve only been a woman for a few days, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure where Caitlin was going with this so, looking perplexed, I said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019ll be 5 days tomorrow.  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much do you know about being a woman?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you knew very much going in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuring the procedure, they gave me all the basic knowledge I\u2019d need; hair and makeup, how to handle a bra and walking in heels.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to learn about flirting; and, as one my girlfriends would say, I can\u2019t hold my alcohol yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can help you with the flirting; especially considering what happened with my last boyfriend.\u201d Getting up, Caitlin retrieved a bottle of wine and some glasses.  Walking back over to me, she said, \u201cBut I think I can help you with the second; what do you say to some inexpensive wine and a chick flick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin and a chuckle, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve heard all day.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Okay, so maybe the movies were playing in the background while we drank wine and talked.  We both spoke about our childhoods and families; I wouldn\u2019t say we were friends yet, but I figured we were well on our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up the next morning to my alarm clock, I found that I didn\u2019t feel as hung-over as I had previously.  After making a mental note to stick with wine instead of hard liquor, I climbed out of bed and made my way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to step into the shower when I heard a commotion outside; going over to the window, I noticed a handful of older children getting onto a waiting school bus.  I then remembered that today would\u2019ve been Kevin\u2019s first day back at school; I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how things would go for Kelsey and my friends now that word of my \u2018death\u2019 had gotten out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then reminded myself that that was no longer my concern; Kevin\u2019s life was behind me now, I was living Amelia\u2019s life.

The longer I sat there, the more anxious I started to get \u2013 I began to wonder if the others in the room could tell I wasn\u2019t what I seemed.  I then reminded myself that that was absurd; after all, I was both physically and mentally a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy interview was the second to last one; both the man and one of the women were called in before me.  I started to get nervous again, this time because of the interview itself.  It didn\u2019t help that the man came out of the room drenched in sweat. He\u2019s not getting the job.  To help with my anxiety, I decided to strike up a conversation with the other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, I walked over and sat down next to her, \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m pretty nervous about all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, a slightly younger woman of Asian descent, turned to face me.  I was taken aback when I saw the look of contempt on her face.  \u201cI\u2019m not nervous at all; one call from my father and I can get any job I want in this town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all I needed to hear to know that this woman was incredibly spoiled; she was probably only interviewing for the job because her \u2018daddy\u2019 was making her.  I didn\u2019t want to be rude, but I also didn\u2019t want to talk with her.  Getting up, with a fake smile, <br>\r\nI said, \u201cWell good luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully I didn\u2019t have long to wait; barely a minute after I got back to my seat, the second candidate came walking down the hall along with another young woman.  After thanking the candidate for coming, the woman looked into the room.  \u201cAmelia Webber?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here goes nothing.</i> Getting to my feet, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s me, I\u2019m Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took it as a good sign that my interview lasted longer than the first two combined; although I was still incredibly nervous the entire time.  The woman I was interviewing with, Meredith Geller, was slightly older than my\u2026rather Kevin\u2019s mom had been.  The position I was interviewing for was to be her assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time I was answering questions, I feared that she would realize my degrees and job experience were faked.  To be fair, the job experience was faked but the degrees were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just finished answering one of those \u2018where do you see yourself in 5 years\u2019 questions; saying that I hoped to become a talent agent as well, maybe eventually open an agency of my own someday.  For some reason or another, Meredith liked my answer.  \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got all the information I need.\u201d Getting to her feet, Meredith reached out her hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the job, Ms. Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that I was relieved would be an understatement; all my anxiety and nervousness had been for naught.  After realizing that I\u2019d gone almost a minute without responding, I quickly grabbed Meredith\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThank you so much, ma\u2019am; you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us walked out of the room; where she introduced me to the woman I\u2019d be replacing.  By pure coincidence, the spoiled woman from before was walking out of the nearby bathroom when Meredith said, \u201cBrianna; I\u2019d like for you to meet your replacement, Amelia Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brianna got to her feet, I swear I saw the other woman giving me a death stare.  She turned and walked out in a huff, while Brianna said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine, Brianna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the two of us, Meredith said, \u201cBrianna is leaving us for an administrative job at Pixar; she\u2019s leaving some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re up to the task Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed for a few more minutes; chatting with Brianna and learning that my training would start on Monday.  I was grateful for that because it gave me four days to relax beforehand.  After once again, thanking Meredith I gathered my things and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew she was probably busy, so I decide to simply text Leslie \u2013 <i>I got the job!</i>  Getting into my car, I plugged in the address for Paramount and drove off for my lunch with Caitlin.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d become mildly annoyed by the traffic by time I drove through the gate at Paramount.  After giving my name to the guard, I was given directions to where I needed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI parked my car in one of the visitor spots outside of Caitlin\u2019s office and walked inside.  After taking the elevator up to Caitlin\u2019s floor, I walked up to the receptionist.  Trying my best to look professional, I said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Amelia Webber, I\u2019m here to see Caitlin Saunders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Ms. Saunders doesn\u2019t take walk-ins, ma\u2019am.\u201d Looking at me, the receptionist said, \u201cI can give you her number if you\u2019d like to make an appointment for an audition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little annoyed by the thought that I was someone walking in from the streets in the hopes of getting an audition.  \u201cSorry, I think there\u2019s been a mistake; I\u2019m not here for an audition.  I\u2019m Caitlin\u2019s roommate; we\u2019re having lunch together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist went pale as a ghost, as if she\u2019d made a horrible mistake, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, ma\u2019am; I\u2019ll let her know you\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a seat in the waiting area while I waited for Caitlin to come out.  The receptionist, probably trying to make up for her mistake, offered me water but I politely declined.  I was only waiting a few minutes before Caitlin walked down the hall.  Upon seeing me, a smile on her face, she came over and hugged me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, she led me down the hall to her office.  While we were walking, she turned to me and said, \u201cHow\u2019d the interview go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on my face, I said, \u201cI nailed it, I start training on Monday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl I knew you were going to nail that interview.\u201d Stepping in her office, which was a pretty decent size, Caitlin said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a seat; I just have to send out some emails and then we\u2019ll go to lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took a seat, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not that hungry yet; I was wondering if we could take that tour first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from her computer, Caitlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s totally up to you, we\u2019ll do whatever you feel like.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As we waited for the elevator to arrive, I decided to pass the time by regaling Caitlin with the story of my encounter with that woman at the interview.  \u201cI\u2019m sure you probably see people like this all the time; but while I was waiting for my turn to be interviewed, I decided to strike up a conversation with this other woman in the waiting room.\u201d sighing, I said, \u201cWhen I asked her if she was nervous, she told me that her father could get her any job she wanted with just a phone call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, I hate people like that; they\u2019re so spoiled.\u201d The elevator arrived at that moment.  As we walked inside, Caitlin said, \u201cI remember, last year, auditioning this teenager for a spot on some reality TV that didn\u2019t even make it to air.  She was terrible but I had to give her an audition because her father was some big executive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt amazes me that people think that\u2019s how the world works; that they\u2019ll get anything they want solely because of who they\u2019re related to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not exactly the same, but you\u2019re only out here because you went to New Horizons.\u201d Looking at me, as the elevator started its descent, Caitlin said, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t become a woman and moved out here, who knows who could have gotten that job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood there I realized that, in a way, Caitlin was correct.  The big reason I got this new job was that I went to New Horizons.  Then again, they just changed me and gave me the necessary education; I was the one that wowed Meredith at the interview.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m like that other woman, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gravity of what she said must\u2019ve dawned on Caitlin; as her eyes went wide and she looked at me.  \u201cNot exactly; sure you got that job with help from someone else, but you\u2019re nothing like that other woman.\u201d With a short pause, Caitlin said, \u201cAt least from what little I\u2019ve seen, and heard about your former life, you\u2019re the polar opposite of that woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Caitlin didn\u2019t believe that; that she actually thought I was in the same boat as that other woman.  But in an attempt to change the conversation, and keep the two of us from arguing in an elevator, I said, \u201cSo what\u2019s the food like here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely overpriced, but it\u2019s actually quite good.\u201d Looking at me, Caitlin said, \u201cI can guarantee it\u2019s better than anything you\u2019d get for lunch at school.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m on the shortlist to replace my boss when he retires next year.\u201d Sighing, Caitlin said, \u201cReally the only regret I have is staying with my ex for 5 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought back to the terrible luck my mom had dating after my dad left; a lot of her dates bailed the moment they learned she had two young kids.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for Caitlin having put all that time and effort into a relationship, only for her ex to cheat on her.  \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been <i>that</i> bad; after all, you were together for 5 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis coming from a former 14-year-old boy who, on her first day as a woman, thought it would be wise to strip in front of half a dozen children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that little story would come back to bite me; I just figured it would take longer.  Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cFirst off; I was drunk.  Secondly; there were only two kids at the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked as if Caitlin was about to say something else; until she got all jumpy for a moment.  \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but a <i>very</i> cute guy just walked into the room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that perhaps it was a co-worker of Caitlin\u2019s that she liked, I turned around to look; only to discover that it was Malcolm.  The sight of him walking through the buffet line caused me to blush.  I don\u2019t know what came over me, but I stood up and hollered, \u201cMalcolm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room turned to face me; as Caitlin, looking mortified, grabbed me and pulled me back into my seat.  \u201cWhat are you doing!?  He\u2019s an actor, you can\u2019t just...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin stopped midsentence as Malcolm stopped in front of our table.

Once she got her voice back, her mouth agape, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re on a first-name basis with Malcolm Tucker; star of <i>Double Trouble</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat at our table, Malcolm said, \u201cWe met at the airport yesterday; she dropped her passport and I retrieved it for her.\u201d With a grin, he said, \u201cThen we met again at a caf\u00e9 in Venice Beach, where she slipped a glass of iced tea on my shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Caitlin, I said, \u201cAfter Elena showed up, the three of us spent almost an hour talking with each other.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I suppose I couldn\u2019t blame her, but I couldn\u2019t help but be a little annoyed by her acting like a fangirl.  She wouldn\u2019t stop asking Malcolm questions about the show, or other celebrities that he\u2019d worked with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm, to his credit, answered every question; but I couldn\u2019t help but notice he was focusing his attention on me.  I\u2019d already told him everything the day before, so all that was left was just idle chit-chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Malcolm\u2019s break came to an end and he went back to the set; but not before taking a quick selfie with Caitlin and me.  As Caitlin and I walked out of the commissary a few minutes later, she turned to me and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe how dull my life was before you showed up.\u201d Stopping in the parking lot, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s the longest conversation I\u2019ve had with an actor that wasn\u2019t work-related.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we continued walking, I said, \u201cMalcolm seems like a pretty down to earth kind of guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus he was totally flirting with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn to stop; turning to Caitlin, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?  Malcolm was not flirting with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was so flirting with you, Amelia; and, at least subconsciously, I think you were flirting with him as well.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cForget for a moment that you used to be a teenage boy; have you ever known a guy to spend 30 minutes talking with an attractive woman about the weather?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I thought about it, the more I realized that Caitlin may have a point.  With the looks that he'd been giving me yesterday, plus the fact 30 minutes of idle conversation over lunch, there was a distinct possibility that Malcolm was at least interested in me.  \u201cEven if we were flirting with each other, he\u2019s way out of my league.\u201d Sighing, as we crossed the road going towards a row of parked golf carts, I said, \u201cHe\u2019s an actor and I\u2019m a glorified secretary; I couldn\u2019t get a guy like that in a million years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe heart wants what the heart wants, Amelia.\u201d Taking a seat in one of the carts, Caitlin said, \u201cMark my words, very soon Malcolm will be asking <i>you</i> on a date.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Actually, in a sense, I guess I was \u2013 Kevin died on that hospital bed.  <b>That must be an awkward situation for you guys to be in; telling people I\u2019m dead when I\u2019m not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah it is, but it\u2019s a price we\u2019re willing to pay for you to be happy.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat response served to show how much my family loved me, and what they were willing to sacrifice for me.  A stray tear rolled down my cheek as I started typing.  <b>There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll ever be able to repay you and mom for this.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation remained like that for a short time; as Kelsey caught me up on everything that\u2019s happened since I left.  I couldn\u2019t help but think, however, that she was holding something back.  I had an idea of what it might be, but I couldn\u2019t prove it until she said: <b>Was that you that I saw parked across the street yesterday morning?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at that message for a moment, taking a sip of my wine while I thought about my response.  Taking a deep breath, I reached forward and started typing: <b>Yeah, that was me.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey didn\u2019t respond for a few moments; likely trying to wrap her head around the fact that I was now a woman.  <b>Why did you drive off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I was nervous; I wasn\u2019t sure how you\u2019d react to the new me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI always knew there was a possibility that you\u2019d come out of this a woman, but I have to admit, I\u2019m a bit surprised.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then proceeded to type out a lengthy description of what happened after they dropped me off.  <b>I wanted my new life to be different, and being a 26-year-old woman was very different from my old life.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I suppose I shouldn\u2019t fault you for wanting something different.</b> There was a slight pause before another response came through.  <b>I didn\u2019t get a very good look at you before you drove off; any chance you could send me a picture?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery picture I\u2019d taken since yesterday had been uploaded to my computer; so I chose the one of me with the girls from NHI and the one that Malcolm took with me and Caitlin.  That last one I sent solely to see how Kelsey would respond.  <b>Here are some photos.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Kelsey responded.  <b>Did you seriously get to meet Malcolm Tucker?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as I wrote my response.  <b>That\u2019s right; I bumped into him and Elena Johnson at the airport yesterday.  That photo was from earlier today; I was meeting my housemate for lunch and he joined us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m so jealous of you right now.</b> There was another brief pause, followed by another response.  <b>You look great in those photos by the way; I can honestly say that\u2019s the first genuine smile I\u2019ve seen you give in a long time.</b> Another pause. <b>I never thought I\u2019d say this about you, but you make an attractive woman.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the time on my computer and saw that it was almost 3:00; which meant that it was 6:00 for Kelsey.  <b>I\u2019m sure Mom\u2019s probably getting dinner ready for you guys; I\u2019ll let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll talk you to later on, Kev...wait, what\u2019s your name now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia Webber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll talk to you later, Amelia.

I was still in the sunroom, watching some birds flying around the backyard when I heard my cell phone start to ring.  As I reached for it, I saw the caller ID said \u2018Mom &amp; Dad.\u2019  With a smile on my face, I answered the call and said, \u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was greeted by the cheerful voice of my mother, who said, \u201cHi sweetie, did I catch you at a bad time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had hoped for a little peace and quiet, but I wasn\u2019t going to tell her that, \u201cNo Mom, I\u2019m just relaxing in the sunroom.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve had kind of a stressful day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you sounded a little tense.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a smile creep across my face; she may not be my biological mother, but Joanna was certainly treating me like she was.  \u201cI nailed my job interview, so my day started out great.\u201d Grabbing my glass of wine, I said, \u201cI met my housemate, Caitlin for lunch; she works over at Paramount.  I thought we were making progress towards a friendship, but it turns out she was just using me to further <i>her</i> career.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then proceeded to explain everything that\u2019s happened between me and Caitlin since I arrived.  That went on for 20 minutes, during which time I would occasionally raise my voice.  Once I was finished, Mom said, \u201cWhile I don\u2019t appreciate anyone treating my daughter like that, I can see where Caitlin is coming from.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cIt sounds like she was quite close to her college roommate; so much so that her faith in people was shattered after she learned of her boyfriend\u2019s infidelity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know why that hadn\u2019t occurred to me until that moment.  Now that I saw it from that perspective, I realized that Caitlin\u2019s supposed hostility towards me was just a defense mechanism.  \u201cI guess I could give her some space; after all, we did just meet yesterday.\u201d With a chuckle, I said, \u201cI guess I got so caught up in wanting to make new friends, I forgot that some people want to take things slow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the front door open at that moment; I turned and caught a glimpse of Caitlin walking down the hall towards the kitchen.  I turned my attention back to the phone as Mom started speaking again, \u201cI\u2019m sure you two will become friends in time, just take things slowly.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cBefore I let you go, sweetie; are you going to be free tomorrow afternoon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m still new to Los Angeles so I might want to explore some more.\u201d Getting up from the couch, I said, \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour brother and sister are stopping by for your father\u2019s birthday; I figured you\u2019d want to meet them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a momentary brain cramp until I remembered they were also the \u2018parents\u2019 to a teenage boy attending a private school in New York.  I suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt to meet him and my sister.  \u201cSure, why not; I\u2019d love to meet them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent, let\u2019s plan to have a video call around 3:30 your time.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked into the kitchen, I said, \u201cTalk to you later mom, love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I ended the call, Caitlin looked at me and said, \u201cI assume that wasn\u2019t Kevin\u2019s mom you were talking with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d assume correctly, although I did have a chat with my sister earlier.\u201d Placing my things on the counter, I said, \u201cLook, about what happened at the studio...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize; I realize that I was out of line.\u201d Stepping forward, Caitlin said, \u201cI would like to be your friend, Amelia; and not just because you work for a talent agency.  I\u2019ve just been burned before, so I want to take things slow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Caitlin, feeling a little apprehensive, I said, \u201cSo, are we good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her hand out, Caitlin said, \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I shook her hand, I said, \u201cGive me a few minutes to wash up, then I\u2019ll get started on dinner.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I just enjoyed walking in the sand, as the gentle waves washed over my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome motion caught my eye, and I looked, to see someone swimming to shore. My pulse thrilled when I saw that it was Malcolm, now walking toward me through the surf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached me, I opened my mouth to say hello, but he pulled me to him and kissed me full on the mouth. I responded by running my hands over his toned body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we continued to kiss, he began to take off my swimsuit. I, in turn, pulled his swim trunks off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were both naked, Malcolm gently guided me down on my back, then he climbed on top of me. As we made love, I could feel the pleasure building within me, greater and greater, until... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had had maybe one or two orgasms wake me up when I was Kevin, but they were nothing like what I felt now. I felt it, not just in my sex, but also in my breasts, in the way my lips tingled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lay there in bed, two things became crystal clear to me: I was most definitely attracted to guys now, and I was one of those lucky women who were capable of multiple orgasms.</span></div></div>",

I just thought we'd - oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reply, Leslie took my hand and held it to her belly. The baby kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my,\" I said. I'd always been interested in pregnant women, but it meant more to me now, since it could happen to me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might like that,\" Leslie said. \"This little guy drives me crazy sometimes, but he makes up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a boy, huh? How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to raise him better than I was, so he won't repeat my mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you well. You were saying before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I thought I'd keep you loose with your next lesson in womanhood: the chick flick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we watched a couple of movies. Back when I was Kevin, I would have turned up my nose at these movies, since they didn't have nearly enough explosions to keep me interested.

A 5 year old girl? Did I really want to grow up again? what if I hated that life and did it all for nothing. the 13 year old boy I cast out almost immediately. I'd already been a 13 year old boy once and hated it. even if I changed the gender it was too similar to what I was leaving behind. I paused on the 26 year old woman. could I really be a woman? I was intrigued but after remembering the struggles my mom went through as I grew up, I didn't want to risk that kind of life. that left the older man and woman.  I thought about Duncan and how happy he looked as Helen. He had become Helen based of a desire to be more like his grandmother. That wasn't for me.  that left one option. I would become a man's man and shake off the legacy my Dad left me.  I wanted a family that had a loving father, who was always there for his children. even if I had to build that family myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Dr. Willard smiled seeing my nervousness. \" Are you sure? Once we do this there is no turning back. \"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I knew I was making the right decision. \" I'm sure Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" Then Congratulations Kevin, you\u2019ve just made one of the biggest decisions in your life.\" she said jotting a note on my file.

I am happy, I am just very nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That is to be expected. You have a whole new life ahead of you. I am certain we will help you design an amazing life.\" Dr. Willard said kindly. \"Now if you are ready, I will take you down the hall to our life designers and one of them will help you design your dream life.\"   Dr. Willard motioned for me to follow and she led me down the hall to an office room where the lights where turned off. \"Oh dear, I didn't realize the time. they are all at lunch. Kevin, please follow me we will go to the waiting room. they should be done with their lunch shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    We walked down a hallway I hadn't been down yet. \"Um Dr. Willard, wasn't the waiting room back that way?\" I said slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"that was the intake waiting room. you are in the process of becoming someone else, so we have a separate and bit more confidential waiting room back here. That way if someone isn't deemed unsatisfied enough, they wont know you have been here by seeing you in passing.\"  we arrived at a door at the end of the hallway where another hallway intersected perpendicular to it. A sign on the door said \"VIP Waiting\". Dr. Willard Opened the door and turned to me and said \"This is where I will leave you. Good Luck Kevin. May you find Happiness. A Life Designer will be down shortly collect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    I walked into the VIP waiting room and took a seat. the seats where much nicer than the intake room.

I glanced around the empty room. A decorative  mirror hung on the wall opposite the door. It reflected light that hit my eyes in an uncomfortable way, so I got up and walked over to it. My reflection peered back at me. It had been my constant companion and I was about to give it up for a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saying goodbye Mr. Scott?\" A voice said, startling me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. uh....\" I stammered as I turned around to see a young woman in the door way. \"Call me... uh Kevin. I was just... uh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, that is what it is there for. I am Leslie Cummings, your Life Designer. It is a pleasure to meet you.\" Leslie said. \"If you would follow me, we will go to my work station and figure out what kind of body and life you would like to lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up to follow Leslie and she led me back down the hall Dr. Willard had led me through. we passed offices with the doors shut but I could see through office windows other patients that had been in the waiting room with me talking with whom I could only assume where other Life Designers. Leslie turned into a room and sat behind a desk.  \"Please Kevin have seat. Do you have any plans or Idea's on the life you want to design?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"plans? no I hadn't thought that far out. I'm not sure here to even start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm. okay\" she said tapping a pen against her lip. \"then we will start at the beginning. You need a name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A name?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yep first and last. well I guess you could keep Kevin, but I do recommend changing it. it makes the adjustment easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought hard for a few moments. My thoughts drifted to my old friends.  \"Call me David Williams\"  I finally said. It would be a way to honor my only friends by taking parts of their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good David. lets proceed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next hour answering Leslie's questions. What color hair, I decided a medium brown hair which was darker than my sandy brown hair, what kind of Skin color and physique and everything else in between.  I was going to be light skinned with a strong athletic build. I wasn't going to have to worry about gaining weight as I aged and I would be fit enough to be considered very attractive but I wouldn't need to work very hard to keep my physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"penile size?\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI choked. \"excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe smiled knowingly \"what size would you like your genitals to be David? and stop blushing we are both adults here. Heck I use to have a decently sized one myself a few years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wait what? you use to be a man?\" I said simply. \"what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes, I use to be a man. I was in my mid 40s when my daughter came out to me as gay and well, I didn't take it very well. I ended up alienating my family and caused a lot of pain.  I eventually ended up here at New Horizon and decided my new life would be just like my daughters. So I became a 22 year old lesbian. I married my wife 3 years ago and as you can see I am expecting. I learned to understand  my daughter and actually see her once a week, though she doesn't know who I use to be. But back to you.  we were talking about your sizing.  I guess I should ask this first. Straight or Gay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"straight.\" I answered promptly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you plan on becoming a porn star?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" I said thrown that, that could literally become a reality for me if I wanted. \"Should I just go with something average?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked at her computer then back at me, then back at the computer. \" No, if you don't care, then how about average size plus two inches. It would look normal with your build and be a nice present to any ladies you may pick up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed. \"if you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I do.  now do you want to see what you will look like David?\" Leslie said turning her computer monitor towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore me on the screen was a very handsome and athletic looking man.  \"what do you think? I know I wished I had looked that good at 37\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI liked it. but something about Leslie's comment struck me. \"could you adjust the age and make me 39\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sure thing, but why 39?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, I used my friends to come up with my name and my sister gave me photos to remember her. the only other person in my life was my mother and she is 39.\" I said with a matter of fact tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie made the adjustment and the image on the screen shivered and adjusted slightly matching the new age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"okay David, now to choose a career. do you have one in mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes, I do Leslie. I want to be....\"</span></div></div>",

More homes and businesses.\" I chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I tired my recruitment plug. Architect it is.\" she said  looking back at her screen.  \"now where to get the degree from.....mhmmm.\" Leslie muttered to her self. \"Oh, I know! MIT hasn't been used in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you can just assign a degree from any college?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what? oh no. not any college. But we have affiliated colleges and universities all over the country and we are beginning to expand abroad as well. MIT is one of our affiliated universities. Although they do stipulate that you be in the Alumni Association for the first 5 years.  That tends to work in our clients favor though anyways as it creates networking opportunities that could make your new life more successful .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sounds great.\" I said. \"but don't you have to be smart to get into MIT or be an Architect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes, but we take care of all of that.Our procedure gives you all the necessary skills and talents needed to succeed in the life you choose. Be that something simple like a woman understanding how to dress or apply make-up or in your case an Architect knowing how to build a home, and all the minute building code laws or complex mathematics to make the engineering work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, what about job placement? am I given a job or do I have to find one?\" I said, a bit nervous I'd have to interview for a field I currently knew nothing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"let me see...\" Leslie said, as she checked her computer. \"oh this would work nicely.  you might like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"like what? I said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh of course, sorry.\" she said turning the screen to face me.  \"given your age, it is a bit harder to find a firm looking for \"new\" architects and we don't have too many  firms we work with to place you, but we can if you don't like this idea.\"  I gestured for her to continue. \" well because your at an age where you should just be entering your prime earning years, we have the ability to set you up with your own architectural firm if it is located in Chicago. It does have strings attached to it though. so if it is a deal breaker let me know.  We would want to use \"your\" firm to design us a new clinic in Chicago. This would allow your new firm to gain business by having New Horizon under contract and it would allow us to better serve the Chicago market.  Also, we would want to be able to place workers at your firm. Be it younger architects, interns, Secretary or  Office temp workers.  What do you say David?  Or we can place you in a firm in either New York or Los Angeles.</span></div></div>",

That solution will both have a sedative and contain a cocktail of nanobots which will have been programmed based on the contents of the files you and Leslie created. Then while you are asleep the nanobots will get to work changing your body and mind giving you the traits, skills, and knowledge to lead your new life.  Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded an affirmative. \"alright then, before we get started is there anything else you need to do as Kevin Scott? any phone calls or last goodbyes, Or is there anything of Kevin that you want to keep? if not everything on you will be sent back to the Scott family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered the envelope that Kelsey had given me.  \"Um, this envelope that has pictures of my twin sister\" I said pulling it from a pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it in the tray, and take these. strip out of everything and put that robe on. And I do mean everything.\" she said slightly sticking her tongue out as she  jokingly handed me the robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later I was on a hospital bed with an I.V. hooked up to me as I waited for Liz to start.  \"are you ready?\" Liz said. I nodded. \" Alright, then when you next wake up you will be Mr. David Williams officially. Happy Birthday.\" she said as she hit a button on the computer.  The I.V. started to drip and my last conscious thought was of Liz humming Happy Birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                               ******************************** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dreamed I was back home watching a movie with Kelsey, Kyle and David. Some cheesy block buster. I looked at the doorway and mom came in and said why don't we watch a family movie. When I turned back around Kyle and David were gone.  \"sure thing.\" I said. my voice a bit deeper, more mature. \"oh what about this one Dad.\" Kelsey said as I looked towards her. already she seemed a little transparent.  \" or maybe this you might like this one Kev.\" Abigail said as I realized Kelsey was gone.  I was closer to moms age, although she wasn't my mom anymore. \" that was fun maybe next time we can watch a movie\"  I heard as an echo as the living-room and Abigail dissolved.<br>\r\nNew memories began to appear building on themselves constructing a new life.  I saw myself as a Kid, though I had darker hair, building a sandcastle. then as a teenager making a shed. I saw my first kiss. high school and college, my first solo project. faster and faster images came until a wall of light appeared and I entered through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke on a hospital bed. Liz siting behind the computer blowing bubble gum that matched her hair color.<br>\r\n\"morning sunshine. Happy Birthday David.\" she grinned.   I smiled feeling the five o'clock shadow on my face. with my hand I brushed the whiskers, grinning at the possibiity of growing a full beard if I wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you some clothes\" Liz said walking towards me with bundle wrapped under her arms.  \"once you're dressed we will get you ready to be discharged and you will be on your way Mr. Williams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got dressed quickly. I was strangely cold so I spent almost no time looking at my new self.  I through on a pair of khakis and dress socks, a white t-shirt and a blue dress shirt and dark red tie. I finished it off by putting on a pair of plain oxford shoes.  It didnt even click that I knew what I was wearing and how to put it all on effortlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz walked me to the discharge counter. Dr. Harris was waiting for me.  \"Dr. Harris hello, thank you so much.\" I said putting my hand forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. It is I who must thank you Mr. Williams.  we have been needing a Chicago branch for a while now. With you there as an additional asset, well to say I am grateful would be an understatement.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well when do I leave, it's a long way to Chicago\" I said smiling at how business like I have become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"actually we have a flight for you.....\"</span></div></div>",

In the mean time we have taken the liberty and booked you at a high end hotel not to far from the airport. Everything will be on us so enjoy and use the time to get use to your new life.\" Dr. Harris said. \"Also we will have car take you there and this weekend a shuttle from the airport will pick you up at the hotel. Now if you will excuse me, It looks like I will be needed shortly. Go ahead and wait in the waiting room, our car will be here momentarily.\" she said. As I looked up I saw a someone had entered the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat  down in the same chair I had previously sat in during my first visit to the waiting room. I noticed how much smaller the chair felt. Not that that was uncomfortable now just different, just as I was now different.  I realized Helen was doing the same thing earlier today as she waited for her driver. \"I wonder how everything went. I hope she got to see her sister off alright.\" I thought to myself.  I sat in thought for several minutes before I realized another person had entered the room.  A young woman had sat in a chair in the corner and was staring at me.  I looked up and smiled. she averted her eyes and mumbled an apology.  \" It's quite alright miss.\" I said.  \"poor girl\" I thought \"she looks like she has had it rough. hopefully she can get a fresh start.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you looking to start new too?\" the woman asked after a moment .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at her again before saying \"No, I have just started my new life. I am waiting for a driver to take me to my hotel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh.\"she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm David. It is nice to meet you Miss uh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Berkhart. I'm Katrina Berkhart.\" Katrina said gathering some composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you Miss Berkart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it hurt? the transformation and getting a new life... all of it?\" Katrina asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"only if you have loved ones you are leaving behind. otherwise physically no.\" I said as a man appeared in the door way. Katrina appeared to brighten a bit as she sighed in relief when I told her that it wasnt painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Williams, the car has arrived and is ready for you.\" the man said, before turning around and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck Ms. Berkhart, I hope you find happiness\" I said getting up to follow the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of traffic and driving across town I found myself in the lobby of a resort I had only seen in passing. I walked to the front desk where the desk clerk was and said \"Hello, I believe I have a reservation. I am David Williams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes, Mr. Williams. I have your reservation right here.\" the clerk said as he typed my name into his computer. I have you set for suite 626. Is that acceptable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will do just fine. Thank you.\" I smiled as I realized this was the first time I had ever checked into a hotel by my self before. my mother had always had to do it before and I never really paid attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"then here is your key. Our Bar is on the top floor, our pool is down our main hall  and to the left. There are of course restaurants across the street and a Mall and a Theater just past that. I hope you enjoy your stay Mr. Williams. please don't hesitate to call the front desk if you need anything.\" the man said handing me the key.  I walked through the lobby towards the elevators.  Seeing a large crowd of people and realizing I would not be on the first, and possibly second elevator I decided to take the stairs.   By floor 4 I was winded and floor 6 I was heaving.  I may have been fit and athletic but I was still 39 and could no longer run up stairs like a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking the wrong way down the hall, I eventually found my room.  Inside was a king size bed, a small hot tub Jacuzzi in one corner, and a large stand-up shower in the bathroom. on the far end of the room was a glass door leading to a large balcony with a table and chairs. I was impressed.  for the next few days this would be home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door startled me. looking through the peep hole I saw a bell hop.  \"package for you sir.\" he said as I opened the door. I gave him a small tip and closed the door.  I set the package on the bed and opened it.  A letter was the first thing I saw. it said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Mr. Williams,<br>\r\n     We hope you like your room.  inside this package we have put three sets of clothes, of various levels of formality, A swimsuit, and both a Cubs and Whitesox baseball hat. we apologize there is no business suit, but there will be one at your home in Chicago.<br>\r\n     We hope you will stay in contact with us outside of business as we do enjoy making new friends. On Thursdays many of the girls in the office adventure to the mall and theater, if you are interested. though we understand if a \"Fuddy Duddy\" like you doesn't want to be seen with surrounded by several gorgeous young women.<br>\r\n    Please take care, Love from everyone.<br>\r\n           NL. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed after reading the note.  I probably was getting close to fuddy duddy age. I certainly thought my mom was getting there.  Inside the package was indeed several sets of clothing. \"good I wont be stuck in business casual for the rest of the week.\" I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter a short rest I felt the urge to use the restroom. the stark white tile and marble counter top was eye catching. everything looked clean.  after using the restroom I felt the need to shower soon after as I realized my clothing was wrinkled from sweat from the humidity outside and my workout climbing the stairs. The shower felt great on my back and it gave me a great opportunity to see my body for the first time.  I enjoyed my well muscled physique  and was glad Leslie talked me into adding a few inches to my manhood.  I don't know if that was the teenager still in me or not but I felt proud of my body. A feeling that hadn't existed several hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I exited the restroom I realized I didnt want to spend my evening in the room. I wanted to go out I decided that tonight my first stop would be the.....</span></div></div>",

I wasnt going to walk those stairs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked up to the elevator the door dinged and a woman who appeared to be in her mid 30s exited the lift. My eyes were instantly drawn to her. She was beautiful.  Long blong curls draped to her shoulder blades, large matronly hips hugged by a scarlet dress.  My mouth gaped open slightly before I realized it and I closed it. Never before had I found a woman like that attractive. Sure she was pretty but as Kevin I would have found her too old and my eyes would have been focused on her average top half. Now however I saw a woman who could be a mother and I loved every bit of her even more.  She noticed me staring and I blushed embarrassed.  I uttered a brief excuse me, before boarding the elevator  leaving her to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about that woman as I decended the floors. It was the first time I had seen a true adult woman and thought \"wow she is beautiful\"  sure ive found porn stars attractive  but even then I focused on college aged actresses, someone closer to my old age. Even that was sparce as kelsey and my mom were nosey people.  It was because they were nosey though that they noticed my unhappiness and gave me the push to leave for my new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and I stepped into the lobby then made my way to the pool area. What I saw was chaos. Kids running, screaming, and splashing.  Teens either laughing or wishing desperately to be somewhere else.  The hot tub filled with parents wishing they were elsewhere while trying to keep one eye on there kids. The room as a whole was just a series of never ending echoes.  I tried to smile for myself. This is what I had wanted. As kevin I had loved the pool though mom was never a fan. I found an empty chair and took off my shirt. I slipped into the deep end only to find I could easily stand. I waded around the pool a bit disappointed but still determined to enjoy my self.<br>\r\nI felt a nudge as someone bumped into my back. Turning around i saw a brace faced  girl. I smiled and said \"thats okay.\" As she blushed and apologized to me.zhe looked like she was going to say more but I looked past the girl and saw a woman, who could only be the girls mother staring daggers at me, so I continued on. After a few minutes I gave up. Too many kids in the pool, too many parents in the hot tub and too many voices to relax on a bench. Disappointed I climbed out of the pool put my shirt on and walked back to my room. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I gave up on going out and exploring as I changed out of my swimsuit. It was getting late and my day had been unforgettably busy. I  ordered take-out Chinese food and had it delivered to my room. Soon after finishing my meal I fell asleep to the drone of television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up with the sun was a novel experience. As Kevin, I had tried to sleep as long as possible, but as soon as the sunlight reached my window I stirred. Groggy I got up and took a shower. Once cleaned up and dressed I still couldn't shake the grogginess from my head, and a growl from my stomach told me I was hungry. I peered into the rooms mini-fridge at the take-out food, but my stomach wouldn't accept it. It was then that I realized how early it was. The hotel would have breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakfast room was on the main floor off the lobby. As I exited the elevator the smell of coffee cleared my head. My stomach growled again as if saying \"that is what we want\".  I gathered a full plate breakfast food and a cup of coffee and found a small table in the corner of the room. I watched older couples sit and slowly gnawed on their breakfast, while business men rushed in grabbing a piece of toast and quickly returned to the lobby. Occasionally I got up to refill my coffee cup, and with each cup began to feel more awake. I found a newspaper on one of the tables and became engrossed in the business section, especially with an article on building trends in the mid--west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on I returned to my room. I spotted the note that I had been sent when New Horizon had sent me clothes.  The Idea of  meeting with several beautiful women for a few hours sounded like fun. I did however a few hours to kill before they would be off work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo kill time I found the hotel gym. It was a relatively small room, set back behind the pool area. Three treadmills, an arm hoist and a squat rack was about it for machines, though several free weight racks lined the walls. Seeing the room empty, I stepped on to a treadmill.  I had never been into fitness before but after trying the treadmill, I couldn't think of why I ever didn\u2019t like fitness.  I ran for miles with no problem. After seeing the five mile mark hit I really began to appreciate how fit my new life was. I would have been heaving for air after a mile as Kevin, but now I was warmed up and ready to hit the racks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat was pouring down my forehead when the gym door opened. I looked up as the woman from the elevator last night walked in. This time she wore spandex pants and a loose t-shirt with her hair pulled up into a high ponytail. I averted my eyes as she noticed me. I was determined to not be caught staring a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to be macho, I put a few more weights on the rack just in case she was watching, and was rewarded with a smile when she noticed. The woman then stepped onto a treadmill and began to run. My eyes drifted towards her, but when I saw her looking I quickly focused on my own work out. After an hour of  working out I could feel the fatigue set in. Once I finished my set I began to put the weights back onto a rack. The woman stopped her own set and smiled at me.<br>\r\n\u201cI saw you last night didn\u2019t I?\u201d she said. Her voice, smooth and welcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah. I had just arrived and was heading to the pool\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof. how did it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was loud, a bit chaotic. I didn't stay long.\u201d I said playing it cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Diana,\u201d she said, stepping forward to shake my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is nice to meet you David. How long are you here for?\u201d Diana asked casually. Though there was an interest in her eyes and I noticed she looked down at my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fly home Saturday morning\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh me too. Hey, I can see that you are getting ready to go so I won\u2019t hold you up but  if you are not busy Friday night I will be up in the Upstairs Bar. If you want to join me, I certainly wouldn't mind the company\u201d Diana said handing me a small card that had her name and what I assumed was her phone number on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I said putting her card into my pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d and left for the door, surprised that on day two  and my first full day as David I was already having better luck with the ladies than I had ever had as Kevin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
