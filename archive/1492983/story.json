It had, thus far, been a very slow night. A few vampires here and there, and but nothing out of the ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anybody there? The sooner we get this done, the sooner we can all go home...or...to hell...wherever's good for you,\" Buffy said, her thoughts wondering slightly as she considered where exactly the forces of darkness ended up after she had slayed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably just ended up as dust, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was growing rather bored of walking in circles; perhaps the demons of Sunnydale had finally realised that hanging around a graveyard was a little too obvious? Nah, they weren't that smart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SLAYER!\" A hissing voice roared from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about time,\" she smiled. \"Though you couldn't have thought of something more original to say to get my attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun around with a smile on her face, and pulled out her stake. She set eyes upon the source of the voice that had called her, and was was disgusted to see a large, fat demon woman pointing a chubby hand at her. Her smile turned to an expression of disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should really get off that whole 'people' diet,\" Buffy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese demon woman hissed at her. \"Your time is up Slayer, prepare to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Buffy frowned. \"Those are really going to be your last words? Sucks to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon screeched and charged towards her, or, as fast as it seemed to be able to move itself - it was more like a waddle. Buffy stepped aside, and the demon charged straight past her and tumbled flat on it's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not even trying are you?\" Buffy smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon was trying to lift itself up, but Buffy, bored now of it's tiresome behaviour, simply walked over to it and staked it through the back. The demon screamed and fell down, rolling over onto it's back and staring up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...curse...you!\" The demon hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, heard that before,\" Buffy shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon gave a gurgling noise and melted away into a green goo before Buffy's eyes. Buffy turned her nose up at the mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer dust to goo, anyday,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped her stake into her coat, and decided to call it a night. Taking one last look around her to make sure the graveyard was empty, she gave a tired sigh and headed for home. She considered the apparent 'curse' she had been cursed with, and guessed it was probably nothing to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the worst thing that could happen?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Buffy kind of laughed off the whole thing and finished off her rove of the graveyard. She wasn't even done with it when her stomach gurgled. Buffy was hit with a hunger pang like none she had ever had before. She grabbed her tight flat tummy. \"Oh. I guess I shouldn't have just had a salad for diner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy wanted to finish her rove of the graveyard but this incredible desire to eat hit her and was clouding her mind from thinking of anything else but food. Over and over in her mind stronger and stronger the desire grows until she says, \"Oh screw the rest of the patrol, I have to eat something. Just a little snack and back to\u2026to\u2026Okay\u2026a full meal but then... \" She clutched her stomach as it rumbled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy saw a cafe across the street from the graveyard. \"Funny I don't remember there being.... uhhhh\u2026oohh\u2026\" Buffy grabbed her growling stomach and just headed straight to the \u2018Gloria's Gluttonous Gulp &amp; Grow Caf\u00e9.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy ran as fast as she could and opened the doors to the cafe. It was empty except for a very, very fat and familiar waitress and a very fat group of women cooks in the back. Unknown to Buffy, it was the demon which had cursed her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy asked. \"Ah\u2026Have we met before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon smiled in her human form and replied. \"Oh no sugar - I am sure I would remember you. Now have a seat and let us whip you up something special for a sweet little thing like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy wanted to ask more questions but she was overpowered by her hunger. She sat down and before she could say what she wanted to eat, a stack of pancakes taller than her are placed in front of her at the table with 3 jugs of thick maple syrup and a very large mixing bowl of melted butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go dear get up I know you are hungry!\" the fat woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy would have protested if she were not so hungry. She didn't even bother with utensils and started eating pancakes as fast as she could get them in her mouth, breaking only to drink maple syrup from the jug or taking a large straw and sucking up the butter in the bowl. This went on for hours. The demon waitress kept the food coming after Buffy finished the pancakes. Biscuits and gravy for twenty people all for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stuffed her face, the enchanted food was taking its toll on her body. Her stomach was bloating up, pushing out against her tight clothes as more and more food filled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her fourth jug of buttermilk Buffy took a break and breathed heavily. \"Oh my, I can't remember being this hungry or fulfilled. I have denied myself all these years!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy at this point had gained quite a bit of weight from the demonic food and curse. She was a fit 123 pounds of tight muscle before, but now she was 180 pounds of flab. Her muscles were covered by fat. Her belly was the largest on her so far, closely followed by her ass, which had swelled out, to a huge size. Buffy had not even noticed the changes to her formerly thin, toned body \u2013 she had been so transfixed on her growling stomach and incredible hunger, that she had not even bothered to consider the effects the mountains of food she had been eating would have on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy\u2019s clothes are much tighter around her expanding body, her shirt had ridden up and exposed her bloated, flabby stomach, and her pants had been forced down her ass \u2013 exposing the top of her bulging butt. Buffy leant back in her chair and breathed out again, her belly was allowed more room to breathe, and suddenly the top button popped off of her jeans and flew across the room with a loud \u2018PING!\u2019. Her belly bulged out further, forcing the zipper of her pants down and exposing her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Buffy didn\u2019t seem to care, she just sat there rubbing her enlarged belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon then wheeled out the largest cake Buffy had ever seen. It was 5 feet high and 1 foot around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that real? It can't be real!\" Buffy exclaimed, licking her lips as her stomach began to rumble again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is very real Buffy, a special cake of mine, a devil food cake. And it is all for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was shocked. \"All for me. I mean I couldn't\u2026 I...\" Buffy\u2019s stomach growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon waitress got close to Buffy's butter smeared cheek and whispered in her ear. \"Oh Buffy. You don't really want to share this cake do you? I mean you work so hard at your job and you deserve - NO! You need that cake. That cake is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy says....</span></div></div>",

Please!!\" Buffy begged, her bloated belly jiggling as she tried to reach for the huge cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon waitress smiled wickedly and replied. \"All you have to do is sign this paper and you can eat for as long as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pen appears in Buffy's hand and she signs on the line. The line that now bids her, her powers and her soul to Gloria the Gluttony demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria takes the pen and paper and lets Buffy have at the cake. Buffy almost dives in the cake eating and eating like she has never eaten. At this point the Demon Gloria waves her hand and the cafe disappears. Gloria returns to her Demon form. Dark skin, horns and a tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy is gaining weight fast. Scooping up handfuls of the delicious cake and cramming them into her mouth, the hugely fattening magical cake is making her body grow even bigger. Her belly bulged out even more, and became heavier and rounder \u2013 taught with the food it was stuffed full of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy\u2019s jeans were losing the battle against her growing butt and chunkier legs, as she continued stuffing her face full of cake; they were forced down her legs and onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of weight she had gained in such a small time was incredible; her once slim body now bloating up like a balloon, as more and more food was crammed into the slayers mouth. Buffy couldn\u2019t help herself, her stomach was getting bigger and bigger, and she couldn\u2019t find a way to satisfy her amazing hunger pangs. As her body bloated even larger, she began to surpass 200 pounds of weight \u2013 and didn\u2019t stop piling on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothing was becoming more stretched as her body expanded in every direction, finally, her tight top was unable to take anymore, and burst into shreds as her enormous new breasts pushed out and popped off her bra. Her boobs must have reached G Cup, the way she was growing, and they plopped down onto her huge belly and sagged over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Buffy neared 300 pounds, Gloria wondered whether or not to help as she swelled even larger. Her panties turned to shreds as her ass enveloped them, and her face gained a prominent double chin as if out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was naked, eating and swelling fatter by the minute. First, for fun Gloria gave her new pet warrior a tail but not a demon tail, a pig\u2019s tail. Then pig hooves where her feet were. Then Gloria made Buffy's hands larger so she can eat more. Then she made her mouth larger, a foot across with big fat lips, big sharp teeth and a long tongue (3 feet) and demon horns on her head. Then Gloria waved her hand and Buffy had new clothes to suit her super fat pig demon body - a black 2-piece thong bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy finished the food and asked in a deeper darker voice. \"More! Moo...What....happened to the cafe? Your the Demon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria laughed at the 500-pound Buffy. \"Look in a mirror Buffy,\u201d and a mirror appeared out of thin air. \u201cYou are MY demon warrior now. You signed a contract for you soul. Come now tell me you love the new you?!\"</span></div></div>",

They surge up and out as they fill with fat. Soon her tits are so enormous and heavy, they sag off to the sides of Buffy's belly. Meanwhile, Gloria is pouring buckets of melted butter into the feeding tube, which floods Buffy's hips, ass, and thighs with even more fat and excess flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria estimates that Buffy now weighs nearly half a ton and shows no sign of slowing. Willow cackles like the redheaded witch she is, no longer under Gloria's spell. Willow has embraced her desinty to become her best friend's feeder. Under the care of Willow, Buffy will not only grow until she outweighs the entire Scooby gang, but also she will inspire the entire town of Sunnydale to fatten themselves up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now I have a mission for you.

I will give you some new powers which you will use to enact my plan. The first power is the fattening influence; everyone within a one hundred yard radius will find fat sexy and want to be fatter by any means necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy smiled wickedly, her chubby body jiggling as she nodded along eagerly to Gloria's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second power is the power of suggestion. Your voice will be a weapon. Like a pied piper you will tell people to eat more or eat fattening foods or just to do as you say and they will. And finally, you will be able to increase the fat content of any food in a 100 yard radius.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy smiled, and Gloria waved her hand in her new servant's direction.  Buffy's hugely fat, part demon body began to shrink like a deflating balloon. The enormous amount of fat that had been added to Buffy's body melted away into nothing, and within moments, she had returned to her formerly slim, athletic body. Her horns and hooves vanished in a flash, and a magical energy swept across her naked form, returning her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy grinned and put her hands on her hips. \u201cOh Master I can hardly wait to fatten up my old friends!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria grinned, as she too underwent a magical transformation. Her demonic image faded, and she regained her human disguise. \"Good, now go my servant, spread my curse of fat throughout this pitiful town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy walked out of the cafe, a wicked smile on her face, she could hardly wait to begin her new job.

It was cold out tonight, maybe that was it? Or perhaps it was that new leather coat she had gotten for her birthday, it looked awesome - but was hardly comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy shrugged off the feeling, and tried to quicker her pace, eager for the time when she would be back in her bedroom, and could undress and fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was quite a persistent feeling, Buffy finally decided to stop and check herself out. Perhaps the curse was that she would feel uncomfortable in whatever clothes she wore? Nah...that was stupid, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked down at her slim, atheletically toned body - a body any girl would have killed to have, perfect in every way. She noticed nothing odd, but decided to undo her leather jacket's buttons and make herself feel a little more comfortable. As she unfastened each button, she felt a sense of relief...and then she realised why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, usually toned, slim and flat...was bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Buffy asked herself, she hadn't eaten for hours. And the last thing she had eaten hadn't even filled her up that much, so why was her stomach looking bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy pulled her shirt up, and saw that her belly had bulged out a good few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...odd...\" she thought, then she remembered the curse again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it be possible this was some side effect of the demon's curse? Buffy didn't know, but giving her a mild case of bloating didn't seem to be a particuarly evil curse. Perhaps she had put on a little weight without realising it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy pulled her shirt back down, but left her jacket open as she continued home.</span></div></div>",

Her bloated stomach worried her a little, while it was hardly a massive weight gain - she couldn't afford to be out of shape, she would need to watch what she ate more carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally reached her house, pulled out her key, and unlocked the door. She slipped inside carefully and quietly, trying to be careful not to wake anyone, and headed up to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way up, she stepped on a squeaky floorboard, and winced as she heard a door open and somebody yawn. She turned around to face Dawn, who was dressed in her pyjamas, rubbing her eyes tiredly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Dawn. \"Your back. Good slayage tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much a big no show, got cursed...the usual...\" Buffy said, pulling her jacket closer together in case Dawn mentioned her bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cursed? You should check that out Buffy!\" Dawn said, sounding concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, in the morning,\" Buffy replied, eager to get to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the morning then,\" Dawn said stubbornly, and she returned to her bedroom and closed the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy entered her room and locked the door behind her. With a sigh of relief, she pulled her jacket off and tugged her shirt over her head, throwing her clothes in a messy pile in the corner of the room. She unbuttoned her tight, form fitting jeans and slid them down her strong legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed only in a black lace bra and panties, Buffy walked to her full body length mirror and looked at herself, she looked the same as always - beautiful, slim and toned...but there was that belly, a single oddity in her otherwise perfect form, sticking out and staring back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her hand to her slightly bigger stomach and stroked it, it felt quite soft, and not hard and bloated. Perhaps it was just her putting on a few pounds? On the other hand, it might be gone when she woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her belly and looked down at it. \"You better not be there when I get up in the morning!\" she said sternly, realising how silly it was for her to be talking to her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy unfastened her bra and let it fall to the ground, and as she looked down, she got the strange feeling that her breasts looked a little bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be seeing things, just because your a little bloated doesn't mean your getting bigger boobs Buffy...\" Buffy said to herself, but she couldn't resist turning to the side and looking at her breasts...maybe they had grown a little? That certainly wouldn't have been a bad thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy yawned, and stretched out, then slid her panties down her legs. She grabbed her comfortable silk pyjamas and slipped them on, they felt good against her skin. She climbed into bed, pulled the covers over herself, and before she knew it she was asleep.</span></div></div>",

Also her thighs, butt and arms were bigger. She looked at her body in the mirror and she now knew for sure what she thought to see yesterday, her boobs were bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I did want bigger boobs but only the boobs. Not my whole body!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy put on a shirt and noticed how tight it was. She knew she should probably were some wider clothes. She knew she had some in her closet but she didn\u2019t wore them normally since it was hard too kill vampires and demons if you clothes were loose on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn was in her pajama eating a bowl of cereal.

I think you're already fat enough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked at the box of cereal in her hand. She didn\u2019t want to admit it but she had no idea if the cereal could have effect on her body since the curse. They had calories in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I\u2019m going over to Giles\u2019.

Unfortunately, her tight pants made her running a little more uncomfortable down below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Buffy found what she had hoped for, there, lying on the floor in a gooey pile, was the green blood of the Obefat demon. Buffy squealed in excitement and pulled out her cell phone, she quickly rang Giles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giles, it's Buffy,\" she said quickly, too excited to stop for breath. \"The blood from last night is still here, come meet me in the graveyard and we'll get this spell sorted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right now? I'll be there as fast as I can! And I'll bring Willow, I dare say we'll need her help.\" Giles said, and hung up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy smiled down at the pile of green goo. \"You should have ran while you had the chance,\" she smirked triumphantly. \"I gotta stop talking to inanimate objects..\" she mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good fourty minutes of waiting, and poking at her doughy belly absent mindedly, Buffy finally saw Giles and Willow approaching in the distance, she waved across at them, and Willow quickened her pace and ran up to Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry we took so long, had some stuff to collect for the spell,\" Willow panted, out of breath. \"So, how are you doing? Giles told me about the demon, and Dawn made some...chubby the vampire slayer jokes...which I thought were in kinda bad taste...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy smiled. \"I'm all right,\" she said. \"But the less said about this the better...\" Buffy said, and she pulled her shirt up to reveal her bloated stomach, which actually looked a little bigger than it had earlier - more rounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...and that was just from one night?\" Willow asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy nodded, and pulled her shirt back down as Giles arrived and started setting down the spell ingredients on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't you worry Buff, we'll have that extra weight melted away in no time,\" Willow said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow began to assisst Giles with his things, and they scooped up some of the green blood and tipped it into a small cauldron, which they set on the grass in front of Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, we're ready,\" said Giles. \"Buffy, if you can sit down in front of us, you'll need to be close when we perform the spell,\" he told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy nodded and sat down on the floor, her stomach bulged out as she sat down and pressed hard against her pants, she was sure it had gotten a little bigger since this morning, and she spotted Willow give it a stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked away and she and Giles focused on the spell, dropping spell ingredients into the cauldron full of blood, which bubbled and smoked. They began chanting something weird that Buffy could not even begin to understand, as Buffy looked into the bubbling green liquid before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obe, obe, obe...reductious!\" Willow and Giles said together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy watched, wide eyed, as a purple cloud rose from the pot, began to crackle with energy and then shot straight at her and knocked her backwards.

Sometimes I miss him. I hope he's doing all right,\" Willow mumbled. \"Well you could ask spike if he... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not asking Spike. Besides do you really think he would help me?\" Buffy interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he would. He wouldn\u2019t tell you he would help, or let it look like it, but I think he will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want help off Spike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Buffy\u2026I won't say that I like Spike that much or even that he would help, but maybe you need to ask him. I'm sure he is better at finding and killing a demon then we are,\" said Giles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will help you Giles, but I think I better get some stretch pants first. If I keep growing like this these clothes are going to rip,\" Buffy said, looking down at her swollen midsection dubiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the top button on her pants popped off and flew into the air. Her pot belly spilled out further and pushed the zipper of her pants down, as her flab burst out and filled the gap that had been created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great,\u201d Buffy sighed. \u201cWhat do I do now? I can't go out in public like this!\" Buffy said, and she tried hard to suck her belly back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow put her hands on her friend\u2019s shoulders and looked her in the eyes. \u201cDon't worry Buffy. I\u2019ll get you some stretch pants we will get those demons. You know i could use some extra pounds. I always thought I was a bit thin. But how much more can you gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can believe Giles, it will go on forever,\" Buffy said sadly, realising her belly wasn\u2019t going to go back into her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! But won't you die if your weight gets too high? I mean, this has got to be dangerous!\" Willow said in a panicked voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well normally it would but in this case i don't think so,\u201d Giles replied. \u201cThe curse was used to make her fat. Not to kill her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles lifted the book again and looked in it, as though to confirm his hypothesis. \"Oh...\" he suddenly said, taking off his glasses nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Giles?\" Buffy asked, fearing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think i know why the demon attacked you.

It\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Willow assured her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles turned to Buffy as she stared at her big belly, a look of sadness creeping into her eyes. \"Buffy! Before you get to big to fight you need to find one of the daughters so we can get information,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy nodded. \u201cI know,\u201d she struggled a little to sit up, not yet accustomed to her extra pounds. \u201cAnyone want to give me a hand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow and Giles both took Buffy by the hand and pulled her up, her belly and breasts jiggled slightly as she stood up, and as they headed out of the graveyard, Buffy could feel her growing body shaking with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow took Buffy back to her place to find some clothes that would fit her expanding form. She reached into a dusty old wardrobe full of clothes that looked as though they had not seen the light of day in over a decade. Willow finally pulled out some baggy looking pants, dusted them down, and handed them to Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Buffy, my Aunt Sue was a big woman. These stretch Capri pants will fit with room to grow,\u201d said Willow, handing the pants to Buffy, who eyed them uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow reached into the wardrobe again and pulled out another rather large, ugly, looking blouse. <br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s is a big blouse too. Sorry for the colors and patterns.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy took a long hard look at the bizarre looking garments she had just been handed, and wondered just when the hell this \u2018Aunt Sue\u2019 had last visited. The pants were hot pink and the blouse was white with pink flower patterns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026\u201d said Willow suddenly, looking deeply into the wardrobe and sounding disappointed. \u201dSorry, I don't have a bra that will fit. But you haven\u2019t gotten too big for that one yet have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy frowned, but began to strip down and put on the clothes she had been handed, however ugly she thought they were \u2013 it was better than waiting until she ripped out of her current outfit. <br>\r\nBuffy felt ashamed of what she had become, although she knew it wasn\u2019t her fault\u2026she couldn\u2019t help but feel hugely embarrassed as she stripped off in front of Willow and revealed her growing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow got a look at Buffy\u2019s fatter body, and her eyes bulged. Buffy had lost all muscle definition, her once toned abs had become a bloated, pregnant looking belly and her breasts were practically overflowing her too-small bra. Buffy felt like her underwear would explode off her at any moment, but decided to leave her bra and panties on for now. She pulled on the plus size clothes Willow had gotten her, and pulled an unhappy face as she looked down at the mass of flesh beneath her, covered in flowery pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy guessed she had gained about eight or so pounds, most of it going to her stomach and breasts, but quite a bit going to her arms and thighs. However much she had gained, she felt enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything Willow,\u201d Buffy said. \u201cKeep looking for the information I need, hopefully we\u2019ll-\u201c suddenly, Buffy felt a churning in her stomach, she grabbed her chubby belly and groaned.  \u201cUhhhhh oohh\u2026my stomach is aching. I am so hungry\u2026you got anything to eat before I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked dubious, but Buffy could tell she knew she was in pain. \"Sure Buffy help yourself to the kitchen, just don\u2019t eat too much\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy made her way into the kitchen as Willow went off to do research. Her stomach still growling hungrily, she headed to the fridge and pulled the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy spotted a box of donuts and opened then up quickly. Buffy ripped open the box and tore through the box of donuts in minutes, stuffing each one into her mouth hungrily to try and relieve some of the pain in her chubby belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her hunger pains would not go away, she started eating anything and everything inside the fridge, unable to control her greedy urges. As time flew by, Buffy stuffed her face with everything in sight, whether it was chocolate pudding or leftover pizza, her belly began to bloat even bigger with the vast amount of food she was consuming, and she barely stopped for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour had passed, and Buffy had eating every single item inside the fridge, including all condiments. She wiped off her mouth and then looked down at the mess around her, her clothes are covered in food stains, and empty packets and crumbs are scattered across the kitchen floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cURP!\u201d Buffy let out a loud belch which eased some of the pain in her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy couldn\u2019t believe how much she had devoured, she would not have thought it humanly possible\u2026but perhaps she didn\u2019t have the appetite of a human anymore? Buffy felt an odd sensation in her bloated stomach and pulled up her flowery blouse to see her bloated gut swelling outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy almost screamed, but at the last minute\u2026she didn\u2019t. The swelling of fat feels... good. Buffy tries to dismiss the feeling and heads out the door, still bloated, but determined to get on with her mission looking for one of the daughters\u2026</span></div></div>",

Buffy was keen on ending the curse as soon as she could. She tried to think of a location where the sisters would be hiding. <i>\"Hmm.. If i were a obese hideous monster, where would i be at 11pm?\"</i> She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a sensation struck her body. It was a smell. Buffy inhaled it as if she were inhaling one thousand rose gardens at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My goodness, what is that beautiful Smell!?\".<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nBuffy followed the smell as if it carried her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust around the corner was a Jack In The Box restaurant. <i>\"Just what i need.\"</i> Buffy said to herself, clinging onto her growling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the building, looking around in curiosity.<i> \"Hello madam, may i help you?\"</i><br>\r\nBuffy looked back to see a young overweight teenage girl smiling at her from the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"um.. I'll have...just a cheeseburger thanks.\"</i> Buffy mumbled.<br>\r\n<i>\"sure, and a drink?\"</i> <br>\r\n<i>\"... no thanks.\"</i> Buffy replied with little enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy sat down at a near by table. <br>\r\n<i>\"I can't believe I'm here, i haven't eaten fast food in such a long time.....Oh c'mon Buffy! You need to think of a way to find these demons....concentrate!\"</i> She said to herself rubbing her temples.<br>\r\n<i>\"here is your meal Madam, please enjoy!\"</i> The young girl smiled as she continued to do her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy hesitated to eat it but the craving for food became too overwhelming for her, so she took a bite.<br>\r\n<i>\"That.. wasn't so bad... now i think i can last at least an hour before I'm hungry again.\" </i>She thought, trying to be positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the street lurking in an alley was one of the sisters observing Buffy through the main window of the building.<br>\r\n<i>\"What! she is barely even chubby. What a weak curse!\"</i> She hissed. <i>\"Let's have a little fun.\"</i><br>\r\nThe Sister began to chant loudly as she looked at Buffy, Buffy sat there in the restaurant completely unaware of whom was outside. Buffy's stomach growled again as she was just about to leave. So she decided to have one more bite. <br>\r\nBuffy picked up the cheeseburger and chomped down hard, but this time as she tasted it, the flavor was unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grease from the meat dripped onto her taste buds she couldn't help but drool.<br>\r\nshe quickly devoured it in complete delight.<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my god! This is the best food ever!!\"</i> She screamed.<br>\r\nOther customers couldn't help but stare as they saw her licking her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back up to the counter. \"I want an Ultimate Cheese burger! and with a chocolate shake! she demands slapping down $10 on the counter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later Buffy sat at her table with a big smile on her face, rubbing her ever expanding stomach.<br>\r\n<i>\"That was the best meal ever!\"</i> She declared.<br>\r\nBuffy could then feel herself gain even more weight all around her body as the curse was still in effect. Buffy's arms started to become tight in the blouse she borrowed from willow and as she wiped the crumbs off her face she could grabbed a small double chin. Buffy pulled herself up off the seat and walked out smiling, her body now slightly jiggled with each step she took, but for the second time that night, the growing fat on her body felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy came down from her fast food adrenaline rush, and she had realized what she had done.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm going to say this... but this actually feels good....\" She said to herself with her hand clutching fat from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still... i need to find away to stop this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She started to chug it; sweet cold liquid flushing down her throat. He unwrapped the second half family size bag of cheesy nachos and another can of pop. She picked up the can in one hand and a pile of nachos in the other, pushing the entire handful in at once and crunching around the enormous mouthful. She swigged and grabbed for more, swiftly getting into a rhythm of eat, swig, eat, swig, eat and swig, till Xander handed her another can, which she downed, slower than the first. She rested a hand on her stomach, getting cheesy fingerprints on the clean white shirt. She pour the last remnants of the bag into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finished that one slower than the last.\" Xander observed. He gave her another can of coke while he opened the cookies.</span></div></div>",

It took some steady chewing to get through the mass of doughy chocolate. She squeezed the rest of the four cookies together into a chunk and pushed it into her mouth, filling out her cheeks like an enormous hamster. She chewed and swallowed, and put in another folded up cookie. That went as fast as the first, then another, and two more. She stopped to drink the fifth can and Xander started to encourage her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Buffy, there's only three left.\" She downed the last of the can, shoved in all three whole cookies at once and tried chewing.

She continued to watch the hilarious parodying. She reached down for yet another brownie, and met wood again. She waved her hand a little. And a little more. She couldn't feel *any* brownies.

Yep, like she thought, Buffy was biting the brownie pretty much in half. She turned back to the movie. But every short while, there came the sound of Buffy's chewing. Brownie after brownie disappeared like a fascinating magic trick. She'd never been terribly interested by someone else eating, except in so far as she could imagine that it was really her who was eating like a glutton. But then, it had never been another woman before. Was she kind of bi? But only for women who stuff themselves or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was chewing the still warm brownies, loving the feeling of the soft, chocolatey food in her stomach. She actually didn't feel full, but that didn't make sense. She'd eaten her fair share of that other tray, hadn't she? And the cookies before that. And now she was making a large dent in this second tray. Then the final climactic scene started playing out on the television, and she was distracted again. Her hand returned again and again to the tray. She ate and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the credits rolled, Willow quickly put the now empty tray on the table.

But, to his surprise and joy, Buffy asked him to pass it to her and let her eat the last of the brownies by herself. Willow, who knew that up till now, Buffy had been the only one eating any brownies anyway, realised that Buffy was now going to finish of the last of *three* full trays of brownies, one after the other. She felt herself becoming just a little damp as she thought about it. She squirmed a little, holding her legs closer together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander gave Buffy the last tray. As the second movie started, Balls Of Steel, she started trying to push whole brownies into her mouth. Willow and Xander, who had seen this movie three times with Buffy already, stopped even pretending to watch the screen and chose to gawp at Buffy's gorgeous gorging. She wasn't entirely engrossed in the film either. Instead, she rubbed the bulge of her belly, which had begun to protrude from the gap in her pyjamas. Her top was riding up on the swelling hill of her belly and her pants were being pushed down. She kept shovelling the soft, chocolatey treats into her mouth and still, her stomach felt no pain. She mustn't have eaten that many of the brownies on the other trays. She felt fine, if a little full. She saw that the tray was nearly halfway empty, and tried eating even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Buffy had finished her mother's buffet of brownies, Xander had a father firm tent in his pants, and Willow had accepted that, yes, she really was *very* turned on by the thought of this girl gaining. Not just the thought that it could be her, but even just the fact that Buffy was stuffing herself. Xander saw that Buffy had fallen asleep shortly after her enormous snack. He heard her murmurring under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow had Buffy lying on her shoulder. They swivelled her a little, to let her lie down. Xander picked up her strong, but much too slim, thighs and rested them with reverence in his lap. Willow had lain Buffy's back on her lap, and was stroking Buffy's belly with one hand and her hair with the other.</span></div></div>",

Glad to be interrupted by report of a successful patrol, Giles allowed them to quiz him a little on the nature of magic and his mastery of the art. Apparently, it was far from unheard of for a Slayer to study the mystic arts, whether simply to better track and kill evil magic-users for their attempted apocalypse rituals or, in the case of many more long-lived Slayers, the use of magic themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn particular, Giles was unconcerned as to the possibility of Buffy ever becoming \"too fat to be a Slayer\".

Being typical teenagers, <i>of course</i> they took the opportunity to have mock lightsabre fights with their floating pencils in mid-air and projected thoughts to each other during boring classes.

She remained oblivious to just what that study group were really studying, and the fact that they finished early to patrol graveyards every night. She even remained oblivious to the fact that, as soon as Buffy was done eating a large, healthy meal at home, the study group got together and ate around the book table, with Buffy herself putting away as much as the others combined. </span></div></div>",

Another button popped off of her shirt. Under the increasing weight of her boobs, another two buttons exploded off of her shirt, as she squealed, and her breasts pushed forward with a wobble, with only three more buttons keeping them bound within the increasingly useless shirt. Dawn just stared wide eyed at her sisters growing cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This cant be happening!\" Buffy exclaimed, and as she spoke, she heard the sound of three 'pops', and looked down to see her enormous cleavage had torn through the last remnants of her shirt and left it wide open - her now massive breasts were barely contained by her bra, and sticking out a good few inches from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

Buffy would have followed her up, but she was worried that if she started walking her bra might give way...so for the moment she decided to stay still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Willow returned she told Buffy that...</span></div></div>",

Buffy sighed deeply, and looked down at her massive breasts - she guessed that having enormous boobs that overflowed her bra and kept her from even driving was worse than having tight clothes for a while. At least she hoped it would only be for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was me, I would have stayed with the giant boobs,\" said Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy sighed, really not that interested in Dawn's opinion right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, big boobs are pretty cool. Much better than having a big pot belly, a bubble butt...and...you know...even bigger boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo, and a double chin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy turned to the side and glared at Dawn, and she twisted her body round her bra snapped and flew half way across the room, hitting Dawn in the face. Buffy gasped in shock and covered her nipples with her hands, unable to hide her entire breasts due to their huge size. She went bright red, as she watched Dawn pull the now useless bra off of her face and throw it aside in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the look on Dawn's face just became one of amusement, as she burst out laughing at Buffy's predicament. Before Buffy could open her mouth however, Willow broke the silence by charging back into the room holding something in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Willow announced, before she stopped herself from colliding with Buffy again. \"Buffy,\" she observed, \"You realise you didn't need to take your bra off for the spell right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It burst off,\" Dawn said quickly, trying to sound serious. \"She got too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow almost laughed herself, and Buffy felt sure she was going to kill somebody in a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to blow this magic powder onto you and perform the spell, and you'll be back to semi-normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So basically, I'm going to end up back where I started?\" Buffy pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one way of looking at it...here's another,\" said Willow, and she blew the powder off of her hand and in Buffy's direction, adding the magic word, \"Even!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powder sparkled and twinkled in the air, and seemed to flicker and dissappear around Buffy. Willow nodded in satisfaction, indicating that the spell had been completed.</span></div></div>",

Buffy looked down, expecting her body to change at any moment. Although she hadn't really felt anything last time she had begun growing, except for the tightening of her clothes - she somehow expected to go through some kind of hugely painful transformation. Luckily, that wasn't the case, and Buffy quickly spotted her slim stomach bulging out very slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's working,\" Buffy said, as she looked down at her growing belly, slowly expanding out into a rounded shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy took her eyes off of her belly, and instead focused her attention on her breasts - which should have started to shrink as her weight evened itself out. Still covering her breasts with her hands, Buffy began to feel something moving behind her palms, and breathed a sigh of relief as she spotted her enormous cleavge beginning to shrink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow smiled in triumph. \"See, nothing to worry about. You should be back to...semi normal...in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy continued to hold her unsupported breasts as they shrank slowly, pulling back towards her body and returning to a normal size. She wasn't paying too much attention to her growing belly, which had started off rather hard and round, but was now losing some of it's definition and forming itself into a layer of flab that rested above the top of her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you've got a muffin top,\" said Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy frowned, and stared down. Dawn was right, she was developing a thick set of love handles which oozed over her pants...pants that were becoming incredibly tight now. Buffy saw that her breasts were still shrinking, as her belly pushed out and became chubbier. She could also feel her legs thickening, and pushing up against her sides of her pants as they became increasingly tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll finish this somewhere else...\" Buffy said, as she began to fear her pants would burst open at any minute and embarass her further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made for the door, stumbling a little as her body continued to change, and clumsily tried to exit the room, holding her changing breasts while her legs threatened to tear out of her now skin tight jeans...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling like she might collapse, and getting increasingly dizzy as her body began to swell - Buffy staggered out of the kitchen, leaving Willow and Dawn behind. It was bad enough that her body was growing like this, let alone having to endure other people staring at her like she was some kind of circus attraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed for the stairs, as her bulging belly continued to push against her tight jeans. She stopped at the foot of the stairs for a brief rest, and suddenly those steps looked like a mountain, one she was not looking forward to climbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, there aren't so many...you can do it,\" Buffy told herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to lift her leg, but her jeans had become so tight it was virtually impossible to move in them, let alone climb stairs. None the less, she willed herself to do it, bringing up her leg and stretching the fabric of her jeans to the limit - she hopped up onto the first step and let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...that was hard,\" she said, panting slightly from the effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did it again, and moved her legs onto the next step, but this time, her jeans had had enough, and simply refused to be stretched any further. The top button on her skin tight jeans popped open, and Buffy felt the most incredible relieving of pressure as her stomach bulged free and bloated out a good few inches, allowing it room to breathe. It looked a lot bigger than she had thought it was, and sagged down over her pants, which were still so tight around her legs that they stayed on perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, her belly being freed from the jeans had removed a lot of the pressure from her body, and Buffy was able to climb the rest of the stairs a lot more easily, with her belly shaking and bulging with each step she climbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the top of the steps, and smiled in triumph, almost forgetting for a moment she still had her growing body to deal with. Her face fell as she was reminded of that fact upon looking down at her belly, and she quickly moved into her room and locked the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally away from prying eyes, Buffy released the grip on her naked breasts and let them flow free. Willow's spell had worked just as she had said it would, and now her boobs had returned to a more normal looking C cup shape, rather than the monstrous mammaries she had posessed a moment ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, losing her gigantic breasts had meant the rest of her fattening up once more. And now she had a large pot belly which resembled a nine month pregnant womans stomach, bulging out over the top of her jeans, which were clinging to her body due to the expansion of her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms had a lost a little defintion, but not too much, and Buffy noticed that her face hadn't changed at all - which was a plus. Her gains mainly seemed to be in the belly and thighs, and, she suspected, her ass. Luckily, the growing had stopped for the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy turned to look at herself in the mirror, and sighed - she could hardly believe her jeans had stayed on, and she went to pull them down and change into something more comfortable. She grabbed the sides of her pants and tried to yank them down, but they didn't seem to want to budge - instead, she heard a loud rip, which made her jump and stop what she was doing. She turned around and looked at herself in the mirror, revealing a large tear across the back of her jeans, which revealed her bigger butt, and frilly lace panties stretched across it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap,\" Buffy pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled at her jeans with more effort and forced them down her thicker legs, straining and moaning with the effort it took to yank them down. Finally, they were off, and she kicked them across the room in frustration, as though they were responsible for the fattening of her body. She looked at herself in the mirror again, her great, thin, long legs had gone, and been replaced by thick unwieldy tree trunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe it wasn't as bad as it could have been...or it was going to be. She wouldn't be stopping like this for long, as the curse would force her to grow even bigger soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy decided to...</span></div></div>",

She thought perhaps she might be able to catch it sleeping during the hours of daylight, which would make her job a lot easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy, still clothed only in her panties, crossed her bedroom and pulled open her wardrobe. She heaved a sigh - something she was getting used to doing, as every few minutes something happened which caused her to feel thoroughly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she surveyed her wide array of fashionable, form fitting clothes, Buffy tried to look for something that would suit her current predicament. Certainly not the leather pants - those would never fit her now, and even if they did, she'd never be able to get them off. The mini skirt was out. Her jeans would never hold her newfound pot belly in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like it was going to have to be sweats, not the most attractive things she had, but at least the baggy material would stretch over her body, and make her look a little more normal in public. Buffy pulled the dull, grey sweats off of their hanger in the wardrobe and pulled them on, they felt a lot tighter than usual, but that was to be expected. She pulled the pants on first, and they felt rather snug around her waist. She then went to her draw and pulled out a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed the bra with apprehension, was it really going to fit her? It was worth a try. She lifted up the bra, designed for B cup breasts, and placed it over her exposed breasts, reaching round to tie the clasp, she found it incredibly difficult. In fact, she soon deduced that there was no way it was ever going to fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap,\" Buffy said. \"I can't go out with no bra, what if someone...\" Buffy spotted a stretchy looking tank top in the draw, and pulled it out. Luckily, when she pulled the top over her head, it stretched down over her breasts and torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy smiled in satisfaction, then noticed that her belly was exposed - the tank top didn't cover her entire belly, leaving a good amount of flab, and her belly button, exposed. She shrugged off that slight disappointment, pleased that anything still fit her, and pulled on the sweat top - zipping it up firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and looked in the mirror, satisfied with her appearance, the biggest parts of her body were covered, and while she had no doubt she had the look of a girl who had piled on a fair bit of weight, she didn't look too bad, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy headed back downstairs, seeing Willow and Dawn were still looking anxious in the kitchen, she poked her head round the door and called in, \"Guys, I'm going to look for that demon, thanks for the spell Will, worked a treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful!\" Willow called back, as Buffy pulled away from the doorway and headed out the front door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Buffy headed off down the road, deciding to quicken her pace and make it look like she was out for a jog or something. At least she would present the appearance to passers by that was trying to lose some weight, instead of just letting herself go. She hoped she wouldn't bump into anyone she knew on the way, she wasn't sure she could cope with explaining her situation to anyone else...or if anyone else would even believe her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hastened into a jog, Buffy noticed that this running business was harder than it used to be. With every step, she could feel her unsupported breasts jump up and down, straining against her tank top as though they were ready to pop out at any moment. Her belly was jiggling, her newfound flab wobbling each time her foot hit the ground. And her ass was shaking from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Buffy had to stop, leaning against a nearby wall and gasping for breath. She didn't relish the idea of continuing with her jog, and after a moment, decided she would just have to walk until she got her breath back. She looked down at the bulge beneath her sweats, and touched her belly with her hand, trying to keep it from jiggling as she breathed in and out. As she continued to look at her swollen midsection, she was startled by a familiar voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked up quickly, removed her hand from her stomach, and tried to look dignified, as she saw who had spoken. \"Hey Xander,\" she greeted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks fat,\" said Anya, who was standing beside Xander, looking quizzically at Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander smiled and turned his head to face Anya. \"Honey, remember what we said about that thing you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way I tell the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then how will she know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could always look in a mirror?\" Buffy interjected, placing her hands on her wide hips in a confrontational stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya shrugged. \"Well you look very nice, and no bigger than usual,\" she turned to Xander for some sort of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" he said, forcing a smile. \"Nice save. So Buff, out for a jog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy couldn't help but notice that Xander had noticed her weight gain, and seemed unable to take his eyes off her big breasts and bulging belly. \"Before you ask,\" she said, deciding to get it over with. \"I was cursed by a demon, and now I'm getting fat. I need to find some blood from one of the demons race so that Willow can do a spell to change me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh,\" Xander said. \"I should have known it was some crazy magic, I mean, you've always had a great body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy raised an eyebrow. Anya elbowed Xander in the ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or so I'm told!\" Xander added quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it one of those icky Obefat demons?\" Anya asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy nodded. \"That's the one, you know them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they don't usually leave their food sources though, weird one tried to fight you,\" Anya said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food sources?\" Buffy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They eat anything, usually things they cursed. They curse first, wait until the victim has gotten big enough...then eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy felt sick. \"You mean that demon was going to EAT me? Good thing I killed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just be careful, the other Obefats will know you were cursed...and they'll pick on anyone fat enough to make a good meal. Looks like you've got a while to go before your demon chow,\" Anya said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy suddenly felt a whole lot more scared, it was bad enough she was getting fat, but to have some demons out there planning to eat her...she felt angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I'm going to find these things and stop them. Now. Anya, any idea where they hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During day time?\" Anya stopped and thought. \"Some place dark, underground...probably a cave or something they can store the food they gather inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I'll check out the tunnels by the cemetery, see what I can find,\" Buffy said, and hurried, no longer concerned about her jiggling body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander and Anya watched her go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at her run...almost hypnotic,\" Xander said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya slapped him across the back of the head.</span></div></div>",

She could feel her clothing becoming a little looser as her quickened pace forced her zipper down slightly, and her bottoms slipped down a small ammount, revealing her butt crack. She stopped for a moment to adjust her clothes, catch her breath and lean up against a wall, then she continued on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was making pretty good time, she had expected her new gain to slow her down, but now that she was becoming used to her new body, she was finding it easier to manage. It wasn't so bad, but she didn't relish the prospect of getting any bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, Buffy had reached her intended the location - the caves near the cemetary. She stopped and caught her breath, not wanting to feel weak if she did locate the demons and got into a fight. Even with her her extra pounds, she was sure she would be able to take them down, they weren't exactly the most sprightly creatures themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy made sure her clothes were properly adjusted, took a deep breath, and headed into the darkness ahead of her. She took it slowly, her slayer insincts took over immediately, and she kept her eye on every shadow within the cave, listening to every noise and checking behind her every few moments. She rarely had to go stalking the forces of darkness in the middle of the day, and the light was something that would have worked in her favour. Unfortunately, the caves were so dark she could barely see a thing anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she carried on, Buffy noticed a change in the air...she could smell something. Something foul. Her nose wrinkled, and she moved forward more cautiously, that smell could only be made by a demon...hopefully the one she was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into an alcove, lit by burning torches on the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, torches, that's new,\" Buffy added sarcastically as she stepped into the glow of the flames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard something, a low growling noise, and she looked down at her feet and saw something curled up on the floor, asleep. She recognised the pudgy creature immediately, it was the Obefat demon. But there wasn't just one of them, there was four, each lying a few feet apart - looking bloated and overweight, to a morbid degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy could hardly believe her luck, she had stumbled onto exactly the right demons, at exactly the right time. </span></div></div>",

But as she moved, and her foot hit the ground, the Obefat's eyes shot open. Her footsteps must have gotten a little louder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap,\" Buffy sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Obefat demon shot up. \"The slayer!\" the first demon, who was male, roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other began to rise, moving their unsightly, fat bodies from side to side as they tried to scramble to their feet. Seizing the opportunity, Buffy swung her arm at the first demon, punching it in the jaw. It's face felt disgusting, and her fist was almost lost in a sea of flab. She yanked her arm back and kicked at the Demon, sending it flying backwards into the others and knocking them back like bowling pins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the most dangerous demons I've ever faced,\" Buffy smirked mockingly. Buffy had to admit, despite her cockiness, kicking her leg just then had been much harder than it used to be, they were heavier, and more difficult to simply kick out with. The kick had also caused her zip up top to ride up, exposing the bottom of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demons began to recuperate, and Buffy realised that kicking them all into one pile hadn't been such a good idea. They were now helping one another up, getting to their feet and snarling and growling at the person who had entered their lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy pulled her arm back, and flexed her fingers on her stake - ready to strike. But as she did, she began to feel her sweat pants getting tighter. Nervously, she looked down, and to her horror, she saw her belly bulging out even further, getting bigger, and causing her top to ride up even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" Buffy blurted out. \"Not now! Please not now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demons realised what was happening, and laughed amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ours now slayer, nobody has ever escaped an Obefat curse!\" a female demon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a slayer!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy realised there was now way she could fight the demons like this, it was bad enough fighting them with her fattened body - but WHILE she was fattening up? It couldn't be done, there was too many of them. Buffy began to back away, she slid her hands down her body and grabbed her belly, trying to hold it still as it continued to grow, pushing out into a rounder, bigger ball, and forcing her pants further down her legs so that they threatened to fall down entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demons continued to advance, and Buffy knew she had to get out of there now. With her tail between her legs, or, rather, her belly between her legs - she turned and ran as fast as she could. Not daring to look behind her. The demons could be heard giving chase, but they were much slower than she was, their fat bodies not helping them move quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy stumbled through the darkness, gripping her belly and trying to stop it from swaying from side to side as she ran. She could feel it growing, pushing out further and causing her fingers to spread apart. She was so focused on escaping that she didn't notice her sweat pants had been forced down even further, and, suddenly, they dropped down completely around her thicker legs, causing her to lose her footing and topple over, face hitting the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demons were still hurrying after her, and Buffy panicked, quickly, she got to her feet, and nearly tumbled over again, letting go of her belly and trying to propel herself off the wall, Buffy gained a little more momentum, and continued to hurry to the exit of the caves. As she did, her belly jiggled uncontrollably, no longer supported by her firm grip, and the zipper on her dull grey top began to push it's way down, eventually the top opened and Buffy simply wrangled her arms out of it's sleeves and threw it behind her in a vain attempt to go faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow her breasts were not contained in the top, they were shaking around as much as her belly, her whole body was starting to ache, and she was clothed in nothing but a pair of panties that had now become a thong and a tank top which had ridden up to expose most of her fat stomach, and was so tight it felt like it might tear apart at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy breathed a sigh of relief as she spotted daylight through the cave exit ahead...hopefully the demons wouldn't follow her out.</span></div></div>",

The corpulent demons continued to grunt and growl behind her, getting ever closer to her swelling body. Buffy panted and puffed and weezed as her belly and breasts jiggled uncontrollably around her - her dignity long gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she was there, the exit to the cave was right before her, and she practically jumped the last few feet in her desperation to escape her pursuers. The Demons ground to a halt in the mouth of the cave, hovering around as if afraid to enter the daylight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Demons attempted to move forward, but the tallest of three held out his arm and stopped his companion from moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the Demon spoke with authority. \"Leave her...for now. She will grow bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy ground to a halt as she realised she was no longer being chased. She leant against a nearby tree, completely out of breath - a feeling she was not used to. She cast a glance over her shoulder and saw the Demons retreating back into their cave. It was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy couldn't believe the stress all that running had put on her body. She didn't think she was that big, but it seemed her recent growth spurt had added a good few pounds of fat to her gradually growing frame, and by looking at her arms and legs, Buffy could tell that her muscles were losing their definition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was growing faster than she could cope with. As she pulled herself off of the tree and forced herself to stand up straight, she noticed that she could no longer see her feet over her beach ball sized belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts increasing size were putting a strain on her tight tank top, and she could feel her panties disappearing inside her bulging ass cheeks. She suddenly became very aware that she was no longer wearing any pants, and that her thicker looking legs were now exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and realised that getting home was going to be a far more embarrassing trip than it was getting here. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Buffy decided she would need to set off for home immediately, to hang around the cemetary any longer would be dangerous with her growth spurts occurring at random and inconvenient times, and the Obefat Demons lurking nearby. But getting home wouldn't be easy, or rather, it wouldn't be easy to get home without being seen. Hopefully she would be able to take a more discrete route...if only she knew the sewers like Angel had done - that would be the perfect cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy wished it was dark - all the vampires stalking the graveyard would be preferrable to the staring eyes of the people of Sunnydale. None the less, she had to get back home before anything else happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy set off, keeping in the shade of the trees, and nervously checking around for anyone nearby who might spot her. Her half naked body was hard to miss when out in the open, but if she kept to the shadows than she might just avoid being spotted. Buffy suddenly heard footsteps, and ducked down behind a large bush as a couple walked by. When she was sure they were gone, she struggled back to her feet and headed onwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the cemetary was full of trees and foliage, and Buffy managed to keep herself hidden for some time as she headed for the exit, but as she approached the metal gates that marked the way out - the trees became ever more sparce, and she realised that she would soon need to come out into the open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Buffy looked around and made sure the way was clear, and then she emerged from the bushes and hurried as fast as she could towards the gates, which she swiftly passed and continued past onto the pedestrian path ahead. This was it, she was out in the open, exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In no way can this end well,\" Buffy said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurried along the path, which would take her into town and further into the open. Her growing body had made it more difficult for her to pick up a decent level of speed, not so much because she found it hard to run,  but because her enlarged body parts would jiggle around all over the place and slow her down. She felt disgusted with herself, and it didn't look as thought this situation would resolve itself anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords could not describe how anxious Buffy was feeling right now, she was terrified of anyone seeing her like this. And she was sure that anyone who did would be absolutely horrified, her tank top was stretched across her bulging stomach and breasts, and her completely exposed bottom half, minus tight binding panties, were on display for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes on, and Buffy hadn't seen anyone, which she was very grateful for. She rested for a moment as she realised she had come to the end of the path, and as she stared ahead, she saw the road leading into town...a road she knew would be pretty busy around this time of day. Buffy took a deep breath, and headed onwards, stepping onto the pavement and walking straight into town - she spotted people ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets didn't look too busy, so Buffy hurried along the path, trying to move quickly past the shops before anyone could set eyes on her. As she turned a street corner, she came face to face with an elderly woman, who widened her weary looking eyes and stared at Buffy's half naked body in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord...young lady...cover yourself up!\" The old woman shook her head and moved on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she didn't comment on my weight,\" Buffy said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Buffy saw something, something familiar that had completely slipped her mind - the Magic Box. It was right in the middle of the high street, and Giles or Anya would most likely be working there right now. It would be much easier to recouperate in there than making it all the way back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA triumphant smile crept across Buffy's face as she headed over to the magic shop...</span></div></div>",

Xander looked away awkwardly, Giles removed his glasses and polished them, Willow just stared and Anya frowned in a confused manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you wearing any pants?\" Anya asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy couldn't stand the awkwardness for a moment longer, and marched past her friends and into the back room - turning bright red in embarassment as she walked on by. Willow quickly rose, and followed Buffy out into the training room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy sat down on a bench in the training centre that Giles had set up for her in the back room of the shop. She wished she had the energy and agility to use the equipment in here, but knew that her growing body would make that very difficult - so she merely slumped down onto the seat with her head in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow sat down beside her, and placed a hand on Buffy's shoulder sympathetically. \"Did you have another growth?\" Willow asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy nodded sadly. \"Just as I found the Demon's nest. I had them...but they woke up...and it was hard to fight when my stomach was blowing up like a balloon. One thing led to another and...well...\" Buffy gestured to her exposed legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the bright side, we know where the Demon's live now, so the rest of us can go find them and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy cut Willow off. \"No,\" she said. \"If anyone else goes then you'll end up cursed like me. I have to deal with this myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Buffy, we could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Will,\" Buffy said quickly. \"You guys will be no use to me if your all too fat to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked a little uncomfortable, then nodded. \"All right, but we can still help you. We've been doing research all morning, and I've found a new spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy turned and gave Willow a sceptical look, remembering the last few times Willow had used magic to try and help her out of this situation. \"I don't know if I want to try another spell Willow...I might end up even bigger, or with a giant butt or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no!\" Willow protested. \"This one will work, I promise. I prepared a potion earlier that restore your original body for twenty four hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! Only one day?\" Buffy questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, which should leave you with enough time to get rid of those Demon's right?\" Willow said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definately,\" Buffy replied. \"They weren't the most agile bunch. But what happens if I don't get rid of them in one day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...erm...\" Willow shifited nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Buffy frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body will start getting much bigger...much faster...and it might not stop...even with the Demon's blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy considered this for a moment...</span></div></div>",

It was worth the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow seemed pleased, and pulled out a ready made vial of the thick, black coloured potion from her pocket and handed it to Buffy. Buffy eyed the vial with apprehension, and uncorked the lid, looking over at Willow to make sure this was safe. Willow nodded, and Buffy lifted the potion to her lips and downed it all in one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck!\" Buffy said, smacking her lips together. The potion had tasted terrible, and she could feel it slowly sliding down her throat like treacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I never said it would taste good,\" Willow smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when does this take effect?\" Buffy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round about...\" Willow looked down at her watch, then at Buffy's bulging stomach. \"Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy felt a strong tingling sensation in her stomach, and grabbed it instinctively. She was now used to seeing it bulge out and grow, but she now found herself watching her belly shrink away to nothing. She squealed excitedly. \"It's working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...\" Willow said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy watched in joy as her breasts deflated and her clothes loosened. All the extra pounds she had accumulated were melting away, and in a matter of moments her pudgy new body was gone - replaced by the slender, toned form she was used to. Her stretched clothes were practically hanging off her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank God...\" Buffy sighed in relief as she looked down over her body. It felt so good to lose that extra weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you need some new clothes?\" Willow asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy pulled at her panties, which had been stretched out so much when her butt was getting fat, that they were now in danger of falling down. She smiled awkwardly at Willow and nodded. \"Clothes would be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow returned to Buffy's house to gather some clothes, while Buffy hid her scantily clad form in the training room. Buffy was overcome with a sense of urgency now, knowing that Willow's potion would wear off in twenty four hours. She now had a deadline to meet, and the sooner she got back to the Obefat lair, the better. Now that the effects of the curse had been lifted, albeit only temporarily, Buffy felt she could easily take down the Demon's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour passed before Willow returned, carrying a bundle of Buffy's tight fitting clothes in her hands. She entered the training room out of breath and dumped the clothes on a workout bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she panted. \"Got back as fast as I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries Will,\" Buffy replied. \"Thanks for the help - I could never have done this without your bag of tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow smiled happily. \"It's a deep bag,\" she said. \"I'll leave you to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy rummaged through the clothes and pulled out a new set of underwear, a pair of tight jeans and a tank top. Getting dressed felt heavenly - it was so much easier now she was slim again, as she didn't need to force undersized clothes over her expanding belly and bustline. In a matter of seconds, Buffy was fully dressed, and marched out of the training room to find Willow and the others waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good Buff!\" Xander complimented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy I suggest that in order to get the blood totally fresh one of us goes with you,\" Giles said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go,\" said Willow. \"I know the spell, and I can hang out of sight while Buffy goes into the caves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was reluctant to let anyone else go with her, but at least once the Demon's were dead getting their blood and lifting the curse wouldn't be much of a problem anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, but just Willow. I don't want anyone else to be in danger...of...you know...obesity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy and Willow headed for the caves...</span></div></div>",

She knew that they were reaching the entrance to the cave, and that Willow would have to wait out here to save her getting cursed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, you should wait here,\" Buffy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" said Willow. \"Just hurry back once you've killed those Demon's...then I can scoop up the blood and lift the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy set off for the cave entrance, pulling out her stake as she entered the darkness ahead. She crept carefully through the dark tunnels, following the same path she had followed on her last visit - and hoping that the Demon's had gone back to sleep. That would certainly make things easier. Buffy couldn't quite believe how different it felt walking now compared to when she had been fattening up - there was an immense relief of pressure on her limbs, and she felt so much lighter without her belly jiggling all over the place. She told herself she was never going to let her body get like that ever again - these Demon's had to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned a corner into a familiar looking alcove, Buffy spotted them - the Obefat Demon's. She smiled smugly as she realised they were asleep once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat lazy monsters...\" Buffy muttered, pulling out her stake. \"I should really think of a good fat joke...something about a killer diet plan or something...oh well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy pulled back her stake over her head, and swiftly brought it down into the heart of one of the Demon's. As soon as the stake had impaled the flabby creature, it yelled out in pain, with a scream so loud that Buffy had to cover her ears to stop herself from going deaf. That was it - the scream had woken up the other two Demon's, who, despite their size, sprung into action from their sleeping positions and lunged at Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead Obefat snarled. \"How did you regain your old size slayer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy didn't respond, instead delivering a powerful kick to the lead Demon's face which sent him flying backwards. The second Demon lunged at Buffy, but she was too quick for it, and it fell past her and collided with it's companion comically. Wasting no time, Buffy jumped over to where they lay on the ground and drove her stake through each of their hearts. It was a technique that seemed to get rid of most Demon's, whether they were Vampires or not. The Demon's howled in pain and clutched at their wounds as green black blood poured forth and Buffy covered her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Demon's groaned and moaned as Buffy watched them suffer for what they had put her through. Then a thought occurred to her, hadn't there been four of the Demon's last time?</span></div></div>",

The last remaining Demon was standing there, snarling with it's sharp, dirty teeth - and with it's armed wrapped around Dawn.

Dawn hesitated, and began to walk towards Buffy, but before she could take another step, the Demon grabbed her arm and shoved her forward, so that she bumped into Buffy and knocked her back. In the confusion, the Demon raised it's arms and pointed at Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the unholy powers, I say that no potion shall help the Slayer's body!\" The Demon screeched, and a crackling bolt of green energy formed in mid air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap...\" was all Buffy had time to say before the green ball of light flew across the cave and flew straight into her body, sending her flying back across the cave floor and into the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon laughed and turned tail, running down another passage of the cavern with it's brown robs flailing out behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Go and fetch her, and tell her that we have fresh Obefat blood for the spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d Dawn asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hurry Dawn!\u201d Buffy snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn ran away, speeding out of the cave until she was out of Buffy\u2019s line of vision. Buffy could feel her clothes tightening around her body, and she knew that the potion had been rendered useless and that her body was beginning to swell with fat once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked down and saw her stomach bulging out and surging forward \u2013 at an alarming rate. Her previous growths had been slow and gradual, but it seemed that now she was regaining all the weight Willow\u2019s potion had hidden instantaneously\u2026which was bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy\u2019s tank top tightened around her swelling belly, as her breasts began to push forward and her cleavage grew larger and larger with each passing moment. Her jeans were growing ever more constrictive around her thickening legs, and soon Buffy was finding her clothes becoming so tight that she was having difficulty breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have undo these pants\u2026\u201d Buffy grunted, reaching down to unbutton her increasingly tight jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Buffy could lay a finger on her jeans, her growing belly bulge forward and popped open the top button. Buffy let out a pleasurable moan as some of the pressure being put on her body was relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tank top was now riding up, exposing her reformed potbelly and stretching the top to its limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Buffy groaned. \u201cThese clothes aren\u2019t going to last much longer\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Buffy\u2019s jeans began to burst at the seams. She was caught off guard as she heard several ripping sounds coming from her legs, and saw that her chunky legs were pushing the fabric of her jeans apart, creating large gaps through which flesh was spilling through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take the pressure of her constricting garments any longer, Buffy buckled under her own expanding body and fell to her knees. As she hit the floor, her jeans gave way completely, ripping into shreds as her legs continued to swell with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy wasn\u2019t able to see the full effects of her continuing transformation over the sheer size of her expanding breasts, which had reached a bigger size than ever. Buffy was amazed by how big she was getting in such a short time, in fact, she seemed to be getting even bigger than she had been previously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy grabbed at her enormous cleavage and squeezed at her swelling breasts, trying to force them back towards her body so that she could get a better look at the rest of her expanding body. She didn\u2019t have much success with this however, and all she could see was a small part of her belly pushing out before her eyes like an inflating balloon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the hell is Dawn?\u201d Buffy asked herself, looking frantically around the cave for any sign of her sister. \u201cI can barely breathe in this top\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy couldn\u2019t take the pressure anymore. She grabbed her tank top and pulled the now damaged fabric apart, pulling the top in two and allowing her huge breasts to bounce free and plop onto her beach ball like belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah what a relief!\u201d Buffy exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy had been left in nothing but her underwear, her clothes were shredded and her body had grown bigger than ever before \u2013 but she would soon be cured, so she tried to stay positive. This would soon be over, and for the moment, she seemed to have stopped growing, although her bra and panties looked like they weren\u2019t going to last much longer. </span></div></div>",

Expecting to see Willow and Dawn emerging from the tunnels, she was shocked to see the Obefat Demon walking towards her with an evil smile on it\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026not now\u2026\u201d Buffy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes Slayer, now\u2026your perfectly helpless!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon advanced towards her, and Buffy made to stand up and fight it off. Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t accustomed to her new size, and toppled forward and fell flat on her face. As she tried to pull herself up, she saw the Demon\u2019s legs coming towards her, and a minute later, she was struck over the back of the head, and everything went black\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up\u2026wake up Slayer. Time to grow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy groggily opened her eyes, trying to remember where she was and what had happened to her. Then it all came back to her, the Demon had come back\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy\u2019s eyes took a moment to adjust to the somewhat brightly lit cave. In contrast to the tunnels she had previously entered, this rocky room she was now inside was lit with flaming torches that were positioned so close to her that they warmed her skin. Her flabby skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026where am I?\u201d Buffy asked tiredly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my personal fattening chamber,\u201d the Demon replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyes widened, Buffy checked out her surroundings, and realised she was strapped down to a large stone slab that was laid up against the wall in a vertical position. Metal chains bound her arms and legs to the slab, and she immediately struggled against them with her flabby arms, but it was no use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s no use Slayer, your muscles have turned to fat, and you wont be able to break those constraints in your current condition.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked down and saw that she was now totally naked, her bra and panties had either popped off or been forcibly removed, and all she could see past her enormous breasts was her bloated bulging stomach. She looked like she was about nine months pregnant\u2026with quintuplets. Her arms had gained a considerable amount of weight as well, and her formerly slim and toned muscles were nowhere to be seen. She could also feel her two large butt cheeks pressing into the cold stone of the slab and squishing together like cushions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy had never felt so humiliated. \u201cWhat are you keeping me here for?\u201d Buffy demanded angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to keep you constrained until you are too big to pose any threat to me,\u201d The Demon explained. \u201cYou have been unconscious for three hours, which means that the blood of my fellow Obefat\u2019s is now useless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Buffy cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d The Demon laughed. \u201cAnd I get to eat you all myself now that you have gotten rid of my greedy siblings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis cant be happening to me\u2026\u201d Buffy whimpered, beginning to get upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh but it is!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy couldn\u2019t think of a way out of this situation, unless her friends found where she was, there was pretty much no hope of escape. She would continue to swell into an immobile human meal for this repulsive Demon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I have things to do, but I shall leave you here to expand for the rest of the day, enjoy your oncoming weight Slayer!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon laughed and pushed aside a boulder, which revealed a secret entrance to the cave, and then it left, pushing the boulder back afterwards and leaving Buffy alone. </span></div></div>",

Buffy guessed she had begun to grow larger in the face as well, but as it was one of several of her body parts she could not see, she could not be sure. But in her head she began to picture herself with a double chin and chubby cheeks, and she wanted to be sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much more of this am I going to have to take?\u201d Buffy asked, and her voice sounded somewhat deeper than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body slowly stopped growing, leaving her body even larger and flabbier.

She guessed it was her captor returning from a long hard day of\u2026whatever it was Demon\u2019s did during the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boulder that formed the secret entrance to the chamber began to shift slowly, as something pushed it out of the way. Buffy saw a pale, flesh coloured hand creep around the side of the boulder, and finally shove it out of the way completely \u2013 revealing three figures in the oval cave doorway: Willow, Dawn and Spike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy had never felt so humiliated in all her life. It was bad enough that she was fattening up to a morbidly obese level, but to be naked and chained up, and now to be seen by her best friend, sister and former archenemy \u2013 was a little too much to bear. The slayer saw her friends eyes fill with amazement as they stared at her flabby, exposed body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Spike exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really need to bring him?\u201d Buffy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Buff,\u201d Willow replied. \u201cI thought it would be a good idea, since we haven\u2019t had much luck lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you wont be slaying anything like that,\u201d Spike said, gesturing to Buffy. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to kill you your demon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Spells all ready,\u201d Willow stated. \u201cWe just need to wait for the Demon to return so we can get its blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy struggled against her constraints again, trying to free herself so that she could at least cover herself with her arms. \u201cGet me down from here\u2026\u201d she said, pulling against her chains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike pulled the constraints from the stone slab that Buffy was chained to, and she suddenly felt the huge weight she had gained \u2013 no longer supported, and unprepared for just how difficult it was to stand up on her own, Buffy\u2019s legs buckled under her girth and she fell to the floor. Her huge gut bulged forward as she slumped against the wall of the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you brought any clothes?\u201d Buffy said, covering her exposed breasts with two chubby hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have time,\u201d said Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy doubted anything would have fit her anyway. At this point, she was larger than she had suspected, now she was in a seated position, she could see the vast size of her stomach and breasts, and her fat hands \u2013 which now covered her breasts. She would be unable to fight anything in this condition. She had never thought she would see herself like this. </span></div></div>",

She laid it down on the floor and began to remove various spell ingredients from within it. Dawn grabbed a glass container and poured a circle of salt around Willow to protect her, then hopped into the circle herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy wished someone had bothered to draw a salt circle around her \u2013 but she doubted it would do much good now. Besides which, she doubted there was enough salt in Sunnydale to draw a circle around her fat body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it comes\u2026\u201d Spike murmured, retreating to the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy tried to stand up, grabbing her rotund belly with her thick arms; she used all her strength to slowly raise herself off of the floor and onto her wide legs. Spike gave her a curious look, but tried to avoid staring at her naked form for too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Obefat Demon lumbered through the still open entrance to the cave. \u201cWho dares intrude into my lair!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike jumped out from his vantage point in the shadows, and grabbed the corpulent Demon around the neck. It struggled within his grasp, and elbowed a far arm into his chest. Spike released his grip and stumbled back, as the Demon suddenly took noticed of Willow and Dawn, who were preparing the spell that would undo Buffy\u2019s curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat spell will be of no use to you while I still live!\u201d The Obefat Demon grinned, baring its sharp, dirty teeth. \u201cYour vampire will not be able to stop me, and look at your slayer! Too fat to fight!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon laughed a deep, horrible laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Buffy listened it\u2019s annoying laughter, she could take no more of this. This entire situation had been nothing but a cruel, embarrassing inconvenience \u2013 a curse from a group of Demons too greedy and cowardly to fight her on normal terms. They had feasted upon humans like her, after fattening them to monstrous levels, and she was going to make sure this Demon never humiliated anyone ever again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy suddenly found a whole new source of energy: her anger. She charged towards the laughing Demon and threw herself at it, knocking it down to the floor and falling on top of it. Her enormously flabby stomach pinned the creature to the floor and prevented it from getting back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off me!\u201d The Demon screeched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpike! Kill it!\u201d Buffy commanded, keeping the Demon trapped underneath her layers of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike hurried over, and Buffy brought up her two flabby arms, and swung her clenched fists at the Demon\u2019s face over and over again. Her chubby but powerful fists collided with the Demon\u2019s sneering face over and over again as Spike looked on in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy realised she was getting carried away, but she was so keen to hurt this Demon for what it had done to her, that she didn\u2019t care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026curse\u2026\u201d The Demon began to say in-between punches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut your fat mouth!\u201d Buffy shouted, punching the Demon square in the jaw and finally knocking it unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked down in triumph, as a smile spread across her chubby cheeks, she gradually lifted herself off of the foul smelling creature beneath her bulging stomach and shuffled her fattened body along the floor so that she could prop herself up against the wall again. She panted heavily, the energy she had just used had taken a lot out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike twisted the Demon\u2019s neck around so that it gave a sickening crunch, then he pulled it off completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww!\u201d Dawn exclaimed in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring me its blood,\u201d said Willow. </span></div></div>",

She looked over at the dead Demon, and wished that she could have been the one to finally kill it. Still, she had greatly enjoyed pummeling it with her fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike leant against the wall and lit a cigarette as Willow continued to prepare the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to stop getting fat once red does her spell?\u201d Spike asked Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy didn\u2019t particularly want to make conversation with Spike right now. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan, as long as it goes right this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat went wrong last time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiant boobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow walked over, carrying the small cauldron under her arm, and placing it on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy eyed the bubbling liquid within the cauldron with apprehension, and sniffed the air. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t smell good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d Willow replied, scooping a small amount of the liquid within a glass vial. \u201cDrink this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy pulled away. \u201cThat looks disgusting!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt should stabilize the transformation,\u201d Willow said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked at the disgusting liquid, grabbed it from Willow and gulped it down. The thick, sticky substance seemed to coat the inside of her mouth, and it took several subsequent gulps to swallow it all. Buffy stuck her tongue out and made a disapproving noise as she handed the empty vial back to Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow performed the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when do I change back?\u201d Buffy asked. </span></div></div>",

Happy to be left alone at last, Buffy relaxed, and removed her hands from her swollen breasts \u2013 she would never have boobs this size again (except if she was cursed by another Demon) and as she stared at them, she noticed them moving slowly \u2013 and saw that they were shrinking. The spell seemed to be taking effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her enormous breasts shrank back towards her body, Buffy was allowed a better view of her huge belly, which also appeared to be decreasing in size. Buffy breathed an immense sigh of relief as she realized that her body would soon be back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a great load being lifted from her weighty body as it returned to it\u2019s slender shape \u2013 her tree trunk like legs began to slim down, allowing them some degree of movement once again. Her thick, flab laden arms started to regain their muscular tone and lose their wing like shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her, Buffy could the fat magically melting off her ass, causing her to sink lower towards the floor.

She stood up, quite unprepared for how easy it was now that her extra three hundred pounds had been removed \u2013 and nearly toppled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy giggled, thrilled that she old body was restored and working perfectly, she felt an immense weight had been lifted from her shoulders \u2013 quite literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill naked though\u2026\u201d Buffy suddenly realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down over her naked, slender body, and managed a smile. Being naked certainly wasn\u2019t the worst thing that had happened to her this week. She covered herself with her hands and stepped outside, at which point, Willow, seeing she needed help, removed the long green coat she was wearing and handed it to Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy quickly pulled on the coat, which luckily reached down to her knees, and buttoned it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankyou,\u201d Buffy said, smiling at the others. \u201cThat\u2019s an experience I never want to through again\u2026when I think about the poor people who weren\u2019t able to cure themselves\u2026I feel sick\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Spike. \u201cWith their numbers depleted, I should think they\u2019ll skip town now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDisgusting Demons,\u201d Dawn grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too,\u201d said Buffy, reaching an arm round her sister. \u201cNow, lets get something to eat.

Judging from experience, the spell would make things <i>worse</i>. As talented a witch as Willow was, she didn't seem to be having much luck with these body modification spells...Buffy had visions of herself growing bigger and bigger until her whole body was overtaken by flab. She pictured herself enormous and immobile - unable to move due to the sheer amount of weight added to her once slender frame - and she shuddered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like it's working!\" Willow exclaimed in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked down at her ridiculously large bust, and saw that the size of her mammoth mammaries was decreasing. She felt her nipples shrink beneath her hands, and kept them firmly covered as her breasts shrunk like deflating balloons. It looked as though the first part of Willow's spell was working like a charm, but Buffy was dreading the return of her pudgy body and bulging belly. But as her breasts continued to shrink, reverting back to their normal size, nothing seemed to be happening to the rest of her body. Her stomach remained flat and toned, and, as far as Buffy could tell, she was back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't I supposed to be fattening up again by now?\" Buffy asked. \"Not that I'm complaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was meant to happen immediately...\" Willow said, scratching her red hair in confusion. \"I wonder what happened, do you think maybe I cured you completely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked down at her body. \"Maybe...it's starting to look that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with immense relief, Buffy picked up her ruined clothes and began to put them back on. Her bra and shirt were stretched out and loose, but covered her exposed top half well enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud, piercing scream came from the other side of the kitchen. Buffy and Willow spun around and saw that the shriek had come from Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn? What is it?\" Buffy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at my stomach!\" Dawn wailed, gesturing to her mid section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy and Willow looked at Dawn's stomach, and Buffy instantly saw why her sister was so freaked out. Dawn's normally flat belly was bulging out, growing larger and larger, peeking out from beneath her purple top. Dawn was growing, just like Buffy had, somehow, the same fattening curse that had affected her was now affecting her sister. A loud 'PING' noise sounded as the button on Dawn's jeans exploded off, allowing her burgeoning belly some room to breathe. Dawn exhaled as her belly bulged out, but quickly returned to whimpering in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she understood, and sympathized, with what Dawn was currently going through, Buffy couldn't help but feel a little smug; Dawn had been quick to mock her when she was gaining weight, and not the exact same thing was happening to her, and far more rapidly than it had happened to Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" Dawn said, her eyes filling with tears. \"Why am I getting fat too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked awkward. \"Erm...I think...maybe instead of moving the weight from Buffy's breasts into the rest of her body, it actually moved it into a different body completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy raised an eyebrow at Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Those translations are tricky!\" Willow protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn gave a groan as her top tightened across her bloating belly. She was looking like she was in the middle stages of pregnancy at the moment, with her newly formed gut pushed out in front of her. Other parts of her body were starting to grow as well; her breasts had increased in size, stretching her top even more. Her butt had doubled in size, and her jeans were tightening around her thickening legs. Her face was also looking a little fuller. Dawn watched helplessly as her body expanded before her eyes, tears running down her face as her once trim body fattened up. </span></div></div>",

The garment slid down slightly, exposing the top of her bulging buttocks. Her breasts were now roughly C-cups, and were being painfully constricted by her bra. Her shirt was now skin tight, revealing every curve and dimple, and the seams on her jeans were beginning to creak ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy shook her head and snapped back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow! Do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-haired witch was apologetic. \"I don't know what to do! Everything I try just seems to make it worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you were just a better witch!\" Buffy snarled, now sick of her friend's excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow flushed with rage. \"Don't you try and blame this on me you bimbo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bimbo!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir argument was interupted by a tremulous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked over, and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they had been distracted, Dawn's rate of growth had increased. Her gut was now massive, and had forced her t-shirt up under her breasts, which themselves were straining to escape the confines of her top, her now deep cleavage visibly shaking. Her butt and thighs had swollen as well, and her jeans were groaning as the stitches valiantly fought against the tide of flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm going to burst...\" Dawn whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy took a small step forward, her unrestrained breasts jiggling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be fine Dawn,\" she said soothingly, \"just take a deep breath...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn opened her mouth, exacerbating her double chin, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy? Buffy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy opened her eyes and was confronted by the bleary image of Willow, a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy shook her head, attempting to clear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whuh?\" She began groggily, \"What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow bit her lip, helping the dazed slayer to her feet. \"Well, when Dawn took a deep breath, it was kinda the last straw as far as her clothes were concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They burst off?\" Buffy guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow nodded. \"And you got caught in the crossfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy rubbed her head, ruefully. \"And where's my 'little' sister now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ran upstairs. Well, I say ran, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the idea.\" Buffy interrupted. \"I'll go check on her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to head upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde looked back and saw Willow looking shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, Buffy realized why.</span></div></div>",

How the hell did <i>that</i> happen? I thought you transferred all of my weight into Dawn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was still holding her rapidly bloating belly, which was pushing out further and further, rounding out into a sizeable ball. She looked like she might be heavily bloated, or in the early stages of pregnancy. Her clothes were tightening around her new centre of gravity, with her skirt and top stretched to bursting point. Buffy looked down at her own stomach anxiously, afraid she might be fattening up again herself, but everything seemed normal - it looked as though Willow and Dawn had absorbed the curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think maybe some of the energy that went into Dawn must have gone into me as well,\" Willow explained. \"It started affecting me just after you passed out...only I seem to be growing much slower than Dawn...I guess poor Dawnie got most of the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy found it hard to concentrate on what Willow was saying when her belly was growing so quickly. She imagined her friends had probably gone through the same thing when she had been growing. It was a strange sight, and as Willow's slim frame changed, Buffy was relieved she was back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this is not good...\" Willow was muttering as her shirt began riding up above her belly, exposing the bulging flab of her pale gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy had never seen Willow looking so big. The rest of her friend's body had remained unchanged, with all of the weight apparently settling in her huge belly. Willow staggered back a little, and as she lost her balance, Buffy heard a tearing noise. In a flash, Willow's skirt ripped away and her belly jutted forward with a prominent wobble. Willow could only gasp in horror at her half naked, bulging body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's any consolation Wil, I think you've stopped growing,\" Buffy shrugged, forcing a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Willow panted, her flabby new belly jiggling as she leant against the kitchen table for support. \"That's a plus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Buffy asked. \"Do you want to try another spell or something? Although at this rate, you'll give Xander a beer belly or turn Anya into a pig...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow frowned. \"Hey! A little sympathy here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Buffy said, apologetically. \"I'm sorry, you tried your best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Willow said. \"Now...erm...maybe I should get some new clothes, and you should check on Dawn?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Buffy nodded, and set off upstairs with Willow. Willow went first, which Buffy quickly realised was a bad idea. As the red haired wicca ascended the staircase, her very prominent belly jiggled and wobbled before her. Willow was also without a skirt, which gave Buffy a very direct view of her ass, which was clothed in a pair of black lace panties. Buffy tried not to look, but it was unavoidable, so she awkwardly followed Willow upstairs. Willow moved slowly, letting out small grunts and sighs, her hands were gripped around her flabby gut, trying to keep it still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you move around with one of these?\" Willow asked Buffy as they neared the top of the stairs. \"It's jiggling all over the place, I feel so achey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy shrugged. \"You get used to it, but you might want to wear some loose clothes for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, how am I going to explain this to Tara?\" Willow wondered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow reached the last step and turned to go into her room, giving Buffy a good view of her exposed belly as she moved away. It looked enormous from the side, and Buffy couldn't believe Willow had gotten so big so fast. What was even weirder was that only her belly had grown, making Willow look bizarre, with a belly that looked nine months pregnant atop her stick thin legs. Willow gave a grunt as she entered her room and closed the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy, with more than a little trepidation, turned the handle to Dawn's bedroom and quietly slipped inside. She was quickly made aware of Dawn's presence in the room by the sound of tearful sobbing, and she spotted a large lump under the covers of Dawn's bed. A <i>very</i> large lump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn?\" Buffy said, moving closer to the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden beneath the bed covers, Dawn shifted her body and turned away from Buffy. \"Go away!\" She said in a muffled voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, are you okay?\" Buffy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anyone to see me like this!\" Dawn said, louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn pulled the covers of her bed even further over her head, but, in doing so, exposed the bottom of her legs. Buffy looked down and saw that Dawn's once slim legs had become thick as small tree trunks, her feet swollen and flabby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, we'll find a way to change you back,\" Buffy said. \"It's happening to Willow too. She'll find a way to reverse the curse. I promise. I mean, I'm back to normal, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dawn pulled back the part of the bedsheet that covered her face, revealing a double chin and extremely chubby cheeks. Buffy could hardly believe the fat faced girl staring back at her was her own sister. She had changed dramatically since she had first begun growing in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure! It's okay for <i>you</i>!\" Dawn shouted angrily. \"You're the one who went out fighting the wrong demon and got herself cursed, and I'm the one who ends up turning into a fat pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotten twice as big as you did when you were growing!\" Dawn interrupted. \"It's not fair! None of my clothes will fit me anymore, and I only just stopped growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked at the floor, and saw the tattered remains of most of Dawn's wardrobe spread across the room. It looked as though she had tried everything on, and everything had been torn apart by her bloating body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawnie,\" Buffy began, as tears streaked down her sister's chubby cheeks. \"I'm so sorry I've brought this into our house, but I will make it stop. You won't be like this for much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn sniffed, calming down a little. \"O...Okay...\" She said, wiping away some of her tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, you can't be that big,\" Buffy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" Dawn frowned at Buffy, and sat up in the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy watched, her mouth hanging open, as Dawn pulled herself up, wrapping the covers around her to keep her naked body concealed. Dawn pulled the sheet up over her breasts and sat down on the edge of the bed so that could Buffy could get a good look at her. Buffy hadn't expected anything quite like this. A bit of a belly maybe, a fat ass, breasts that had gone up another cup size...but nothing quite like what she was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn was enormous! She looked around two hundred and fifty pounds, and although she was trying to keep much of her body hidden, Buffy could see her huge, flabby belly, which sagged down onto her chunky legs. Her ass was gigantic, a whole shelf of flab that jutted out behind her with two cheeks the size of basketballs. And her breasts...they must have been a D cup, if not bigger. Her double chin was unmissable, and there wasn't one inch of her body that wasn't coated in a thick layer of flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn had changed so much she was nearly unrecognisable, and Buffy knew she couldn't let her little sister carry on like this. She looked like she had gained twice the weight Buffy had. Another day or so and she might be immobile - a five hundred pound blob. Buffy couldn't let that happen, she laid her hand on Dawn's and looked into her wide face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, I'm going to change you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you,\" Dawn said. \"But Buffy...do it soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy took one last look at her sister and left the room, as Dawn lay back down and covered herself up, and resumed her sobbing. Buffy considered her next move...</span></div></div>",

After choosing a pair of tight black jeans and a white cotton v-neck shirt, she skipped downstairs to find Willow in a less happy mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white witch had struggled to fit into any of her clothes, and was reduced to wearing an old t-shirt of Xander's that had somehow found it's way into her wardrobe, paired with a pair of lumpy trackpants. The t-shirt was from an old beer promotion, and the company logo was oddly distorted by Willow's distended stomach. To an outside observer, it looked like she'd just downed an entire brewery. When Buffy walked in Willow was poking her blossoming belly and whimpering softly. She didn't even notice her friend's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy coughed. \"Hello? Earth to Rosenberg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked up, startled. \"Oh, sorry Buffy, it's just, cursed weight gain has a way of grabbing your attention.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBuffy grimaced, \"Tell me about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, remembering the sensation of her body swelling with fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any thoughts on what our next move should be?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Willow was once again absorbed in her gut, slapping it gently and watching it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy let out a sigh and went to get her coat. Slaying had got her into this problem, slaying would get her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround halfway to the spot where she first fought the obese demon (and having already staked two vampires, without breaking a sweat), Buffy felt a pang of hunger. As she rubbed her rumbling stomach she realised she hadn't eaten since the start if thus little misadventure. Slowly and inexorably becoming obese is a wonderful appetite suppressant. But now she was cured of the curse, there was no point in starving was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't exactly slay on an empty stomach now, can I?\" she rationalized. She tucked her stake, already at the ready, back into her inside pocket and went to get some food.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She didn't want to face anyone in her current condition, so had decided to stay hidden in her room until she decided on the right course of action. She was perched on the end of her bed, her protruding gut resting in her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled loudly, and Willow clutched at her flabby belly as she felt yet another pang of hunger. They had been happening since Buffy left the house, and Willow was sure that with her bigger belly came a bigger appetite. But she had been reluctant to eat, fearing that her condition would only worsen if she gave in to her hunger - she had visions of her stomach bloating to enormous sizes, touching the floor and tearing through her clothes. So far, only her belly was growing, and she wanted to make sure she didn't start to fatten up all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Willow heard a loud moaning noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooooooooooooooouuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow struggled to her feet, pushing herself off the bed with considerable difficulty, and headed to the source of the noise - Dawn's room. With some trepidation, Willow turned the handle and gingerly pushed the bedroom door open. She could hear a quiet moaning coming from somewhere in the room, and she looked over and spotted the huge mass beneath the sheets that was Dawn's enormous body. Willow was amazed by how big she had gotten...poor Dawnie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawnie?\" Willow said, moving towards the bed. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so...so...hungry!\" Dawn said, pulling back the covers in one swift motion so that her fat face was uncovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Willow drew closer, she heard loud rumblings coming from beneath the sheets, and saw Dawn clutching at her belly in pain. Willow could only imagine that Dawn was feeling about three times as hungry as she was, and she was feeling pretty darn hungry herself. Perhaps it was time to eat? If Dawn didn't get any food, it might begin affecting her health. Their bodies had changed dramatically in a very quick space of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should get something to eat...\" Willow said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes...please!\" Dawn whimpered. \"I'm so hungry! I can't stand it anymore! I didn't want to eat but...it hurts so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow nodded sympathetically. Dawn must have been having some serious hunger pangs. \"I'll be back in a moment,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow exited Dawn's room as her stomach rumbled loudly, and headed downstairs, her belly jiggling precariously with each step she took. She walked to the kitchen and opened up the fridge. Unfortunately, it was bare. Buffy clearly hadn't bothered to get any food in this week. The cupboards were similarly empty, and Willow didn't fancy going shopping in her current condition, which left only one option: a take out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow grabbed the phone and dialled the local pizza place. As she dialled, her stomach rumbled again, even louder than the last time, and she grabbed it in pain. \"That was a bad one...\" She muttered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally got through, her appetite took control of her decision. She decided to order extra large amounts of food, trying to convince herself she would just eat a small amount and save the rest for Dawn. Willow wanted to believe that she wouldn't eat all that much, but when she started putting her order in, she knew she was getting carried away. Soon enough, Willow had ordered a startling ten extra large, double stuffed crust pizza's with everything on them, French fries, garlic bread and two bottles of pepsi. She had never ordered so much food in her life, and when she put down the phone, she was shocked at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow, realising this would cost her quite a bit, grabbed her purse and pulled out a wad of notes. It looked like she had enough there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, after lounging around on the couch staring at her belly, Willow heard the door bell ring. She got up as quickly as she could, grabbed her money, and moved to the door. She opened the door carefully, and stuck her head around, careful not to reveal her bulging stomach to the delivery guy, who was holding a bag full of her food. Before the guy could say anything, Willow grabbed the bag and practically threw the cash at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But miss, what about your change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow pulled the food inside and slammed the door. \"Keep it!\" She shouted as she hurried back upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe re-entered Dawn's room, which began to fill with the smell of Pizza. Dawn sat up, still concealed by the covers of her bed, and suddenly smiled. \"You've sure got a lot there, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow smiled back, and placed the bag of food down on the edge of Dawn's bed. \"I think this should keep our bellies happy.\"</span></div></div>",

She gnawed the last chunk of chicken off the bone, before casually tossing the bone down on the tray on front of her, belching heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had staggered into the first restaurant she had come to, the tastefully named 'Gutbusters', a small 50s style diner, with obnoxious neon signs, garish red decor, and the kind of artery clogging food that could only come from a time before people new what calories were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Both the diner's menu and the elderly waitress had assured the starving slayer\u00a0that the heavily garnished \u00a0platter would be enough for six people, but she had finished it off with little trouble. Her stomach was puffed out with food, and she leaned back heavily, the cheap lino of the seat squeaking under her butt.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...\" she sighed, patting her small belly. \"Much better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just licking the last vestiges of barbecue sauce from her fingers when the same blue-haired waitress appeared, astonished by the slender young woman's eating ability.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you anything else?\" she asked jokingly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her further surprise, Buffy immediately sat up straight and began perusing the menu.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get...\" she began, eyes still locked on the menu, \"A double bacon cheeseburger with extra Gutbuster sauce, with onion rings and some chili cheese fries on the side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress stared. \"Anything else?\" she asked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy put the menu down. \"And a large chocolate shake... With whipped cream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress laughed and went to put in the order, leaving Buffy to rub her belly and try to rationalize her giant order.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just one burger,\" the blonde told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's not like I'm as big as Willow.\" she thought prodding her small paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Or poor Dawn\" she thought guiltily.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of her little sister, bloating out with blubber, Buffy made a silent promise to go find a cure for the curse as soon as she finished her burger.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at a dessert menu. Or maybe as soon as she had some of that pie... And she could hardly leave without trying at least one of those 'World-Famous' Gutbuster brownies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could hardly walk, and her stomach was gurgling ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy groaned and sat down on a crumbling headstone, her bulging belly popping the top button of her jeans, providing a modicum of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh....\" she sighed, \"Much better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rubbing her taut stomach, feeling the solid lump of food inside, and was considering just heading home and starting again tomorrow (Plus she was sure there was a pint of ice cream in the freezer...), when a snarling voice broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slayer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked up, expecting another Obefat demon, but it was just a common or garden variety vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Buffy began, not really too worried, despite her stuffed state, \"Can I help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the vampire interrupted her, obviously having had prepared a speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long have I awaited my chance for vengeance against you slayer, and tonight, I shall finally defeat...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped mid sentence, finally noticing his victim's predicament. A look of confusion crossed his distorted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy hauled herself to her feet, grunting as her stomach shifted, \"Yeah, I'll be fine. You ready to do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Doug.\" The vampire answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy grinned. \"Really? The magnificent dark lord Doug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" the magnificent dark lord Doug stuttered, \"That's not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Buffy was already sick of the conversation, and without warning launched into a spinning kick. While it succeeded in knocking Doug over, it also had the unwanted affect of busting the rest of the buttons on her jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Doug leapt back to his feet with supernatural agility, Buffy's pants began to slip down her toned legs, revealing a pair of skimpy white panties. Before she could react, Doug drove a bony shoulder into her chest, sending her reeling backwards. Normally it wouldn't have been a major problem, but as her jeans tangled around her ankles she felt herself tipping over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted, trying to break her fall, but she only succeeded in landing heavily on her burgeoning gut, knocking the wind out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh...\" Buffy groaned, \"That one hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her stomach sloshing, and felt an unfamiliar building up of pressure. Before she could react, she felt a grip like an iron vice grabbing the waistband of her underwear and pulling her upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oogh...\" Buffy gasped, as a second hand tightened around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha!\" cried Doug, \"Now, I shall kill you and make a name for myself as the vampire who killed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her seemingly desperate situation, Buffy was honestly more concerned with the churning, bubbling noises coming from her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both Doug and Buffy were interrupted by a large, meaty fart, which echoed around the graveyard, long and loud. Buffy's buttcheeks vibrated as she released the built-up gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh...\" she groaned, \"Much better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug was shocked into silence. \"Did you just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could recover, Buffy took advantage of his confusion to send a rapid uppercut into Doug's jaw, freeing herself. Quick as lightning, she grabbed a stake from inside her coat and thrust it into the vampire's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug vanished into a cloud of dust, leaving Buffy, pantsless and panting heavily, alone in the graveyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Doug,\" Buffy said aloud, putting her jeans back on, \"But there was no way I could let that particular episode get around the Hellmouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little better, having em, 'vented her frustrations', Buffy decided to head home. She patted her belly, which was still inflated with  food, and let out another small fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't let this happen too often.\" she sighed, \"No matter how much fun it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy shook her head. This wasn't fun... was it? It was just a little binge to let off some stress... wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed home, mulling it over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dawn's bedroom floor was littered with boxes and wrappers, as well as her discarded clothes. The gluttonous pair had torn into the food with wild abandon, meaning that plenty of it had ended up on the bedsheets, their clothes, and even their bodies. The room was, basically, a pigsty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez,\" groaned Willow, lying back on the bed, her incredibly swollen stomach jutting out over her pants like a small hot air balloon, \"I can't believe I spent over a hundred dollars on pizza!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer light green t-shirt had been pushed up to just under her breasts, fully exposing her pale white belly, while her grey sweatpants were a mess of tomato sauce, cheese and garlic mayonnaise. She had accidentally sat on one of the pizzas (which she ate regardless) explaining the large, perfectly circular stain on the seat of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" agreed Dawn, letting out a particularly pungent belch, \"And yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow glanced over at Dawn, sitting against the wall, barely covered by a now grubby bedsheet. She had done her best to maintain her modesty, but throughout the meal, usually whenever she dove for another slice of pizza, she had often let the sheet slip, giving Willow a quick glimpse of her wobbling butt cheeks, or her flabby belly. She really was huge, at least 250 pounds, which was a lot on her petite frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was intrigued, and scratched her gut, \" And yet...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn shrugged. \"It's kinda weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow smiled, patting her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawnie, does anything about this situation strike you as 'normal'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not.\" she admitted, \"It's just, it's kinda... nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, it's nice, like, not having to worry about your weight. There's not a lot I can do if I'm cursed is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow nodded in agreement, \"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Dawn continued, gaining confidence, \"If we don't care about gaining weight, We can eat whatever we want, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow gestured at the room, sitting up slowly, \"I think this is pretty much proof that we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, for the first time in my life, I've got curves!\" Dawn said proudly, pulling the sheet tight around her huge breasts. \"Well, sort of.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Willow giggled, slapping her stomach, \"Big sexy bellies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And big bootylicious butts!\" Dawn added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And tasty thunder thighs!\" Willow laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the pair simply dissolved into giggles, both striking outrageous 'sexy' poses with their engorged body parts. Just as Willow was sticking her belly out as far as it would go, almost ripping her pants and causing Dawn to hiccup with laughter, did they hear the front door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

The sudden movement of her bloated gut caused Willow to let out a loud, gassy belch, and she covered her mouth in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think it's Tara?\" Dawn asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gotta be,\" Willow confirmed. \"Oh my god...I didn't even think...what am I going to tell her?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, she doesn't know about...<i>this</i>?\" Dawn said, gesturing to Willow's ridiculously bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I uh...forgot to mention it,\" Willow shook her head sheepishly. In truth, she had planned to try and fix her gaining problem before Tara got back, but she had been so shocked by her sudden 'developments' and so totally fixated on eating, that she had completely forgotten that Tara was even coming home tonight. Time flew by when you were pigging out, apparently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we won't notice?\" Dawn shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...yeah...idiot.\" Dawn said, pointing to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie? Are you up there?\" Tara's voice called from the staircase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here!\" Dawn suddenly blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn!\" Willow hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry,\" Dawn said. \"Force of habit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow knew there was no escaping it now. She desperately tried to pull her shirt back down over her bloated gut, but it refused to budge so much as an inch. She looked around the room, gazing in horror at the mess she and Dawn had made. If Tara was to see her like this...what would she think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, see if you can hide some of the pizza boxes!\" Willow said, frantically gathering up the cardboard boxes and shoving them underneath Dawn's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can barely move!\" Dawn groaned, rubbing her enormous middle. \"You do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow ignored her, and carried on shoving the boxes under the bed. While she was hurriedly trying to cover her shame, Tara pulled the door open gently, and stepped into the room. Willow didn't notice her - she was still trying to clear away some of the mess left on Dawn's sheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...\" Tara broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's head shot upwards. She dropped an empty box to the floor as she came face to face with her lover, who was staring at her beach ball sized belly in amazement. Willow turned bright red, she had never felt more ashamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara...I uh...I...\" Willow didn't know what to say, she kept tugging at her shirt, hoping desperately that it would cover more of her exposed stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, what happened to you?\" Tara asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember me telling you how Buffy was cursed?\" Willow said, her cheeks bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were cursed too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly...\" Willow said. \"I thought I lifted the curse from Buffy, but something went wrong, and well...one poopoo lead to another and...me and Dawn ended up absorbing the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara seemed to notice Dawn from the first time, and her jaw dropped. \"Oh my God! Dawnie, you're enormous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn also turned red, and hoisted her bed sheets up to just below her double chin. \"Thanks...\" She said, sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, you know how tricky it is to lift a curse, you should have asked for help from me or Giles!\" Tara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it all seemed to be going so well until...you know...we started inflating...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara sniffed the air. \"Have you been eating pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no...\" Willow lied. \"Come on, why don't we go and do some research?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's probably a good idea,\" Tara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tara stared at her engorged girlfriend, rubbing her distended stomach, letting out the occasional groan, and obviously trying to stop herself from belching, she could only think of one thing...</span></div></div>",

She would never have imagined finding such a thing attractive, but right now, Willow's distended stomach was an amazing sight, made all the more arousing by the fact that the red head kept on rubbing her exposed bulge and giving groans of discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious, despite Willow's denial, that she and Dawn had just eaten a rather large meal; the grease stains could clearly be seen upon the bed sheets and Willow's clothing, and she even had some tomato sauce around the corners of her mouth. Willow forced her mouth shut, and Tara could see her desperately suppressing another belch. Her cheeks went red with the effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn, on the other hand, was not so modest. Her chubbified face peered over the sheets, and she let out a loud, gassy belch, and giggled sheepishly. \"Oops...sorry guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara looked from Dawn to Willow, secretly hoping that Willow would do the same, but her girlfriend appeared to be trying to retain at least a little dignity. She tugged awkwardly at her undersized shirt, and tried to stand up. Willow grasped her enormous gut in both hands, steadied herself, and slowly rose to her feet, letting out a tired groan when she was finally upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay sweetie?\" Tara asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow grunted. \"Yeah, I'm good...shall we go and research?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd offer to help but uh...I kinda want some clothes first...\" Dawn said, her eyes just visible over the food stained bed sheet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay Dawn, you get some rest,\" Tara said. \"I'll go find you some clothes tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Dawn said, lowering the sheet just enough so that Tara could see her smile, as well as her double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow waddled forward, obviously having great difficulty supporting her new belly on her skinny legs. It was amazing how all of her weight had settled in her rotund belly, which jiggled preposterously when she walked. Tara was tempted to support her, but was rather enjoying the sight of the incredibly bloated Willow trying to make it out of the room. As Tara followed Willow out, she heard a key turn in the front door, which meant that Buffy was home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow stepped out into the hall, leaning against the wall for support while her belly jiggled from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy, is that you?\" Willow called down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ermm...yeah...it's me...\" Buffy answered awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have any luck?\" Willow asked. \"Find anything that might help me and Dawn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, sorry,\" Buffy called back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow sighed, and rubbed a hand over her bulging stomach. Tara looked to the bottom of the stairs to see Buffy walk into sight and begin climbing the steps. There was something strange about the way she was walking, sort of slow and laboured. When Buffy got to the top of the stairs, Tara realised why...it seemed as though Willow and Dawn hadn't been the only ones enjoying a late night binge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy's belly was noticeably bloated. Not nearly as full and round as Willow's monstrous gut, but enough to cause her shirt to ride up slightly and exposed an inch of flesh. Her stomach was noticeably rounder than usual, and Tara had never seen Buffy in this state before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow had noticed too. \"Um...Buffy...you're not growing again...are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Buffy went red, feigning ignorance, then looked down and pretended to be surprised by her bloated belly. \"Oh this...right...well you know I hadn't eaten since I got cursed, so I figured I was entitled to a big meal, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Willow nodded. \"You must have been starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara stared from belly to belly, watching the two stuffed girls awkwardly rub their bellies. She also noticed that the top button on Buffy's pants had bust open, exposing a fraction of her panties...she had clearly enjoyed a <i>very</i> big meal tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna go to bed,\" Buffy said. \"Early slayer catches the demon...or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night,\" Willow and Tara said simultaneously, as Buffy hurried to her room, closing and locking the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should hit the hay too,\" Willow said. \"Research can wait until morning, I'm pooped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Tara said. \"I'm pretty tired myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked across the hallway to their room, and went inside. Tara quickly got undressed, and changed into her pyjamas, but Willow appeared to be hesitating. Tara pulled back the covers and climbed into bed, eager to see Willow's new body in all it's glory, but Willow was just staring nervously at Tara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Tara asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I want you to see me all bloated and gross...\" Willow said. \"I must look so disgusting to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, sweetie,\" Tara said comfortingly, rising from the bed, and placing a hand on her lovers enormous belly. \"I'd love you if you weighed one thousand pounds. Now come to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow smiled, and Tara smiled back, oddly aroused by the feeling of her girlfriends gargantuan gut. She slowly pulled her hand back, and got back into bed, as Willow got undressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head pulled her shirt awkwardly over her head and threw it aside, revealing an extremely tight looking bra. Tara gazed on at the topless Wicca, she could have sworn that her breasts had grown a little bigger too...but maybe she was imagining things. Willow slipped out of her pants, and stood in her underwear, which seemed to cling to her new body. Tara was amazed; she was still the same old Willow, but every ounce she had gained had gone to that wonderful, round belly. She looked massively pregnant...massively bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow clambered into bed, and pulled the covers back. Her belly was making some slurring noises, and she moaned a little as her body hit the bed. Tara, immensely turned on, cuddled up to her, and wrapped her arms around that wonderful, swollen stomach, as they drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She had hoped to avoid being seen, and had expected Willow and Tara to be in bed by now. She hoped Willow wouldn't think she was being ungrateful. Her friend had finally found a way to remove Buffy's enormous belly, and the slayer had just gone out and brought it back again! Admittedly, this time it would only be temporary, but still, Buffy felt a little guilty. There was Willow, with a belly that had already reached a larger size than Buffy's had once been - and Buffy came waltzing in with a bloated stomach and an open pants button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked down at her swollen stomach, and rubbed her hand over it's concave shape. In this light, it actually looked a lot bigger. She had never been given to overindulgence, but her hunger had taken over this evening. Despite feeling like a total pig though, Buffy wasn't really all that bothered, in fact, after the ordeal she had just been through, she figured she deserved a little treat. Well...a <i>big</i> treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slayer slipped her pants down her legs, glad to be free of them. Skin tight pants and a bloated stomach definitely did <i>not</i> mix. She pulled her top over her head and tossed it aside, then turned to her full length mirror to examine the full extent of her binge eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy gasped at her own reflection, she looked absolutely stuffed! She placed a hand on her bulging belly, and felt it's firmness beneath her fingers. She had looked like this in her entire life, she had never even been able to eat this much without throwing up! But now, she looked like she had swallowed a basketball. She stared curiously at her bloated form, slowly rubbing the curve of her inflated stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <i>so</i> not doing this again,\" Buffy told herself, turning to the side and staring in wonder at her overstuffed waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel tired, and heavy, Buffy climbed into bed, not even bothering to change into her pyjamas, though she doubted she could get them to fasten over her stomach tonight anyway. It wasn't long before she fell asleep, hand resting comfortably atop her bloated, food stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy's eyes shot open as a deafening scream sounded through the Summers' house. Immediately, the Slayer jumped out of bed, grabbed a stake from her bedside table and charged into the corridor. It was empty, but the scream had definitely come from somewhere nearby. Buffy moved down the corridor slowly, the stake gripped firmly in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust ahead, she saw the door to Willow and Tara's room open, and raised her stake instinctively. To Buffy's relief, the only thing that came out of the door was Tara, who rubbed her eyes tiredly, and gave the stake wielding Buffy a quizzical look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Buffy said with a smile, lowering the stake. \"When I hear a scream, I usually end up needing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard it too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard not to,\" Buffy said. \"I think they heard it in Hell. It wasn't Willow was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhhhh...\" a mumbling groan came from behind Tara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy and Tara turned to see Willow waddling towards them, and Buffy's eyes nearly popped out of her head when she saw her huge the red-headed witch had become. Her stomach looked as though it had doubled in size overnight, it had turned from a pregnant looking belly to a monstrously large and flabby gut, which sagged down almost to her knees. Buffy was horrified by how big her friend had become. It was hard to believe this was the same, skinny Willow who Buffy had known all these years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't me,\" Willow said, approaching the doorway slowly, her gigantic gut jiggling from side to side. \"Not that I wouldn't have had good reason to scream looking the way I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow stared down at her belly sadly, causing Tara to place a comforting hand atop her girlfriend's stomach. She and Willow's eyes met and they shared a comforting smile. Buffy tried not to stare, and shifted her gaze to Dawn's bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that just leaves Dawn,\" Buffy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably check on her,\" Willow said. \"It looks like my growth accelerated overnight, the same thing probably happened to Dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense. Buffy knew all too well that the curse affecting her friend and sister was unpredictable, and seemed to strike at any moment. Buffy remembered the feeling of helplessness she had experienced when her body had begun expanding before her eyes, and she shuddered. Dawn had already gotten bigger than Buffy had been...how big would she be now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some trepidation, Buffy slowly turned the knob of Dawn's bedroom door and pushed it open, peering round the door frame and into the darkened room. As she stepped inside, she heard a quiet sobbing coming from the far side of the room. There, in the corner of the room, sat Dawn, her entire body concealed behind the entirety of her bedsheets, and only her blotchy, chubby face could be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawnie, you okay?\" Buffy asked, moving towards her sobbing sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn looked up, tears in her eyes, and tugged at her bedsheets. \"Buffy...I...I...I don't want you to see me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara and Willow followed Buffy into the room, but stayed back as Buffy knelt down besides Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I woke everyone up, huh?\" Dawn said, wiping the tears from her eyes with a flabby arm. \"Sorry. I...I weighed myself this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy wasn't sure what to say. She gave Dawn a sympathetic look, but wasn't sure she wanted to ask any more questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I broke the scales,\" Dawn said, and she pointed to the bathroom scales, which were lying nearby. \"But before they gave in, I saw the needles hit three hundred pounds. Three hundred <i>pounds </i>Buffy! I mean, that's as high as our scales go, I might even weigh <i>more </i>than that! I'm so massive...I just want this all to be over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn burst into tears again, and pulled her sheets up to her face so she could use them to dry her tears. As the sheet lifted up, Buffy got a glimpse of Dawn's bulging stomach, which, frankly, looked even bigger than Willow's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Dawn, we'll find a way out of this,\" Willow said, moving a little closer. \"We're going to hit the books today and a find a way to stop this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm going to find the Demons that did this,\" Buffy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn said nothing, she simply nodded and wiped her eyes again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy stood up, and as she did, she heard an incredibly loud growling noise. She jumped back, and suddenly realised the noise had come from Willow's stomach. Willow went bright red, and clutched at her monstrous belly in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...I'm kinda hungry,\" Willow said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too...\" Dawn said weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fix you something,\" Tara said, hurrying out of the room with surprising speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get changed and go on an early patrol, see what I can find,\" Buffy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Willow slumped down onto Dawn's bed, Buffy exited the room and left the two growing girls alone. She wasn't sure how exactly to deal with this situation, so she had decided to stick to what she did best - slaying. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, deciding she could do no good at home, Buffy set out on an early morning patrol. Buffy doubted she would find anything useful at such an early hour of the morning - Demons tended to avoid the sunlight - but still, she didn't want to hang around the house while Dawn and Willow grew to ever more ridiculous sizes. The whole situation freaked Buffy out, and while she herself wasn't expanding anymore, her late night binge yesterday had brought back memories of her growing belly. She didn't want to go down that road again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy headed for her usual haunt, the graveyard. The most reliable Demon hunting spot in all of Sunnydale. She suspected that if a Demon was awake at this time, they could be found here. It was quiet, out of the way and at this time of the morning, probably Slayer-free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssssssslaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyerrrrrrrrr!\" A hideous voice screeched from behind Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it kill one of you Demons to just say 'Hello' once in a while?\" Buffy sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slayer turned around, and found herself face to face with a familiar looking Demon. She realised, instantly, that this was one of the Obefat Demons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You killed one of my sisters!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you caused one of mine to blow up like a balloon, I'd say that makes us even,\" Buffy replied, drawing her stake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did no such thing...unless...you tried to reverse the effects of one of our curses?\" The fat demon questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy didn't reply, and instead just gave the Demon an icy stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Demon simply laughed a deep, menacing laugh. \"A dangerous business, trying to remove an Obefat curse. It could easily go wrong, without our fresh blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy realised what the Demon meant, but decided to play dumb and try to extract more information from it. \"So...what if someone tried to remove one of your curses from themselves, what would be the consequences?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon laughed once again. \"The curse can never be completely lifted, unless an Obefat Demon like myself performs the correct ritual. If someone else attempts to lift the curse, even with our blood, the results will not be quite what they expect. The curse can be lifted from it's original occupant, but not completely destroyed - instead, the curse will transfer to one or more nearby vessels, and leave a lasting impact on it's original occupant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was worried by that last remark. \"What do you mean, a lasting impact?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will find a way to fulfil it's objective, by making you fat, by whatever means necessary. I know you were cursed by my sister Slayer, I can sense it. You may think you have escaped our curse, but your troubles are only just beginning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was getting angry now. \"What do you mean?! Tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you found yourself growing a little more ravenous lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! I can see that you have! You will find yourself growing an insatiable hunger as time goes by, you will be unable to stop yourself from indulging, and soon, your body will fatten and grow as we had intended!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take anymore, Buffy charged at the Demon, but it dodged her attack with surprising speed. Buffy spun around to launch another attack, only to find the Demon had completely disappeared. She considered its words, furious beyond belief that the curse had found a way to continue it's work. She stared at the space the Obefat had left behind and sighed. \"Crap.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the House, Tara had worked feverishly to prepare a breakfast for Willow and Dawn. After making an early morning shopping trip, Tara had returned to the house will all manner of breakfast foods - sausages, bacon, eggs, waffles and pancakes, among others, had all been cooked up in copious amounts and served to the two growing girls upstairs. Tara had to admit that, besides satisfying her friends' painfully ravenous appetites, she had an ulterior motive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some unknown reason, Tara had been incredibly aroused by the sight of Willow's growing belly. Watching her red haired girlfriend's stomach expand to such an enormous size had been such a bizarre turn on that Tara's mind was now occupied with thoughts of making it even bigger. She had watched Willow in bed last night, as she tossed and turned, her stomach slowly bulging and bloating to bigger sizes as the night went on. Willow seemed to be taking it much better than Dawn, who had gotten considerably larger, all over. Willow's growth seemed to have stuck entirely in her bulging belly, but Tara was wondering if she could change that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, after trays and trays of food had been deposited in Dawn's room by Tara, Willow and Dawn were digging into their feast. With Willow's assistance, Dawn had cobbled together a makeshift dress from two bedsheets, which kept her body concealed. Dawn was still hiding herself away in her room, but was feeling slightly less humiliated with a little more fabric to cover herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow, on the other hand, had lost all sense of modesty. She sat on the edge of Dawn's bed, surrounded by plates, her massive belly hanging between her legs, almost touching the floor. She hadn't stopped eating since Tara brought them the food, and was determined to fill her massive gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn was eating with an equally ravenous appetite, her bloated stomach was now causing the bed sheet dress to tighten around her bloated form. Both girls had barely spoken since the food arrived, and were focused only on filling their hungry bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open, and Tara stuck her head round. \"Hey, how are you two doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn muffled a response as she took a bite of waffle. Willow swallowed the mouthful she had been chewing and exhaled slowly. \"Good, thanks...\" Willow said, finding herself out of breath. \"I can't believe I'm still not full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard a strange noise...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A strange hissing noise suddenly filled the room. For a moment, Dawn feared it might be the sound of her body about to blow up - from the moment the curse had transferred into her body, she had been terrified of reaching a size so large that her entire body would explode like an over inflated balloon. Willow seemed to be thinking the same, and was looking down at her immensely bloated gut as though it was the source of the hissing noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's you, Will,\" Tara said, and she raised her hand and pointed at a cloud of smoke that was seeping in through the open window on the far side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smoke?\" Dawn questioned, peering at the strange cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow shook her head. \"Can't be, I don't smell anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara backed away as the cloud of smoke grew nearer, Dawn pulled her bedsheets tighter, and Willow, who could not see past her huge belly, squirmed to get a better view. Suddenly, the smoke began to rise upwards, it formed a tall column and began to take on a different shape altogether. The three girls watched in amazement as the smoke grew thicker, and began to form a humanoid shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no ordinary smoke...\" Willow gulped nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a monstrous, bloated figure stepped out of the cloud and lurched towards the girls. Dawn gave a gasp and pushed herself back against the wall, kicking over several empty plates of food in the process. Willow leaned back, too stuffed to make any other movement. Tara moved closer to her partner, as they stared at the Demonic figure before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow stood her ground, though she doubted she looked very threatening in her current state. She realised instantly what this Demon was, she recognised the picture from Giles' books. \"You're an Obefat. The Demon that cursed Buffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct,\" the Obefat sneered. \"And you must be the foolish Wicca who tried to remove our curse from the Slayer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow simply glared at the Demon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Obefat threw back it's bulbous head and laughed, causing it's several chins to wobble. \"Stupid girl, our curses are not for amateurs to toy with! See what your meddling has cost you!\" she gestured to Willow's exposed belly. \"All of the weight from the curse now gathers in your belly! Hahaha! How sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to us! Not Willow!\" Dawn suddenly hissed from the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Obefat turned her attention to Dawn, and she laughed again. \"Oh dear...you are much larger than the others, aren't you, little one? Quick a rapid weight gain. Very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn gave the Demon a disgusted look. \"Nothing about this is <i>nice</i>. Change us back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, the Demon seriously seemed to consider this for a moment.Dawn and Willow both stared at the Demon fearfully, wondering what was coming next...</span></div></div>",

Willow looked up at Tara, and they both exchanged concerned looks. Dawn watched fearfully from the corner, unsure of what to do, worried that if she tried to escape the room she might end up even fatter than she currently was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"KRAK KRAK INVICTIOR KRAK, RAKASH!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Obefat was saying words that Willow did not understand, but she still got the feeling this was a powerful spell. The red haired Witch felt totally helpless, but there was nothing she could do right now, even if she had the ingredients for a spell nearby, she would have felt too bloated and tired to use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"RAKASH!\"</i> The Obefat shouted, finishing the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a ball of purple energy formed in mid air, it hovered there for a moment, then zoomed towards Dawn, who screamed. The energy ball went through the bedsheets and straight into Dawn's body. Dawn started to freak out, peeking underneath the sheets frantically at her body. Suddenly, the ball of energy shot back out of Dawn's body and flew directly into Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara stared as the ball of light vanished again, and then, once more, zoomed into sight, and, finally, exploded into dust in mid air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done,\" the Obefat smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done what?\" Dawn asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn didn't need to wait long for her answer. She suddenly felt her entire body being overcome with a strange, tingling sensation, she felt a cramp in her stomach, and clutched at her flabby belly. She was getting herself ready for another growth spurt. <i>Please don't get any bigger, please  don't get any bigger, please don't get any bigger...</i> Dawn repeated over and over in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, to Dawn's amazement, she wasn't getting bigger, in fact, she could actually feel her bulging belly deflating beneath her hands. A smile spread across her face and she lifted up the bed sheets for a better look at her body - she was still totally naked under the oversized sheet, so could see every inch of her chubby new body perfectly...and her eyes did not decieve her, she was getting thinner! Her belly was shrinking, her thighs were thinning out and her breasts were returning to a half way normal size. Dawn was amazed at how much weight she was losing in such a quick space of time, she was getting closer to her original size now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys! I'm changing back!\" Dawn squealed excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" The Obefat Demon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dawn's body stopped shrinking. She stared down at her pot belly in disappointment. \"Hey, why did you stop?!\" She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I removed a good 200 pounds from your body girl, stop complaining!\" The Demon snapped. \"Now it's the witch's turn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn?\" Willow didn't need to wait long for an answer to her question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked down at her bulbous stomach, and found that, like Dawn's, it was shrinking! A smile spread across her lips as she watched her stomach deflate. For some reason, Tara didn't look all that happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's working, it's -\" Willow suddenly stopped talking as she felt her stomach's deflation grind to a halt, leaving her with a belly that was still very large, albeit not nearly as big as before. \"Why did it stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're not done yet,\" The Demon smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow suddenly started to feel oddly constricted by her clothes. While her belly had put some strain on her pants due to it's vast size, she had not experienced any trouble with the rest of her wardrobe, and why should she? Her belly was the only part of her body that had been growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that seemed to be changing now. Tara stared on in shock as Willow's ass began to inflate, pushing against the back of her already unbuttoned jeans. Willow could feel something happening to her ass, but she wasn't sure what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Willow! Your ass is getting huge!\" Dawn blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ass? I...oh no...\" Willow sighed. \"That's what you meant by 'even things out'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon just laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow reached a hand around to her butt, and touched the exposed flesh of her swelling butt cheeks. She gasped at the feel of how large her rump was becoming, and pulled her hand away in shock. As she brought the hand back up to her face, she noticed that it too was starting to change. Her arms were getting thicker, and her fingers were growing chubbier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara could only watch in bewilderment as her lover's ass squirmed to escape her jeans. Willow gave a grunt as the jeans began to cut into her growing midsection, and, as if on cue, her growing ass completely tore through the seat of her pants. Willow's underwear became a little more than a thong as her butt cheeks grew larger still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Willow's breasts had also started to change. Her once modest B-cup had already reached a C and was now pushing a Double D. Willow groaned as her shirt tightened around her chest, and it's buttons began to pop off and fly in different directions. With an almighty tear, the shirt exploded open, and Willow's generous cleavage burst out with a precarious wobble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Willow squealed, instantly trying to cover up her ample new assets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara seemed mesmerised by Willow's increasingly dramatic transformation, her weight was rapidly going up. She was starting to reach the size Dawn had once been, and looked like she was going to go past it! Rolls of flab formed everywhere on her once skinny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow heard another tear, which she could only assume was her underwear giving way. Shortly after, she heard a snap, and her bra came undone, pushed to it's limits by her huge breasts. Willow's chubby arms ripped through the sleeves of her shirt, shredding the last item of clothing she had left, leaving Willow very much naked, and very much fat. She gazed up at Tara, her face now round and chubby, with a double chin. Tara just stared back, her mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think that should do it,\" The Obefat chuckled as Willow's body finally stopped growing. \"About 300 pounds I'd say...and the other girl about 200. It's only fair that you should be bigger, after all, you started this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME?!\" Willow roared, her whole body shaking. \"You did this! When Buffy finds you -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Slayer will soon be in no position to help either of you,\" the Obefat laughed. \"Now, what else can I do for you?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the first time, the flabby demon seemed to notice Tara standing next to the now massive Willow. It took her in, before smiling and licking its plump lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow tried to waddle her way in front of Tara. \"You leave her alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon simply waved a chubby hand and, suddenly, Willow was doubled over in pain, clutching her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow!\" Tara cried. Behind her, she heard a thump as Dawn slumped over on her bed, also holding her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... hungry...\" Willow moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara looked up at the demon, who smiled evilly. \"Fear not, the hunger will pass. I simply wanted to talk to you while your companions were otherwise distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara swallowed, desperately trying to remember a defensive spell, and drawing a blank. She tried to stall. \"Wh-Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon snorted. \"I can sense it within you mortal. You are like me and my kind. You gain pleasure from the fat, the corpulence, the gross obesity of others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara flushed. It was true, she had found something strangely erotic about the recent goings on in the Summers household. All the big bellies and bulges had been hard enough, but to see Willow swelling and growing first hand had almost been too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon carried on with its spiel. \"So mortal, in recognition of our shared appreciation, I offer you this boon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon made a complicated hand gesture, and a ball of blue light appeared, hovered in place briefly, and zoomed into Tara's chest. She lurched backwards, but after a few seconds realised she wasn't getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon saw her confusion. \"Now you too have the power to alter size and shape as you see fit. Simply will it, and it will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's work done, the demon began to dissolve into a the same mist that had heralded its arrival. Finally Tara found her voice. <br>\r\n\"Well, what if I just use it to help my friends get back to normal? Your revenge will be ruined!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon grinned, as it began to disappear. \"Yes, what if? It's your choice, although I warn you your friends' hunger is beginning to subside. They will soon return to their senses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last word echoed through the room, and the demon was gone. Tara looked down at Willow's prostrate form and saw a feeble stirring, her back fat jiggling as she moved. Dawn moaned from behind her, the bedsprings creaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara knew what she should do, what she had to do. She closed her eyes and concentrated, feeling the magic start to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Willow staggered back to her feet, struggling under her new weight. \"What happened..?\" she murmured, before her mind cleared and she saw Tara. \"Oh my!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTara stood in front of her, sporting a stomach halfway between potbelly and beergut. It had caused her beige sweater to ride up and popped the lower buttons on her blouse, as well as the top button of her jeans. Her pale flesh was firm rather than flabby, as Willow's had been the previous day. Aside from that, she seemed unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Tara, it got you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded, trying to look as distraught as Willow had been. \"It said we were all involved now, and that our weight would keep changing and growing randomly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow went in for a hug, awkward with all her added mass and Tara's turgid stomach, but heartfelt nonetheless. Tara felt guilty as she enjoyed the sensation of Willow's pillowy arms wrapped around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn stood up, her still impressive boobs now perkier than they had been before, and patted Tara on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Buffy is on the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded, secretly imagining what effect her new powers would have on the Slayer's pert rear and toned stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some distance away from the house, Buffy Summers sat in Sunnydale's local fast food joint; the Doublemeat Palace. Sitting in a booth, her table covered in mounds of greasy, fatty junk food, the Slayer was stuffing her face like a woman possessed. Since her encounter with the Obefat Demon earlier - in which she had been warned that the curse would find a way to beat her - Buffy had been overcome with hunger. This wasn't just the empty feeling that had lead her to Gutbusters last night, this was full on, keeling over in pain if she didn't eat hunger! She had literally stumbled into the Doublemeat palace, clutching her empty stomach and groaning in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier had given her a bizarre look as she heaved and moaned her way to the counter, and they had looked even more mystified when the svelte, blonde girl had tipped her purse open onto the counter and ordered \"one of everything\". Buffy knew the feast she had ordered was making her look like a complete and total pig, but she didn't care, she just needed to be full to stop that gut wrenching agony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, half an hour later, Buffy had worked her way through two large fries, three doublemeat cheesburgers and about three large sodas. She found the soda helped fill up her more quickly, so was trying to consume more of that rather than the fatty junk food, but it was hard to find the right balance. She started on her fourth burger, tearing off the rapper and taking a huge bite before casting a furtive glance up at the cashier, who was still giving her a very confused look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Probably wandering how a girl like me can pack so much away...\"</i> Buffy thought, taking another bite and wiping some tomato sauce from around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had not dared look down, but Buffy knew that her toned stomach was beginning to bloat. She could feel her jeans tightening around her waist, but was convinced this wouldn't be a problem. She had torn through enough clothes in the past few days to know when her pants were about to burst open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she shoved more and more food into her mouth, the pain in her belly gradually began to subside, but Buffy didn't even notice. Her hunger continued, and she barely broke a sweat as she crammed more and more food into her open mouth, guzzling on her \"diet\" pepsi in-between mouthfuls. She was completely consumed by her ravenous appetite now, her every thought focused on food, her every movement simply a grab for another mouthful. Chomping through burgers on all shapes and sizes, handfuls of chunky french fries and the occasional sugary doughnut, the Slayer was rapidly becoming a one woman advert for the Doublemeat Palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, why does that girl have so much food?\" A young boy asked as he and his mother walked past Buffy's table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy saw them out of the corner of her eye as she tore into a spicy chicken burger, giving a satisfied moan as she swallowed. She barely heard what the mother and son said as they walked past, giving her a disapproving look. Buffy watched them go and finally stopped for a breather, slumping back into the soft chair of the booth and letting out a loud, gassy belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhhh...\" Buffy groaned, letting her hands fall to her bloated stomach. She surveyed the table, and found that nearly every scrap of food had been devoured in her fit of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Buffy's hands touched her stomach, she realized just how bloated she had become. She felt the expanse of her bulging gut and looked down to see what looked like a basketball shoved under her sweater. Her stomach had been transformed into a huge, round ball, making her look rather pregnant. At this moment, Buffy realized she had probably gone too far. The pain in her stomach had subsided a long time ago, but she had continued stuffing her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta get home...\" Buffy murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bloated and tired, Buffy slid along the seat and sluggishly tried to stand. Her ponderous belly almost trapped her in the booth, and she had to squeeze it past the table as she stood up. More customers were looking over at her now, and she greeted their stares with another noisy belch. Some people laughed, others looked disgusted. Buffy blushed red with embarrassment and hurried out the door. She felt humiliated, and decided to head home before anyone else saw her in this state...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Buffy made her way home, the other members of the Summers household were readjusting to their recently modified physiques. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow sat on the couch, taking up most of the space with her expanded rear end. Tara had helped her tug off her jeans, and she had switched her torn underpants for a fresh pair. One of her stretched out t-shirts covered her breasts, while a large expanse of her belly was still visible. Tara, sitting on the armchair, hadn't bothered changing her clothes, her sweater and blouse still riding up over her gut, which she was rubbing, feeling the same strange arousal she had when she watched Willow grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, check it out!\" said Dawn, as she strode in, \"I can fit back into my clothes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFit might have been a generous description, judging by the way she had crammed herself into them. Her breasts were squished against the fabric of her red shirt, and her tight jeans were riding low under her still prominent belly. She smiled, a second chin coming into view, and span around, showing her cute bubble butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good Dawnie.\" Willow replied weakly, shifting uncomfortably on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara, partly to make Willow feel better, mostly out of mischief, added a few pounds to the teenager's butt cheeks, which bulged out and caused the top button of her pants to pop open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it!\" Dawn groaned, reaching around and picking the wedgie out of her crack. \"I'm growing again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara stifled a giggle, and decided to play along. \"Oh, I'm growing too!\". She felt a pleasurable tickle down below as her bra straps strained, as she bumped her self up to a CC cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow and Dawn looked on. Dawn grimaced. \"At least its your boobs, and not your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded, but suddenly felt a new sensation. She placed a hand on her stomach, and felt a rumble. \"Man, I'm getting hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's belly let out an answering grumble, and she squeaked. \"Man, I gotta eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned around and hurried to the kitchen, followed closely by Tara. Willow rocked back and forth, trying to pull herself off the couch, hunger pangs ripping through her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, wait! Help me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she waddled into the kitchen, the other two were already rifling through the cupboards. Tara was hastily unwrapping snack cakes before cramming two or three into her mouth at a time, while Dawn was taking large bites out of a block of cheddar cheese. Willow muscled Dawn from in front of the fridge and grabbed a turkey leg from the half eaten bird, sinking her teeth into the cold meat. Dawn rained some halfhearted blows on her corpulent friend's side, before the hunger forced her to seek food elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's mind was racing as she squeezed a tube of icing into her mouth, inflating her cheeks. She was so hungry, but she wasn't supposed to be cursed! What had that Demon done to her. She looked over at her girlfriend, who turned as she chugged a gallon of chocolate milk, a stray rivulet running down her chin and neck, staining her t-shirt. Meanwhile, Dawn was bent over rooting around in the cupboards, her jeans slipping down revealing her ass bulging beneath her pink panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara considered adding another few pounds to that little butt, or maybe making Willow's arms a little pillowier, but she was suddenly overcome with another wave of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy arrives home feeling hungry again...</span></div></div>",

She stood in shock, her mouth wide open as she stared around at her chubby sister and friends. Dawn let out a loud belch and covered her mouth in embarrassment, Willow tried to pull her shirt down over her huge gut and Tara swallowed a mouthful of ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...Buffy...\" Tara struggled to explain. \"We were just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating?\" Buffy raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorging trio nodded awkwardly while still munching their food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything left?\" Buffy asked again, a serious look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn nodded. \"Yeah...we only just got started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Buffy replied. \"Because I'm absolutely starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone's immense surprise, Buffy charged towards the fridge and seized a tube of cookie-dough. The others watched her in confusion as the slender Slayer squeezed the contents of the tube into her mouth, causing her cheeks to puff up considerably. Tara looked on in confusion, wondering why Buffy was suddenly feeling the same hunger that she had...Willow had managed to cure her of the Obefat's curse earlier today...had the spell failed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy pulled the tube away from her mouth and gasped for air. For the first time, she noticed everyone staring at her. \"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy...are you...feeling okay?\" Willow asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it turned out...the curse wasn't that easy to escape,\" Buffy sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Tara asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy put down the cookie dough and opened up her jacket, revealing a very bloated looking stomach. She ran a hand over her bulging belly and lifted up her skin tight top, exposing her rounded middle. \"I've had a serious case of the munchies all night,\" she patted her bare belly for emphasis. \"Apparently it finds a way to fatten you up, no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Willow moaned. \"I thought we'd made some progress earlier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only progress you made was fattening me up too,\" Dawn pouted. \"And now we find out you spell didn't even work?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara had not realized that endless hunger came with the curse...was she doomed to stuff herself to obesity now too? She hadn't expected this. She was about to question Buffy further when her stomach rumbled audibly. She instantly forgot about the curse and and resumed eating, devouring the rest of her tube of icing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara got cursed too, huh?\" Buffy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave her away?\" Willow laughed as she watched Tara's stomach bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn had found a jumbo sized bag of potato chips and was wolfing them down eagerly. She threw back her head and tipped the contents of the bag into her mouth in a frenzy, one hand rubbing her pot belly as she chowed down. Her unbuttoned jeans slipped down her thighs and hit the floor, but she didn't seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy and Willow exchanged a quick shrug before they joined the others in pigging out. Despite being the slimmest one in the kitchen, Buffy seemed to have the biggest appetite, and was quickly grabbing anything and everything she could lay her hands on. Willow was not far behind her, chugging gallons of chocolate milk before she slumped to the floor and propped herself up against the fridge, belching and groaning as her exposed gut continued to bloat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn had finished her potato chips and was now seeking something more satisfying. She switched on the microwave and grabbed some hot pockets from the cupboard. Tara, approving of Dawn's idea, turned on the oven and crammed in several pizzas and some french fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come oonnnnnn...\" Tara moaned, rubbing her belly as she waited for the food to cook. It seemed to be taking an eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the 'DING' sound finally came, Tara and Dawn spread their newly cooked food out amongst the group, and their gluttony continued as they grabbed at slices of pizza, hot pockets and handfuls of fries. Bellies bulged, burps were heard and by the end of the feast the girls had consumed every item of food in the house. Tara waddled towards Willow and slumped down beside her girlfriend, her expanded stomach threatening to rip through her clothes. Willow gave a moan as she massaged her friend's full stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside them, Dawn was squeezing the last of a tube of mayonnaise into her mouth. The clothes she had been so happy to 'fit' into earlier now did very little to conceal her bloated state. Her top had ridden up just below her boobs, while her chubby little behind threatened to swallow her underwear. She held her full belly in both hands as she staggered from the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was in a similar state, and was so full she could barely move. She had pulled up her top earlier, and had been unable to pull it back down once she started eating. Half an hour into the feast, she had decided to unbutton her jeans, and it didn't look like she would be buttoning them up again any time soon. She groaned noisily as she walked into the next room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't stay here all night,\" Willow groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Tara burped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two witches helped one another up, Tara almost being dragged back down due to Willow's weight; she was easily pushing two hundred and fifty pounds now.  They dragged themselves into the lounge, where Buffy and Dawn had collapsed onto the couch. Willow and Tara slumped into the couch opposite the two sisters, moaning in relief as their butts hid the seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so big...\" Willow moaned. \"I can't believe how huge I look.\"</span></div></div>",

She didn't believe that it would leave her home without, at least, doing something else to the others and her. Her noises had distracted the Obefat and so had drawn its attention back to her. In a reasonably calm tone it asked, \"Alright kid, what's the matter with you.\"  Dawn now near tears spits out, \"It's not fair that Buffy leaves me alone most nights when she goes off to do her slaying. And <b>NOW</b> I'm stuck with <u><b>HER curse.</b></u> I just wish that some of this weight was distributed better. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncidentally Miss Obefat since I'm twice as heavy as before, I can't even go to school tomorrow. All the kids there will just put me down for being such a slob and <u><b>GAINING <i>so much</i> MORE</b></u> weight. For the first time in its very long life, the Obefat actually felt pity for one of its victims. Dawn's pain reminded it about when it was young and its older sisters <i>ALSO</i> made her stay home because she was to young. So the Obefat decided to cheer up Dawn and do to her something it had never done before. It would fulfill her wish in an unexpectedly interesting way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile downstairs:<br>\r\nBuffy had finally returned home after doing some more searching around Sunnydale. Just as she opened the front door she heard the unmistakable sound of Willow inflating. Thinking that maybe this time she can catch the Obefat unprepared, Buffy quietly ascended the stairs to Dawn's room. Pulling 2 stakes out (one for each hand) Buffy stealthily approached Dawn's bedroom door. Hearing Dawn crying increased Buffy's resolve to kill that Obefat as quickly as possible. Buffy quietly and slowly eased the door open with her foot waiting for the perfect moment to sneak in and lunge at the Obefat demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside Dawn's bedroom:<br>\r\nHearing the Obefat say, (smirking) \"Well little girl, I've got a <i><b>REALLY BIG</b></i> surprise for you. I'm going to fulfill your wish, <i><u><b>RIGHT NOW!!</b></u></i>\" The Obefat starts reciting her spell over Dawn's head. As she raises her hands higher over Dawn, Dawn grows a foot taller but stays just as obese. In less than a minute, Dawn has gained back all the weight she had recently lost with an additional 75 pounds. Tara then (without realizing it) lustily yells out, \"Dawn, I love your new body. You're so <b>BIG and BEAUTIFUL !!</b> I only wish you'd grown <b>THREE times bigger instead of <i>JUST</i> two.\"</b> With everyone now looking at Tara, no-one noticed the Obefat raise her eyebrow over that declaration.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Obefat then turned its attention back to Willow. Saying to Willow, \"Witch you're looking <b>WAY</b> too thin for my tastes.\" She proceeds to fatten up Willow a whole lot more than Dawn. To teach her another lesson, while Willow's body is growing fatter she's doesn't notice she's also growing shorter. Unfortunately for her, Buffy decided at that moment to jump in and attack the Obefat. So Buffy's caught in the spells effect, losing several inches in height while she gaining nearly 8 more stone (110 pounds.) Tara <u>now has a very weighty</u> decision to make. Which <b>ONE</b> of the 2 much heavier girls she's taking to bed <u><i>FIRST</i></u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turning to look she saw that her butt was already massive, easily the size of a pair of basketballs, straining against her jeans. Her hips had not been spared either, swelling up to mat her now enormous buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the situation Buffy let out a brief chuckle as her mind went back to the time the town lost the ability to speak and she had silently protested that Giles drawings made her hips look too big, if only she knew what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow what's going on? I thought you transferred all the weight to Dawn?\" Buffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow shrugged, with a helpless look on her face. \"I don't know, I didn't expect it to transfer any to Dawn, we don't even know what the spell has done to you now.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Buffy asked. \"It's making my ass grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but has the spell returned us to stage one, with you growing everywhere, or have we just transferred the grow from your boobs to your butt.\" Willow replied. \"And if it's the latter, should we try the spell again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not a good idea.\" Buffy said with a wince. \"If it backfires again we could wind up transferring all my weight onto someone else again, probably you or worse, Dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would it be worse for it to be Dawn?\" Willow demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn's already grown, for all we know she is probably cursed to grow fatter like I am, at least you are still skinny right now.\" Buffy replied.</span></div></div>",

She needed to check on Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy frowned as she walked out of the room and climbed the stairs, feeling as her gait altered by her swollen hips and the way her newly thickened frame pulling her trousers taught, making it even harder to walk, particularly climbing up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, are you okay?\" Buffy asked as she walked into her sister's room, noticing a large pile of ripped cloth... and a larger lump hidden under Dawn's covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away.\" Dawn replied, her voice wavering, suggesting she'd been crying. \"I don't want anyone to see me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Dawn, it can't be <i>that</i> bad.\" Buffy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" Dawn asked, her voice angry now. \"Look at me!\" With that the girl threw her covers off, letting Buffy see her, <i>all</i> of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was that Dawn was naked, for a second Buffy considered telling Dawn to put on some clothing, before realizing that the pile of ripped cloth was likely the result of Dawn trying and failing to do exactly that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she noticed was just how <i>big</i> Dawn was. Legs like tree trunks, leading to hips so thick it was probably equal to two Dawns standing side by side, at least before all this. Above this was a belly larger than someone 9 months pregnant with twins and a bosom whose size Buffy could only compare to beach balls. Even her face wasn't untouched, with swollen cheeks and a double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her own disgust at her now appearance, Dawn was insulted by the look of horror on Buffy's face. \"Okay I know it's bad but you don't need to look like I've turned into a monster!\" The newly obese girl snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're huge.\" Buffy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed.\" Dawn replied sarcasitcally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean you're bigger than I was.\" Buffy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks, first time I get to 1 up my sister and it's at how magical fat I've put on.\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it can't have all come from me.\" Buffy said, the horror still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Dawn snapped.\"I wasn't fat before this! I was skinny! At the risk of sounding egotistic I'd say I was hot! And now I look like I'm on the road to immobile blob town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not look like.\" Buffy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Dawn started to understand what Buffy was saying, as a feeling of horror started to grow in her gargantuan gut. \"What do you mean?\" She asked, fear suddenly prevalent in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have put on more weight than you could've gotten from me, as you said it didn't come from you. Me and Willow were talking about it downstairs, I don't think Willow's spell just gave you my fat, it gave you the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock and horror filled Dawn, who collapsed onto her bed, which let out a groan of protest. \"No. No, no, no, no.\" She started to cry. \"This is your fault!\" She screamed at Buffy \"You went out and fought those demons, now I'm turning into a fat blob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not exactly untouched.\" Buffy said, gesturing to her now bulbous hips, bringing them to Dawn's attention for the first time. \"But you're right, this is my fault, particularly because it was our efforts to fix me that dragged you into this, I'm sorry Dawn.\" Buffy said, attempting to hug her enormous sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't notice.\" Dawn said, poking Buffy's hip. \"Is it just down there or are you growing everywhere... like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Buffy shrugged. \"But I know that either way, whether we can fix this or if the two of us are doomed to slowly turn into immobile blobs... we'll face it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Buffy stood up attempting to ignore the little voice asking how long she'd be still able to do that. \"Now get some rest, we'll see what happens tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

Anya had the attention span of a gnat and Xander was probably less intelligent than the chair he sat on.  Dawn would always spend half the session pounting over some percieved slight.  That mostly just left Giles, Willow, and Tara to perform the real research on a good day, and today was not a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Xander peaked over the top of the Codex of Eschalion to catch another glimpe of Buffy's cleavage, Anya smacked him on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're holding the book upside down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I know that?\" Xander asked.  WThis book's in ancient greek.  I can't read ancient greek.  I didn't take ancient greek.  I did take Spanish.  If there's a Codex of Enchilladas, I can read that for us.  Except, I can't, since I didn't pass Spanish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Linear B, not Greek\" Giles muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Xander.\" Willow said while suruptitiously turning her own book over.  \"You bring a lot to the table besides your language skills.  Like... the donuts.  You brought those to the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These donuts are hitting the spot.\" said buffy while taking another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do remember, Buffy,\" said Giles \"that we're all here to save you from a spell of obesity.  Do you really need to be fueling the magic with the donuts.  Especially the last jelly donut, when some of us here didn't get to have one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy turned to face Giles with a bounce of her heel, leading to several more bounces of her bosom.  \"All my life, I've known that a moment on the lips was a lifetime on the hips.  Except nothing is going to my hips right now.  Eventually, we'll find the cure and everything will go back to normal, but there's no real not to take advantage of the situation while it lasts.  Besides, compared to all the other threats I've face in my career, giant boobs seem kind of tame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've found something\" Tara interrupted.  \"It's not a cure, but it'll buy us some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, things are looking up already.\" Buffy beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the curse of the Obefat is hard to break, but it can be, uh, shared.  I know that I'm not much help in the field, but I can take half the curse, leaving Buffy in better slaying shape while we look for something more permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea, honey.\" said Willow.  \"In fact, I could help us split the curse three ways.  That keeps Buffy growing slower, plus there's this new ice cream place up on Jackson street that has this great ice cream sundae that we could totally big out on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, too, would like bigger breasts.\" said Anya.  \"Xander doesn't clear his browsing history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander turned beet red before burying his face in the codex.  \"I think this greek is really starting to make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help.\" came a voice from the back of the room.  Everyone turned to look at Dawn, her arms crossed behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absoltely not.\"  said Buffy.  \"You're too young and it's too dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy, I'm a senior.  I'm eighteen now.  By my age, you'd died once, slept with a vampire, been in a coma, and killed a mayor.  You're okay with everyone else helping out, which seems to amount to gorging on junk food and having sex.  I'm willing to settle for just the junk food part and you're turning me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's eyes began to water up.  \"Without mom, you're all I've got left and every night I'm afraid that I'm going to lose you, too.  I'm not smart like Willow or strong like Spike, so I can't be out there with you.  But I can do this and this will make you safer until we find a cure.\"</span></div></div>",

Everything was gone, and she was back in her bedroom. \"It was just a dream,\" Buffy moaned in relief, and began to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that things began to go wrong. As Buffy slowly (still woozy from the bad dream) pulled away her blanket and shifted from a prone into a sitting position, the first thing she noticed were her legs. Instead of trim, shapely thighs and calves, she could only see massive thighs, that shook like jello and looked almost as thick as tree trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy gasped, but the sight of her legs was almost immediatelly obscured by an expense of skin that Buffy assumed was her stomach and breasts. They billowed out before her, two to four times bigger than ever before, obscuring her legs, but bringing no relief to the vampire slayer for the obvious reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually grunting from her efforts (vampire slayer or no, Buffy was always fast rather than strong), Buffy finally got to her feet, and proceeded to move very slowly, due to her mammoth bulk, into the Summers' bathroom, to take a look in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom was only a brief walk away from Buffy's room, but it took the bloated slayer no less than 10 minutes to get there, and she had to pause - twice! - to catch her breath. Clearly, until she lost her new weight, there would be no more slaying in the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Buffy saw herself in the mirror, and her breath vanished once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face was what Buffy saw first now: a face of an overweight woman, with chubby swollen cheeks that sagged and merged with her fat neck, obscuring the lower jaw almost competely: there was just a thin line to distinguish where the jaw ended and the chins began; in fact, Buffy's entire face was full of subcutaneous fat, making her look 5 to 10 years older than what she actually was. That didn't make Buffy feel any better, and below the... <i>chins </i>it was <i>worse</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the neck, Buffy's body was now wide, with fat. The breasts were barely contained by Buffy's pyjama top, and since Buffy didn't wear a bra to bed, they currently sagged on both sides of an immense gut. Still in denial, Buffy grasped that gut with her arm, but that made things worse, for now she could clearly see that her hands and arms were too swollen with fat: still positioned in their pyjama sleeves, they resembled overstuffed sausages! The fingers were too like sausages: fat and thick and rather clumsy - even if they hadn't been soaked with sweat, Buffy would still have fumbled with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...As it was, she did fumble with them, and accidentally grabbed one of her sides. Immediately, she could sense that her flesh and skin drooped there as well, as it did on her face, creating numerous love hands. In addition, she also felt that her back was now wide and thick just like the rest of her body; her butt now was as big and bulky as her stomach and breasts; and it merged into her thighs as her chins had into her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the final straw, actually. Before she had felt this, Buffy was ready to go to the bathroom scale to see how much she weighted; but now her resolve broke and she fled, her fat feet slapping loudly against the wooden grain of the floor, back into her room...</span></div></div>",

Unlike Willow, who generally appeared flabby and bottom-heavy, she appeared to be evenly fat all over. Her great stomach hung in front of her body, and her bust in turn lay on her enormous belly. Both arms were huge, twice the diameter of their previous extent. Her waist weas as expanded as the sea, above which her breasts protruded like balconies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass of her rear left little unchecked to the imagination. Tara was an appetizing, irresistible obstacle to grasp in all of her extensions. Her knees, robust, spongy, were fused with the rest of her huge legs that nevertheless became proportionally thinner until arriving at the relatively small ankles. Her feet were twice as big to what Buffy remembered - in order more to compensate the width of her new legs. Her neck, which disappeared under a layer of fat echoed her double chin and gave a fresh and moving aspect of Tara as a plump and healthy lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, sleepy head,\" Willow said softly to Tara, \"let's get you moved to a side so I could fit in.\" She turned to Buffy and added: \"Hey, I would be happy to have you spoon between us, but Tara's tummy was feeling cranky and gassy, so it's just the two of us for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" Buffy said, her mind all tilt and whirl, however.

She headed home, and, following the same routine she followed every night, clambered up through her window and into her bedroom, shutting the window behind her quietly so as not to wake her Mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy removed her leather jacket and tossed it on a chair in the corner of the room, then stripped down to her underwear. She took a moment to admire her toned body in the mirror - she was still looking great, if she did say so herself, but lately, she had begun to feel her pants getting tighter. She had been worried that she was putting on weight, despite her constant training sessions, work outs and patrols. Unfortunately, all of her activities usually caused her to work up quite an appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy poked a finger into her stomach, which felt softer than usual, albeit still as flat as ever.

But before she could drift off into further thoughts her belly lightly rumbled. \u201cShush\u201dshe whispered softly patting her fluffy flab. <br>\r\nWhen she first entered the kitchen all she intended to eat was a large bowl of cereal and possibly some toast, but as was about to become the norm that\u2019s not what happened. So she placed her rather round rear end on one of the stools and poured one large bowl of Frosties into a bowl with a healthy serving of milk. For the first few mouthfuls Buffy was rather pensive with her mind drifting to studies and slaying. But as she ate more she became more and more fixiated on the food and after thirty minutes she had consumed a box of family sized cereal and two bottles of full fat milk.<br>\r\nShe sat there pouting and upset at the results of her stuffing session, extra pudge on her midriff. She stroked her tummy lightly running her fingers over it: tickling, fondling and enjoying it. But despite her upset she was still hungry and even the iron will of the slayer couldn\u2019t hold back. So she meandered to the fridge and hit the jackpot. A cake. A three tier chocolate cake for Dawn\u2019s birthday, but then again why couldn\u2019t it be for now. Dawn couldn\u2019t eat all of it, and besides Buffy was martyring her figure to keep Dawn\u2019s safe, it was the least a big sister could do.<br>\r\nSo she took out this monster of a cake and starting eating before she even sat down. But as she was dawdling along sucking cream of one of her fingers, she tripped. The cake went everywhere.<br>\r\nBuffy got to all fours and tried to pick it up, but instead of putting it back on the plate she ended up eating it. Mouthful after mouthful she shoveled cake into her mouth. All the meanwhile her belly hanging lower and lower until Willow came to walk to school with Buffy. But what Willow found was something quite different <br>\r\n\u201cOh, Buffy, what have you done?The cakes all over your face, let me give you a hand up.\u201d Willow reached under Buffy and tried to heave her up to no avail.

Willow and Tara had began to fight - as they sometimes tended to do - about magic, and have wandered off into a corner to settle things out. Xander and Anya went to another corner just to make out. And Dawn was out at a friend's house, so Buffy was left with her mother, who proceded to mother her, quite naturally. Absense makes the heart grow fonder, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this occassion, the fondness of the heart resulted in Buffy comfortably settling on a sofa and eating the party meal (designed for five or six people really) largely by herself. Joyce Summers ate only slightly, claiming that the onset of menopause currently made her relatively uniterested in big meals and that she needed to lose some weight anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce then proceded to loan some of Buffy's clothing - mostly for jogging and the like - for herself, in exchange for some jewelry, including a pearl chocker that looked rather familiar to a necklace that grandmother Summers had worn once, a long time ago, when she was alive, but Buffy ignored this similarity and agreed to the exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, Joyce also handed her daughter a pair of glasses for reading - apparently, Buffy has complained about some eye strain trouble now that she was in college. Buffy, who was experiencing problems with skin and posture for some reason, just shrugged and accepted them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party ended on a quiet note, with Joyce leading Buffy back to her old room - for old times' sake,of course - and then returning downstairs to argue with Willow and/or Tara about some aspect of her art gallery...</span></div></div>",

Consequently, both Spike and Joyce looked at Tara. \"Yes, yes, I'm on it!\" the witch said crossly. \"Sheesh, the nerve of some people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these words she began to chant. A mist and a smell spread throughout the air, and soon the big cat fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was easy!\" Spike said brightly, only to be interrupted by the mewling of a pair of small, spotted kittens that approaching their sleeping mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I could get easy money for them,\" Spike said thoughtfully, and then backpedalled quickly as both Joyce and Tara glared at him. \"Just kidding!

Her petite rear was bulging and expanding before her eyes! Buffy's face turned to an expression of horror as the seat of her pants tightened. What the hell was happening to her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was difficult to get a good view simply from struggling to look over her shoulder, she wished she had a mirror with her. But even though she could not see the full extent of her expansion, she could still feel it - her ass cheeks were swelling within her jeans (which, Buffy had to admit, she had chosen because they emphasised her butt).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhh...\" Buffy moaned in discomfort as she felt her pants grow tighter and tighter around her butt. She clenched her teeth and closed her eyes, groaning continuously as her backside bulged to bigger and bigger sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was snapped out of her discomfort induced trance upon hearing a loud tearing noise from behind her. Obviously, her jeans had not been able to take it any more. Despite feeling hugely embarrassed, even with nobody around to see her, Buffy was actually kind of relieved that all the pressure had been relieved from her butt. She reached around and felt her ass, and her fingers traced along the large tear that had formed down the seat of her pants - although there was no way she could really see it, she could feel that the tear had formed directly in the middle of her pants, and her frilly lace panties were no doubt exposed. It was like something from a cartoon, or a bad dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, however, her butt had not actually grown quite as much as she had suspected. It had, without a doubt, become more of a 'ghetto booty' than ever before, but at least it wasn't monstrously huge. Better still, it seemed to have stopped growing. Hopefully it was over now, and perhaps the new changes to her body would simply fade with time...or diet and exercise, but, somehow, Buffy doubted it. This could only be the curse that the Demon had spoken of! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering the tear in her jeans with her hand, Buffy began running back home, praying that nobody would see her...</span></div></div>",

She immediately went to look in the mirror, trying to survey the damage. Like before, she saw that, while her butt was noticeably bigger, it wasn't exactly huge either.She decided to get a better look, and took off her jeans, struggling a little to squeeze them down over her expanded buttocks. She spent a moment mourning the loss of her favorite pair, before remembering that she had bigger problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her shoulder into the mirror, she could see that her butt cheeks were rounder and fuller, but still perfectly pert and smooth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" she thought, \"it might actually be an improvement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on her bed, sliding off her undies, and reached over to her underwear drawer. Under a few pile of panties was a lacy black thong, that Willow had dared her to buy a few weeks ago at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't thought she would get a chance to wear it, but this seemed like a golden opportunity. Sliding it up her legs, frowning a little as the g-string slipped into her butt crack, she stood up and examined herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" she exhaled, sticking her butt out as far as it would go, \"I look good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly, she slapped her ass, which was still as firm as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the slap was a little louder than she'd thought it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy?

She was far too tired for such an early rise, and wanted nothing more than to sleep until midday...unfortunately, she had school. The Slayer stretched her arms into the air and yawned before getting to her feet. As she stood, she felt her pajama bottoms tighten around her backside and suddenly remembered her butt's mysterious growth last night. Well...it wasn't exactly 'mysterious', since she knew full well it was due to some sort of Demon curse - but Buffy figured any curse that caused her ass to grow had to be a little mystifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy! You're going to be late if you don't hurry up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy ignored her mom's warnings and walked to the mirror, turning to the side so she could see the curve of her larger behind. It hadn't grown any more since last night, but it's new shape was all the more obvious in daylight. She wasn't exactly sure how she was going to hide this from her mom, not to mention her friends and classmates...but then...did she really <i>want </i>to hide it? It was certainly nothing to be ashamed of. Her butt looked better than ever, more shapely, more firm...perfectly round. She reached down and gently rubbed her hand across her enlarged butt cheeks, smiling to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Probably best not to tell anyone about the curse,\"</i> Buffy thought, giving her ass a playful squeeze. <i>\"That's one conversation I definitely don't want to have today.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy peeked out of her bedroom door and checked that the coast was clear before hurrying into the bathroom. She quickly brushed her teeth, did her hair and had a wash before hurrying back to her bedroom - not wanting to be seen by her Mom. After getting back to her room, she closed the door and began to undress. As she pulled off her pajama bottoms, she got another good look at her butt, still clad in the lacey black thong she had slipped into last night. She found herself becoming excited just looking at her curvy behind in the mirror, so much so that she spent a whole ten minutes simply twirling around so that she could view it from different angles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally tearing herself away from her reflection, Buffy carefully selected some clothing that would go some way to concealing her newer, sexier butt. She chose a skirt that had always been one size too big, a Christmas gift from her Dad last year. She had never imagined that his ignorance of her measurements would come in handy, but the skirt fit nicely over her bulbous behind. She quickly pulled on a shirt, applied some make up and hurried downstairs. Thankfully, her Mom didn't notice any chances in her daughter, and the two drove to school without incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of relief, Buffy said goodbye and climbed out of the car, making her way towards the bench where her friends were sitting...</span></div></div>",

While she had snapped at Buffy, in reality she was worried. <br>\r\nBuffy was the slayer, which gave her super durability, super strength...and a super metabolism. She would probably barely gain at all, regardless of slaying or otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn, on the other hand was a full fledged human. Buffy didn't allow her to partake in slaying, and she wasn't good enough for cheer team, so her only contribution was researching, an activity that was mostly filled with snacking and sitting. Between that, the stress and depression of her mother's death, and Buffy's brief stint at the burger joint, Dawn had noticed some slight softening of her body. <br>\r\nShe grumbled and turned over on her side. What did Buffy know? Dawn was just processing through some stuff, and her slight gain was barely noticeable at all.  She brought her hands to her stomach. It used to be perfectly flat without an inch of flab on it, but now her belly showed signs of softness. A subtle curve had begin to form, with a light layer of pudge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo big deal, she could lose the weight easily. She may not be the ass-kicking savior of the world, but she was still the little sister of that slayer. <br>\r\nWhich wasn't as good as being the actual slayer. <br>\r\nDawn grit her teeth, anger and insecurity washing over her in waves. Buffy probably thought she was just SO much better than Dawn, didn't she. Everyone relies on Buffy. She's strong, formidable and beautiful. No one relied on Dawn. She was just the messed up kid sister with problems. Dawn throws the cover off her and marches downstairs, with the intent to watch some T.V<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Buffy was gone, Dawn sometimes sat on the couch and fell asleep to the sound of voices. Without Buffy, the house had felt so empty.<br>\r\nShe parked herself on the couch and started flipping through channels. On the table, there is a large bowl filed to the brim with small various pieces of candy. Dawn pauses, hand hovering over the bowl. Well, no one became fat by one small piece of candy, right? Chuckling, she pops one into her mouth. Satisfied with her choice, Dawn continues to snack mindlessly, popping piece after piece into her mouth without noticing. Soon, Dawn drifts off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is awoken suddenly, disoriented and groggy. The T.V is showing some kind of action movie. It was probably a loud sound that woke her up. She rubs her stomach, feeling a little bloated. Dawn eyes her surroundings, and her attention is pulled to the table. The bowl was empty!<br>\r\nDawn couldn't believe it. She ate everything in the bowl. Impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe...that's right, she has to be misremebring it. The bowl was probably only half full...maybe even less than that. Ignoring the voice in her head that tells her to rethink, Dawn lifts herself from the couch, noting that it has become a little harder. Her stomach pushed out a tiny bit, but it wasn't enough for Dawn to notice. She rubbed it a little, and as she pressed down, a burp erupted from her mouth. She quickly pressed a hand against it, looking around to see if anyone heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez...I need to go to bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn starts to head up the stairs when...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If anything, it'll probably help with all the sugar she just consumed. Dawn crosses over to the kitchen prepared to get a glass of water. as she begins to fill it up from the sink, she tastes something...salty? Dawn realizes in shock that she had been mindless snacking on an open bag of chips! She mentally slaps herself. What's wrong with her? At this rate, she'll match Buffy's prediction and go beyond. <br>\r\nShe gulps the down the water quickly, trying to get upstairs fast.  The salty snacks had made her thirstier, so she downs another two cups before hauling it upstairs. Dawn flops down onto her bed, resolved to be more vigilant with her eating. With this in mind, she falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn wakes up groggy. Her head hurts, and she feels the beginning of cramps. 'Great,\" Dawn thinks 'Some period bloat to make things worse.' After taking a shower, Dawn pulls on a loose shirt. Her eyes narrow at the slight outline of a belly showing. <br>\r\n\"Damn periods.\"<br>\r\nDawn slips a pair of shorts on with ease, and heads downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\nWhen she gets to the kitchen, she sees a note on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Slaying emergency!<br>\r\nLeftover waffles in fridge<br>\r\nMake sure you get to school<br>\r\n-Buffy</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn scoffs at this, and heats up the plate. Buffy made about 8 of them at once, it seems. Dawn gets two and plops down in front of the T.V. She watches the show with interest, and realizes that she has ran out of waffles. She rubbed her stomach experimentally. She wasn't full at all. One more waffle wouldn't hurt. In reality, Dawn had scarfed the food down so fast that her stomach had no time to tell her to stop. As Dawn reaches to pile more waffles onto the plate, she gets distracted and sees that she put two more than she intended. Dawn shrugs, and piles them up with butter and syrup. She'll just eat enough to get her full. <br>\r\nIt turn's out that Dawn's fullness was infinite when she watched T.V, because when the show ended and she looked at her plate, the waffles were gone. Her slight belly was a little more obvious, making her feel unusually round. She gaped in shock. Had she really just eaten more than half of the waffles? <br>\r\nBefore this could set in, she realized the time! She was going to be late. There was no time for walking to school, so Dawn caught the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn sat through a wall of boring classes. Halfway through, she realized that she had forgot to bring her lunch with her. Oh well, cafeteria food for her.<br>\r\nLunch hits, and Dawn sluggishly walks to the cafeteria. After her breakfast binge, she was determined to eat a small meal. As she stood in line, more appealing options stared back at her. She got to the counter, intending to get a salad and some fruit. Dawn opens her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get...\"</span></div></div>",

It had just been a dream...only a dream...but a pretty disturbing one. Buffy's little warning about eating junk food must have made more of an impact than she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn pulled back the covers nervously, almost afraid that she would see a bulging, bloated pot belly staring back at her, but, much to her relief, nothing had changed - she was still as skinny as ever. She let herself fall back into a lying position, but as soon as her head hit the pillow, someone banged on her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn! Time to get up!\" Buffy called from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" Dawn muttered. She cast a glance at her bedside clock, and saw that it was, indeed, time to get up - she hated having to get up early, and prayed for the day she would be free from school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn pulled back the covers and hopped out of bed. Thoughts of her embarrassing dream soon faded, as she got dressed, brushed her teeth, had a wash, and headed downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, hurry up, your going to be late,\" Buffy said, sliding a plate of pancakes down the table as Dawn sat down at in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn stared with a grimace at the questionable breakfast Buffy had placed before her - her sister, though she tried, lacked the skill at pancake making that they're Mom had possessed. None the less, Dawn ate what her sister gave her each morning, as she didn't want to hurt her feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy's pancakes usually tasted a little weird, so Dawn had gotten into the habit of smothering them with so much syrup that they tasted good. As she took the syrup bottle and began pouring it over her food, Dawn's thoughts drifted back to her dream...to the thought of herself gaining so much weight that she popped out of her clothes...and suddenly, she pushed the bottle aside, paranoid that her over use of syrup could lead to her gaining weight. Though she hated to admit it, her stomach had softened a little lately, and developed an ever so slight bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn cut into the pancakes, and finished them fairly quickly. She gathered up her things and headed out the door to school.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On her way to school Dawn starts thinking about the 8 pancakes she ate for breakfast. Normally she only eats 4 or 5, but that morning even without being smothered in syrup they actually tasted pretty good. So she continued eating until both stacks were all gone. Since she needed to make more pancakes, Buffy gave Dawn a not-so-pleased look when she left for school. So considering what Buffy had teased her about the previous night, Dawn resolved to not eat anything while she was at school that day. Dawn's now starting to grow concerned that she WILL become fat from all the food she eats. Her resolution lasts through lunch but barely. EVERYTHING smelled so good that Dawn started wondering about what has happened to her. Even the mystery meat that most kids usually held their nose when eating smelled absolutely delicious to Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's next to last period was gym and that day her class was practising volleyball. The 35-year old teacher-coach Sasha was a 6' 5\" Amazon who was a perfectionist with her training. Two years ago she retired from professional volleyball to spend more time with her 3 teen-aged daughters. The shortest girl was nearly a full head taller than Dawn. Also like their mother they all had already developed very large voluptuous bodies with extra-firm size D or DD busts. Understandably nearly all of the boys wanted to be their friend. All three girls had instead zeroed in on Dawn when they first moved to Sunnydale. Dawn never did figure out why they wanted to spend so much time around her, especially at school. Having so few friends due to her situation, Dawn never looked that hard into their background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that days practice she had decided the girls would practice their net spiking. So for nearly 45 minutes Dawn joins with the other girls in jumping at the net. The motion of several girls busts going up-and-down with each leap starts working on Dawn's nerves. Having not eaten anything since breakfast her stomach starts growling at her for something(anything) to fill it. Dawn grows extremely thirsty from watching the other girls busts in motion. In her head, she daydreams about drinking all of them dry of milk. FOUR times she gets nailed in the head before the teacher orders her off the court. It's very clear to her that Dawn is totally distracted that day. By the time gym is over Dawn's mouth feels parched and she has started staggering from growing weak. It's as though she hadn't eaten for several days rather than hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen school let out two of the sisters invite Dawn to their house. She accepts the invitation far quicker than she normally would. About halfway to their house, Dawn nearly collapses from hunger pangs so Eve, the tallest sister carries her the rest of the way. Resting her head on Eve's bust was shear torture for Dawn. Now not knowing what she's saying, Dawn starts repeating, need milk. By the time they arrive at the sisters home Dawns body has started quivering from not eating since breakfast. Because they don't have milk in the refrigerator, Eve gets out some ice cream for Dawn. It takes her less than a minute to devour a whole pint. Having eaten Dawn perks up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill weak but very hungry Dawn asks them if one of them could go to her house and only bring Buffy or her friend, Willow Rosenberg back with them to their house. If they ask why, she tells them to say, \"The key is broken.\" They assume that she is talking about her house key, which is not the case at all. Julia the shortest sister at a hair over 6 foot offers to go and she ends up waiting quite awhile before anyone shows up. By the time, Buffy returns with Julia, Dawn has consumed nearly a gallon of ice cream. When Buffy walks in their house she promptly faints. Dawn's belly now looks at least 10 months pregnant ! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Buffy do when she wakes up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>School went by as it always did, slowly. Thoughts of her bizarre, disturbing dream were still on Dawn's mind throughout the day - whenever she founds her concentration in class faltering, all she seemed to be able to think of was her body swelling and bulging with fat. It was a thought that horrified her, but she couldn't seem to get it out of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh well, I'll have forgotten all about it tomorrow, like most dreams.</i> Dawn thought, as she slumped into her chair at the start of History class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe History teacher, Miss Powers, was an ancient looking woman with a voice so slow and dreary that Dawn often had trouble staying awake during her lessons. Today, they were covering the American War of Independence, and Dawn could already feel her concentration slipping away as Miss Powers droned on and on, her words coming out so slowly and methodically that Dawn could actually feel her eyes starting to grow tired, and her body starting to feel more relaxed. She slipped down a little further into her chair, shifting uncomfortably against the hard wooden seat every classroom in the school insisted on having. She felt herself growing more and more bored, and could even see some of her fellow classmates resting their heads on their wooden desks tiredly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn made an effort to stay awake, but she knew she was dropping off to sleep. She hadn't actually gotten much rest last night, with her weird dream seeming to cause her more stress than anything while she was asleep. She gave a tired yawn, and covered her mouth so as to not appear rude - but Miss Powers was paying no attention to the class anyway. The woman was like a robot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn felt her eyes close, and, when she reopened them, she was back home, sitting on her couch, watching TV. Dawn looked around curiously, wandering how she had got here. She saw Buffy enter the room and watched as her older sister stood before her, shaking her head in a scolding manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Dawn asked. \"Why are you looking at me like that? What did I do <i>this</i> time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Buffy asked incredulously. \"Dawn, you've eaten nearly everything in the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn stared at Buffy as though her sister had gone mad. \"What are you talking about? I haven't eaten a thing al day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Then what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy gestured to the space around Dawn, and Dawn looked around her and gasped in amazement. Beside her on the couch were empty bags of chips, soda cans, an empty tub of chocolate ice cream that looked as though it had been licked clean and various chocolate bar wrappers, some of them still containing half a bar. Dawn just stared at the mess surrounding her, not remembering any of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it wasn't me!\" Dawn exclaimed. \"I swear! I didn't even see this mess until now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy rolled her eyes. \"Oh please Dawn, of course it was you, why would you even try and lie about it? Look at how bloated you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn looked down again, and, out of nowhere, she seemed to have developed a hugely bloated stomach. She could see the outline of her bloated belly beneath her top, and could suddenly feel it pushing against her jeans - it had come out of nowhere! Dawn clutched the sides of her stomach, and, without warning, let out a loud, gassy belch. She clamped her hands over her mouth in embarrassment, not knowing where that had come from either. What the hell was going on here?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try and deny it now,\" said Buffy, fanning the air with her hand in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's happening to me!\" Dawn said, as her eyes began to fill with tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what's happening to you Dawnie, your getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Dawn exclaimed. \"It must be a Demon...or a spell...or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been a long time coming Dawnie,\" Buffy said, shaking her head. \"I warned you about watching what you ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn could feel her bloated belly pushing even harder against her jeans, if such a thing was possible, she actually seemed to be getting bigger! Dawn watched in horror as her suspicion was confirmed and her stomach began to bulge out before her eyes, her purple top began to ride up above her belly button as her stomach swelled and swelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy! Help me!\" Dawn whailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy just stood and stared at her sisters rapidly inflating belly. Dawn moaned as she felt her jeans tighten, digging into her expanding gut and causing her considerably discomfort - the discomfort was suddenly relieved when the top button of her pants burst open, allowing her belly to burst free with a prominent wobble, and causing to let out a long, satisfied exhale. But that wasn't the end, Dawn was still growing, she could see her stomach rising now, pushing out, bloating and bulging before her eyes, she looked like she was nine months pregnant, she had never seen anything like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Dawnie,\" Buffy said. \"Your going to get so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn burst into tears as she held on to her massive swelling gut, feeling her fingers sink not into firm, bloated flesh, but soft, jiggly fat. She gave a long moan of unhappiness, before, suddenly, a loud bell rang, and her eyes snapped open just in time to see her classmates jumping up from their seats and running from the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had just been a dream...only a dream...Dawn thought, breathing a sigh of relief that the ordeal was over. Another disturbing, weight gain based dream, two in one day...Dawn hoped there wouldn't be a third, they were really starting to creep her out. For now though, school was out, and it was time to go home...</span></div></div>",

In this town, it might just happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Dawn decided to go to her room. After hurrying up the stairs and entering her room, she fell back onto her comfy bed, glad the day was over. She started feeling tired again, and closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dawn reopened her eyes a moment later, she was greeted by the sight of a large, bloated belly sticking out in front of her. She gave a scream and propped herself up on her elbows, her considerably large pot belly was sticking out like she had swallowed a basketball. She swung her legs over the side of the bed, and felt her belly bulge forward - her pants buttons were undone, and she suddenly remembered that binge she had apparently indulged in earlier. However, she didn't seem quite as big as she had been before...Dawn rubbed the huge spherical belly that was now resting in her lap, and eased herself onto her feet. Her stomach jutted out obscenely, and she realised her top no longer held it at bay - her large, round, overstuffed belly was on display for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the house was empty...wasn't it? Nobody would even see her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling confused, and more than a little bloated, Dawn waddled into the hallway and looked it up and down: empty. She tugged at her top, trying to pull it down over her hugely rounded gut, but it was no use, it just sprang back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Dawn groaned. \"I feel so big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled along the corridor, her belly ahead of her, hoping nobody would see her like this. She could barely remember how she had gotten into this state, but remembered Buffy scolding her for being a pig. Had she really eaten enough to result in a stomach this round and full?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn slowly walked downstairs, her belly shaking slightly with each step she took. She peered around the corner to make sure the downstairs was empty, and then waddled into the kitchen. She was greeted by the sight of more empty food packaging, pizza boxes, tubs of ice cream, half finished milkshakes, soda cans and bags of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I eat all this?\" Dawn asked aloud as she surveyed the mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did,\" came a voice from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn turned around, and went bright red as she saw Buffy facing her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy, I'm so sorry if I did all this...I don't know what's happening to me...\" Dawn tried desperately to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what's happening to you,\" Buffy said. \"Your getting chubby, look...your growing again now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Dawn looked down at her exposed midriff, and, sure enough her belly was growing once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Dawn knew that Buffy would not help her, her sister only appeared to mock her whenever she underwent another expansion. Dawn could see her belly growing, but also feel the rest of her body thickening - her legs were expanding, and she felt her jeans squeezing around her legs as they became tighter and tighter with each passing moment. Dawn could also feel something stirring in her bra - her breasts, once a modest B cup, appeared to be growing along with the rest of her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was actually a little exciting for Dawn, but her joy at having an enhanced bustline quickly evaporated when she was disturbed by a loud tearing noise from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering how long those pants would hold out,\" Buffy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn turned an even darker shade of red as she looked over her shoulder and saw her ass, twice it's normal size, bulging out of the back of the seat of her pants. Her jeans had split, and, with little left to hold them on, they slipped down her thicker thighs and onto the floor. Dawn stumbled back, as she felt her top tighten - she was aware that her belly was still growing, but right now she was more focused on her breasts, which seemed to be ready to explode out of her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you with that,\" Buffy suddenly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn backed off nervously as Buffy advanced on her, but Buffy just spun her sister's body around and pulled her top right off over her head, leaving a bewildered Dawn in her underwear. Dawn was about to ask what the hell Buffy was doing when she noticed her big boobs filling out her bra, overflowing the lacy cups, ready to pop out at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...\" Was all Dawn had time to say before her new, D cup breasts exploded out of her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts pushed forward with a wobble, and Dawn struggled to cover them up, holding her arms across her ample bust, trying to conceal her nipples. She had never felt more embarrassed in her entire life. The only piece of clothing still left on her chubby, bloated body was her underwear, which, due to the size of her butt, had turned into little more than a thong wedged between two large cheeks of flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn stared at Buffy in horror, the growth seemed to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your just about done,\" Buffy said, and she slapped Dawn's rotund gut, causing it to jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" Dawn said, squeezing her breasts towards her, trying to conceal herself behind her larger arms. \"Why are you enjoying this so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's so much fun watching you eat yourself into a big fat pig,\" Buffy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me fat!\" Dawn raged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are,\" Buffy replied. \"I'd say about two hundred...two hundred and ten pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that big!\" Dawn cried out, trying to stop herself from crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes you are, and this is just the beginning,\" said Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...the beginning?\" Dawn stuttered, suddenly even more afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore this could go any further, Dawn's eyes shot open and she sat bolt upright in the bed, breathing in and out, startled and terrified from her dream. The third one she had had today. This had to stop, she had to tell someone about this, but who?</span></div></div>",

Dawn had no doubt that Buffy would just roll her eyes and dismiss the dreams as nothing but Dawn's over-active imagination, besides which, as Buffy was the one who seemed to be mocking and taunting Dawn in the dreams, Dawn wasn't really sure she wanted to get her involved. Willow would probably be more understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn waited until Willow and Tara returned home, let some time pass, and then plucked up the courage to knock on their bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Willow called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn gingerly pushed open the door, which creaked ominously as it swung open. Dawn slipped into the room, and saw that Willow and Tara had a number of ancient looking books laid out across the floor. Dawn didn't need to look at them to know they were spell books - no doubt Willow and Tara were researching new magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dawnie,\" Willow smiled, looking up and grinning as Dawn entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Tara asked, looking up from the dusty book she was holding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn took a breath, she was not entirely sure how she was going to say what she came here to say. \"You guys busy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just researching a new spell,\" Willow said. \"But nothing that can't wait. Did you want to take about something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn sat down on the edge of the double bed in the centre of the room. \"It's just...and this is going to sound crazy...I keep having these dreams...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow and Tara exchanged an awkward look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not <i>those</i> kinds of dreams,\" Dawn said quickly, going red. \"They've been more like nightmares really, and even though I'm not tired, I keep falling asleep and having them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked concerned. \"How long has this been going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the past two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they about?\" Tara asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...they always end the same way...\" Dawn said, looking away from Willow and Tara shyly. \"They always end with me getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked confused. \"Fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Really</i> fat,\" Dawn stressed. \"It always happens really quick too, it's horrible, and it feels so real every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that does sound like a nightmare Dawnie but...their just dreams,\" Willow said comfortingly. \"We dream about the things we fear the most - for me it was clowns...creepy...scary, clowns.\" Willow shuddered at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to have dreams about loads of Bugs carrying me away,\" Tara interjected. \"That was pretty creepy. They could talk too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Willow said. \"Dreams are always weird, from talking bugs to instant weight gain. Xander used to dream about being in his underwear in the middle of class too, it's usually something embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn thought they both made good points, perhaps she had overreacted about this whole thing? She felt a little foolish now. \"I guess that makes sense, but they have been happening at weird times, like during class and when I got home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you just need to get more sleep?\" Tara suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn shrugged. It was possible, but there really hadn't been much change in her sleeping pattern lately. \"I don't know, I haven't been having any trouble sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have you been worried about anything lately? Your weight maybe?\" Willow asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I didn't mean it like that!\" She held up her hands in a pacifying gesture. \"I just mean, us girls tend to worry about stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn blushed, and placed her hands on her stomach, staring down at it knowingly. \"Well, I have put on a few pounds lately, and Buffy was kinda teasing me about it the other day...maybe that's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it could be,\" Tara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put it out of your mind,\" Willow said. \"You look fine, really, as slim as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn smiled. \"Thanks guys, I guess I was getting kind of paranoid, but...to put my mind at ease...could you have a look in the books and see if there's anything that might be to dreams and...getting fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could check, but I don't think we'll find anything,\" Tara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you don't,\" Dawn smiled. \"Thanks guys, sorry to come to you with such weirdness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time, Dawnie,\" Willow smiled. \"We'll get right on those books, but for the time being, I think you should just get some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn nodded, smiled, and went back to her own room, feeling a lot more relaxed. She felt kind of stupid now, but knew she wouldn't feel entirely at ease until Willow and Tara had finished their research...</span></div></div>",

Department' emblazoned across the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another gurgle rumbled through her tiny belly, Dawn realised that she was famished. A combination of worry, self-consciousness and Buffy's lacklustre cooking skills meant that she had hardly had a bite to eat all day. As she was feeling a little better after her talk with Tara and Willow, she decided she needed to eat something, and just put the stupid dreams to the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadding downstairs in just her socks, jeans and t-shirt, Dawn was unsurprised to note that Buffy's jacket was missing from the stand in the hall, as was the big sword with the jewel-encrusted handle.

Once again, Buffy had left her in the lurch. What would she do for dinner now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed the pizza menu from last night, sitting on the counter. Pizza sounded great, but maybe Buffy was right about all the junk food, she thought, unconsciously patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw Buffy!\" she thought, \"If she's too busy to cook for me, I'll eat what I want!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the menu, glancing at the prices. Most of her allowance had gone on last night's pizza, and the rest had been spent on candy, soda and chips from the school's vending machines. She would need money.\u00a0</span></div></div>",

The chicken strippers, the garlic sticks, the chocolate brownies with caramel sauce, all present and correct, not to mention the pizza, which was a large pepperoni and sausage with extra cheese, or the half gallon of Diet Coke that the guy had told her came with any order over forty dollars...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a lot, but Dawn just hadn't been able to stop herself. She was just so hungry! Plus, she rationalized, Willow and Tara would almost certainly have some whenever they finished their 'spell.'\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling open the large flat box, she inhaled deeply, her mouth watering as she took in the meaty, cheesy aroma. The pie was about a foot across, and was covered in pepperoni and salami slices. \u00a0Dawn carefully separated a particularly large slice, dripping with a combination of cheese and grease, and took a large bite.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmm...\" she moaned, flavour exploding across her taste buds. This was the best pizza she'd ever tasted! She quickly finished off the slice, and each bite was even better than the last. She opened the bottle of soda, taking a swig before digging in to another slice. All thoughts of those weird dreams were forgotten, as she munched quietly and happily. She worked her way through slice after slice, stopping sometimes for some chicken or a piece of garlic bread. It was all so good...</span></div></div>",

Since his spell would only cause WOMEN to gain weight, many of the lower class-men (including Dawn) and a smattering of the Junior and Senior girls weren't gaining weight. Since they hadn't experienced THEIR first period yet, they were still both chronologically AND biologically not yet WOMEN. Also, since he had convinced Andrew to cast the spell on a Friday morning many girls/women living outside Sunnydale also gained weight. They came to see the Special event being held there. Those women gained weight continuously from the second they entered until the second they left Sunnydale's City limits returning home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the 3-day weekend Sunnydale's town square was the scene of a very special outdoor fashion show featuring all of the Victoria Secret models wearing this summer's hotest new swimsuit designs. On average, the 2 dozen models assembled there gained around 50 pounds. So ALL of those models ended up leaving with fairly pronounced hour-glass figures. Their rapid weight gain soon caused many problems for the photographers assembled there. All weekend long, the poor women kept popping out of their swimsuits. Many times both their tops and BOTTOMS would fail simultaneously! So every single time when it happened that one or more of the women were unexpectedly naked, several REALLY good photos of the event had to be scrapped. Fortunately for the photographers, that's very easy to do with digital cameras. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly when all the effected women LEFT Sunnydale, they believed that they had been their new size for a long time. Even all of the Victoria Secret models suddenly stopped worrying about their weight. Which should've gotten the whole lot of them fired. They were lucky that the various swimsuits they had modeled (especially the larger sizes that had to hurriedly put on) started flying off the racks the following week all around the World! Also some of those women visiting Sunnydale that weekend, returned home with much LARGER bellies. Apparently, the spell had the unintended effect of increasing the pace of a women's pregnancy. Their baby grew older by one day for each hour they spent within Sunnydale's City limits. So nearly 100 women living OUTSIDE of Sunnydale delivered much sooner than expected. Additionally over 30 girls currently attending Sunnydale High along with several of the younger teachers and staff were now only days away from giving birth. Sunnydale's maternity ward would soon be over-whelmed with business.

Though she knew that Anya would probably turn her nose up at her presence as usual, she was always made to feel welcome by Giles, and she had a new spell she wanted to try out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beginning to become a real expert at magic now, after a few years, she had picked up some very impressive skills, and had even brought Buffy back from the dead. She was pretty proud of her abilities at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally reached the Magic Box, and cheerfully skipped inside. It was empty apart from one woman, who was examining a jar of newt eyes in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow spotted Anya behind the counter. \"Business not exactly booming today huh?\" She said, attempting to make polite conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How rude,\" Anya said, taking it the wrong way. She gestured to the back room, \"Giles put all the stuff you wanted back there, he said to be careful and...some other stuff I forgot while counting the money...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow sighed and shrugged, and headed into the back room, where she found the ingredients she had requested earlier piled up on the table before her. The spell she was planning to perform would hopefully be able to assisst Buffy in slaying vampires, by making them too fat to fight back. Willow figured it would make things a lot easier for her slayer-friend, since an immobile demon would be unlikely to put up much of a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathered the ingredients and began to mix them in a small couldron that had been provided for her. When combined, they made made a sticky black goo. This was not what Willow had expected to happen, she pulled open her spell-book, and looked over the spell instructions, which were in one of those weird vague languages that annoyed her so often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this doesn't help much...\" Willow said to herself as she tried to see what she had done wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow then noticed something in the corner of her eye, she quickly looked up from the book and saw that a swirling, sparkling ball of black dust had formed above the cauldron. She realised that the spell must be working, and quickly began to look through the book to find the right words to cancel it - now that she knew she could prepare it - after all, she didn't need to use it right now.</span></div></div>",

Why didn\u2019t I translate the entire spell before I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ball in the air formed small tentacles that waved up and down and from right to left like they were looking for something. Slowly a few tentacles stroke her skin. They felt a bit warm and nice. The next moment all the tentacles flew in her direction and grabbed her head. Willow opened her mouth to scream but the ball flew down into her mouth with all it\u2019s tentacles waving. She felt like she had just tasted something delicious - the little ball going through her throat and fall calmly in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stupid book could have mentioned that part more clearly!\u201d Willow pouted. \u201cI can't find anything here that says it attacks you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have much time to think about it as she suddenly began to feel a strange sensation in her belly. Her clothes began to feel awfully tight, she closed her eyes since she feared she would like what she would see. She could feel her body moving, bulging\u2026and changing, and nervously opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh No!\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once flat belly was now round and was clearly visible. She noticed she had gained a bit more fat on her arms, legs, thighs, butt and chest. The last thing was something she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well calm down Willow. Come on. You always wanted to gain a few pounds. You were terribly skinny,\u201d Willow told herself, and she looked down at her bulging stomach. \u201cBut how much will I gain? When will it stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her hands slide over her whole body and felt every new pound she gained. She had to admit that it couldn\u2019t hurt her figure to get a little extra meat on her bones. But was this just the tip of the iceberg? How much weight was she going to put on?</span></div></div>",

Anya sighed. \"Showoff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow tried to act to normal on the street, attempting to hurry back to her dorm room, but trying to keep a normal pace like everyone else. She sets her eyes on the path to the UC Sunnydale and tried not look at the people around her. Her stomach began growling very loudly. Willow became more and more anxious, not wanting to attract attention. The growling got more louder. So much so that Willow couldn't take it anymore. She ran as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Willow was outside her dorm building, she stopped to rest for a moment. She was very out of breath. But then, her belly grew more and it was now a potbelly. It outstretched more out of her shirt, becoming fully visible, and her thighs were a little wider than before. This caught the eyes of the many students outside the campus. Willow ran inside with as much strength she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was finally alone in her dorm room. Fortunately Tara wasn't inside to see her new chubby body. Her jeans felt very tight around her potbelly. She unzipped them and let out a sigh of relief. She went through her drawers and put on some stretch pants, then she lied on her bed, breathing heavily. She started staring at her belly, which obscured half of her point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my!\" said Willow. \"I've really grown. I have to fix this immediately!\"</span></div></div>",

She opened it to find a carton of milk, four ham and cheese sandwiches, four vanilla pudding cups, and a gallon of orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this will be enough,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with the sandwiches first, tearing off the plastic wrap and eating them like a wild animal.  she grabbed each of the pudding cups, crushing the pudding out of the cups into her mouth. Next she grabbed the carton of milk and began chugging away without taking a break until it was empty. She lets out a quiet burp. All was left was the orange juice so Willow figured, \"What the hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chugged down the orange juice as much as she did with the milk. The jug was empty, and Willow let out a louder burp. Her face was covered with milk and pudding. Some of it got on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her stomach resumed growling. Another growth was starting. Her belly was now at least six inches wider than before. Luckily her stretch pants were able to keep up with her expanding waistline. But Willow grew more and more concerned about this. What would her friends think her new large figure? What would Tara think?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She rubbed at the milk and pudding surrounding her mouth, hurriedly trying to make herself presentable. Unfortunately, Willow had neglected to change her shirt along with her pants, and to her horror, realized her bloated new pot belly was fully visible above the top of her stretch pants. \"Oh crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara?!\" Willow spun around, revealing herself to her girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's eyes widened in surprise as she set eyes upon the noticeable chubbier Willow. Her eyes drifted down to her girlfriend's exposed tummy, then scanned the empty food wrappers and cartons littered around the room. \"Willow...are you...um...okay?\" Tara stammered, trying not to stare directly at that big, bloated belly in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure!\" Willow lied. She really didn't want to tell Tara that a spell had backfired and left her with an ever expanding waistline and a ravenous, uncontrollable hunger. \"Just...uh...cleaning up!\" Willow bent down and scooped up the empty carton of milk, her new belly forming into several rolls of flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Tara said, looking very confused. \"I think...uh...that shirt might be a bit too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow tugged awkwardly at her tight shirt and laughed nervously. \"Oh. Yeah. I might have gained a few pounds I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't mean it like that!\" Tara said apologetically. \"It just looks like a really old one. You should probably throw it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow blushed. \"Yeah, you're right, I'll throw it in the trash later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara stepped forward and crushed an empty pudding cup under her foot. \"Erm...what's with all the pudding cups?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those?\" Willow struggled to think of an excuse. \"I was just...erm...taking out the trash and the garbage bag split.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded. \"Oh, that makes sense,\" she said. \"I didn't realize we'd eaten that many...and all the juice...and milk...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow suppressed a belch and started picking up the mess. Every time she knelt down, she felt her larger belly groan and grumble, her stretch pants tightenining around her stuffed midsection. She hoped Tara would just brush this off. If she just changed into some loose fitting clothes, her new gains probably weren't even that noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your day?\" Tara asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was good,\" Willow said absent mindedly, picking up the discarded remains of her binge and dumping them into a trash bag. When she arched her back and stood up, she laid a hand on her bulging belly and started rubbing it. It was so soft...so full...so round...</span></div></div>",

That was a close one! She had been seconds away from magically inflating with fat. She grimaced as she looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not like I need any help with that anyway.\" she thought, poking her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, the white witch had put on a few pounds lately, most of it straight to her stomach. While it was once flat, she now had a small potbelly, which bulged out over the waistband of her jeans. She had tried to restrain her eating habits, as she was worried about what Tara would think. But there was just too much temptation. Tara always kept the fridge packed with goodies, Buffy usually brought dinner back from Doublemeat Palace, not to mention the donut shop located just across the road from the magic box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue, her small starter belly grumbled, and Willow sighed. She hoisted herself from her chair and packed the loose ingredients away, before leaving the back room. The store front was empty, aside from Anya, who was munching on a large bag of chips. As a demon, she didn't really have to worry about her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so unfair!\" thought Willow. \"Anya's got her demon mojo, Buffy has her Slayer powers, which apparently include lifetime membership to the slim club, Dawn's got the metabolism of a teenager, and here I am chunking up majorly! Even Tara never seems to gain a pound!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering these highly unfavourable circumstances, she made for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later Anya!\" she called, receiving only a grunt in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Willow left, she noticed the donut shop had a special on, a dozen donuts for half-price. Her tummy rumbled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she thought, \"I'll get a box, but I'll skip dinner, and that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thought were interrupted by the trill of her cellphone. She plucked it from her handbag, it was a text from Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just picking up dinner.\" it read \"You want Palace-sized with curly fries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow texted back a quick yes and a smiley face before she realized what she had done. She groaned, and resumed her mental calculations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I have the donuts, and the burger and fries, but then don't have ice-cream for dessert...\"<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She had already removed her jeans, releasing the top button with a groan of relief, and she now took off her blouse, revealing a pale torso and a contrastingly vivid red bra. What immediately caught the redhead's attention was her belly, now even larger than it had been before, swollen with food.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best efforts, she just couldn't stop eating! The dozen donuts had barely lasted the way home from the magic shop, and she had finished off not just her Doublemeat Supreme burger but also Tara's and half of Dawn's, not to mention two orders of curly fries and a half gallon of soda. After dinner, Dawn went to do homework and Buffy went out on patrol, so Tara and Willow settled in to watch a movie. It was some mindless action movie, but it was nice just sitting and cuddling, as well as tucking in to a large bowl of hot buttered popcorn, most of which went straight into Willow's already bulging stomach.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had barely noticed how much she'd been eating at the time, she could definitely see the effects now, her swollen gut sticking out over the waistband of her panties, making her look like she'd swallowed a basketball. She sighed and continued her routine, brushing her teeth and changing into her pink silk pajamas, struggling to button the top over her turgid tummy. She turned sideways and took one last look at herself. She looked pregnant, and heavily pregnant at that. \u00a0There was no way she could hide it from Tara, who was already sitting in bed, reading a book about ancient Sumerian warlocks. Grimacing, Willow opened the bathroom door and, every step feeling heavy and ungainly as she balanced her bloated belly, walked into their shared bedroom.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara, hearing the door close, looked up over her book, her eyes widened, a look of shock on her face.

Had she really not noticed? Maybe she was just being polite. Willow wondered if she'd say anything if Tara started to put on weight.

I know I've gained weight.  You don't have to rub my nose in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow,\" Buffy said seriously, \"are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked up at their faces.  There wasn't even the ghost of a smile on any of them.  They looked worried.  Tara was close to tears.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They really think I'm thin</i>, she realized.  And yet all she had to do was look down for proof that she wasn't.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't much, a bit of a pot belly, but as she looked at her reflection in the mirror, she patted it a bit, enjoying the jiggling feeling. She was gradually becoming aware of the fact that she had started piling on weight over the past few weeks. Things had been particularly quiet in Sunnydale lately, and Buffy dealt with most of the Demons and Vampires in this town before Faith had a chance. As a result, instead of a night out slaying and patrolling, Faith had taken to enjoying nights full of drinking and stuffing her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Faith finally said, \"looks like I need to hit the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as the rest of the day passed, Faith found herself not going to the gym, but lounging on her couch instead, munching on some chocolates and assorted candy before Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did this for several hours and by the time night had fallen, she was well and truly stuffed. As she looked down at her round stomach, she realised that, once again, she had overdone it. Belching carelessly, Faith rubbed her stuffed bit of a belly, feeling it's taut surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there came a knock on the door and Faith gave a groan as she got to her feet, causing her tank top to ride up and expose her bulging stomach. \"Just a minute!\" Faith called, adjusting her top to hide her exposed flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she answered the door, she came face to face with...</span></div></div>",

And <i>thin</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bitch,</i> thought Faith in annoyance.  But she put on a broad smile and leaned casually against the doorframe.  \"Hey, B. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checking in,\" her fellow Slayer said.  Her eyes quickly darted around the Faith's body, taking in the changes.  Faith growled slightly.  She could just imagine what the judgmental little twit must be thinking.   \"I haven't seen much of you -- er, I haven't seen you very often, lately.  Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five by five.  Hell, with you around, it's like I'm on vacation all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy peered around Faith to the living room.

For one the double chin changed her profile a bit, along with the chipmunk cheeks. There was no doubt that Willow was turning into a grade A heifer. Suddenly Faith wasn't feeling so bad about her spare tire. looking down, she could see that Willow's gut and ass had really pushed out. That big old butt was like two basketballs stuffed into those dugarees. And it was hard to see through the jean fabric of the normally baggy clothes, it looked like Willow's belly had split below the belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith cracked a joke. \"So, how many people did you have to eat to get that fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilllow's fatty cheeks blushed and she tried to stutter her own comeback, \"W-w-well how many did you eat?\" she pointed at faith's own belly, which was revealed by a shirt that was riding up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to care what others thought of her appearance, Faith smiled and gave her belly a smack. \"Guys like something to grab onto. Times are changing and big is in. so what the hell do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Willow launched into a semi panic, \"Faith, there's some kind of spell going on! Buffy read and book and angered some kind of ancient fertility goddess and it's a long story but we need your help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith rolled her eyes, \"I always told be that books were more Giles thing; damn valley girl really is as dumb as she lets on. Alright, so where the hell do I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to cause Willow some embarrasment. \"Well, I need you to help me drive. We need to pick up some mystic items from across town and I can't drive, Xander and Giles are locked in a dungeon somewhere and most of the girls are too fat to get around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm the thinnest one,\" Faith intoned angrily. \"Well fuck you, get some other skinny bitch to do your driving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Willow shouted, \"I'll pay for your food bill!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Faith's attention, \"Really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I learned a spell to make counterfit money and I've been waiting for the right time to use it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith laughed, \"Fine you convinced me. Let me grab a snack before we hit the road. Then we'll hit up In and out Burger and get whatever we need.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Faith!\" Willow gasped, belly and boobs bouncing with the enthusiasm. This had the unexpected result of ripping open the front of her dugarees and showing off her pale belly cleavage. \"Fuck!\" Willow shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot normally the kindest, Faith felt sorry for Willow. A girl shouldn't be ashamed of her utter gluttony. \"hey it's alright\" she said, lifting up her T-shirt to show off her belly in full. \"We're both full porkers, now let's go eat to make us feel better; like fucking girlfriends are supposed to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove in Faith's car, the two girls ate away their troubles. Faith one handed drove while munching a burger. Willow was demolishing the last of a set of fries meant for a family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark slayer looked down at her own belly, which was larger by a couple of inches when they'd left the house. \"Damn I think the curse is working. My ass is getting fatter faster than it should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow gulped her fries, \"The curse is working faster. We need to move before we get too fat to walk around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith gave her a naughty grin before finishing her burger, \"Too fat to move. Jabba the Slutt; that kinda turns me on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh grow up\" groaned Willow.  </span></div></div>",

She was fat and very much liked it. All through the drive she'd seen Sunnydale's female population turn into overweight porkers; she was doing good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow on the other hand wasn't so confident. It looked like she was trying to shrink into her own fat; waddling as slowly as possible to avoid the ever present jiggling. Her boobs popped out of her normally conservative dugarees and her ass shook like two jelly filled basketballs. Belly and boobs had popped out, it looked like her but was going to be next .\"Faith, we gained weight just on the drive here; aren't you the least bit worried.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark slayer laughed as she ignored the pain in her jean's waistband. \"Nah, I like being like this. I eat what I want and fuck who I want; this is just the next logical step.\" Burgoning ass cheekcs strained against her jeans and a bit of crack was showing off from the top of her pants. \"In fact, let's grab a snack.\" With a sudden kick of a formerly toned leg, Faith kicked over a vending machine and sent its contents <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was about to yell something about vandalism when a growl of hunger emerged from her black hole of a gut. Losing what little self control she had she went on the floor and reached for the first package of chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith smiled, but there were better things in her future. The doors to the cafeteria were no match for the slayer strengh and soon there was nothing standing between Faith Lehane and the Sunnydale cafeteria but thin air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFridge doors were ripped off and deserts for over a thousand students began to go down the gluttonous lips of the dark slayer. Faith shoved brownies, cakes and other cheap and sugary treats into her mouth with mechanical effeciency. Powered by slayer metabolism, the plump girl was rapidly fattening as the curse of fatness accelerated her metabolism. Her arms thickened and fingers became plump sausages. Cheeks filled out and over the course of half an hour the deserts in the walk in fridge were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlayer regeneration prevented the formation of stretch marks and in fact made her skin far more elastic and spherical than any woman her size had a right to be. Faith never cared when the buttons on her jeans popped off. Her growing layer of blubber shielded her from the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark slayer let out a most massive belch, shaking the entirety of her now three hundred pound body. The hunger was still there, despite all the feeding. Faith however decided to abstain for now. There was no reason to rush the gain and part of her enjoyed the pain of hunger; it was a very s&amp;m feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing nothing now but her denim jacket, Faith was nearly naked. At the very least the wide open jacket covered up her boobs; which hadn't expanded as much as she wanted. But nothing was perfect right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling despite her slayer strengh, Faith smiled when she saw the fully naked Willow. \"Hey Red, how goes it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnspeakably shamed, the now four hundred pound naked witch help up a stone state. \"I got what we need; the Willendorf Venus. It's the first thing we need to break the curse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>UUUUUUURRRRPPPP!!!!!!!</i> Well that's excellent\" Faith retorted. \"But before we get any more weird artifacts, let's have a bit of fun and work off our meals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Willow asked. Faith's response was physical rather than verbal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark slayer wrapped her obese arms around Willow and pushed their fleshy, round bodies together. Faith deeply kissed willow, the crags and wrinkles of fat folding into one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was taken back by the Slayer's advance but some deeper magic fueled her lust and she kissed back. Clutching the Venus with one hand, she groped faith's breast through her open jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning in delight, Faith put her hands on Willow's double D twins. Faith's belly groaned in hunger and like a mating call being answered, Willow's gut groaned back; just as their two sexes began to moisten under their bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperior strengh pinned down Willow and faith guided her into a teacher's lounge. Squeezing through a doorway almost too narrow, Faith and Willow landed on the teacher's couch and crushed it. Ingnoring the busted legs, the couch was still quite comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the initiative, Faith pushed Willow back and shoved her face towards her crotch. Pushing back Willow's belly apron, she eagerly began to feast on pussy with the same gusto as food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uugh-Faith!\" Willow moaned as she began to play with her nipples; the idol forgotten by the side of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo gluttonous, horny fat women began to make love. And it was just the start</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weeks of laziness had taken their toll on her body, but not her reflexes.  Faith didn't recognize the three demons standing in front of her.  She saw they were humanoid, man-sized, long, gnarled horns growing back from their heads.  The ones closest to the door were muscular, powerful, and she threw a kick at the one on the left, pushing herself backwards in the process to get some distance.  Her belly jiggled while she moved, but suddenly that seemed less important.<br>\r\nThey closed in on her and pinned her shoulders, moving in perfect harmony, her now frantic attacks proving useless.  She grunted and struggled, suddenly wondering of she had gotten so out of shape that two seemingly generic demons could get the drop on her so easily.  The demon between the two was a thinner, well-dressed one, almost dignified in appearance.  He approached between them with his eyes staring directly into Faith's.<br>\r\nShe tried to speak and now couldn't even manage another angry grunt.  It wasn't her body that had gotten in the way of this fight, it was him.  The two large demons released their grip but Faith remained firmly laying on the chair she was thrown into, the chair she had sat and watched so many movies and ate so much junk food the last few weeks.<br>\r\n\"Is this the one?  Looks likes she could use a trip to the gym,\" one of the larger demons said, echoing Faith's thoughts.<br>\r\n\"It's her,\" the middle one said, not taking his hypnotic eyes off of Faith's.  \"And she's perfect.  Slayer, you can hear me, so stop struggling.  You'll be free after I make you my offer.  Well, by 'free' I mean you'll be able to move and speak again, but you won't have much say in what you do with those abilities.\"<br>\r\n\"Grrrrnnnnnnn . . .\" Faith growled through her teeth, unable to make any other sound.  She wasn't one to scare easily, but this head demon had such complete control over her right now that her anger, that emotion that fueled her, was rapidly turning into fear.<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes, very articulate.  You're going to carry a message to the vampires in this town, see?  This isn't their town, or the Slayer's town, or the Mayor's town, it's our town from now on, see?  They don't listen, I'll know right away through you, and they won't be too happy about what happens.  So you do this, you get rewarded.  Understand?\"<br>\r\nFaith released a gurgle of understanding.<br>\r\n\"What's her reward?\" one of the demons asked.  The head demon looked around the apartment, littered with snacks and garbage.<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?  She appreciates the finer sides of leisure--pure laziness.\"<br>\r\nFaith rolled her eyes.  This wasn't her choice.  She had just not had much slaying to do with Buffy and her gang taking care of all the evil without her.  She had never been the couch potato type before this.<br>\r\nThe three began backing out in unison again, sensing their leader's thoughts.  Faith slowly started feeling her will returning.<br>\r\n\"So, Slayer, just a taste of what's to come if you follow my orders,\" he spread his hands and Faith felt her body return to her control.<br>\r\nHer stomach gurgled and then, as her hands raced to the already swollen, puffy tummy, she felt it press out, snapping her jeans and pushing her shirt up.<br>\r\nShe gasped, now staring so intently at her stomach that she barely noticed the three demons back out, closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n\"What?  What?\" she screamed, now to non one.  He hands cradled her tummy.  It was already uncomfortably puffy from her weeks of slacking off.  Now, in seconds, it was a potbelly.  It was flabby.  It oozed out so far that she couldn't close her jeans again while she was sitting.  She had trouble standing when she tried, not leaping her feet with a slayer's grace as usual.  Her hands didn't leave her stomach as she stood there, panting, shocked, confused.<br>\r\nShe turned and saw her profile reflected in the window of her apartment, noting she looked almost pregnant, and that her large, beautiful eyes were wide with disgust at what had happened to her once sexy abs.<br>\r\nShe surprised herself with her next thought.  After weeks of avoiding Buffy and her friends, she realized that they were exactly who she ad to go to right now.  If not for the sake of Sunnydale, then at least for her figure.</span></div></div>",

Honestly, all of them had been through some seriously messed up circumstances, but only Faith had managed to hurt them like this. Xander wasn't completely blameless in his actions, but he deserved far better than her. Better than Faith. <br>\r\nBut Faith obviously didn't care, because she was a slayer, sexy, and had nothing that could stop her.<br>\r\nYet.<br>\r\nWillow spread the ingredients out in front of her, and took a deep breath. She wanted to punish Faith, but she also wanted her to understand why it was happening and give her a chance to change her ways. Willow came on a variety of spells while trying to decide how to exact her revenge. There was a fierce on the would force the victim to go through the full nine months of pregnancy over and over without any breaks until the afflicted apologized for all their misdeeds. Another one Willow thought of was a simple 'niceness' curse. Under it, everything that came out of Faith's mouth would be a compliment, regardless of what she intended to say. While it would be entertaining to hear Faith yell how nice someone's shirt looked, or how pretty their eyes were, Willow had something much...bigger in mind. She had a plan to take away Faith's main reasons for being able to act like she was above everyone. <br>\r\nHer sex appeal was a definite factor. This was combined with her quick wittiness, and supported by her mobility and deadliness as a slayer. <br>\r\nAnd Willow had a solution to take these factors away, slowly, but surely. <br>\r\nThe spell, when cast, would cause Faith to gain weight. Since it was magical, it would ignore any outside factors, such as diet, exercise, or Faith's slayer metabolism. <br>\r\nShe knew the spell worked, as she had secretly tested it on the potential slayers that loitered around, and even managed to cast it on Buffy herself. Willow still feels a twinge of guilt when Buffy had come to her, worried by the twenty pound gain. She had done her best to make it flattering, though, with most of the weight settling on hips, butts, and breasts. She had been a little experimental with Buffy, seeing how drastic she could make the distribution, and how gradual she could make it. Buffy hadn't even noticed she gained weight until she realized one of her shirts hadn't always been a crop top. Still, all of the weight had melted away, with the exception of five pounds in Buffy's breasts that Willow had purposely made impossible to lose to see if the spell could work in the long term. It had been three months and Buffy's boobs had stayed. The slayer seemed to enjoy it, so Willow didn't feel bad about her deeds.<br>\r\nShe was merciful with Buffy.<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be so for Faith.<br>\r\nWillow muttered words in an ancient language as the room around her began to glow. She could see Faith now, asleep and unaware of what was to come. <br>\r\nWillow only had one choice. How would the spell work? A couple of thoughts came to mind...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She had never been the type to admit it, but lately Faith had been feeling particularly down. Her time in Sunnydale had reached a low point for her. She initially tried to do her slayer thing, fit in, make friends, be the cool new girl. That failed, leaving her feeling like a big phony. She then tried to take charge under the assumption that Buffy's status as de factor chief slayer was up for grabs. She overestimated how good of friends Buffy had, and wound up ostracizing herself even further. Xander trying to help her was just another massive insult. And she had further infuriated the whole gang with her unnecessarily nasty comments a few months back when Buffy mysteriously, an still inexplicably, ballooned up. Faith felt a little worse about that. Making fun of fat girls was something she tried not to do but couldn't help it sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now Faith found herself having not spoken with the gang in a few days. She last saw Xander, of course, and that left her feeling more self loathing than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had wandered around for a few hours, but with nary a vampire in sight, walked into a gas station she had frequented as it was nearby the extended stay hotel she was living in. Another sign of her isolation. Had things been differently, any one of Buffy's friend, or Buffy herself, would have gladly offered her a better place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody was there except the guy behind the register. He glanced at Faith from his newspaper, then went back to reading. Faith grabbed the first 40 oz she came across and went to the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ID,\" the guy said, turning his page slowly, deliberately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? I'm here every night,\" Faith said, taking out some cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy's eyes looked up and met hers. Maybe he had gotten in trouble for not checking IDs. Maybe he was just in a bad mood. Maybe the obviously not 21 year old Faith had gotten on his nerves. Whatever the reason, he was not having. He, very slowly, like a man too aggravated to rush, put his paper down, stood up, put his hand on the counter, and moved the beer towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ID, no booze,\" he said, looking her right in the eyes, as if daring Faith to try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith didn't consider that the guy of course was assuming she would get pissed and leave. He certain did not see it coming when Faith grabbed him by the shirt, pulled him halfway over the counter, and shouted in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asshole!\" she said, nothing better coming to mind. Still holding on the trembling man, caught completely off guard by the immense strength of this young woman, she slammed a few bucks on the counter. \"Don't mess with me tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, <i>something</i> went through her. It only lasted a few seconds. It started as a feeling of sudden fullness in her stomach, which then dispersed like a vanished burp, and ended with a tingly, pins-and-needles feeling through her ass. It was fleeting, but caught Faith enough off guard that she let the guy go. He fell back into his chair, still having made no further sound but a surprised \"urk!\" when she let him go. Her jeans, formfitting but loose enough to allow action packed movements while fighitng vampires, felt different behind her. She casually tugged at the seat, disregarding the sensation, and not noticing that the tight feeling was from firm butt having plumped up just a little. Enough that it was now crammed into her jeans, having pushed out a good two or three inches and gaining some volume, if not outright heft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, lady-\" the guy started saying, his hands up in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith sneered, waved her hand, and began walking away. The man was too shaken to notice that the young woman's already fine ass had gotten a little bigger, although Faith felt her walk was a little off already. She wanted to keep tugging at the seat of her pants like she had to remove a wedgie. Halfway to the door, she turned around and walked back to the counter. The guy looked terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm taking this,\" she scooped up the money, smiled, now daring him to do something. \"What's what I thought,\" she said, and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feeling of fullness again entered her, then dispersed, and now she paused at the door. She held her arm across her chest and had the odd sensation that her breasts had pushed out into it. Her bra even felt tighter. She started to adjust it in the door mirror, looking at her reflection with confusion. She looked back at the guy behind the register and, detecting a strange bounce to her chest that wasn't there before, left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, a bookcase needed moving. After it had been broken when a Orgorbort demon had been thrown into it the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be careful,\" Giles said, standing off to the side. He stood up from his chair to move a strange sculpture off of a pedestal, but Buffy shooed him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giles, sit down, we got this,\" Buffy said. She had her back right to the sculpture Giles could just imagine it falling off any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might know books and vampires and demons,\" Xander said, slapping on some work gloves, \"But this is my territory. You're in my house now.\" He looked around, \"Although not actually. I don't think we have a bookcase. This is how I grew up, everyone. No bookcases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On three-\" Buffy said. The two bent down to lift the broken furniture from the bottom. Giles started to speak as Buffy was just inches from whatever the presumably priceless object was. It was like watching an Abbott and Costello routine being set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn three, the lifted. The shelves creaked. The whole thing was going to come apart. They lifted it just a little higher when.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Buffy said. Something went through her. She had been through enough to know that something this weird, this specific, must have been a spell. First she felt full, then tingly, then she was certain she felt her ass stretching behind her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was bound to happen,\" Giles said as Buffy's ass knocked off the sculpture. It fell to the ground with a clunk. Nothing broke off of it. He stood up and get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Buffy Butt Breaks Bust,'\" Xander said moving his hands like a headline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, something just happened,\" Buffy was examining her behind. She was wearing loose cargo pants so it wasn't readily apparent, but she could tell. After her body changing so much, however briefly, during the weight gain incident, she knew what it felt like when part of you got bigger. \"It's my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is,\" Xander said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It grew, just now. I felt it, like a pulse in my stomach, and then moved there,\" she started to sound worried, \"Giles, did you ever find anything at all about what happened when I, er, grew a few months ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Buffy, I'm afraid I didn't. While there are spells that could cause it I saw no evidence of one being cast,\" Giles turned his head, to avoid continuing to stare at the slayer's rounder behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-\" Buffy said, she put a hand on her stomach as the fullness returned. It vanished, and this time they all saw it. Buffy grabbed her already large breasts with a shocked look as they visibly blew up a few inches in front of them. They already felt heavy enough, not even more so. Her t-shirt was starting to strain as it is. \"We have to stop this.\" Buffy said, fear in her voice, remembering what had happened so recently. \"Now!\"</span></div></div>",

For shame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty sweet on her, aren't you?\" said Faith, \"The way she's got you whipped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis angered Spike so much that he and Faith went into a little brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she?\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey struggled and struggled, until Spike left the kitchen in disgust.

Of course I'm bloody pissed! Without her, we won't survive for long!

(Andrew has been sleeping there.) Andrew went over to her bed and reached underneath He pulled out a big ray gun that looked like the invisible ray that he and his friends, Warren and Jonathan, created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" Spike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this used to be an invisible ray,\" said Andrew, as he struggled to carry it. It was very heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And am I right in saying that you zapped Buffy with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accidentally, yes,\" Andrew replied to Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's this got to do with getting vengeance?\" Spike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made some modifications to it. You can not only make people invisible, but also make people shrink, grow, and even gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Andrew, \"I figured we should zap Faith with the ray on the weight gain setting so she can be too heavy to lead us and they would need to get Buffy back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike took the ray off of Andrew's hands and observed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still think you're an evil genius?\" asked Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes,\" replied Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, speaking as someone who used to be evil, this is really cruel but I'm game with this plan.\"</span></div></div>",

A bolt shot out of the ray and struck Andrew, rendering him invisible. Then Spike went off on his way to find Buffy. Andrew carried the ray over back inside the house. Some of the Potentials were in the living room while some were in the basement with Faith and the Scoobies. Andrew quietly walked on over to the basement, hoping someone would not see the floating ray. Step by step, he sneaked with as much ease as he had to get to the basement. He made it. As he sneaked down the stairs, he heard the gang trying to decide what their best course was for the time being. Kennedy was attempting to speak out her opinions, but Faith kept shutting her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew squatted down on the middle step of the stairs. He pointed the ray to where Faith stood. He turned the setting to weight gain. Then he pulled the trigger and a bolt struck Faith, causing her to fall.</span></div></div>",

Faith's formerly fat stomach now pouched in front of her body and her boobs were beginning to droop as well. Her arms and legs had thickened with fat as well, to a point where her old jackets and pants were now too restrictive, so now she wore just sleeveless shirts and shorts - clothes that her new (and ever increasing) weight was making to appear almost obscene. Her butt too was increasing in size and girth, straining her shorts as well, beginning to reveal her panties, as they increasingly peaked over the ever-straining waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Faith's face became inflated with a fledgling second chin and fuller cheeks - Faith no longer looked too dangerous, but more cuddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy gained less weight, but it was distributed in a more pear-like fashion, so it was more noticeable as well. Her slacks, skirts and dresses were often strained to a point of bursting, especially if her mother wouldn't buy her a new pair (which was fairly often these days). Her arms too were inflated with fat as well, and the rest of her body was full of rolls and handles, her belly too now pouched outwards, but it was her legs and butt there were especially noticeable, as Buffy was on the verge of developing steatopygia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Faith, however, Buffy wasn't aware that she had gained a large amount of weight, as Joyce (who was pleased that her elder daughter stopped spending her nights in dangerous pursuits) kept her wardrobe up-to-date, buying larger sizes for her daughter to be comfortable and somewhat unaware of her weight gain. As a result, Buffy became lazier and lazier, and by now was more interested in all-you-can eat buffets than vampires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith was more observant than Buffy, but she preferred to play along with Joyce, since Joyce provided her with food and board for free - as long as Faith helped her fatten Buffy as well.

Of course, by the time they moved in together in Sunnydale, Faith felt much more safe and secure, physically and mentally. She found herself almost surplus, as Buffy was a more experienced Slayer and already handled most of the supernatural problems of Sunnydale. So, Faith enrolled in Sunnydale High School, to stay close to her new friends and the other Watcher.

Her sweet, sweet Willow. Despite the young woman's flaws, Tara was still completely head over heels her, and would do anything to keep her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was one thing she wasn't the happiest with. Tara wasn't fat by any means, but compared to the likes of Willow, Buffy, or Anya, she was definitely a bit bigger than the other girls. Willow didn't seem to mind. In fact, she was delighted by Tara's body, smitten by its softness and warmth. Still, Tara wished that she was a little thinner from time to time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was off with Xander going through one of their movie marathons. Buffy and Dawn had arranged a sister day, and Giles was...well, Tara was sure he was fine. This left her by herself, however. Tara decided to make herself useful and go refresh the spell ingredients that had been dwindling recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tara made her way over to the magic shop, she saw a store that hadn't been there before. The sign hung above her is bold, curvy print \"Indina's Indulgences\". Tara was going to walk past it, but the urge to have a peek inside was just too much for the young witch to resist. As Tara walked into the shop, she was almost bowled over by how heavenly everything smelled. The bakery had everything from glorious looking donuts that were dripping in frosting to decadent chocolates that seemed to be begging Tara to taste them. Tara was glad that she only brought enough money for the supplies, otherwise she would not be able to help her self. Suddenly, a woman appeared to her side, with a large tray of various treats in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our grand opening! would you like a sample?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara fearfully glances down. She can already feel her willpower begin to slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is already lifting a treat to Tara, a large smile on her face. Feeling as though she's not in control, Tara takes it and pops it into her mouth. She almost moans as sweetness explodes over her tongue. Its just as delicious as she fears. The woman smiles once more, and places the try down directly before her. Before Tara can gain control of herself, she promptly shoves another 3 into her mouth. Tara's eyes widen in horror, even as her fingers wrap around her fifth sample within two minutes. She managed to jerk away from the tray, but not before she shoves one more sweet into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to get a handle on my willpower...\" She mumbles as she makes here way to the magic shop. <br>\r\nOnce there, she buys the ingredients she needs quickly. Tara then decides to stop by Anya's store, to see how she was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tara got there, she was surprised to see the store empty, with no one in sight. <br>\r\n\"Anya?\" She called. no answer. Tara turns to leave when something catches her eye. Its an exquisite necklace, covered in beautiful engravings. As she gets closer, she notices an open book right next to it. Tara can't read the text, but there are notes next to it which seems to be written by Giles.<br>\r\n<i>'Amulet of Will...given to those who need to strengthen their willpower...seems to activate when worn...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara inched closer, observing the necklace closely. She mumbles a few warding spells, but the jewelry doesn't react. So, the object isn't evil. She places a hand on it, intending to observe it closer, but a strange feeling comes over her. Before she can think about it, she clasps the necklace around her neck. Tara waits, seeing if the enchanted thing worked. She feels no different. <br>\r\nShe glances at the clock on the wall. Shoot! she had been out for too long. Tara hurried back to her apartment. Once she gets back, she can order something small to eat, no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tara get back, she feels her stomach growl. Oh, she should order something for dinner. She picks up the phone and dials...  </span></div></div>",

Except for the heavily-fortified fence and the guards on patrol, the spa looked like a resort hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even beach access to a fenced-off section of ocean. Cordelia breathed in the fresh air, smiled and headed inside the resort. She was greeted by a friendly woman who showed her to her room. It was a very nice room with a private bathroom and a balcony with an ocean view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent...\" Cordelia said to herself as she checked out the view, and admired her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman waddled out of the room, Cordelia stifled a giggle when she saw that the woman was so wide and fat, her hips grazed both sides of the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my,\" Cordelia wondered aloud, \"what do they feed the staff around here? I'll make sure to skip the endless buffets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia's first day at the spa was heavenly, she had enjoyed a dip in the pool, a massage and a visit to the steam room. As she walked to her room that night, she spotted a tall, leggy blonde strolling down the hallway towards her. The blonde was dressed only in a towel, and had no doubt just returned from a dip in the pool - though her body seemed relatively dry. The girl was clearly just showing off, and Cordelia couldn't help but feel like she was being one-upped. Though completely confident in her own good looks, Cordelia had a tendency to dislike anyone who might be seen as more attractive than she was...and this new arrival at the spa certainly seemed like she might pose a threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl walked to the door of her room and jiggled the handle, she noticed Cordelia and gave her a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia did not return it. She eyed the blonde up and down, noting just how little of her body was covered. <i>\"What a slut...\"</i> she thought. </span></div></div>",

A reflection of buck teeth set in braces returned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Cordelia exclaimed, unaware that her originally short skirt was elongating to compensate for the inflation of her butt. \"My teeth! What happened to my teeth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they were always like that - you just couldn't see them because of your faulty glasses,\" the blonde giggled even as Cordelia fumbled for her glasses, which were hanging on a rope around her neck and resting on top of two mammoth breasts that needed a custom-made bra to hold them more or less upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My glasses, right,\" Cordelia muttered as she put them on and looked at her reflection once more. By now, her stomach had sufficiently inflated with fat to hold her breasts aloft, straining the buttons of Cordelia's \"new\" blouse to the maximum. However Cordelia ignored it, staring at her hair, which was now greasy and limp and lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you better go now,\" the blonde said kindly, and Cordelia left, her new personality now meek and submissive - a complete opposite to what it now was. As Cordelia exited the room, her face also inflated with fat, forming at least one more chin, and several pimples of different sizes appeared on her face too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I doing here?\" Cordelia muttered, as she pulled out her organizer from her large and ratty purse. \"Wasn't I supposed to meet Willow to compare study notes?\"</span></div></div>",

She returned to existence on top of the currently-vacant Sunnydale High.  Just Cordelia's  looks alone would keep her beautiful for at least another year. However, for a sprite-in-exile, a tenth of a century was a few idle yawns away. The impermanence of stealing glamor had kept Cathaertis from enjoying her time in exile; by killing one of her sisters, she was forced into one of the least beautiful dimensions she had ever seen as punishment for snuffing out her sister's life. (As if Aphrosia was -that- big of a loss! Cathaertis was sure she was -much- more beautiful than her.) Now, instead of doing what a sprite should, radiating true beauty at all times and occasionally letting those of other dimensions catch fleeting glimpses, so as to incite worship,  her gifts had been reversed into a curse. Since she arrived in this plane, her form was constantly drawing perfections away from others, <i>into her</i>! Those she passed by on the street would find zits disappearing and a healthy glow appearing on their cheeks, sudden bursts of weight loss, even developing newly-found social skills;  after a few days, Cathaertis found her once perfect body developing rolls of fat, and for the first time in her life, she began to smell a little ripe and needed to bathe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever; she still knew her kind's spells, usually reserved for warfare or used in return for sacrifices from those of other planes.  By enchanting personal objects, she could create a locus of glamor, draining all the beauty in the vicinity into the object and absorbing it. Unfortunately, magic had its costs; if she used the spell too much, Cathaertis would likely become tolerant to the spell, no longer benefiting from it but still having all the enchanted objects sucking charm and beauty away like black holes. Cathaertis was not unintelligent and quickly came up with a plan to remedy this problem.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had chosen locus spell's first  victim for a reason;  the mortal girl Cordelia was not only beautiful, resulting in a greater amount of energy stolen, but she was also popular and attended a high school on a hellmouth; as long as she kept that mirror with her, it would begin to drain other girls as it drained (and continued to drain) Cordelia.  It would work much slower than the initial burst of beauty transfer that had sealed the enchantment into the mirror, but after a while Cathertis was sure the whole school would be exposed to it from sitting near Cordelia, passing her in the hallway, sitting near her at lunch, the possibilities were endless!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with her work, Cathaertis began sunbathing and waited for the arrival of the first day of class. </span></div></div>",
