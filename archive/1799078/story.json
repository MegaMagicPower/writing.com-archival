You've got wavy black hair and dark brown eyes. Your skin is smooth and tanned from long hours outdoors, and your athletic lifestyle has kept you in great shape. Your legs are toned, your tummy is taut, and your firm breasts have made you quite the catch. Maybe that's why you've ended up in Poison Ivy's greenhouse, you think with a shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you remember was hiking through the rainforest. It was hot and humid, so you tried to wear as little as possible. Then\u2026 you woke up in here. Thinking you might be able to get out before Ivy notices you're awake, you get up and look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenhouse is thick with vegetation. Trees stretch up to the roof, covered in vines. Ferns and flowers line rows of carefully placed plant life. You start walking down the rows, looking for a doorway. As your walking amongst the plants, you feel something feathery drag across your bare belly. Letting out a startled giggle, you jump backwards and cover your stomach with your hands. In front of you is a wiggling vine with what looks like a feathery tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you think to yourself. \"The vines are going to tickle me! I'm so ticklish, I don't know if I'll be able to take it. I mean, I kind of like being tickled, but if Poison Ivy catches me\u2026\" You stop and shake your head, determined not to let that happen. At the same time, you keep your arms to your sides, trying to cover your underarms, sides, midriff, and as much skin as possible. Although, since you aren't wearing much, it seems like a lost cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the road forks ahead. To the left is a path covered in feathery vines. You catch some of them wiggling out of the corner of your eye, but whenever you stare at them, they seem to stop. The path looks\u2026 ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle path has bright red flowers lining both sides, and is very fragrant. Taking a whiff of the sweet scent, you feel yourself getting hot\u2026 and your nipples perk up. A pleasant tingling sensation runs down your spine. Realizing what the smell is doing to you, you shake your head to clear your mind. Would being turned on like that be any better than being tickled?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right path has white flowers that don't seem to smell very much. You try to take a whiff, but you can't seem to smell anything. In fact, you feel your mind blanking, your body relaxing\u2026 you shake your head again. This path might be the most dangerous, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got three paths to take, each with their dangers. Which one should you choose?</span></div></div>",

They don't move when you can see them but you can't look everywhere at once. All you can do is keep your arms locked into your body and try to protect your tummy and sides as best you can.

Once they secure their grip on you they begin hoisting you up towards their mistress.  You try to kick at first, but several alarming squeezes from the vines around your neck and belly help you to realize that resistance is fuetile.  The vines stop lifting you when you reach Poison Ivy's eye level.  She smiles at you and looks you up and down.  She then reaches out and places her hand on your chest, apparently feeling your heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing,\" she coos to you, as she reaches up and scratches the underside of your chin.  \"You must have been very hungry, to try and steal my fruit, when all you had to do was simply ask me.\"  She then kneels down as the vine around your middle shifts its way up your body so that now it is coiled around your chest leaving your stomach bare.  Then she gently presses her ear against your belly while placing her right hand on your hip; this feels good yet awkward for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, it does sound empty in there,\" she sighs after a while, leaning back and stroking your belly with her left hand.  \"I should punish you for trying to steal my fruit, but since your belly sounds so empty, and you are so lovely to touch and look at, and look so tasty in my vines, I am feeling genorous.\"  She then stands up and walks over to a branch and deftly plucks an apple from it.  She sniffs the apple and sultrily approaches you with it in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells so delicious,\" she sighs, seductively waving it under your nose.  \"And I'm sure it tastes even better.\"  You realize that she is right about the apple smelling good, and that she might also be right about how it tastes.  Deep down you know that this is another of her traps, but still the apple smells so sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, little horse,\" she whispers holding the apple a mere inch from your lips.  \"Feed your poor belly.\"  What should you do?</span></div></div>",

This throws you off balance , and prevents you from fleeing.  You wobble a little as the root squeezes your legs together and start to fall backwards.  As this happens the tree that the root belongs to scoots up behind you, preventing you from falling on your back.  But suddenly an arm-like branch reaches around your chest and pulls you up against the tree's trunk.  Then another branch grabs your neck and pins it against the tree, as two more branches seize your arms and pull them around the trunk of the tree.  You try to get free, but the tree only hugs you tighter, and when it does you swear you can hear what sounds like a deep rumbling chuckle coming from within the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not nice to steal, little horse,\" Poison Ivy says as she lowers herself down from the tree.  \"Now, you're going to learn why.\"  And with that she snaps her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a rustling above you and look up.  You see several vines lowering themselves from the tree's upper branches.  Each vines a bulb at the end of it.  When they reach you the bulbs bloom open, revealing in their centers a long feather-like pedal that wiggles around like a snake's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enjoy watching you squirm,\" Ivy chuckles as the tickling vines begin their work.  First, one tickles at your left ear and at your right ear making you twitch.  Then another one tickles at your nose making you snort a little; it then moves down and tickles your chin, and then works its way down your neck.  Then the others start tickling at your sides and belly, making your flesh quiver.  You angrily glare at Ivy, trying your hardest not to give her the satisfaction of seeing you laugh.  This glare only makes her smile more, because she can see in your eyes that the tickling is becoming unbearable.  The feathery pedals are like large horseflies that will not leave you alone no matter how hard you shake.  Finally one vine decides to work on your belly button(your most sensitive spot).  This at last begins to draw chuckles, which finally grow into hysterical laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, simply delicious,\" mutters Ivy, knowing that she has finally broken you.  The vines increase their ferocity, seemingly encouraged by your laughter.  This madness continues to the point where it feels like you are ready to pass out.  But before you do, Ivy snaps her fingers again.  Immediately the vines stop tickling you and retreat back up into the tree.  You slump down in braches' embrace, your chest heaving as you struggle to catch your breath.  But then Ivy slowly approaches you and places her hands on your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did, little horsie,\" she snickers.  You simply glare down at her, trying to look undefeated.<br>\r\n\"My name is Spirit, not horsie,\" you say proudly, puffing your chest out (at least as far as the constricting branch will let you) in an attempt to look big.<br>\r\n\"Spirit, hmm, what a lovely name for a horsie,\" she says in her most fawning voice as she playfully draws circles on your pectorals with her index fingers.  \"Would you like me to rub your belly too, silly,\" she added giving you Bambi eyes.<br>\r\n\"No I would like you to let me go now,\" you snap, annoyed yet unsurprised by her condescending attitude.  At this she snears arousingly.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I'm afraid I'm not done with you yet, you little thief,\" she says.  \"Now that my babies have worn you down, I think I'll...\"</span></div></div>",

My name is Zenith, my friends call me Zen, and I\u2019m an anthro wolf. I was out jogging, and had smelled something really tasty coming from a cluster of greenhouses. Wait, greenhouses?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes, and looked around as best I could. I was in a greenhouse, one with lots of plants. I was lying on my back on a metal table in the middle of the room. When I tried to move, I found that I couldn\u2019t; vines were holding my arms and legs spread-eagle. I was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well. It seems I have a visitor.\u201d I looked over to one side, and my heart sank. Standing before me was Poison Ivy herself. I was trapped, at her mercy, and only wearing a pair of athletic shorts that were starting to feel a little tighter. I should probably explain something first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am submissive by nature. Just the thought of being dominated by a female can turn me on. And living near-ish to Gotham (I hail from Furryville, a city near Gotham, but far away enough that we don\u2019t have to deal with their various villains.), I would regularly hear about superheroics and villainy, which ended up seeping into some fantasies I\u2019ve had. In one, I\u2019m a supervillain and my (now ex-)girlfriend is a superheroine; she\u2019s stopped my plan, but before handing me over to the police, she decides to have some \u201cfun\u201d with me first. In another, I\u2019m a superhero, rendered powerless by my supervillainess girlfriend; she lords her victory over me, and tries to make me her servant. I have another similar to that one; wherein I\u2019m a civilian (possibly someone important, like a mayor) who got captured by the villainess, and is now at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now it was happening for real. I was equal parts turned-on and terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have anything to say for yourself?\u201d Poison Ivy asked, leaning over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, if you let me go, I promise I\u2019ll leave and I won\u2019t come back,\u201d I said, voice shaking. She made a face, thinking about it (hopefully).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, no, I won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were trespassing, and should be punished for that.\u201d I gulped nervously, and tried to ignore the stirring feeling in my shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you going to do to me?\u201d I asked. She said nothing. Instead, she ran a hand along my side, starting at my outstretched arm, and traveling down my body. I squirmed a little when her fingers brushed against my underarm and again at my ribs. She spread her fingers wide to feel the fur on my chest. She tugged the waistband of my shorts down a little, and gave my butt a squeeze, making me blush. Finally, she felt the underside of my leg, as if checking the muscles. Neither of us said anything while she was doing all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided,\u201d she finally said, \u201cwhat I\u2019m going to do with you. \u201cI\u2019m going ___<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

HAAHAOHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, after what was probably only a few minutes (but felt like hours), I came harder than I think I ever had before. Right before I came, I could feel Poison Ivy pushing forward on my cock. I wasn\u2019t sure why, but realized when I watched my spooge fly up into the air, and come back down...right at my face! I closed my eyes in time to not get any of my juices in them, but still got splattered all over my face. Ivy was pumping my cock, and now laughing at my situation. Streams of thick, ropey cum landed on my face, a little on my neck, mostly on my torso, and at the end, some oozed out and pooled around my crotch. At least the plants had stopped tickling me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation, the domination, the humiliation. This was far better and far worse than anything I had dream up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Poison Ivy had calmed down enough that she could stop laughing, she said, \u201cLooks like someone made a mess!\u201d She cleared away the cum from my eyes, and I looked up at her, blinking. \u201cWe should really get you cleaned up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only wonder, \u2018was she done humiliating me?\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I inhaled, and closed my eyes, enjoying the scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes again after a few seconds, and looked up lovingly at Poison Ivy. My heart skipped a beat when she smiled at me, and sped up when she said, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay, M-mistress.\u201d The second word sounded odd on my tongue, but at the same time, it felt right. The vines holding me in place released me, and I was able to sit up on the table. I briefly considered covering myself up, before deciding that there was no point - the Mistress had already seen everything. And if she wanted to look upon me, she should be free to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome along, my pet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to get you cleaned up.\u201d She began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mistress,\u201d I said, climbing down from the table and following after her, tail wagging all the while.
