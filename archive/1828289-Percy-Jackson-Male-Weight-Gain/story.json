Then my mother ran over to me and pushed through the forest only to have her snatched up by another one of those bird-like women. But soon after I faded to unconsciousness, then as I woke up I noticed this white-streaked raven haired man sitting next to me while a blonde haired woman with gray eyes was spoon feeding me a yellow liquid. To my shock it tasted like, my mom's home-made birthday cake ice cream. As I got up, I notice that my head hasn't completely been recovered and I was feeling a major headache. The blonde haired woman asked if I was alright. I was about to say yes when my head started to hurt more. I clutched on to my head then I open my eyes to see that blonde haired woman, white-streaked raven haired man, and everything around me was levitating. I said I'm sorry and my shock made everything fall. Then from lack of energy I passed of again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

And that made your anger rose, but it was short lived seeing that white-streaked raven haired man was now holding his head in pain. Like someone slapped him upside the head and my guess it would be the glaring blonde-haired woman with grey eyes. That same woman even gave me a towel to help me dry off. She asked me what was my name. And I told her it was Jacob Miliano. But to my surprise she asked me who was my godly parent which I thought was weird. I said I didn't know. But I felt a strange almost homey sensation right over my head. I looked up and it was a golden bow and arrow. Then the white-streaked raven haired man said \"Apollo\". Then that's when my mind went to back to what I learned when I was in sixth grade. You mean the Greek/Roman god of the sun, Healing, Music, Poetry, and lastly Prophoecy. I replied back to the man \"Yep, that's the one.\" he gave back. He told me that his name was Percy Jackson, Son of Poseidon. And this is Annabeth Chase, Daughter of Athena. Percy gestering to the blonde haired woman sitting next to me. They asked me what happen and I told them everything. Then they both muttered \"Sirens\" hoping that I didn't hear them.

This kind of took Percy by surprise, and he asked that I had any physical powers but all I said that I had a healing factor which everyone has and that I could turned my body in to pure diamond but that will also cut off my mental abilities. And I also have audiokinesis along with astral projection and biokinesis.Percy soon understood this likely every thing must have a drawback at some point. Then he directed me through the entire camp and finally came a stop at the weapons inventory. He told me to pick a weapon. But as I looked around I found something that would really suit me.

As I picked up the shield it seem like it was calling for me. But my mind was soon pulled back into reality once Chiron, started the sword battling challenge. And to very much dissappointment it was Percy. As we began fighting, I was soon noticed that I was on the defensive and trying to get away from Percy's forcive swing and slash. But then I realize that their was a pattern for his way of attack. After a quick measure of distance between us I charged in dodging almost all of his blows, but coming along with some scratches. I soon low kicked his knee and took his unbalanced as a sign then jumped over him which landed my foot on his chest. I placed my sword up to his neck and said \"Yield now Percy Jackson.\" in a normal tone. You could practically see Percy sweat dropped to his face. \"Alright, I give up.\" Percy soon replied back shocking everyone that defeated their strongest swordsman here. Then I asked him a question telepathically saying \"Is Annabeth your girlfriend or something?\" Percy soon replied back saying\"No, she isn't. She likes Mitchell, one of the aphrodite kids.\" \"Well, who do you like then?\" I asked Percy soon had a smirk on his face saying, well he has long raven black hair, emerald green eyes that look like seafoam, he is light skinned, he is skinny, and he is a psychic.Can you guess?\" \"Me, You like me.\" I replied back only to have him say this\"how about this, I hope it will help.\" then Percy knocked away me sword as soon as everyone left the field, you got off of Percy then used your telekinesis to levitate him up from the ground do he could stand. Then we lefted the field to head down to the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

That's when I found out that this person was Nico and the curly auburn teenaged boy was named Grover. \"L-L-Lover, what do mean by that?\" I Stuttered \"Aww, you even stutter cute!\" Nico replied back and saying that the Oracle prophesied that the male Demi-god children of Posidon, Zeus, and Hades will find a male child of Apollo, that will become their eternal mate and help them become stronger than their original fathers.

It was a Saturday so their was no big rush to get out of bed. He laid there for a while letting the sun wash over his body. Finally with a great groan Percy heaved himself from bed. He had recently taken to just sleeping in his powder blue boxers which he now roughly scratched his junk through before scratching his rear. Was it his imagination, or was there a bit of a jiggle back there? Percy shook it off and started to get dressed. Percy pulled his blue jeans up, but he struggled a little to get them around his butt. \"I have a little more junk in the trunk than I used to\" thought Percy as he finally got his tight jeans buttoned. Next Percy pulled his orange camp half blood shirt over his. The size medium was a lot tighter and more form fitting than it used to be. Percy turned to look at himself in the mirror, his huge thighs were squeezed like sausages into his jeans and his slightly flabby chest filled out his shirt. The biggest difference in Percy though was his belly which was bulging out over his waistband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Percy thinks it's new Muscle or Does he Know he is getting fat?</span></div></div>",

He wasn't ashamed at all. He was curious.<br>\r\nTentatively, he slipped a hand under his gut (yeah, it was classified as a gut now). He heaved it upward, then quickly let it fall, watching in awe as it jiggled playfully.<br>\r\nOh gods. Did he actually like this?<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when the bulging globe itself gave a low rumble, as if saying, Hey, I'm hungry.

What's up?\"<br>\r\nWill shrugged as he easily caught up with him. \"Nothing much.

He placed a hand over the bulge, grinning playfully. \"What's this, Percy?\" He gave it two gentle pats, causing it to jiggle in response.<br>\r\nPercy's cheeks burned, tinted with scarlet. \"U-Um, nothing, Will.\"<br>\r\nWill chuckled, patting him on the back reassuringly. \"Don't worry about it, Perce. It actually looks really good on you, as strange as that might sound.\"<br>\r\nPercy's brows furrowed. \"Seriously? I'm... fat and you're saying I look good?\" He asked, bewildered.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it's not just me who thinks so. I mean,\" The blonde motioned around to nearby campers heading to the pavilion. \"Look, they're all looking at you, and they're practically drooling.\"<br>\r\nIt was true. All the other demigods were staring dreamily at their now-chubby hero.<br>\r\n\"Okay, look, all I'm going to say is, you look great, thin or chunky. It's up to you whether you want to stay this way, or go back to your old, lean self.\" Will finished, and without waiting for Percy to respond, sprinted off.<br>\r\nPercy had yet another decision to make.

He pulled out his normal attire (jeans, an orange Camp tee, and so on...) and threw them on. As he made his way to the door, he glanced at his mom's homemade blue cookies in a plastic container. Popping open the lid, he snatched a couple and practically moaned. They were so good\u2013 No, beyond just \"good.\" They were devilishly good. He was tempted to just ignore whoever was calling for him and finish off the whole tub of cookies. But sadly, he knew he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy breathed a sigh through his nose and moved to open the cabin door. His herald was revealed as Malcolm, who stood there and greeted him with an awkward 'good morning'. \"Chiron, um, needs to see you. He's in the Big House.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy gave a short nod, munching on the cookies. \"Okay, I'll just head there now.\" He stepped outside his cabin, but the son of Athena cried, \"Percy\u2013! You don't have... shoes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got socks on.\" Percy shrugged laxly in response, finishing off the cookies. \"Also, this probably isn't the worst I've walked on without shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy!\" Chiron clip-clopped into the room. \"I apologize for sending Malcolm to wake you up, but this is... somewhat important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mentor nodded gravely. \"Mr. D and I have... received information stating that a god or goddess may have cast a spell on the Camp as an act of revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what the spell is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron looked hesitant. \"We haven't figured it out yet, but we believe it isn't something major. Just\u2013\" He paused, his face a mask of concern and... something else Percy couldn't identify. \"Be careful, my boy? If you feel anything different or strange, tell someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shifted, suddenly feeling a bit guilty. \"Um, Chiron, I'm leaving today. Back to the city. For school.\" He sighed. \"I'm sorry, I can't help you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right, child.\" To his surprise, the centaur smiled gently. \"I, though, should be the one who's apologizing. We're dragging you into another problem. You've already done so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled in return, giving a small wave. \"It's fine, just give me updates, okay?\" He turned to walk away, but abruptly stopped. \"And I promise I'll Iris Message you right away if I feel sick, or anything different.\"</span></div></div>",

And just junk food in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he may or may not have gorged himself on whenever he could find, such as a pan of his mom's rich homemade brownies, a box of greasy pepperoni pizza, or tubs of Chinese food from that really good restaurant across the street...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, like usual, he didn't even realize he ate that much until he mindlessly reached for another, only to find nothing was left. He lay on his back, fingers massaging his swollen mass of a belly, ever so often forcing out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, when he knew he should've been full\u2013so full-his-stomach-should've-hurt full, his stomach still growled for more, somehow emptier than before the meal. So, he slowly stood up and walked into the kitchen, one hand massaging his middle while the other roamed the fridge for something. He discovered a gallon tub of chocolate ice cream, but he realized he needed a spoon after he sat down on his bed.

He threw the empty tub under his bed, ignoring his stomach's angry gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid back down, gently running his hands over his surprisingly taut, yet fleshy gut. Breathing a sigh of contentment out of his nose, he passed out into food sated slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy woke up to his mom in the hallway calling for him to get up. After a few minutes of blinking open bleary eyes and yawning, he reluctantly slid out of warm, comfy bed. He was surprised to feel slightly cooler air hit his legs, until he realized he had probably taken off his jeans during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauntering over dresser, he pulled out some clothes. He crammed a shirt on fairly easily, (though he could feel a small breeze hit his stomach), but his jeans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeans, gods. Once he managed to get them up his legs with several hops, they were practically suffocating his thighs. But when he tried to pull them up to his waist, there was an obstacle in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when Percy realized the obstacle was his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling incredibly puzzled, he stiffly walked to his vertical bathroom mirror (why did he even have one of those?), surveying his lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nearly choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs were huge, looking squeezed into the two or three sizes too-small jeans. They didn't touch each other though, so that was a good thing. His arms, too, were flabbier and thicker, jiggling slightly whenever he moved. His face was softer, too, with something that would soon turn into a double chin. But his belly by far had the most obvious change. It bulged out over his tight waistband, and pressed against his shirt, creating an outline of the round object. The fabric even rode up an inch, revealing a strip of tannish skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Percy whispered to himself. \"How did I let myself get this big?\" He lifted the shirt over his gut, causing it to bunch up. He poked the blob experimentally, letting out a small gasp. It was soft. So soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could also grab a handful of the jiggly flesh. Woah. This was weird. Percy...</span></div></div>",

Well, of course he's going to need lots of food, but what else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about lots of food, but you add in naps after meals?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's eyes lit up happily and a pleased grin sat on his lips after hearing an unknown voice offer advice in his mind. Naps would easily convert food to fat. He tilted his head down and examined his girth that bulged out a mere 5 inches over his extremely tight jean's waistband. He placed a palm on the soft globe, giving it a few small gentle pats. \"I'm going to stuff so much food into you.\" He spoke aloud to his belly. \"You better get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you better get ready, Perseus.

His eyes drooped sleepily as he patted his surprisingly taut gut.

Percy groaned, and yelled, \"Coming!\", heaving himself off the couch with a grunt. He waddled to the door, a hand attached to his gut, which jiggled with every step due to the gallon of soda he drank.

But hey, bonus points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason woke up thinking that this was harder than he'd anticipated. He was constantly uncomfortable and he wasn't seeing anything directly for it. At least Percy isn't doing any better, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy weighed himself after he stood up, not getting dressed yet. Wow! Almost 20 pounds in one night. He was gonna win this for sure. He slid a camp shirt on and was a bit disturbed when it didn't cover his gut and the sleeves squeezed his arms more than they had when he was muscled. His pants were the real issue. They went up to his thighs without much issue, but stopped there. It took a funny dance just to get them over his butt, and then they wouldn't zip up. He decided to leave it unzipped and just button it as best he could without crushing himself and headed out for breakfast. Annabeth had left him a note that he found on his way out. 'I won't be at breakfast or lunch today. Studying to do. XX -Wise Girl'. Perfect chance to pig out, Percy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't like how easily he fit into his clothes after it seemed like all he did was eat.

Lucky for him, he knew where the convenient stash in the Big House was. He grabbed a few large sizes and made it back to his cabin just before the button on his pants popped completely off. Instead of being embarrassed like he would normally be under the circumstances, Percy shed his old jeans (with much difficulty) and put on a size bigger. Even those were a bit tight, but he didn't want to spoil himself with the bigger ones. He replaced his shirt with a loose one so he didn't feel so squished around his midsection. Looking down, he saw the swell of his stomach below him and felt the pressure of two chins in his neck. His butt pressed against his pants with strength enough to make him nervous and his legs were trapped in the denim. The thickness of his arms is what got to him most, probably because that was the only bit of him not covered in fabric that he could see. They shook as he moved, and he didn't like it. Sweatshirt time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paced his room wondering how on earth the son of Poseidon had managed that he did. Not by pacing around and it eating, Jason thought.

Leo must've added some other things in the pills to help with that stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy woke up and felt like a blob. His boxers were leaving imprints in his waist and love handles formed over the gentle fabric. He felt his thighs pressed together as he stood up, and he had to wait for his mind to grasp that the extra weight he was carrying was his. He stepped on the scale and had annoying difficulty seeing the number last his biking stomach. He had gained something like 50 pounds in two days. Wow. Maybe today he could take a break. NO he couldn't allow Jason to catch up with him that easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy took a pill and proceeded to put on clothes that were two sizes larger than what he's worn the day before.

He was surprised at how much he would feel it weighing him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his pants off, almost resorting to cutting them when it took five minutes. The denim print was pressed into his legs which were even still burdened with intense stretch marks. His shirt came off with the sound of popping fabric in his ears. His stomach was rounded off with stretch marks as well. He winced and poked his belly as if to make sure it was real. His finger sunk into the warm squish and it jiggled. Jason quickly covered it with his massive shirt and squeezed on his larger jeans. He grabbed one pill from the stash he had taken from Percy and swallowed it, walking out to lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was already there when Jason arrived. He was shivering food into his mouth almost faster than he could true. Too many of the pills gave the feeling of intense starvation that didn't go away after you ate. He felt sick, like his growing stomach was emptying itself as soon as it was filled. His body swelled as it converted almost everything he ate into body mass. His stomach popped from under his shirt and the button flew off of his jeans with the pressure. His weight pushed himself into the seat at the table. Gravity felt like it had too much against him. He knew he should stop, this wasn't worth the bet. But he couldn't. He felt like his stomach was eating itself from hunger and he just couldn't stop. The magical food-supplying plates didn't help his restriction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat and ate about four times as much as he normally would, most of which was converted into fat for him. The stress on his pants was enough to pull the zipper down and make him uncomfortable, but the button stayed firmly in place.

Slightly embarrassed by his figure, he simply yelled out, \"Don't come in!!\" As he spoke, he felt his fat jiggle, and couldn't help the small smile that appeared on his face. <br>\r\n     \"Uh, Percy?\" The voice was Malcolm's, strong and clear and maybe a little bit confused. \"I just wanted to tell you that Piper and Annabeth are a bit\u2026 held up at Camp Jupiter and are probably going to stay there for another week or two.\" <br>\r\n     He paused, waiting for a response. When none came, he continued. \"Uh, just thought I might tell you.\" At the sound of footsteps walking away, Percy breathed a sigh of relief. As much as he missed Annabeth, he was a bit worried about how she would react, and knowing that it would be a while before he saw her again both tightened and relaxed his nerves.<br>\r\n     Percy was about to step on the scale when the box of pills caught his eye. Looking down, he was unsatisfied that he could see his feet, given he suck in a little. Walking towards the box, Percy felt his stomach rumble.<br>\r\n       \"Already?\" He said aloud in shock.

Reyna said they needed another.\" Jason shrugged. \"Ah, don't worry about it.\" Leo started laughing. \"Dude, he takes your job and your house, and all you say is 'don't worry about it'?!\" Jason looked at Leo. \"Does it really matter?\" he asked. \"Leo held his hands up in submission. \"Hey, don't blame me, it sounded funny.\" Frank gave Leo a high-five. \"You're great, man,\" he said to Leo.<br>\r\nThey walked into the restaurant and they quickly got a table.

It has every type of pasta in here, and because Jason and I are praetors, everything's free.\" Everyone nodded. Leo put on a fake Italian accent. \"Bring-a on-a de pasta!\" Then he and Frank started cracking up again.<br>\r\nThe waitress came up, and they ordered four Diet Cokes and the Pasta Platter Supreme. After a few minutes, the waitress came back with their sodas, and the pasta platter. \"Whoa,\" said Leo. \"That's a LOT of pasta.\" He wasn't lying. The platter had huge bowls filled with every type of pasta you can imagine. They all gapped at the platter. Finally, Percy picked up a bowl and put some Ziti on his plate. He forked some and put in his mouth. \"Oh, my gods,\" he said with his mouth full. \"This is the best pasta I've ever had!\" Every one else tried some too, and they all agreed. They filled their bowls with as much assorted pasta as possible, and then chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Percy leaned back from the table. \"I am stuffed!\" he declared. Leo burped in agreement. \"I can't eat another bite!\" Frank cradled his swollen stomach. \"I can't believe we ate it all!\" Jason hiccuped. \"But it was -hic!- so good!\" Each of them sported a rounded out stomach. The waitress walked over to drop the dessert menu on the table. Percy picked it up and saw something called a \"Baklava Sundae Platter.\" \"Waitress!\" he called. \"Can a get a small sample of this?\" She came back with a small spoon with a little honey colored pastry and soft-serve ice cream. \"He tasted it. \"Oh, wow, this is good.\" Jason moaned. \"Oh, don't tell me you're going to eat more?\" Percy ordered the Baklava Sundae Platter. \"Yep, you are,\" Jason answered himself. \"No,\" said Percy. \"So are we.
