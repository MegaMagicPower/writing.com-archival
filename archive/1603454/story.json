Mikenopa went out of bed in the most exciting from of sitting up that he could imagine, \"supa coola dance PARTY\" as he would call it. He stretched his arms up, opened his mouth as wide ad can be, breathed in, and calmly, smoothly, YELLED AT  THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS, \"PUCA PUCA DANCA PARTY PUCA PUCA DANCA PARTY.\" After a tiring five minutes of yelling, he decided that he should stand up and do something. Mikenopa stood up, opened his door and....oops my bad, I forgot to introduce my self. I am the narrator of this story I may or may not be in it, but I can tell you this, I am Meekehapa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, so now where where we? Aw yes here it is, Mikenopa opening the door. Mikenopa opened his medal door, the only door in the room that imprisoned him in a very tight are, scaring him and causing him terrible nightmares. But he's to manly to recall any of it, oh Mikenopa was a true man. He looked out his doorway and saw that his dog had not yet woken up, but he didn't recall having a dog, so it didn't really bother him much. Mikenopa crawled to his basement and saw there was a note on his door. Grabbing it he the repeated on eating it, and finally coughing it up to read it. He read, \"Wear RED shirt and BLUE pants to diner.\" Mikenopa got dressed and put on..... I'm going to let you decide this one for me, what did he wear? </span></div></div>",

A light square outlining is barely seen on the dining floor. Mikenopa, being the true man he is, he bravely opens up the hatch to discover his dining room, with breakfast sitting on the table.  Eggs, toast, sausage, yum.  No one was to be seen though.<br>\r\nMikenopa eats all of the food in one bite. Aw, awight. Mikenopa opens a door in the room.  a flood of light comes through and the outdoors reveals itself. \"HEUHEUAHEUAHUEAHUEAH IT TIME GO TO THE PARK YES!!\" he yells and runs outside, falling off his deck, not realising its there.  He gets up and runs even faster, and runs into his tree.  He gets up again, and runs, and then hits his fence.  \"OKAYE MAYBE I SHUD WALK YES?\"</span></div></div>",
