Of course, Ganondorf knew differently - if he was here, then of course that boring peace wouldn't last much longer.  Not after he had escaped his last imprisonment.  Hyrule would pay, once he had the power of the Tri-Force...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger welled up in his heart.  He thought of that boy that had defeated him in the first place.  He knew that if he didn't strike first, Link would send him back to his hellish prison and it would be back to scraping his way out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf needed a way to keep the Hero from acting against him.  The most obvious method, of course, would be to kill him.  That was difficult - his army was far too small to tear up the kingdom to find one boy.  There was also the matter of Link still possessing the Tri-Force of Courage.  They could well wind up at a stalemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first - he'd need to find Link in the first place.  He looked into his magic mirror - every villain had one these days.  \"Find the Hero of...oh, just find Link!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black magic of the mirror swirled around until it found its target...</span></div></div>",

It gave her small comfort that Link's appetite was unhindered by whatever strange event had affected him.  But still, the look of pain on his face haunted her.  It couldn't be \"nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link,\" Zelda said, \"I still can't get over what happened.  Could you try to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, Link did not stop eating when Zelda spoke.  She was somewhat annoyed - here she was, worried about him, and he was too busy cramming food into his face to worry about it.  She looked up at him angrily and examined him curiously as he continued to eat.  Zelda noticed that his face appeared just a little bit fuller, that his chin appeared rounder, and that his clothing looked tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she thought it was her imagination, but as she watched Link continue to eat, she was struck with the realization that he was fattening up right in front of her.  The impossible was happening - Link was putting on weight!  Not only was it showing, but it was as though with every bite of food he swallowed, his girth was increasing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, Zelda watched him transfixed, as though she were hypnotized by Link's expansion.  His tunic began straining at the seems, the stitching around his sleeves peeling back to reveal bits of soft flesh and his chest puffing out as his pecs filled with additional weight.  A second chin was taking shape on his face.  From Zelda's seat, it was hard to see his stomach, but she thought she saw the tablecloth beginning had started lifting around Link's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snapping noise broke Zelda of her trance as something flew through the air.  She stood up and walked over to where the object had landed.  Behind a white marble pillar was all that remained of Link's belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!  Stop eating!\" Zelda yelled to him, running over to the expanding hero of time and trying to wrestle his food from him.</span></div></div>",

The bowl slipped from her delicate fingers and flew over her head, shattering against the wall behind her. &lt;P&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with that clatter that Link finally broke out of his glazed expression.&lt;P&gt;<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"-Huh?! Oh... A thousand apologies, Zelda.. Were you saying something?\"&lt;P&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stood beside him panting heavily from frantic concern and utter confusion. He was more than twice his original size! Roughly 210, if she had to guess.<br>\r\n\"S-say... -saying something?!\" she stammered. \"W-what's happened to you?! Look at yourself!\"&lt;P&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a sight it was. It was as though someone had used a set of bellows to pump him up a few tunic sizes. His face had taken on a more cherubic quality, round and full with a cleary defined double chin. The rips in his sleeves revelaed the soft, white flesh that had puffed up over his biceps. His knees were slightly dimpled, all leg muscles tucked away under a soft layer of fat. Even his rear had become wider and thicker to the point where it took up the entire seat easily. But most impressive of all was his new belly. Rising and falling with each breath, it pressed out against his green tunic in the most triumphant way, uninhibited by the leather belt that had given up the ghost not moments before. &lt;P&gt;<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLink innocently blinked at Zelda. Goodness, she seemed awfully flustered. &lt;P&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda.. Dear. You need to calm down,\" he gently cooed, resting his now chubby hand on her shoulder.&lt;P&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm- Calm d-? Cal- ... OUU!\" She stormed off to her chambers in a tissy fit, leaving poor bewildered Link at the table. She KNEW there was cause for worry when he had collapsed in pain during target practice! Why didn't he head her words?! This was the work of a disgruntled enemy bent on revenge, no doubt. And she had just the notion of who.  &lt;P&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink watched his dearly beloved companion ragefully rush off. He wanted to try and console her... but HE seemed to be the thing she was mad at. That, and he was still famished. He reached over to the platter of fruit on the table and began to idly pop grapes into his mouth. &lt;P&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that blinding pain had hit him earlier, he found that food tasted far better than it usd to: meats were more tender and smelled irresistable; fruits seemed to simply explode with gushes of sweet juice; ciders and ales left a tingling, warm sensation in his belly; and pastries, which he had never had too much of a fondness for, were now a welcomed creamy delgiht.&lt;P&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink kept eating and eating, his plump body starting to slowly swell again, until suddenly....&lt;P&gt;</span></div></div>",

Then the food finally arrived and Zelda mumbled, \"I'll plump you up yet.\"  Link quickly ate his sandwhich while the princess merely nibbled at hers.  Then she started giving link her bowl of mash potatoes and after that her big plate pork loin. Noticing that Link's stomach was puffing out more got her even more into it.  She didn't want to play games anymore and knew he had a temptation to eat so she just made sure he didn't think about it so it could just take it's role on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda started rubbing his bigger more rounded belly and while this happened he kept drinking and eating until it was stuffed completely.  This got Zelda too excited where all she could do was feel it.  Zelda told Link they should stay in this town for the night and quickly ran off for a hotel being excited about what to do that night.  Link would've chased after her but was too exhausted and all he do was stare at this new plump part of him. </span></div></div>",

So what if he put on a pound or two? He didn't need to be in peak physical condition; Hyrule was safe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link's finger circled around his belly button, he contemplated what to eat for breakfast. He was hoping for a large meal, since he always loved eating a lot first thing in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Link heard the door to his bedroom open. It was Zelda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'morning, Princess.\" said Link, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Link!\" she replied. She sat herself down beside him on the bed. \"I hope you recovered from last night.\" Zelda then gave Link's bare belly a soft rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Link said shyly, trying to cover up his belly with the silk blanket. Just then, a rumble came out of his midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want breakfast?\" asked Zelda. But before he could answer, Zelda snapped her fingers. Several servants came into the bedroom with trays filled with tons of food! They had eggs, ham, bacon, orange juice, whole milk and a variety of other breakfast foods! The servants set down the trays on the bed and walked out, shutting the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was drooling at the sight. Zelda picked up a plate that held a giant stuffed omelet. She held out a forkfull in front of Link's mouth. \"Open wide...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, every plate was empty. Zelda had fed all of the food to Link; she was pleased with herself. Link, on the other hand, was stuffed full. His belly was nearly spherical and was tight.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link entered his bedchamber in Hyrule Castle and sat on the edge of his bed. His head was still cloudy from the pang, in what can only be described as a bout of vertigo. He placed his head down softly onto the pillow, as sudden movements caused his head to spin. He stared up at the lush fresco on the ceiling and watched as the familiar faces spun around, faded in and out of focus and seemed to melt off the roof. He gently closed his eyes, promising himself that he was only resting his eyes, not sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, he was soon fast asleep. Supper had been laid next to his bed several hours ago by the help. Zelda now stood over him, her hands clasped together, watching him, hoping he was alright. There was a cold sweat over his brow, matting his light hair to his forhead. She wiped his forehead with her handkerchief and left the room quietly. The sound of the door closing awoke Link from his slumber. He was still slightly dizzy, so he took some water and sat up in the bed, holding his head in his hands. He wiped the hair from his forehead and propped himself against the wall. The tingling sensation from several hours ago had returned and began to feel as though someone was rubbing a silk sheet all over his body. His tunic began to feel tight. He looked down and saw a roundness to his form he had not noticed before. More astounding was the fact that it seemed to be expanding before his very eyes. His belt began to hold tighter and tighter and he realised that he was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" Link stammered. His stomach was actually growing outwards. He watched in astonishment as he continued to grow and the bright green fabric covering his body pulled tighter and tighter over his thickening chest and stomach. His torso was blowing up as though he had spent the last week feasting constantly. Too astonished to move, he lay back moaning to himself \"What is this? Awaken, Link, awaken!\" The seams of the tunic began to pull apart at the side and his stomach stopped growing. He looked like a stuffed sausage in his little green tunic. He looked down at himself and realised he must take the belt off, or risk being cut in half. He fiddled with the buckle, unable to see it over his newfound waistline. He rubbed his hands over his body, wondering what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was not over yet. The tingling sensation moved from his torso to his arms, which also began to expand, stretch and grow. Link panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" He cried, \"Stop!\" His arms pushed away from his body as they grew. The soft white hose began to run and his hands inside his leather gauntlets began to squeeze against the fabric. There was a loud snapping noise and Link looked at his arms to see the hose fall away in shreds from his former muscled arms. While this was happening, the sensation spread to the rest of his body. His legs and his face began to expand. Was he going to pop? What was to happen? No, but his limbs grew until they were the size of the rest of his body. He looked in astonishment at his hands, his arms, his legs and stomach. He had expanded amazingly. His clothes were creaking under the pressure of his larger body, ready to burst at any second. He touched what was once his bicep to find out what had happened. Link was unsure if he was filled with air, water or if he had simply fattened up.  As far as he could tell, he had gained weight. He had gained about fifteen pounds of fat in the past few minutes. The tingling sensation faded away, the dizziness subsided and Link relaxed against the wall, his head still reeling in awe of the situation. He closed his eyes and drew a breath. On expelling the breath, he, almost instantly, seemed to add another ten pounds to his already larger frame. His tunic, which was now skintight, split open. His undershirt tore it's buttons from their holes and his gauntlets tore along the sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes now in shreds around him, Link looked at his body. What now?</span></div></div>",

His biceps, once toned to a perfect degree from all his years of swordsmanship and archery were now soft, as were his legs, as if he'd only lounged around eating the past few years of his life, instead of running throughout Hyrule and dodging enemy attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, worst of all was his tomach and chest. His once fine and attractive pectoral and abdominal muscles had completely disappared, his abs replaced by a rather generous beginning belly that flopped over his loincloth and jiggled this way and that when he walked. As for his chest- he was beginning to develop breasts! No longer manly in appearance, Link's pectorals now drooped slightly as the fat had accumulated there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, Link poked his belly, watching as the action caused his now rather flabby stomach to vibrate. Then even more carefully, Link inhaled as he had before, then exhaled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his slight horror, and slight curiosity, Link watched in the mirror as he put on weigh again- though this time to a lesser extent. The growth stared short of five pounds, luckily, though it was enough to give his \"breasts\" a more rounded look as well as make his loincloth all the more tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it was that did this to me...its stopping at least for now.\" Link said in an attempt to comfort himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, he didn't really look fat, or at least, not as fat as King Zora, or Talon, or Darunia, at least. He actually looked like someone who had been fit once and had then had been chained down and force fed fattening foods for a few months. He was still tan, at least, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The question is what...or who.\" Link muttered, his eyes narrowing as thoughts of Ganondorf and his many minions came to mind. \"But how am I going to fix this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrimarily, Link needed to find a way out of the castle, or at least to a more private location. And for that he needed some clothes. While it might have caused a bit of a tizzy if he had went out in nothing but a loincloth before, now it would most likely only elicit screams...or people fainting, perhaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, if he was to leave the castle, he'd need to decide where to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Link felt his body over again. It felt...different, to say the least. Maybe a hot bath would help him sort out his problems?</span></div></div>",

It actually concealed his chubby body, which was a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He snuck out of his room and made his way down the grand hall.  He could feel the layer of chub bouncing while he walked.  Lucky for him, his reputation as a hero meant that the guards weren't obligated to guard him, so the hall was empty.  He finally found the bathroom and opened the door.  A light steam filled the room, and the always warm bath bubbled in the centre of the room.  Link locked the door and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Can't have anyone finding me like this...\" Link said while dropping the robe.  He pulled off his hat and settled into the warm water.  The thoughts of his newfound chub faded a bit as he relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ganondorf had just finished supper,and decided it was time to check on the hylians progress.  He entered his chambers and pulled out the dark mirror again, waving his hands over it, he saw Link pulling off his bathrobe and hat.  Sure enough, the hero had a small belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why would he be taking a bath at a time like this?\" Ganondorf chuckled.  \"He's either not very bright, or hasn't noticed yet.  Well... I'll make him notice.\"  He began to laugh.  Once he had finished, he prepared himself.  Ganondorf chanted, and waved his hand before the mirror.  The triforce of power began to glow on his hand again.  \"Time to become a hero of considerable substance, hylian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Link was sloped low into the hot bath, he let out a deep sigh.  What was he going to do to get rid of the new stomach?  While he lay in the bath, he felt a tingling go across his body...this felt familiar, and it caused him to get up with a start. Then, he felt it begin again, the tingling gave way to a swelling feeling. Link looked through the surface of the water, and his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  His slight stomach was bowing out, swelling.  His pectorals were softening.  His thighs and arms too!  He clamoured out of the water to see what was happening.  His body jiggled as he got to his feet.  His loincloth was tightening, he looked down, seeing his belly and chest swelling.  He looked in the mirror on the wall, his backside had grown considerably!  He lifted his arms to see his sides.  Love handles were growing on his hips, and rolls were bunching at his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  His once lean thighs were pushed together.  His legs were thick now.  His stomach was pushed out far in front of him, and folded at the hips a bit.  His hips had widened, and his tight chest had become round and soft.  Link attempted to run to the mirror, but was forced to waddle, making his body sway and quake.  He examined his face.  His once strong jawline was replaced by a soft rounded curve, and his cheeks had filled out.  The fattening soon stopped, leaving Link at just under 300 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh no!  I knew I shouldn't have taken that bath!  What am I going to do now?\"  Link groaned as he grasped his gut... he was very uncomfortable in his too small loincloth now.  Then a thought occured to him... what if this happens again?  How big would he end up?!  \"I need to fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He grabbed his robe and tried to pull it closed, but his body was far too big for it now.<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Ganondorf sat back in his chair, laughing.  The hero was getting pretty husky...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Now, what to do....\" Ganondorf scratched his chin.  \"I suppose I could let him squirm a bit and try to find a way to slim down....\"  He grinned  \"Or I could put some pounds on him right now...\"</span></div></div>",

Any pound Link lost, Ganon would replace it with 2... or 3... well, 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Link gave up on the robe and tossed it aside.  He pulled his hat back on and slowly opened the bathroom door to see if anyone was up.  The hallway was empty, so Link made his way down the hallway, waddling back to his bedroom.  Each heavy step caused his body to quake and jiggle.  He panted heavily as he made his way down.  Yesterday, he could run the length of Hyrule Field without so much as breaking. a sweat, but now he couldn't make it down a hallway without losing his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He made it back without being seen, and decided he needed to get out of the castle.  He gathered his things, none of the clothes could be used aside from his boots and his gauntlets. The belt that used to drape over his shoulder to hold his sword no longer fit that way, but it  managed to just fit his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Now it was time to go... but he couldn't  He was still in a loincloth.  When he was thin, this wouldn't have seemed like such a problem because he would have been quick enough to duck out of sight if he were seen.  In this new body though, he'd be lucky to be quicker than King Zora moving over on his throne.  Link looked in the closet again, if he found a robe this time, maybe there was a bigger one in here.  Instead, he found a long dark cloak that fastened at the neck and had a hood.... it'd do until he could ge something to cover himself now.  Link threw it on and made his way to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He stood on a trunk underneath the window, which groaned under his increased weight, and his belly pushed into the stone wall keeping him held away slightly.  After some efford, Link managed to reach the window and climb up.  His hips jammed in the window on the way through, but after some effort, he managed to pop out and climb down the outer wall to the castle moat below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Okay... just gotta do what I used to when I was a kid.  The guards out here are pretty easy to slip by.\"  He took a few steps forward, causing his belly to stick out of the cloak.  \"Well, it was easy when I was skinny...  This might be a bit harder.\"  Link scans the area one more time and sees a broken grate at the other end of the moat...  That might be the safest route in this body.  Link nods to himself, his mind made up, and waddles off into the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After squeezing his chubby body down the tube for what felt like ages, Link finally sees light, and drops down into a pool of water.  When he emerges, he sees he's in....</span></div></div>",

He'd let him adventure here for a while before putting another wave out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------ <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Link sputtered out water and looked around.  He was in the Zora domain. He swam to the edge of the water, which was an odd sensation in a fat body.  He pulled his bulging frame onto the rocky platform at the waters edge and stood up.  His cloak was soaked, hanging heavy, forming over every curve of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He looked around quickly to see if any Zora were about, but it seemed that they were all away at the moment.  Link sighed in relief that no one would spot him like this.  Link waddled away from the water and made his way for the exit to the domain.  If he got out to Hyrule Field, he could travel unnoticed.  He found the ladder to the upper levels and attempted to climb, but his belly kept him from getting flush to the wall.  It took a while, but he finally managed to get up to the top.  Just as he was making his way through the door, He felt an impact, and fell backwards onto his butt, causing his body to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He looked forward, and sitting on the ground in front of him, rubbing their head, was a friend of his.  A young Zora named Rikki.  Rikki was a friend that Link met when he would come to visit Princess Ruto while he was still a child, he also helped Link stay in practice by being a sparring partner.  Rikki stopped rubbing his head and looked up.  His eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Link!?\" Rikki shouted, getting up slightly.  \"What happened to you?!\"  Rikki prodded Link's generous gut.<br>\r\nLink turned red, he wanted to explain, but he couldn't really think of what was going on.  \"I.. I don't know.  I was at Zeldas today, and I just started blowing up.  At first, it was just a few pounds, but now I'm stuck in this blimped out body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'll say you are.\"  Rikki rubbed his head again. \"Do you know how it happened?\"  Link shook his head.  \"No.  Like I said... it just... kinda.... \"  Link trailed off... he was feeling weird again.  The tingling spread across his body.  Link grasped his belly, just to feel it swell again.  Rikki's jaw dropped while he watched Link fatten before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh no!\"  Link grunted, trying vainly to hold his belly in.  His belly inflated, his chest grew, his arms and legs thickened more and more.  He could hear groaning and popping.  His eyes widened when he realized what it was and he wrapped the cloak over his midsection to hide what was going to happen.  His loincloth burst open, leaving him without a shred of his old clothes.  He continued to grow for a few minutes.  He was massive now at 370.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rikki was speechless for a few moments, seeing his Hylian friend inflate in front of him like that.  Link finally piped up.  \"Rikki, you need to help me find some clothes.  Something stretchy so I won't burst out of it if this happens again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Of course.  I think we have some tunics that were made for Zora's like the King.  Come on, we gotta do something before Ruto sees you.\"  Rikki said as he helped pull Link to his feet.  He ran ahead, unintentionally, since Link was forced into a waddle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When Link finally caught up, Rikki was digging through his shop store room.  Some very large Tunics piled on the table, yet Rikki was still looking.  \"What else are you trying to find?\"  Link asked while grabbing one of the tunics.  \"I remembered this book that was brought in by a travelling Gerudo Merchant that was filled with spells that altered the body.  Maybe someone else has one of the books and made you fat... so I figured....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That there might be a spell to make me lean again?\" Link cut in.  Rikki laughed \"Exactly.  Maybe not as lean as me, but at least something to help you manage it till you find a way to get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Ganondorf wasn't pleased that a Gerudo would be selling artifacts like that...  well, no matter.  He was a far stronger warlock than that scrawny Zora could be.   Now a new decision came before him... should he let them think they'd found a way to fix Link?  Or... should Rikki join Link in obesity for trying to ruin his plan?</span></div></div>",

Flipping through the pages casually, Rikki issued forth a slow whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for us that most Hyrulian languages descended from a common root language, huh?\" The zora casually propped himself up against Link, much to the obese hero's ire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, just because I'm softer than ever before is no reason for you to go around treating me like...like some larf-filled pillow!\" Link replied tersely, bitterly noting that he could really do nothing to make the swifter, and obviously slimmer Zora, listen to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken, but when will I ever have such an opportunity again?\" Rikki laughed, \"My, my. This is rather interesting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's interesting?\" Link asked, glancing down at his amphibian friend. \"Please tell me you've found a spell to reverse or stop all of this weight piling onto me. Or both. Both also works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I havn't found any spell here like that yet, I was just noticing how Gerudo magic lives up to it's name.\" Rikki said, \"Hylian magic is well-rounded, whereas Zora magic is purely elemental, as it draws its power from the forces of water and electricity. Gorons, in terms of magical ability, they're very weak, but most of their spells are fire or earth based. Forest magic is almost completely benign, being of a healing or protectory nature. Gerudo magic, though...Gerudo magic is perhaps the most mysterious magic in all of Hyrule, given that Sheikah magisters are nearly a dead breed. It's been rumored that, while powerful, Gerudo magic comes at an extensive price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that lecture was wonderful, really Rikki, I was enthralled, but if you havn't noticed, I'm probably the most obese Hylian in all of Hyrule and I would like to have the problem remedied. Soon, if possible.\" Link droned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fault me for warning you.\" Rikki tsked, \"When it comes to magic, leaping before looking is a surefire way to get yourself killed, maimed, or for all intents and purposes, worse off than when you began.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really see how I could end up worse, but you're the mage here, not me.\" Link retorted, rolling his eyes, but knowing it to be true. Some people - Zelda, Rikki, or even to an extent, Malon - were mages. Link was not one of them. His capacity to wield magic was equivalent to that of a Goron's, limiting him to a few spells granted to him by Great Fairies and a few minor magical sword tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here...weight, weight, weight....ah, here we are...hmm. There's a spell here that would cut your weight into fourths.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, let's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The consequences being you, yourself, would be cut into fourths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's another...transferral of weight to another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Rikki, I don't suppose you would be willing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The weight doesn't transfer smoothly, it just all pops on at once. In other words, the unlucky victim's skin explodes and they bleed to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bedamned Gerudo, have they no spells that aren't fatal?!\" Link nearly shouted, his face turning a violent red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be patient. This spellbook contains thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of spells. Finding one that meets your particular predickament could take days.\" Rikki adomonished, \"...or not. Link, I think I just found a section of spells that may solve your problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gatask de Floraj, or Floodgate Spell. It will return you to your former shape, but the weight will trickle back at an ever increasing pace. Consequences: A loss of strength that multiplies as the weight trickles back. Similar to it is the Lune Peseta, or Lunar Coin spell. This spell...\" Rikki paused and blinka several times, \"Weird. It's kind of like a werewolfos deal. This spell returns you to your former weight as well, but only during the day. As the day goes on, you'll slowly fatten up until you reach your maximum weight at midnight, but then slim down until you reach peak physical shape at dawn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's eyebrowed raised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is weird...what are it's consequences?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...while it says here that it's a spell, it actually acts more closely to a curse. Unless you can find who or what's causing you to randomly balloon up...\" Rikki gulped, \"Unless you find them, and have them reverse or remove whatever they've done to you, the effects of the Lunar Coin spell are permanent. That's the only drawback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pretty damn big one, though, if you ask me.\" Link retorted, \"But...even being trapped in a loop between being fit and fat is better than being this size constantly....were there any other spells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were two others listed with the Floodgate and the Lunar Coin spells. \"The Feder Aveoja, or...Iron Will Spell, I think it translates too. Like the other spells, it also returns you to your physical best.\" Rikki held up a webbed finger for emphasis, \"What's more is that it returns you to that form indefiniately, but the price is terrible hunger. You'll want to eat, and eat, and then eat some more - and whatever you do eat will, in a few seconds, be reflected in your weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last spell is...honestly, I wouldn't reccomend it. The spellbook doesn't offer much of a decription. In fact, all it says is \"Problem solved, problem created. Sick of home, sick for home. A solution and a mistake. The Rejasales, or Reversal spell. I'm guessing it'll work like the others but...like I said, it's too unclear to trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's your choice to make. I could look for other spells, but that would take time - something you probably don't need to watse.\" Rikki finished, and looked up at Link. \"What spell do you want to try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink thought, and mentally elimanated two spells. He was definately going with either the...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Always wearing a green tunic and cap, an born with blond hair, he is the one destined to overcome evil.  However...\" she paused, looking up at Link.  \"It is foretold that in one incarnation of this Hero, the forces of evil will change his body so that it so it would become much larger and heavier, even beyond what is possible of a normal Hylian, until that evil were to be defeated and the curse to remain for the rest of that incarnation's lifetime.  It seems we've finally seen it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I had defeated Ganondorf... Why did I see him just a few hours ago, before he made me this big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a projection of the last ounce of his soul energy before he finally enforced the remainder of the curse,\" the old woman explained.  \"As he increased your weight immensely, so that it became what it is now, he also made it so that no matter how hard you tried, you would not be able to lose it, even with the use of magic.  I'm sorry to break this to you, but you will never be thin again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sighed, looking down at his immense belly, which occupied most of his vision.  He no longer was able to stand on his own two feet, and even his tunic, which was already extremely large, was exhibiting some very large rips.  But if he was never going to be lighter than this again, he didn't know what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been a prophecy carried down in history from the early ages of our race,\" continued the old woman, \"that this profoundly overweight Hero of Time should become our ruler.  The fatter he becomes, the greater our people will thrive, simple as that.  And, because of your curse, it's even possible for you to get even fatter than you are now, with no threat to your own health.  Simply put, there is no limit to how fat you can get, and thus no limit to what our people shall be able to achieve.  So what do you say, hero?  Will you become our monarch?\"</span></div></div>",

Fried cucco wings, mashed poe-tatoes, octorock soup, the lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had the food been placed on the table, Link dug in, ravenously tearing apart any and all food in his way. He didn't bother with knives or forks, instead shovelling it down his throat with his bear hands. There was not a moment that Link was not chewing or swallowing his food. It was as if he hadn't eaten for weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the spell foretold, Link's stomach began to expand. At first it wasn't noticeable but soon Link's tunic went from being baggy to fitting him perfectly to stretching. A rather large bulge was beginning to show beneath his tunic. Link paid no mind to the ever expanding orb. Soon it began to slow down as the round mass clashed with his belt. It seemed to grind to a halt as the belt quivered, unable to contain Link's growing stomach. Any regular person would have slowed down or stopped to relieve the pain they would be experiencing. Link, however, didn't notice, firmly transfixed on satisfying his complaining stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne plate later and it could take no more. The belt burst open, the buckle shooting off and embedding itself within the bottom of the table. Link's gut surged forward now free of restraint. His tunic was no longer held down by the belt and began hiking it's way up his body. By the time Link was halfway finished with the food, his tunic could no longer reach any further than his belly button if pulled down. Instead, it sat atop his prize gut which was beginning to give even Hyrule's fattest a run for their money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf laughed. The hero, reduced to a pig. It was extra hilarious that Link didn't even notice his belt flying off. He noticed Link began slowing down though with still a quarter of the food left to go. While he may not be able to control Link, he used his magic to place a hypnotic suggestion in Link's mind hoping the dim-witted hylian would listen to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink began feeling full. He wanted to stop when a thought entered his head, \"Finish it all, go on, it couldn't hurt.\" Link wasted no time and began picking up his pace again, determined to wipe every last plate clean. He ate twice as fast as before, causing his stomach to expand twice as fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Link had finished, he lay back, absent mindedly rubbing his overly stuffed gut. It was as big as if not bigger than it was a few hours ago. When he took a moment to look down, he was shocked at the damage. It looked like he had swallowed a few basketballs or been force fed for a month or two. He attempted to pull down his tunic which couldn't even go a quarter of the way down his round gut. He was lucky the chair he was sat on was made from metal or else it would have collapsed long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink attempted to stand up before realising he couldn't. It took the help of 4 staff members to get him up on his feet. The staff gave him a room upstairs and helped him up to it so he could sleep off his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the staff had left Link alone in his new room. He fell forwards, unable to balance his newfound weight. He found his belly supported him. His current position left him unable to reach the floor though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough some trouble, Link managed to climb into the bed which fell to the floor under his weight. He lay belly-up and gently massaged the huge orb in instinct. He found the sensation of rubbing his stuffed stomach pleasing if not down-right heavenly. He was lost in the sensation, moaning in delight. Perhaps being big wasn't so bad after all if it meant this feeling afterwards. As Link rubbed the orb he fell into sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Watching the Hylian sleep, Ganondorf laughed. Link had struggled so much to climb into his bed due his increased weight. Seeing how off-balanced and un-natural Link looked with his stuffed ball gut made Ganondorf laugh even harder. In fact, being off-balanced might be more rewarding than it seemed. If Link was unable to stand upright, there was no possible way he could defeat him again. Satisfied with his plan, Ganondorf cursed Link once more. This curse made all fat Link gained go directly to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell had worked. Link muscles gained a bit of definition as his gut grew larger with the already accumulated fat. Despite his strengthened muscles, the extra weight in-front of the hylian was more than capable of nullifying it. Ganondorf waited for Link to wake up and resume his binging as the ball began slowly expanding as his previous meal digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink awoke to a strange gurgling noise. He was hungry. Very hungry. He needed to satisfy his stomach. Now. As he struggled to sit up, he thought his stomach looked somehow bigger than last night. He must be imagining things besides, he thought rubbing his distended stomach, he had more urgent matters to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling downstairs as fast as his gut would allow him, Link noticed none of the staff were there yet. They wouldn't mind if Link made himself a 'snack,' would they? His stomach growled as if to agree with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRummaging around the cupboards and fridges, Link found enough food to satisfy him for the next month even with his increased appetite but also noticed a strange bottle filled with an odd purple liquid. He didn't recognise it. It wasn't labelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink grabbed the bottle. It was cold but not freezing to the touch. It could satisfy his stomach's hunger but it could also have disastrous side effects. He could also just down the mountains of food but he could be missing out on something great with the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf looked at the bottle in the Hylian's hand. If he drank it, Ganondorf could take advantage of it. But did Link drink it?</span></div></div>",

A small drop was added to the food putting the customers mind into an unconsciously suggestive state. When the waiter would ask them if they would like anything else, they would order something else due to the potions effects. It was even added to the food Link ate the previous night which caused him to obey Ganondorf's command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Link, had downed the entire bottle.

He could send Link to devastate Hyrule as none had ever defeated the hero. Hyrule would be under his command. The princess would weep in fear and horror if she saw her hero protecting the Demon king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpying the pile of food on the corner of his view of Link, Ganondorf got new idea. Link had humiliated Ganondorf by defeating him. It seemed only fitting that he humiliate Link in return. He could have Link gorge himself on all the food he could find. Once the green pig was fat enough, Ganondorf could show the hero to Hyrule and let the people see how their warrior has fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The effects of this spell are, according to this spellbook, permanent.\" Rikki sighed and massaged his cerulean foreheard, \"I may have said something incorrectly earlier, let me look over the spell one more time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. I did make one small error. It's not at dawn you'll be at your physical peak, it's noon. A small translation error on my part, but that doesn't lessen the gravity of performing this spell.\" Rikki noted, \"Summarily, at noon every day you'll be at your best - as fit as you were before all this started. As noon slowly approaches the midnight hour, you'll fatten up until you reach your current size...or larger. Finishing up the cycle, the midnight the noon period will be one where you'll be slimming down...and you're sure this is the spell you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Floodgate spell inhibits my power, but the spellbook doesn't explain how it inhibits my power, or to what extent it does so. That's too risky, I think. The Iron Will spell...no matter what size I am or what spell we use, I'm going to have to eat. A spell that converts food to fat so quickly would have me at this size again in a week or more. As for the Reversal spell, like you say, it's too much of a question mark to be deemed as safe. The Lunar Coin spell...as so long as I find whoever's doing this to me - and I will find them - and make sure to confront them when I'm still fairly powerful, I'll be fine.\" Link reasoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikki was shaking his head back and forth, but then sighed exasperatedly. He chuckled lightly once or twice before giving Link a wry grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the only guy I know who would pick the spell with a permanent side effects. But, then again, you are the holder of the Triforce of Courage, and you must be channeling Wisdom to an extent, because your reasoning sticks. I'll perform the Lunar Coin spell if it's your choice.\" Rikki brought the spell book up to his chest and gave Link a final look. \"This will be your last chance to back out though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink grinned, celebrating inwardly that in a few moments, he would be fit again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, please.\" Link said, calmly. \"Should I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay standing as you are, make no sudden movements, and under no circumstances interrupt me after I've begun the spell. Adhere to those three rules and everything should proceed smoothly.\" Rikki replied, \"I'll be starting in just a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded, and a moment later, the magical words began flowing from Rikki's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O pyraja Dinne, o narahen Dinne, lesamitu pyrnn. Enajaren esone et Lune Peseta, et cujask dehos! Hen coropo, dofaren, hen coropo, lifiren....\" Link listened as Rikki continued chanting, the Gerudo words flowing fluidly off of his tongue, as he became acutely aware of a magical tension building around him. \"...Bet pyrnnde Dinne, makaraso!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Link felt as if Farore herself had descended upon Link, a raging tempest of fury. The horrible spinning sensation left Link after a moment or two, leaving him in the strangest pain he'd ever felt in his life; he likened it to an octorok being attached to his stomach and rapidly sucking out all of the fat. For, indeed, Link did feel himself becoming thinnner. He felt the skin tightening around his face as he lost his second chin. His legs and rear shrunk, and the agony of wearing a painfully small loincloth lessened, and then disappeared. The excess fat from around his arms was peeled away like the husk of an orange, revealing the tight, bulging arm muscles underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down in amazement, Link watched as his chest slowly deflated from a pair of sagging breasts, only to pooch out again, but this time as a set of clearly defined pectoral muscles. The painful sensation of feeling as if he was being mauled by an octorok had begun to abate as his belly had shrunk and as Link had felt power return to his body in a welcome flood. Moving more slowly now, the magic ate away at his belly, now only slightly swollen....and then, it was gone completely, and Link was staring down at a set of rock hard abdominal muscles earned through many a battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For future reference,\" Link looked over as Rikki spoke, trying not to laugh at the Zora's bewildered appearance, \"Gerudo magic causes quite a stir...just look at this place, it'll take ages to reorganize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the spell had done a number to the stock room. The table that had been in the center of the room had been blown back to the far end of the room, it's remains now resting under three collapsed shelves. Rikki himself was crawling out from under a bundle of fabric that had tumbled over from another shelf. Surprisingly, the area around Link was mostly undamaged. The Hero in question had found a rather large mirror shield and was appraising himself in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say...I look just as I did before all of this began...maybe even a bit better.\" Link noted. His loincloth, stretched to breaking earlier, he now had to hold up to keep from falling off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a pictograph, it'll last longer.\" Rikki teased, checking himself over for bruises, \"No, really. Magic's gonna kick in any minute now, probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, Link stared at his reflection in the mirror shield as it changed. His abs, which he had juuust gotten used to seeing again, were covered as his stomach became a belly, yet again. His arms became a little bit softer, his thighs grew a little closer together. His upper chest lost all muscular definition, and his behind grew more spherical. All in all, Link noted with a grimace, he looked much like he did earlier, when this fiasco first began. His loincloth, at least, now fit him perfectly. His sudden growth now at a stop, Link noticed a very faint sensation fall over his body...a magical humming of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...judging by your size, I'm guessing it's around 1 p.m.\" Rikki noted as he came up beside Link to poke his friend in the stomach, \"That's one plus, eh? Your body's now a weight-based sundial...a weight-dial?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gave the Zora a flat look, sighed, and looked at Rikki again, serious this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All fun and jokes aside Rikki, I need to get going while I'm still at a decent weight. Epona can only get me so far before I'll be too heavy for her.\" Link scoffed, \" Can you provide me with supplies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, clothes, I've been in just a loincloth far too much today. Water and...food, I guess. Like I need it. Oh, and any arrows and bombs you can spare. And you, I need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'm pretty sure that - wait, what was that last one?\" Rikki gave his friend a double-take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked at Rikki abashedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need a mage with me on this one I think - especially if whoever's doing this to me changes their tactics, or Goddesses forbid, the Lunar Coin spell goes amiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear friend, may I remind you that I am a Zora? Any long period spent away from water and we dry up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smirked slyly, and Rikki followed his gaze to the spellbook. His eyes widening, Rikki slowly backed up from Link. Even borderline chubby, the Hero was not one to be underestimated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spellbook on transfiguration of the body...\" Link explained matter-of-factly, \"I bet there's even a spell that could turn a Zora into a Hylian...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikki, please. I don't know very many mages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply, Rikki shakes his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink...</span></div></div>",

Rikki suddenly turned his head, horrified to see his backside ballooning so rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh no, whats happening!?\" Rikki moaned, his legs and thighs soon joining in the growth. The slick, smooth skin of his thighs now rubbed together, even when standing. As he stumbled back, mortified to the point his cheeks were blood red. The growth climbed upward, belly puffing out like an air bag, arms and chest growing, even his slim face growing a double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His stomach was growing even faster then the rest of him, making a large gurgling sound as it filled and filled, his body looking full and taught filled to the brim with new fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally, the onslaught ended, Rikki gasping for air looking like a beached whale, leaned against the wall. Link felt awful, the poor guy looked even larger then he did, by maybe even a hundred pounds or so!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm so sorry Rikki...\" Link stammered, his hands feeling the swollen belly of his friend, as if to confirm it was real.</span></div></div>",

He looked up, his eyes wide, feeling half guilty and half panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wh-whats the matter..?\" Rikki stammered, but quickly gasped as he felt even more full then before.

Instead, when they fattened, they did it a lot like Hylians.  Rikki seemed much larger when on the ground, but now that he was on his feet, he appeared to be around Link's size maybe a few pounds more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Again, I'm really sorry, Rikki... I guess this fattening is contagious.\"  He said, bouncing his belly for emphasis.  Rikki sighed and nodded.  \"Yeah, I guess we're in the same boat now... what if this really IS contagious?  I don't want to fatten all the other Zora's.  There's not enough room here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Link nodded.  \"I guess you're coming with me then.\"  Rikki looked up.  \"Really?  You want me to come along?  I'm probably going to hold you back like this.\"  He prodded his belly.  Link shrugged \"Well, not like I can run too fast anymore either.  You can at least use your fins to help me fight.\"  Rikki scratched his head \"Good point. I couldn't find that book... shame, the magic could've helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two heavy heroes waddled out of Zora domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So, what do you think is causing this?\"  Rikki asked as they waddled across Hyrule Field.  Link panted a bit and wiped his forehead, carrying all this extra weight was tiring...  \"I wish I knew...  I'm pretty worried though... if it keeps going... we might end up... immobile.\"  Link propped himself on a tree and sat down.  \"Immobile?\"  Rikki asked, the thought was new to him.  Link nodded \"I've heard of Hylians who were so large that they couldn't lift themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rikki felt a twinge go up his spine.  \"You think that could happen to us?\"  He grasped his belly.  \"I'm guessing that whatever is causing this is probably aiming for that.  Heroes can't fight if they can't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rikki sat down next to Link.  \"Yeah, I guess that's true.\"  Exhausted from the long trek in their big bodies, the two took an inadvertant nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A strange sound woke Link up a few hours later  it was pitch dark.  Like dried branches banging together.  As he opened his eyes, he saw a stalchild pulling itself from the ground... followed by more stalchilds...  a big group of them!  Link clammoured to his feet.  He heard Rikki get up as well.  Link drew his sword and Rikki readied his fins, the two attack the Stalchild swarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Link runs in, using his massive body to tackle the Stalchild in front to the ground, and he began to slash at the others.  Each movement caused a massive jolt of energy to go across his frame, causing it to ripple and bounce.  His frame swayed with his huge momentum, causing seams to pop on his extra large tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rikki joined in, using his bulk to push the ones after him aside, and launching his fins like boomerangs.  The vigorous movement causing him to have to shift his balance from foot to foot as his belly moved from side to side.  He finished off the last before him, and turned to Link.  One of the Stalchild was making it's way toward Links back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Link finished off his attackers and turned to Rikki, seeing the last enemy between them.  As if by command, both the obese fighters ran forward as if to attack the enemy personally.  Their bouncing stomachs took care of that before they got the chance.  As they swung back, their stomachs closed in on the Stalchild, crushing the bone monster between their big guts, causing his bones to fall to the ground.  The impact made Link and Rikki bounce backward and fall on their backsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Panting, they looked at each other.  Link spoke first.  \"Well... not as easy as when I was muscled.  Somehow, a lot more satisfying...\"  He gasped for air.  Rikki nodded.  \"Yeah, that was a very... interesting fight.\"  While they caught their breath, their enormous bellies growled.  Link Ignored it at first and continued to think.  That fight had given him a vital clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ganon hasn't sent stalchild groups out since I last defeated him... to send them out when I'm not in top shape could mean...\"  Link panted again, Rikki cut in.  \"You think Ganondorf is fattening us?\"  Link nodded in response  \"Well, you did say the magic book was dropped off by a Gerudo merchant.  If it's a spell Ganon's people know, he might know it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Link thought a few more moments about their next move.  \"Okay, either we investigate Ganon to see if he somehow caused this, which is kind of risky since we might continue to fatten while we try to get to him... or we can go see Nabooru.  She's a sage, and my friend.  She might be able to help us get this weight under control long enough to find out it's cause.  She's a gerudo too, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rikki scratched his head and responded....  \"We should....\"</span></div></div>",

His belly was getting huge at this point and his clothes began to rip. His belt popped with a loud bang, and links belly sprawled out. The chair under him broke dud to his now large body. He could not move at this point due to his legs being unable to support his weight. \"Zelda help me!\" Link cried out as more food began to stuff him. Zelda was nowhere to be seen. He sat in dismay as the food had not stopped. Nearly all of the food was gone at this point and link was glad. His belly had several folds and rumbled softly. The food all ran out and link took the last bite. \"I'm glad that's over\" he sighed. His belly was so large and it spread over his thick legs. His neck looked like a pile dough as the fat had built up there. He heard a slight rumble from the other room. Gannon's minions ran out with a large tube and stuffed it into links mouth. He was suprised by this and tried to stop but he was too fat to do anything. A bunch of chocolate cream flowed from the tube and into links mouth. His belly swelled to an even bigger size as his soft belly expanded. The cream was so good though so link stopped resisting. He went to sleep as the cream continued to flow. He woke up several hours later not in the dining hall, but in a strange dark room. His clothes had ripped so much at this point that they berly fit. Not even the best tailor could fix them. His belly felt so big and swollen, but it felt good. He tri d to wipe the cream from his face but his big fat arm couldn't reach it. He looked up and saw a man sitting on a throne. \"Hello link, I haven't seen you like this before. Heh heh heh.\" Whose there?!\" Link cried out. \"It's me, ganondorf. You've gotten in my way, and this is my way of stopping you.\" He said. \"But I killed you! Link said. \"Maybe, but I've been revived. You're now my soft fat pet link. You can't stop me now.\" Link was about to resist before ganondorf rubbed his soft belly. \"Actually, could I get more food? I'm kinda hungry again.\" Link said. \"Why of course. I'll have my minions take you to a good viewing spot of me conquring hyrule. They'll also bring you a slice of chocolate cake.\" Ganondorf said. \"Actually, can you bring me 2 whole cakes?\" Link said. \"Why of course my soft pet\" ganondorf laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink lived happy being ganondorf's royal soft and fat pet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link groaned, turning over in his bed, away from the offending morning sunlight that had the audacity to hit him in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does a hero have to do to get some sleep in this place?\" He muttered grumpily with a yawn, as he grudgingly brushed away his plans of slumber to walk over to the window of his treehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out over the once again peaceful forest, Link smiled in content as the Kokiri children began to file out of their houses, ready for another day of play and laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeace had finally returend to Hyrule, and this time, it looked like it was going to stay. Ganondorf had been vanquished, erased from time itself, and the era of The Imprisoning War forgotten by all but a selct few, namely himself, Princess Zelda, and the Six Sages that guarded the land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of travelling the land, fighting monsters, and rescuing sages, the past seven years had been spent exploring the land peacefully, spending lazy days at Lonlon Ranch with Malon or frolicking though the castle gardens with Zelda, or basically just having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow things had come full circle. This year marked the final year of The Imprisoning War, and consequently, the complete destuction of the alternate timeline in which Ganondorf was still in power. To commerate this joyous occasion, Zelda had herself declared this year to be one of grand celebrations, with feasts and parties held in every locale of Hyrule, from The Gerudo's Fortress in the far west to Zora's Domain in the east. All of Hyrule had been rejoicing all year long, and though few actually knew the purpose of the celebrations, everyone had been happy to participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking away from the window to get dressed for the day, Link grabbed one of his trademark Kokiri tunics and pulled it over his head, and in doing so caught a glimpse of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer the sculpted masterpiece of a Hero's form, Link's body had changed from what it had been in the other timeline, thanks in part to growing up in a peaceful world where fighting with monsters was not a daily activity as well as overindulging himself at the many festivals that had taken place throughout Hyrule in the past year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, now a generous portion of flab drooped over Link's belt where before there had been finely sculpted abdominals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking the portruding bulge of fat, Link walked over to his mirror, a present Zelda had given him a few years ago, to examine himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, not only had he grown a small belly, but he looked a bit soft all over. His face looked a bit chubby and he had the start of a double chin, and what muscles he still had were also covered in fat. And of course, his gut was obvious enough, falling over his pants as if to taunt him: \"Tsk, tsk tsk. Someone's let themself go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing slightly, Link looked away from the mirror and put his tunic on, noting with a bit of happiness that his newfound stomach rolls weren't as obvious when he was clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I really gotten that lazy?\" Link asked himself, again diagnosing himself in the mirror and patting his spare tire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering that you've spent the last seven years eating, sleeping, and playing instead of slaying monsters, I'd say yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink jumped and turned to the source of the voice, surprised to see Saria standing in the doorway to his house, chuckling lightly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saria?! When did you get here?\" Link asked, blushing and sucking in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a few minutes ago. You seriously must have let your skills go to let me sneak up on you.\" Saria said, bouncing over to her taller friend and looking up at him with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink poted for a few seconds before sighing and turning his attention back to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really though Saria...what do you think? Am I getting...fat?\" He asked her with a hint of nervousness in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria rolled her eyes before laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, please. You're not fat. King Zora is fat.\" Saria said, poking Link in the stomach. \"You may have put on a few pounds, but for all I care you could put on 500. You deserve to enjoy yourself after what you went through to save Hyrule and everyone in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying I'm going to end up like King Zora?\" Link asked in false horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria chuckled again at her friend's joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm saying its no crime if you're a little tubby.\" Saria said playfully before giving Link a serious look. \"You're not the Hero of Time anymore Link. You're just you. Its okay to be a normal person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...I don't know. I think I've let myself go.\" Link muttered, as Saria through her hands up in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Link. Fine, you're fat. And you're going to keep getting fatter and fatter and fatter!\" Saria chanted, barely avoiding the pillow that Link threw at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that back right now you little wood imp!\" Link shouted, chasing Saria out of his treehouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never.\" Saria retorted, sticking her tongue out of Link from his porch, before she began to climb down the ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh. Sometimes I think I should just move to the Castle Town. Or maybe Kakariko, its peaceful there.\" Link mumbled to himself as he watched Saria run off into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way Link!\" Saria, stopped and turned to shout at Link. \"I came to remind you about the festival tomorrow night! Remember to come, the Princess and the other sages will be there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, another festival.\" Link muttered to himself, putting a hand on his stomach, before replying to Saria. \"I know Saria! Under the branches of the Great Deku Tree!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria nodded and then waved to Link before running off to play with the other Kokiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should watch my diet from now on...\" Link thought outloud to himslef as he descended the ladder to his house himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he though of all of the delicacies that would be present at the festival, drooling at the possibilities. Roasted deku nets, fruits and juices of every vareity, forest potatoes, kokiri bread and if he was lucky, Roast Cucco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing very close to the forest and the creatures within, of course, the Kokiri tended to keep to organic foods, but there was always the chance there would be meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, to hell with it.\" Link muttered. Saria was right. He was just being silly. So he'd put on a few pounds. He was going to enjoy himself for the rest of the year, at each and every festival. He'd get back to training again...eventually. But for now, he was just going to have a good time and eat whatever he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...now what to do today?\" Link asked himself as he took out his ocarina. Where to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could call Epona and maybe go see Malon at the Lonlon Ranch, or perhaps warp to the Temple of Time and visit Zelda at the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could also spend the day around the forest, something he hadn't done for a while. Later in the day, the Kokiri would begin getting ready for the festival they were to host. If he hung around, he might even get to influence the festival's menu, or even make a few taste tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching, Link yawned again and contemplated just going back to sleep. It was still a little early and he could do with a few more hours of sleep. It wasn't exactly healthy, but it was pretty tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Link was still exercising. Link then stopped to sit next to the barn wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be in shape agian in no time\" Link thought to himself.

He came up to Talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link i want you to take care of the horses in the stable for the day\" Talon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, i thought i've be dilverig milk or something more active\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, this job is just as important as any\" Talon said a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh O.K.\" Link said as he headed to the stable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon grinned and sent Malon and Ingo on dilveries for a few months. Malon didn't know why her father was giving Link Ingo job but she didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon looked in at Link sitting on a stool next to the horses bored. Talon came in with a some chicken and offered Link some. Link didn't know if he should. he had lost a few pounds from yesterday exercise. Link decided to think that one piece of chicken couldn't hurt his diet so he had it. After a little while he had ate the whole plate. His stomach really stuffed outward. Talon knew it wouldn't be long all he had to do was keep Link at this job and feed him and he'll be fat. Talon then went in to make up more of his fattening plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked down at his stuffed belly and knew it was agianst his diet but said that he'll be alright. He exercise his next free moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hot waves of air blew through the ranch making it almost unbearable to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot temperatures were not uncommon to Hyrule especially in the middle of summer. Now the mountains were diffrerntit probalby was still cold making Goron City an area where everyone would want to go. Link was wishing he was thier right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink wished he could have a cool lemonade right now as he sat outside with just his shirt and pants on. Tunic was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was too hot to stay in that barn and had to go sit outside by the barn. Link put a chubby hand to his round soft face as it dripped with sweat like his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past month Link had gained a lot of weight. Link belly was peeking out of his shirt as Link would would pull the shirt down every few minutes. Link was also hungry for food but didn't want to go in the hot house for any. Food something Link wanted but hated. Link was losing his quest to stay fit. This month of working and eating was making him lose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink wiped the sweat from his face agian and walked toward the house. Talon was probalby inside but Link didn't know how he could stand it. Talon was like a father to Link and Link really liked him but Link wished he didn't have to look like him with this weight. Link moved past an old mirror that was being thrown out and looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink belly was rounder and more protruding than ever before. His clothes were becoming to small to cover it. It jiggled as he walked making Link hate it. Link then took off his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked at the mirror agian to see a double chin starting to appear. He had lost it due to his exercising but it was coming back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink ass was also a little bigger then it was. His thighs widen also. His once great biceps turning to flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then looked at his muscular chest and saw it had happened, he was developing man boobs. Those flabby man breasts that he had nightmares about getting. They weren't that noticable yet comparerd to his large protuding belly but they were coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink realized that over the month he really was turning fat.What would Malon think when she saw him now. Yeah when he was little chubby it was alright but he was turing fat now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink finally entered the house but Talon wasn't in the living room. Link went into the kitchen but he wasn't thier either. He turned around and bumped into Talon entering fro the dining room. He bumped into Talon quite easily as Link was almost Talon size now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" Link said as he moved out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright, hot isn't it\" Talon said heading over to the cupboard and getting some cookies. Talon then sat down at the table. Link decided to sit down with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want a cookie\" Talon said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thanks\" Link said munching on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malon, and Ingo should be back soon\" Talon said eating anthor cookie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good it was getting boring only us two\" Link said laughing and muching on anthor cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then headed upstairs to his room. He decided to take his pants off as his shirt was already off. He sat on his bed fanning himself with a book next to the window. Link was looking out and could see Hyrule City. Link wondered if farm life was for him or being a hero.  He didn't want to upset Talon and Malon but he really didn't know if he wanted to stay here. If he left he would need to shape up because he didn't look like a hero anymore. He would wait till Malon comes back and talk with her about his descion. He just hoped his belly and pecs could stay this way till she did come.</span></div></div>",

It was still quite hot out but not as hot as yesterday. Link decided that it seemed go enough for a little exercise since he really needed it. He started his run but it was harder due to he is much heavier then last time. Link decided to just sit down as he was out of breath. Link was upset because exercising was going to be hard. He then headed back inside as he was hungry agian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon was watchig him through the window and knew Link was past the spot of exerscing. His plan was working. Link then entered the house and Talon came over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, would you like a snack\" Talon said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just a small one though\" Link said as he sat down in a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon made Link a huge peice of cheesecake and brought it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i didn't want that much\" Link said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a growing boy Link\" Talon said as he passed it to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gave in and starting to eat it. Talon noticed that Link's will was cracking as he was starting to eat anything. A piece missed Link mouth and fell on his belly. Link though didn't care he loved that cheesecake, food was overtaking him. Link then got up after he finshed the cheesecake. Crumbs went everywhere. Talon laughed to himself as he looked at the former hero. The belly made him look like no hero. Link then came over to Talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good, Thanks\" Link said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome, anything else\" Talon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, i've got to start to lay off due to this\" Link said pointing to his belly as his shirt came up a little agian. Link tried to pull it down but it wasn't working. So Talon could see his bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon laughed as Link said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link you look fine, yes you put on a little bit of weight but not much\" Talon said patting Link gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of confusion came over Link face as Talon told him to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link i used to be just like you and i put on weight but i found love, had a beautiful daughter, and a good life, so it isn't the end of the world\" Talon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look that might be great but i'm a hero. I can't look like this\" Link said a little angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link some people have diffrent body types, yours might be destined to be a fat one. So just embrace it\" Talon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you saying i'm destined to be fat\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying that you might just be eating to much or this is your destiny. But whatever, your not that big\" Talon said as Link looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not big\" Link said laughing and then heading outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link don't be depressed or mad\" Talon said following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not it's just i'm a little upset\" Link said turing back to Talon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then headed off toward the field looking at the setting sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThier then was the sound of hoofs.

Once muscle definition was almost gone. His belly pooched out over his pants. He dosen't wear shirts anymore due to they don't fit him. His chest had poof out and begun to droop.

Link didn't like getting this hungry.  Life on the ranch had gotten him used to being well fed.  If he was ever hungry, he could smother the sensation with piles of yummy food.  Link spied a restaurant up ahaead and smiled.  His big belly rumbled eagerly.  Link patted his stomach fondly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little longer and we'll be there. OK?\"  His tummy grumbled again unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink struted into the place as fast as his tubby thighs would let him.  He waited in line then came up to the hostess.  He was shirtless and holding his obese tummy in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need something to eat quick!\" he told her as his belly growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear,\" she laughed.  \"But say don't I know you?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... maybe... I'm Link,\" he told her.  <br>\r\nThere was a shocked look on her face.  He figured she either didn't believe him, because he was too fat to be the Hero of Time, or she did believe him and was shocked at how fat he had gotten.  Link braced for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness!  The Hero of Time is here in our restaruant,\" she announced to all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Link was surrounded by fans and waitresses asking him questions and thanking him for saving their world so many times.  To Link's suprise he was ushered into the VIP area while his fans, waitresses and patrons, started catering to his every whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted some steak, he got five.  He wanted soup, he got the whole batch.  He wanted wine, they gave him a bottle.  The rest of the night was a blur of delicious food and new friends.  There were of course comments on his gain, but none of them bad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve a holiday! Don't worry about your weight!\"<br>\r\n\"It looks good on you! You were always a little to thin!\"<br>\r\n\"A hero should have a big appetite!\"<br>\r\n\"You've earned it! Eat your fill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he did.  Four hours of constant eating and drinking and he finally filled his belly.  He was way too full to move, so his fans kept him company as he rubbed his stuffed stomach.  <br>\r\nLink sighed contentedly.  Food sloshed around inside his belly.  He slouched drunkenly in his booth wile admiring his fat gut.  Food and sauces were being smeared onto his belly.  He was fatter then ever and stuffed like a pig.  He knew he must look fat and piggish too, sitting there with his belly hanging out.  But he didn't care.  Everyone was so nice.  So he thanked them all, and instantly belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its the least we could do, deary,\" answered an old woman.<br>\r\n\"You deserve it kid,\" answered one of the cooks.<br>\r\n\"Its on the house, Link!\" the hostess said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of resting he headed out for his delivery.</span></div></div>",

Talon was actually the original owner of Lon Lon Ranch. At the full moon after the 18th birthday of his next successor, he would switch bodies. Sometimes it had been his sons and other times his sons-in-law. Normally, the men had been significantly larger, which is why he had been so adamant about enlarging his son-in-law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon thought back to the last time he had switched bodies. At that point, he had been in the body of the much older Galon, who was much older than his current body. Galon had been hunched over with age and blindness, however he had been fortunate to have a son finally in his older age, Talon. His obese son was married with his daughter Malon, when the switch occurred. He had sent Talon's wife, Torma, away with deliveries. His son was quite mad about the switch, but accepted the family tradition by the time Torma had returned. While the father and the son had worked hard to keep up the illusion, she finally figured it out after a few weeks. She fled and never returned to the ranch. The older body soon passed away, leaving Talon in his young son's body with a daughter to raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creaking of the bench as Link lumbered away to his downstairs room to pass out brought Talon back to the present. Malon herself was looking a little groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malon, why don't you go and rest yourself?\" Said her father. \"I'll handle the cleaning tonight. You already work so hard for this family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so tired, she did not question such a generous gesture. She headed up to her own room upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon spent the next hour cleaning up and then readied the ritual. He figured that it would be safe to do the switch now that his daughter and his future son-in-law were fast asleep in their separate rooms. He crept into Link's room, though the hero was snoring so loudly that Talon would never have woken him. Talon performed the ritual and...</span></div></div>",

When Link was standing next to Talon Link completely dwarfed him in comparison.  \"Did you need something Talon? I heard you in my room earlier.\" Talon's heart started to calm down when Link didn't bring up anything about what happened. \"No I didn't need anything. Don't worry\" Link nodded and that's when Talon noticed that there was something in Link's arm and that he was only in boxers even though it's cold outside. \"Oh, ok. Well, when I came down right now I tried to put on my overalls but they wouldn't fit and then they ripped.\" Link somehow managed to stick out his arm, even with all the fat, to show Talon the ripped overalls. This just confused Talon even further since Link didn't seem confused like him about how their weight changed so drastically in less than an hour. Maybe he was the only one that would notice it. Talon, curious about how much Link weighs he decided to try and get an answer from him. \"Well since your overalls ripped we should see how much you weigh to get you another pair. They walked outside to the horse scales, which took a lot longer now due to Link's new weight. When they got there Link was sweating profusely despite how cold it was. Link stepped on the scale and Talon's eyes widened at the number that appeared. 700. 700 pounds. Link weighs 700 pounds! It worried him further that Link didn't seem to pay it any attention, as if it was normal. So it probably was just him who noticed their difference in weights. \"So I'm going to need to get you some new overalls tomorrow from castle town.\" It was at that moment that Link's stomach started to rumble which caused him to blush. \"Talon, coming to the realization that he won't be able to switch bodies with Link, decided to just make Link as big as he can since Link is going to take control over Lon-Lon Ranch. Talon just laughed and smacked Link's stomach causing it to jiggle all madly. \"Well I guess we have to fill up that monster you call a stomach.\" This further embarrassed Link but he couldn't say no to food even if it was midnight. When they were back in the kitchen the first thing that Talon did was to start cooking up some food. Once that was done Link immediately started to dig into the food because of his sudden ravenous hunger. After that Talon decided tp link a option for tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One year has passed scince their trip to Hyrule City.  Link hasn't left the ranch much in the following year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rosters were crowing.  Talon grunted as he struggled to his feet.  He caught a look at himself in the mirror.  He hadn't looked this thin scince he was a boy.  He looked older, more worn-out.  These past few months had been rough.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon walked into the kitchen, where Malon was already cooking up a feast.  Mountains of pancakes, heaps of bacon, pails of milk, and more.  There were sausages and cakes and food, food, food.  The kitchen table was bucling under the weight of it all, and Malon was still cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon had originally planned for Link to gain a little weight and settle down on the ranch.  It had worked very well... for a while.  Link indeed loved the ranch.  He had helped out a lot at first.  And Talon had been so eager for him to indulge himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a thump from the other room.  Then another.  Then the whole house began to shake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link's up,\" Malon announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after Link's belly filled the doorway, followed by the rest of his massive corpulence.  He squeezed through the door and settled his massive ass down on the bench and began shoving food into his mouth with both hands and guzzeling milk by the pail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon quickly started in too - he knew it woulnd't last long.  Talon had been more then accepting last year when Link had told him \"I'll be wanting alot of food!\" In fact, Talon had encouraged him even more, heaping Link's plates with 3rds, 4ths, and more, more, more food.  Things were perfect... Link's presence on the ranch brought more business.  And his cheerfulness was infectious!  Even now, despite his tiredness, Talon was laughing and clapping Link on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm! SO GOOD MALON!  More bacon please! YUMMY! More creame! Soooo tasty! Is there more pie?\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they got back to the ranch, last year, Link started eating.  He had hardly stopped all year.  His body grew fatter and fatter each day.  The problem was Link was usually either too full to help Talon run the ranch or he was eating.  The rest of his time he spent sleeping off his enourmous meals.  And Malon kept feeding him more....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here we are today, Malon serving Link as a full time cook, Talon working double-hard just to make sure Link gets enough food, and Link, the former hero, who has doubled his weight in the year past.  Thats right.  As Link sits on his bench, gorging himself, he now weighs OVER 600 POUNDS!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum! More sauseges please! (belch) Is there anymore pie?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, honey, you ate them all.  But don't worry, here's extra butter and creame for your waffles!\"<br>\r\n\"Oooooh!! Yum!\"  Link's words were then lost in a sea of grunts, belches and slurps as he tore into the rest of the food.  And then it was gone.  Talon had barely enough to count as a true meal.  ALL the rest had gone into Link's MASSIVE belly. Link then guzzled the rest of the milk and then waddled his obese body outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious Malon!  Wake me up when there's more!\"  He plopped his massive ass down on the grass and began to snore as the sun shined down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here dad, I saved you some.\" Malon gave her dad a plate of food she had hidded in the oven.  If she didn't Talon would probably starve.  As Talon worked the rest of the day, he would have to rush back inside and try and get some grub before Link devoured it all.  Link could only be tricked out of food while he was sleeping.  If he had ANY room in his gut for more food, he would find it and eat it, no matter where Malon hid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Talon plopped into his favorite chair, exhausted.  He loved Link as a son and he liked having him here.  But Talon had to face facts.  His plan had backfired.  Link was an unstoppable eating machine.  Link was too fat to help around the farm and too hooked on food to stop eating.  And he's so happy being this fat.  Talon promised him he can eat as much as he wants.  He can't ask Link to loose weight, not after helping him gain so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen?</span></div></div>",

He looked down at himself and watched in horror as his belly rapidly began to swell in size as well.  At first, he could only watch as his stomach grew more and more spherical and within moments Link looked like he'd swallowed a large ball.  With one shaking finger, he touched it and heard a sloshing noise.  \"What's happening to me?!\" he belted out, \"It's like I'm filling up with juice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response, he saw his hands change color, turning pink and then red just like the berries on the ground.  He felt pressure under his skin as his arms and legs swelled in size along with his now gigantic belly.  Link tried to run, but he could manage little more than a waddle and he could hear the juice inside of him churning about as he tried to run away.  He glanced at his reflection in the water and saw that his clothing was tearing at the seams.  Soon his belt gave way with a tremendous snap.  Link tried to run faster, thinking that maybe he could find help if he could only escape this place, but he suddenly lost his balance and tipped over.  He glanced at his reflection again and saw that his belly alone was not growing - his entire body was surging into a massive sphere.  He could do nothing more but watch and wait and pray that his growth would stop soon.  As he felt pressure building under his skin and a slight tingling pain as his skin grew tighter, he felt a fear in the back of his mind that he might keep growing until he exploded from the pressure of the juice inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pressure began to build and Link felt his skin reach his limit, his sausage-like limbs finally engulfed by his stretching body, he closed his eyes and thought of the irony of how the great Hero of Time would fall to such a simple fate.  He defeated Ganondorf for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he pondered his fate, he realized that the pressure had finally stopped increasing.  He opened his eyes and could just barely make out the torn clothing on the ground.  His body was a soft red, completely taut with juice, and had a slight shine from the small glimmers of sunlight.  He tried to touch himself, but his hands were nearly impossible to move.  He turned his head to the lake and saw that he was no nothing more than a gigantic berry with a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround him, he could hear the laughter of children...the Skull Kids perhaps?  \"Hey, come out of there!\" Link called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Skull Kids walked out of the forest, Link glared at them, but he was completely helpless.  He jerked around, trying to move his massive body, but found himself completely immobile.  The Skull Kids snickered as they circled around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So big and round!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bright and red!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So juicy and soft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Skull Kids started to jab him with their flutes, which at first gave Link pause as he felt enormous discomfort and feared again that he could be popped, but this fear subsided because as hard as they poked him, his skin did not give way.  He guessed that as full as he was with juice, his skin must be incredibly thick to contain him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?\" Link asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly Hylians,\" said one of the identical Skull Kids, \"You're so easy to trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a Hylian as fat as you were,\" said another one, jabbing a finger into Link's belly-button and causing him to yelp, \"couldn't give up the lure of the Debu berries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I wasn't that fat!\" Link said, feeling even more concious about his size.  The Skull Kids obviously wouldn't try to save him from this fate, and what was he going to do?  There was a great festival to be held.  Zelda of all people would be there.

Link swallowed.  As badly as he needed help, he also didn't want anyone to see him like this.  And as he laid eyes on the female form that now crossed into his sight, he felt like he would have preferred never being found.</span></div></div>",

No matter how hard he tried to suck in his gut, it wouldn't budge. It was simply too big, so trying very very hard, he finally managed to pull his belt over his stomach, hoping it push in his great gut somehow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda finally approaches a distance where she could recognise him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there Link\" she greeted him, her voice sweet as ever. She finally came face to face right in front of him, with Link's belly almost touching her ultra trim girlish waist. Link wondered how she managed to stay in shape when she was (according to his own account) stuffing her face just as much as he was.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you been upto. I haven't seen you in sooo long... oh Link!\" she proceded to hug him when all of a sudden she felt a big bump from Link's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slowly rolled down to his gut hanging out from his belt and to Link's utter embarassment asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, have you been putting on some weight lately?\" she pinched Link's cute lovehandles that stuck out on either side of his pot belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... actually it's the fabric of this new cloth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is it!\" sneered Zelda not for a moment believing his lame excuse. \"Pull up your shirt!\" she ordered him <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. I want to see how much weight you've really gained.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? In the middle of the forest?!\" Link protested. But before he could say or do anything, Zelda pulled up his shirt as a massive fleshy gut rolled out, finally free from the constrains of his tight shirt. Infact his gut filled out so big, Link almost thought it wouldn't stop, but it finally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda then completely took off his shirt, and began pinching about his gut. First his lovehandles, then placing her finger into his bellybutton, shaking his stomach from side to side to see how much it jiggled, and even went about patting it a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... so far it seems most of the weight has landed on your stomach.\" Zelda said after thorough thought and analysis on his condition. \"And a little on your thighs, face, and buttocks I might add. Perhaps it's MY fault for ordering all those feasts all your long. But really I never thought you'd stuff your self silly and bloat up like a pig!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's face was red with embarassment. He could even hear some of the skull children giggling around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry Link, soon we'll have you on a diet, trim and ready for your next battle in no time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink couldn't muster up the courage to say or do  anything anymore, because the slightest movement would make his belly (already on public display) shake and jiggle like crazy now without the comfort of his thick shirt to hide it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have my shirt back please?\" Link said trying to remain stiff as a board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Infact YOU are going to walk back all through the forest, into the town with me, so EVERYONE can see how much you've let yourself go, fatso!\" Zelda snickered as she patted his stomach again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Zelda, give it back!\" Link reached for his shirt from her hand, but she'd already dropped it on purpose.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink found it incredably difficult to bend over his enormous gut, and through strenous effort (perhaps more than he'd taken while facing Ganon in his earlier days) he managed to completely bend over, but just as he was about to pick it up, his pants split with a cracking sound, that made Princess Zelda and the skull children laugh all the more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat fat fatty Link\" chanted Zelda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that bitch Zelda\" Link thought to himself angrily. \"After all the times I've rescued her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Link! Follow me. We'll get you some attire for your growing waistline from some of my father's old clothes. God, you're gonna be fat as him sooner than I'd thought. (sigh)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all through the way, the Forest creatures, the townsfolk, even the children were astonished when they saw Link stride past them in the clothes he'd out grown. Some of them laughed passed mean comments about his weight, but most were just shocked. Was this the same lean young boy that saved their fair Kingdom so many a time? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink could even hear some of the women whisper about him to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor fellow, the feasts really have taken a toll on his figure.\" one remarked. The others nodded in agreement. \"Where is Princess Zelda taking him?\" another asked. \"Perhaps to get some elixir to reduce his paunch, or perhaps just to the gym.\" Almost everyone in the gathering laughed at that remark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tried his best to hide his stomach with his hands, pushing it in, even taking the belt off his pants (which he obviously didn't need anymore to hold them up) and strapped it around his gut tightening it so it could atleast slightly hold in his stomach. (which later snapped and to the crowd's delight, made his stomach bulge up and down as it bloated to it's original size)     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Zelda is going to do about this?\" wondered Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His old shirt was left in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny! Where are you taking me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just a few of the gals I've invited. I was thinking of doing a makeover for myself with them, but seeing as I've got a whole NEW project for myself of getting you back in shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just point me to the nearest gym and I'll excersise them right off I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" retorted Zelda hastily guiding him through the castle until finally reaching her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you go the gym and work out, you'll only get hungrier and eat more at the feasts! I've got a BETTER more 'girlish' remedy for you to get your 'boyish'figure again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the bedroom door swung open, Link could see half a dozen Girls, (some even elves) swarming around, wearing nothing but two piece spandex showing off their firm, toned abs, and absolutely flat stomachs. Looking at them made Link drool, but also more embarassed than ever at his own pot belly that stuck out like a sore thumb for ALL the girls in the room to see. He held his hands over his stomach, but Zelda slapped his hands off. \"If you hide it, it only becomes worse\" she whispered in his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My! Link is that really you?\" asked the elf like Girl with her large blue eyes staring at Link's protruding gut for awhile, but quickly shifting her gaze back to his face again not to seem rude at his obvious recent weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the girls (who were infact HUGE fans of Link and his heroism) were pretty awestruck by his very presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn't notice (atleast pretended not to notice) Link's enlarged girth. Not until Zelda blurted out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, you may or may have not noticed this before, but Link has put on a lot of weight, and it is sadly also our own fault for making all those rich delicacies and endless feasts. Now I didn't notice what a butterball Link had become until I saw him in the forest, his stomach completely drooping over his tightened belt. Now it's not only safe on Link's health, nor is it safe on the people of Hyrule to have someone of Link's caliber, unfit for battle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at Link, not leeringly as Zelda did, but with more remorse, feeling somewhat responsible for Link's flab. One by one they came to analyse Link's body. They too concluded that most of the weight was indeed settled in his stomach area. They noticed how it drooped lower from the rest of his torso, meaning it was truly getting so fat it was difficult to be carried around anymore by his otherwise natural slender body type. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Do you drink a lot of beer Link\" asked Saria (who was also there) \"Because to me it looks like you have the symptoms of the typical male beer belly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't drink beer, or any real alcohol for that matter.\" replied Link<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's measure him first.\" said the elf like girl bringing a measuring tape. \"We will see how much weight needs to be reduced first, before commencing the strict diet and excersise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda caught hold of the tape along with Saria and proceded to measure him themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"39... no wait 40 inches I think? Perhaps..\" Saria tugged the measuring tape, as it gently squeezed Link's belly. Links face became red again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls gasped at the measurements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... is he getting fatter as we speak?\" questioned Zelda. \"Link do you feel any strange growing sensation in your stomach? Anything at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I do feel somewhat hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls gasped again. By now Zelda lost it. \"Link do you have ANY idea how ridiculously FAT you're getting? Do you REALLY think this is the time to be thinking about FOOD! Strip him off of everything but his underwear girls! WE are going to measure EVERY ounce of flab on his body!     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Link, he wasn't wearing the boxers type underwear. Nope, infact he was still so strangely confident of his physique, he wore the very tight v shaped bikini spandex kind, that not only revealed every bit of extra flesh on his body, but moreover accentuated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda, was poking through his body now like inspecting the fluffiness of a pillow (which was pretty much more or less how Link was now) After revealing Link's almost nude form, the girls came to know how much weight he really HAD put on. His thighs, once well hidden by his pants, now rubbed together like two closely packed sausages that bulged together everytime he moved or made a stride forward. His buttocks were plump and round beyond mention, and his love handles protruded sideways as much as his belly protruded front.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda, by now had almost become a very mean lean fitness expert, announcing every body measurement she took. She slapped his thighs from time to time, to make him turn around, then would pinch his butt to make him turn front again. But most of all she rubbed his paunch and often ridiculed him by comparing it with her own ultra slim flat toned stomach, which made Link feel like his own was a beach ball in comparaison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel my stomach Link\" Zelda said, pulling her dress up a little bit to reveal her washboard abs. She placed Link's hands on top of it forcefully \"Feel the firmness? The tight, totally in control abs, and NO love handles!. Now feel yours.\" She put Link's hands on his own stomach. \"Feels like jelly doesn't it? Like a big fat overgrown marshmallow... a Royal pillow wouldn't be soft as your gut!\" She put her mouth at his belly button blew through it. \"Look girls, I'm inflating our hero's balloon belly!\" she laughed menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the same Zelda\" wondered Link shaking his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, most of the girls there were pretty disgusted at Link's terrible physique, but one was actually admiring it all the way and thinking how nice it would be if Link continued eating like this more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Saria!   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He could see through to the bottom and no impurities clouded its complexion.  \"Guess its safe,\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cupped his hands into the water and carefully began to drink from it.  Strangely, the water had a sweet taste and scent, gliding down his throat.  Link pulled a glass bottle from his belt and quickly filled it with the heavenly water.  He sat down on the ground, tilted his head back, and drank heavily from his bottle, enjoying the taste and feel of the substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Link, it felt as though nothing mattered while he was drinking.  He was barely aware of the woods around him as he continued to drink until he realized he'd actually emptied the entire bottle in one long gulp.  He gasped for air, wondering what sensation had overcome him to make him so thirsty.  As the bliss of the water left him, he realized his clothes felt incredibly tight and something large was covering his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gasped as he looked down to see his stomach had swelled to a massive size, pouring over his crossed legs and having pushed up the front his now-much smaller tunic.  He could see his snapped belt on the ground, having given way from trying to contain his larger girth.  His gloves were strained by his puffed up hands and now sausage-like fingers.  His sleeves and pants had split seams as bits of fatty flesh poked through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, what happened to me?!\" he yelped, trying to push himself up to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, he could hear a tearing noise.  \"That...would be...my pants...\" he grumbled, touching his larger rear-end.  But no part of him had grown quite like his stomach, which he tried to cover by pulling down his tunic, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do I do?\" he said, panicking as he felt that familiar strong thirst return to his throat.</span></div></div>",

Nearly reaching the ceiling of the grotto and wider than the entrance was, this was a sure-fire way to make sure our hero wasn't going to be doing any adventuring anytime soon. His old self little else other than a nagging voice in the back of his mind, Link's tongue started to wag as he greedily grabbed a few large chunks and started to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaaaat's right, just scoff it all down piggy! Go hog wild, I want Hyrule to see just how much their precious hero has changed when I start showing your fat ass around!\" Dark Link said with devilish glee, watching with twisted delight as he saw Link completely cover himself in messy chunks of cake. Taking large bites of a particularly wet slab of cake with french fries serving as filling in one hand and taking large mouthfuls of a jug of a sweet potion in the other, the young adult\u2019s now chunky legs spread far out to allow his growing gut to rest comfortably in-between. Whatever feelings of discomfort or fullness prevented from Dark Link's powerful magic, and just allowed regular Link to eat all the more to his heart\u2019s content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving his now 350 pound body up with some effort, seams in his tunic ripping to allow small bits of flab to peek through, Link waddled over to the other side of his cake, the glutton in him curious to see what nauseatingly unhealthy junk food decorated his personal treat. As he happily plucked off an entire roast chicken covered in fudge and started to scoff it down, Dark Link started to muse over out loud his plans for his soon to be enormous slave to gluttony.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, just imagine Princess Zelda\u2019s face when I plonk your fat ass in the middle of her throne room! Or maybe ON her face, I bet she\u2019d get a real kick out of that as she contemplates just how screwed over her kingdom is when their hero\u2019s a lazy slob... What do you think, lardo Link?\u201d \u201c*URRRRRRRRRP!*\u201d \u201cAtta boy!\u201d His demented laughs echoing throughout the deep cave, Dark Link suddenly sensed another \u2018guest\u2019 at the entrance of the grotto. Panicking at who it could be, Dark Link realized another problem besides the possibility of having to deal with another knight come to rescue Link from a flabby finish; even if it was just another dim-witted traveller, wouldn\u2019t the well known Link stuck in a hypnotic feeding frenzy set them off to this place\u2019s true nature? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019d be tricky, but whoever it was Dark Link would have to try and overpower this new visitor, submitting them to the same fate as Link... Trying to relax himself as he slowly turned invisible to the naked eye, he mused over the possibility of being someone almost as vital to Hyrule\u2019s stability as Link! Hearing some heavy breathing and the smell of Link\u2019s BO being slowly drowned out by a much more pleasant smell, it was obvious this visitor was female. While for his own vindictive reasons Dark Link wanted Link as enormous as enormous can be, he had little issue with giving him a fat bride; all the more to turn Link\u2019s life into a grotesque, fat parody!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he crept slowly towards his unlucky victim, Dark Link recognised this visitor to be...</span></div></div>",

His near-400 pound body jiggled and wobbled with every slight movement, covered in a myriad of stains from the fattening foods he'd been devouring and dripping with a slight coat of sweat. His face would have been unrecognizable had his cap not been adorning his head, with huge wobbling cheeks and multiple chins covering up what was once the face of a heroic knight. His massive moobs were what most women could only dream of having, perched atop his quivering, wobbling, sloshing gut. It was the biggest feature on his newly-fattened form, and from the amount of food being shoveled inside at this pace, it would only prove to get larger. His ham-like arms were loosing their mobility with each pound that Link gained, meaning he'd need more force to grab anything with his bloated hands, which in turn made more sweat drip off his frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him sat his gigantic ass, acting as a big, comfortable throne the piggish was-hero was more than happy with using to eat and eat from, although it had a long way to go before it would catch up with his stomach. His legs were in the same situation as his arms, although his fat-caked thighs and calves had the added difficulty of having to heave this tub of lard wherever he felt he needed to go, his very fat little feet doing all they could to balance him and keep him from plopping on to his belly, not that it would hurt that much if that did happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess just stared at the massive pig in front of here, gawking in complete disbelief.

Some days he was at Hyrule Castle with Princess Zelda.  Some days he was tearing through the desert with Gerudo warriors.  Others he was simply relaxing at Lon-Lon Ranch and racing Epona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon watched him from the window of the barn.  She blushed slightly as he ran by the window, the sight of Link's toned form sending her heart into a tizzy.  Even under the loose tunic, she could tell that he was still muscular.  As she did so, she carefully milked the cow in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow that she was currently milking was special.  It had been given a special diet to increase its milk output.  It had all been Inigo's idea - he was the one who counted the Rupees on the ranch.  This was the first cow they had tested it on and Malon had indeed noticed an increase in the amount it gave today.  However, since the diet had begun, the cow had also tripled in girth, barely able to move on its own, though otherwise it seemed healthy.  She pet the large cow on the forehead as she heard Link gallop by again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon started to pour the milk into the bottles.  She smiled at the thought of the kind Kairu in the Castle Town who was a client of the ranch.  However, she'd noticed that over the last few trips to deliver milk to him, he'd seemed a little heavier each time.  At first it was hard to notice, because he'd always been so incredibly skinny, but by the third week Kairu had a noticeable paunch and a second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon didn't like to admit it, but she had actually thought Kairu more attractive as he grew bigger.  As she looked out the window once more at Link, she started wondering what he would look like at a larger size.  \"Now, now, Malon,\" she scolded herself, \"He's fine the way he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still the thought lingered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon heard Link gallop up to the door of the barn.  She finished her bottling quickly and smiled brightly as he entered.  \"Hey Fairy Boy!\" she quipped, \"You sure racing around 50 times was enough?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smiled, then looked over to the Lon-Lon Milk she'd just bottled.  \"Hey, is that fresh?\" he asked, excitement in his voice.  Link's love for Lon-Lon Milk was legendary in Hyrule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon picked up a bottle and said...</span></div></div>",

Let's see...on today's menu we have fried Cucco legs, freshly baked bread with butter made from Lonlon Milk, some cheese, also made from Lonlon milk, some cider I picked up in the castle town the other day, and I just baked an apple pie this morning! And of course, the milk too.\" Malon said, laughing, as she and Link crossed the short distance from the larger barn to the house of the Ranch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...it all sounds so tasty.\" Link responded, as a loud growl emanated from beneath his tunic, eliciting another chuckle from Malon as she entered the ranch house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Link. I made some of it for you, you know.\" She said, making sure not to step on any cuccos as she made her way towards the kitchen door, quickly checking to see if her father was still asleep as the counter, which he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Malon?\" Link asked, licking his lips in happiness. \"Gosh, thanks a lot! You sure know how to make a man happy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon giggled as she put most of the milk away into the refrigerator, with the exception of a few bottles left out to drink, and then turned and flashed the hero a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.\" Malon joked, poking Link's flat stomach and winking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, the urge from earlier, to see Hyrule's Hero a bit heftier, came back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing slightly, Link put a hand to his abdomen and grinned cheesily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I must have hundreds of admirers throughout Hyrule.\" He stated, sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Malon inquired, as she began to lay out the lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm. It seems everywhere I go these days, feast are being thrown in my honor.\" Link replied, rolling his eyes. \"And each time its something different. Feasts of fish in the Zora's Domain. Desert Delicacies at the Gerudo's Fortress. And even the Kokiri have been feasting on fruits and herbs and have been more jovial than usual; interesting though considering that they're usually ALWAYS happy, except for Mido.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon giggled at the mention of the cranky Kokiri leader, of whom Link had told her of on several occasions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakariko has been in good spirits ever since Impa and Zelda decided to try to revive the Skeikah style of fighting, and the Castle Town, you can find food from any of the races there.\" Link said, picking up one of the bottles of milk on the table, uncorking it, and taking in the frothy beverage with a groan of delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose the Gorons can only feast within their own species then. Considering they eat only rocks. Its kind of sad, in a way.\" Malon commented, watching Link drink the milk in pleasure from the corners of her eyes as she continued readying the lunch. \"But things are indeed peaceful between the races then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded, finishing off the bottle of milk in another of moment or so and sighed contently, licking at his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite peaceful. Its almost boring. The Gerudo have stopped stealing as much as they used to and have started ranching a little bit, like you and Talon, so they're not causing as much trouble as they used to, even though they're still a rowdy bunch. For the most part, Nabooru has been keeping them in line. The Zoras, Kokiri, and Gorons have been peaceful as well, sticking mostly to their own lands. And like I said, the Castle Town and Kakariko couldn't be in better spirits.\" Link said, examining the bottle of milk as he explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This milk was really good, Malon. Have you changed the cow's diet?\" He asked, setting the bottle back down onto the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well, perhaps just a little...\" Malon noted, an image of Kairu coming to mind and how he had expanded over the past few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever you're doing, keep doing it!\" Link exclaimed happily, taking a seat at the table as Malon placed the last bits of food on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we'll be sure to!\" She said with a smile, taking a seat herself. \"Now let's dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink belched loudly, blushing a bit as he lay leaned back in his chair in the kitchen, rubbing his stomach tenderly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon chuckled, cleaning a few plates away from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she knew why Link exercised as much as he did; the fairy boy had the apetite of Goron that had spent half a year with no rocks to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hero had descended upon the lunch Malon had prepared with the fervor of a Wolfos and hadn't slowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon had been mesmerized, forsaking most of her own food in favor of watching the hero gorge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, he'd eaten nearly everything she'd prepared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all of the food that Malon had made for the fairly larg lunch, only a few slices of pie, several bottles of milk, and one fried cucco leg remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Link yawned for a good minute and gave his full stomach a few good pats, then have Malon a thankful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of all of the cities and races of Hyrule, you're the only chef I know of that can prepare such a hearty meal, Malon.\" Link complimented, making Malon blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And of all the heroes and fairies I know,\" Malon said, poking Link in the belly. \"You are the only one I know who can eat so much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Link grinned and again gave his full stomach a pat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank the Goddeses that I exercise as much as I do. If I didn't, I fear that I'd be the size of King Zora by now.\" Link jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon shrugged, returning to gathering up the reamains of the lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who needs to be fit in this day and age?\" She asked, wrapping the remaining pieces of pie and the last fried cucco leg up for Link to take with him when he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Link asked, raising a blonde eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyrule is at the beginning of a grand age of peace.\" Malon stated, turning to eye Link. \"I can feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An age of peace? What makes you so sure?\" Link asked the rancher's daughter as he watched her round up a few of the fresh bottles of milk as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You yourself said it. The races are rejoicing! Even the Sheikah ways may be revived soon enough! And evil, apparently, has given up on Hyrule, at least for now.\" Malon stated, winking at Link. \"It makes me wonder what you're going to do now. What happens to heroes after their battle is won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smiled cheesily, scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't they live happily ever after?\" He asked, making Malon chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose they do. The question is HOW they live happily ever after.\" Malon stated, presenting the leftovers from Lunch to Link with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when will you be stopping by again, Link?\" Malon asked, gazing up at Link as he sat atop Epona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its hard to say, really. Zelda and Impa have asked me for some help overseeing the contruction of the Skeikah Training School in Kakariko. Boring stuff really, I'll mainly just be standing around so no one gets hurts in the contruction. Then I have to make my normal rounds to make sure verything is all right with the races.\" Link said, packing away the leftovers from lunch into his pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the school in Kakariko nearing completion?\" Malon asked, leaning up against a tree near the entrance to the Ranch to get some relief from the afternoon sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly. It won't take longer than a month to complete it, I think. So if all goes wells, the latest you'll see me will be in about four and a half to five weeks.\" Link grinned, stroking Epona's mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning the smile, Malon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to make a good dinner for when you return then, Link.\" Malon said, waving goodbye as Link rode off into the golden expanse of Hyrule Field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was gone Malon sighed, thinking to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of friend was she to actually try to fatten Link up like she did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut its not like she hadn't done the same with Kairu...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening herself, Malon strengthened her resolve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what if she inadvertently tried to put a few pounds onto the boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the way Link exercised, she would be lucky if he even got chubby. And if he did, she would be doing him a favor. If he was a bit tubbier, Link wouldn't be cavorting all over Hyrule trying to get himself killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon would indeed be sure to create a wonderful feast when Link returned to the ranch. If Zelda, Ruto, Nabooru, and even Saria were throwing parties for the fairy boy, by Din, so was she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by then, she would definately have more of the new Lonlon milk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil then, she could occupy herself with seeing how it affected Kairu, and others if she happenned to find new clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was over 50 miles in length, and took 2 whole weeks to cross it--even on horseback!  The evil that had once been in Hyrule was long gone now.   Even the Skullos that had only appeared at night in the field were gone.  Life was boring for the once Hero of Time.  Now, he was going to feast after feast!  It was a good thing he exercised, or he might be chubby now...and who ever heard of a chubby hero?  <br>\r\n       It was just after mid-day when Link had left Lon Lon Ranch.  He was heading towards Kakariko, to oversee the construction of the new Sheikah school.  The Sheikah School of Fighting--as it was called--was just outside of Kakariko.  The construction was coming  along nicely and Link wanted to see the last stages of construction.  Only a month from now, the school would be open and everybody would learn how to fight like the Sheikah people.  <br>\r\n       Link's stomach was wonderfully full after that large lunch of Malon's. Malon had been right about one thing...Link was a serious eater.  He loved to stuff his face with food like a Wolfos.  He didn't get chubby thanks to the constant exercises he was doing.  But then, a thought came to Link.  Why keep exercising?  Hyrule was entering a new age of happy times.  There was no need for a hero now...especially a trim one.  <br>\r\n      Epona ran a little slower than normal, but was still the fastest horse in all of Hyrule.  The reason for this was that Link was a good deal heavier than he was before.  It was hardly noticable, but Link did have a small potbelly going.  <br>\r\n     Kakariko Village wasn't that far from Lon Lon Ranch, so Link made it to the small village well before evening.  The contruction of the Sheikah school was coming along.  As Link approched the contruction site, he saw that the crew was having a late lunch.  </span></div></div>",

One of the short and stocky guys gives a wave for the Hylan to make his way over. Obliging the generous offer, Link hopes off Epona, patting her and letting her know he'll be a short while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrives at the table and takes a seat at the only empty spot left on the edge of one of the benches. The table is surprisingly filled with food, Link being informed that there is a cook on the grounds to make sure the workers maintain their stamina for the construction. Most of the food before them was protein, meats of all sorts and jugs of juice. The guys all simply started in on the feast so Link did so as well, figuring that was his cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started on a slab of charred meat, but soon found himself through with it and sampling (or rather devouring) some of each prepared piece. The food was had such a different flair than what he was used to both at the castle and at the village that he didn't even bother to notivce how much he was actually consuming, nor how his appetite was increasing since his former days of battle and dungeon-crawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he swallowed the last piece on his plate, and also the last piece on the table, highly pleased with the meal. Shortly after the last morsel hit his stuffed gut, he felt a pang of pain as he unexpectedly ripped a monster belch that put all of the construction crew to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt the full weight of all he had rapidly consumed. His belly began to ache with the surprising amount of food he had managed to stuff down. His belly ache made him glance down and see the curve of the rounder belly his tunic was beginning to have to stretch to cover. He finally realized part of the pain was probably caused by his tight leather belt digging into his flesh under his protruding belly. Of course, undoing his belt here would alert his companions to the larger state of their hero. So he dealt with the pain, making idle conversation until the guys had to get back to work. Finally he stood up and slowly made his way back to Epona, and managed to get back into the saddle after some grunts and strained efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't really describe how it felt to undo his belt and let his man-sized gut hang out, filled to the brim with food and drink. He felt satisfied somehow, to feel that much heavier. As Epona began the trek back to the castle, Link could only feel the contents of his stomach slosh back and forth, belching in upset, and contemplating how he felt about everything.</span></div></div>",

As long as everyone was at peace, there was little need for him right then in the land of Hyrule. Using this to his advantage, he figured that if he decided to experiment a bit, no one would miss him for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table near him was over a dozen large bottles of fattening Lon-Lon milk. His belly stuck out a decent amount, though not as much as the time he had downed so much with the construction crew. He reached for the first bottle, opening the top as he brought it to his lips. Like a man with a mission, he began chugging. One, two, three, four... one by one the bottles were emptied into his bloating belly. Between bottles he would usually pause for a brief moment, hands on his belly as he would burp several times in rapid succession, making more room in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the ninth bottle, his large belly was forcing his tunic to ride up, and it looked a bit useless due the unnatural state of his stomach. He struggled to pull it off, followed by his undershirt. Finally unrestricted by his confining top, he resumed his quest. Within a few short minutes he stood proudly (and feeling a little sick), among the many empty bottles. His belly was over twice the size of his former chub and almost completely dwarfed the sight of his feet! He felt huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began running his hands over his expansive stomach, fighting back the urge to throw up with the deeper feelings he was getting from his... sexy... belly. The sick feeling in the pit of his stomach forced gas up from the pit of his engorged stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Uuuuuuurrrrppp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief. He knew anyone remotely near his hut would've heard that eructation, but he didn't care. He was loving how it felt to be so big. As he waddled his way over to his bed, feeling it creak under his increased weight, he formulated a plot in his mind.</span></div></div>",

His softening ass was stressing his tights, and his prominent belly forced up his undershirt (all that he wore) an inch or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks prior, a strange man had wandered into the area. Link, being quasi-famous, had apparently merited an introduction by this strange fellow. A few weeks back, while wandering the plains for exercise (a concept that now felt so humorous to the eager Hylan), he felt a presence behind him. Turning quickly, he saw it to be a man about his height, dressed in a strange red jester's suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard of your deeds in this land,\" he said, then making an offer for Link. Should he ever desire an ally of any sort, or assistance with anything, all he had to do was head to the windmill. The jester would surely be there. Link gave a perplexed and hesitant look but the jester seemed to have seen it within him: \"No request is too strange, nothing too absurd; for I have lived longer than you think and have seen much more than you would expect or even contemplate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was pretty much that, and Link went on his merry way, waving goodbye to the pleasant but off-putting jester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here he was, eager to get fatter, and he wanted this eccentric man's assitance. The drive within him only hoped that the jester would appear, and that he could even help Link in his strange endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, to Link's joy, he saw the jester step from the shadow's cast by the setting sun through the narrow windows of the windmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my good sir! Have we been indulging a tad too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stood silent, one hand grazing his obviously fatter stomach. The jester gazed intently at the Hylan and jumped a bit with realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting! But not unheard of, I guess. Sure, I can help you out, if that's truly what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink only nodded, strangely aware that the jester knew of his desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a clank, Link looked down. Below him at his feet was an iron flask. Giving a hesitant glance at the red jester, he bent over (which was becoming a slight chore) and lifted it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jester merely nodded as Link slowly brought it to his lips before downing it with abandon. He wiped his mouth as he let out a raunchy belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That potion will increase your appetite for the day tenfold, increase the amount of calories your body draws from food, and also is quite a hefty source of nutrition in and of itself. Each morning there will be one of these on your table so long as you drank the one the previous day, otherwise the chain will cease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is true? This will... help  me?\" Link asked, disbelieving the wondrous gift he was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And should you feel you've gotten big enough, all you must do is cease the drinking of the potions. Of course, that won't diminish the natural appetite you will have garnered at that point. Also, it is your job to satiate a tenfold hunger each day, mind you. Otherwise you may very well starve from hunger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded, already thinking of his plan to start preparing a stockpile of food the next day for his coming feasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bright flash, the jester had vanished, leaving the Hylan alone with his thoughts in the eerie windmill, and his suddenly ravenous hunger.</span></div></div>",

The jester had been right; his appetite was at tenfold, and he needed to satisfy it.  At the end of the first day of constant eating, Link's belly had doubled in size again!  He could hardly fit in doorways and in his hut.  He slept on the ground, where the Kokiri children stared in awe at the fat Link.  The next day, Link ate a huge breakfast at Lon-Lon Ranch.  Malon was only too happy to feed the massive Link her cooking.  Malon was beginning to like the fatter Link. At the end of the breakfast, Link's belly hung below his knees!  His undershirt was riding up, exposing his lower belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Looks like you need larger clothes, Fairy-boy\" giggled Malon, poking Link's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Could you make me some clothes?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yeah...it'll take me a few days\" said Malon.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     Epona was getting tired of carrying Link's girth...but was still able to carry Link around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n   ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Two days passed like this,  with Link's constant feeding.  At the end of the two days, Link was huge!  The biggest part of him was his stomach, which was the size of a small bean bag chair!  His undershirt only covered his chest, and his leggins were at bursting point!  The Kokiri children liked to climb atop Link's belly and use it as a bed.  Link didn't mind...in fact, it kind of tickled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     On the morning of the fourth day, Link could hardly move at all.  And he saw that he had some visitors.

Link was an adventurer, so he simply couldn't resist the challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure where he was going, exactly, or even what he was looking for, but that only made things more fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wandering around for several more minutes, Link finally came across something that could give him a sense of direction. His nose picked up a delightful scent, and a strangely familiar one too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was food. Delicious, warm food, a mixture of meats and vegetables, the type of thing Link would wolf down to keep himself fueled during a long adventure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would an aroma like that be in a place like this? Link began to wonder if it wasn't some kind of trap. Still, it was his best lead so far, so he followed his nose through the mist, and into a clearing. </span></div></div>",

A cloaked rider on his horse sped on toward the gate that led to the Gerudo's impressive fortress. The guard at the gate rubbed the last bits of sleep from her eyes and watched as the silhouette gracefully jumped over the gate.<br>\r\n    \"Newcomer always loves to show off, doesn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Link steadily held back on the reins on Epona as he neared his destination. Nabooru stepped outside to greet him. He adeptly jumped off his horse and unlatched a bulging bag from his steed.<br>\r\n    Nabooru took the bag from him with some difficulty and opened it. Fresh corn, quite a few bottles of milk, and many apples were just a few of the things inside. \"Good work, kid. Thanks to you and your exploits, the Gerudo won't have a hard time starving this winter. In fact, I've never seen so much food. I don't even know where we're going to put it all. And apples, too! Only royalty can afford them! You must be stealing from the castle itself to get all this! How did you get past the security?\"<br>\r\n    \"Please, don't give me too much credit. The Hylian harvest is completely phenomenal this year. They've been very careless with all the excess, and I don't just mean with security. In fact, the man was selling the fruit for only fifteen rupees, and he wasn't even watching them closely.\"<br>\r\n    Nabooru shrugged her shoulders and walked inside. \"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Link sighed as he plopped down on his futon in his room. He had been living with the Gerudo for five years now, ever since he returned from Termina. Since Ganondorf was gone from this time line, Hyrule was now peaceful, idyllic, perfect... and boring. An occasional monster from Hyrule Field appeared, but... Link found the silence unnerving. The sage incident had forced him to grow up quickly and get used to seeing blood, always being on his toes, never facing your back to people without watching in the corner of his eye. You can't stop being that paranoid in any short amount of time. So, the only outlet that Link could find before the calm drove him insane was... thieving. Of course, Link still had his Hero of Time mantra; he only stole for the thrill of it and reimbursed all his victims fully. But...<br>\r\n   Link sighed as he looked himself in the mirror. His golden blonde hair reached midway down his back, only adorned by a black headband to keep his bangs out of his eyes. His forest green (of course) cloak was held up with a golden clasp with the triforce symbol scarcely marked. Because of the different lifestyle, his body frame had changed significantly, to look more like a thief. His shoulders weren't nearly as broad, and there weren't any overpowering muscles; he was very thin, and probably one or two inches shorter. He didn't wear any shirts or vests underneath, but his cloak was more than long enough to cover his torso. Anyway, he was currently fixated on his stomach, which was protruding out about an inch more than normal 'Nabooru was really pushing me to eat. I'd better be more careful around the kitchen from now on.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A gentle breeze blew in from his glassless window. He stopped to stare outside at the vast desert... </span></div></div>",

Link fell against a wall and propped himself up. The sting of bile and alcohol forced a groan from his throat. A gentle hand led him away from the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stood in front of him, yet she felt so far away. Her voice rattled in his aching head. He turned away, breakfast and beer leaped from his stomach.. Zelda wrinkled her nose. The smell gave her a decent idea of his ailment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't give your speech in this condition.\" Zelda said, more to herself than Link. \"You've never had a drink before this, have you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No speech? I'm good, I really am.\" Link said. Zelda ignored him and hoisted the intoxicated Hylian on her firm shoulder. His height over her proved difficult, but those years training as Sheik gave her the strength to hold him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge explosion rumbled the air. It gave Link a staggering burst of sobriety. He drew a knife and shoved Zelda aside. He watched the sky light up while a procession of gorons pounded ceremonial drums. Their heavy march sent Link reeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped his knife and rubbed his temples. Control of his legs left him and the young Hylian ambled into the parade of gorons. One larger goron kneeled. The procession paused their march. The beat of the drum like wild horses galloping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pot-bellied goron raised a smooth stone tube towards the air. A smaller goron reached over and filled it a rocket. He sparked the fuse and curled up into a ball. Link crashed into the stone tube and knocked it over. A lanky pair of guards shouted over the din of the crowd. A gray-haired woman scooped up a child and shambled away. A shop-keeper ducked beneath his stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great ball of fire burst forth from the tube. It struck the building behind the shop keeper's stall. A deafening explosion reduced the stone facade of the building to rubble. Debris smashed into the ground, a narrow spike of stone stuck into a wall. The sound, the quaking, it all became too much. Everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a show you put on, brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar voice reached out to him through the remainder of his drunken stupor. Most of the alochol worked its way out of his system hours ago. He rubbed his eyes. Link, or Darunia's son rather, looked down at him with those thoughtful beady eyes so familiar to a goron's complexion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hundreds of rupees in property damage, injuries, and one dead cucoo I believe.\" Said the goron. \"You were quite lucky we got you out of the market before anyone could figure out you caused it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do that, that weapon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mortar? Something Biggoron cooked up this past summer.\" Said Link the goron. \"He never intended it for use as a weapon. Just a parade attraction. Though a very dangerous one in hindsight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sat up. The stone surface that served as his bed left a tight knot in his back. He twisted, each vertebrae popped. A sigh of relief left Link's lips. He looked around himself. Waning sunlight lit up behind the thin tent walls. He turned to the goron that shared his name and craned his neck up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your caravan isn't it?\" Said Link. He poked his head out of an opening in the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTall red mountains surrounded him on all sides. Hyrule castle a mere dot in the distance. Link rubbed his eyes and watched the sunset on the horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I missed the parade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much left to miss. Princess Zelda calmed down the people and urged us to get you to safety.\" Said Link the goron. \"We obliged, partly because we never leave a brother behind and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father requested you come visit him after the parade. We were to invite you after the festivities, but somebody blew up a caterer.\" Link the goron flashed link an impish grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darunia isn't with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold wind brushed past Link's face while the sunlight gave way to darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father...is...\" Link the goron's jovial tone fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be dying!\" Link shouted to the goron patriarch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faint torchlight cast growing shadows on the walls of the throne room. Darunia's hard stare softened at the outburst of his old friend. He sighed and turned to his attendants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave us.\" Said Darunia. The guards and attendants obeyed their leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink the goron and another unfamiliar goron remained present. Darunia turned towards them. A frown on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two as well. This is for me and the Hylian only.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he have to say that he couldn't say to his own son? Link the goron turned to the door reluctantly, but he trusted his father. The Hylian that served as his namesake held a bond that transcended age and species with his father. Something no one but them alone could ever understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other goron stood his ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother, your behavior has been inexcusable.\" Said the goron. \"What secrets do you have to keep from us? From me? This puny Hylian could not possibly undertake anything you ask.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that sort of behavior is exactly why I have called him, Grouger.\" Said Darunia. \"This human has done more for my people than you or the kingdom of Hyrule combined. Leave us, and do not make me repeat myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one called Grouger turned to Link with the deepest fire in his eyes. The Hylian gulped and turned to Darunia. Even in his current state, he still carried the strength to destroy any unruly pests in his presence. Grouger stormed out of the room and closed the doors behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My time is short, Link.\" Said Darunia. \"My late wife's brother watches me like a piece of meat on a spit. By birthright and seniority, he will take the tribe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't your son next in line?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boy, bless his heart, is too weak to stand up to his uncle. He knows no hardship nor the darkness some are capable of.\" Said Darunia. \"Yes, Grouger will take it. What's more, I fear it is all by design.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMemories flooded back, when Ganandorf killed the only father he ever knew. He cursed the Great Deku tree, and with that curse came his death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mean to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My illness is not natural, I cannot say how I know, just that I do.\" Said Darunia. \"You are the last hope I have for my tribe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I need to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarunia smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my successor Link.\" Said Darunia. \"I have chosen you to take my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by the offer, Link shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My duty is to Hyrule Darunia. Besides, gorons won't follow a Hylian  chieftain. That's pushing it a bit too far.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyrule is in serious danger if Grouger gets his hands on my throne.\" Said Darunia. \"He sees your kind as weak. Why should a creature with such soft skin and bone be the ones in charge around here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did not speak. That still did not answer his second question. Darunia pointed to a small chest beside his throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for your Hylian issue, I must ask a sacrifice of you.\" Said Darunia. \"Within this chest is the means to ask the goddess Din a favor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hylian walked to the chest and threw the latch. The lid creaked open. Inside revealed a fine cut ruby. Within the gem appeared to be a dancing flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One miracle per chieftain, and this is the miracle I have chosen for you.\" Said Darunia. \"Go to the Goron's hall of chieftains, and present this gem to the statue of Din. You will become a true goron brother by her magic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sacrifice my humanity to become one of you...\" Link looked at the special gem. \"If that's the only way, I guess I have no choice. Not like the hero of time is needed anymore. Ganondorf is long gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always held the strength of a goron in your soul. Now is a chance to let that strength come forward physically.\" Said Darunia. \"I knew I chose wisely, now go, before Grouger becomes more suspicious than he already is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stepped out side of the throne room, the ruby felt heavy in his pocket. He looked over his shoulder, the dancing torchlight faded to embers, then only darkness. He took a deep breath. The weight of this task grew heavy on his shoulders. He wished things could only be simple again. Then again, he did not have to do this alone. Perhaps he could take a friend?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zelda decided to stay in the room with him to make sure he didn't do anything stupid. As Link finally fell to sleep, Zelda left the room to get some sleep also.<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\nThe next moring Link came downstairs to the dining hall to get breakfast. Zelda was already down there eating some toast. Link asked for steak, fries and a beer for breakfast, which Zelda thought was a wierd breakfast. Zelda then noticed that Link bigger eating habits, more beer drinking and partying, and no fighting was starting to take a toll on his muscular body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you having a steak for breakfast\" Zelda asked Link as it was brought to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause I have a huge appetite\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda just groaned and look at some offical papers that she had to deal with later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man that was good\" Link said finishing his breakfast and undoing his tight belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize that you've put on weight\" Zelda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked down to see that he had put on weight. His belly was huge and very full. Even when he wasn't full his belly was still pretty big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like I swalloed a basketball\" Link said laughing. Zelda just groaned again.<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\nAn hour later<br>\r\nLink sit in a chair in a sitting room taking a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up Link\" Zelda said walking into the room. Link woke up immedialty. Zelda just looked at Link he was no longer full but he was still big. Link tunic was riding up over his belly. His belly was large and round as he sat there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man it getting harder and harder every week to get up\" Link said getting up from the seat. Link belly jiggled as he walked over to Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't belive i'm still looking at the Hero of Time\" Zelda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda noticed that Link's thighs were much bigger now and his arms were fatter now, the muscle was dissapering.

Ruto made herself out of sight, and eventually, Link stopped eating. He rubbed his bloated belly and then went to his room, most likely to sleep it off. As he stood up, Ruto saw that his shirt had pulled up to his belly button, which was a perfectly round innie. She watched him go, and almost coincidently, Zelda appeared after he was gone. Ruto approached, and saw that Zelda had a smile on her face, it seemed she had succeeded in locating a spell for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did you get it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, it was at the back of the last book I checked.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's always where anything is.

King Zora's already vast midsection expanded outward, no more noticeably than usual, but as he glanced down at the smaller, still shirtless Link scarfing down the fish, he could see his bare muscular stomach push outward just ever so slightly, and glanced back to his face, which appeared to be struggling as he chewed the meat off another piece of fish.  He knew no human as tiny as Link with his tiny stomach could ever surpass a Zora, let alone one as fell fed as himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his fish, Link winced in pain, trying his best not to show it, as he grabbed another fish with one hand and clutched his aching stomach with the other.  King Zora then smirked to the young man and said, \"Ahahaha!  Oh, a valiant effort indeed, my dear boy!\"  King Zora started, swallowing another fish whole by the tail, then promptly removing the skeleton from his mouth as he tossed it aside atop a large pile, then continued to say, \"However, us Zora have a much larger capacity for storing our meals than you humans!  And myself in particular; safe for Lord Jabu-Jabu, have been unmatched in my eating abilities since well before your time!\" he slapped his massive gut for emphasis, causing it to jiggle, than grabbed another fish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he prepared to take a bite, he saw Link had actually torn through quite a few fish at this point.  Sweating profusely and looking as though he was on the verge of crying, Link took a deep breath, and tore into the next fish, at a pace not even King Zora thought capable of humans.  \"You're relentless, boy, I will give you that...\" responded a slightly uneasy and suddenly not so confident King Zora as he stuffed the fish into his mouth, \"but you're still biting off far more than you can chew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed.  As Ruto watched, she began to notice Link's pile of fish skeletons had grown slightly bigger than her fathers'.  As she glanced up to him, she saw he began to look a little green around the gills...quite literally.  Suddenly a loud rumbling emitted within the chamber.  Link, too in the zone to look, only continued to eat while Ruto glanced back at King Zora's large stomach, the source of the noisy emission.  Wincing in pain, King Zora clutched his gurgling gut as it continued to rumble violently.  \"Are you alright, father?\"  A moment passed, but still, no response from King Zora.  Ruto began to look a bit concerned.  \"...Father?\"  Suddenly another loud gurgling emitted.  The King then groaned in pain, clutching his vastly bloated belly with both hands.  He looked as though he were about to say something, but as soon as he opened his mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated Zora's disgustingly loud belch echoed throughout the chamber, nearly deafening Ruto and Link respectively, and filled the room with the stench of partially digested fish.  Fanning the air around her, Ruto coughed then laughed.  \"Goodness!  Excuse you, <i>your highness!</i>\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh....*URP* a thousand pardons....that was most vulgar...\" apologized the King, clutching his gut, defeated.  As he glanced back down to his youthful opponent, his eyes widened.  Link, not only engulfed more fish than he, but he somehow managed to ingest ALL of the fish in his bucket.  Not even King Zora had ever succeeded in such a feat before.  \"My word!\" blurted King Zora.  \"Y-you truly are the most fearsome devourer in the land!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smiled weakly as he plopped backwards, utterly exhausted, with both hands rested atop his muscular but rather bloated belly.  \"Yes, good show indeed, my dear boy!  Well done!\"  Too unfathomably stuffed to respond, Link simply glanced back at King Zora and just barely managed to utter the words, \"....Thank...you....\" as soon as he did, a rush of air forced his way from his belly to his throat, and pushed out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!! !!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ruto and King Zora's eyes widened as Link let out a monstrous belch surpassing anything before it which carried on for ten straight seconds before Link nearly passing out, groaning in pain.  Blushing profusely amidst being unbelievably stuffed, Link glanced nervously at the King and muttered a nervous, \"...Excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto was still dumbstruck by the sheer volume of Link's burp, while King Zora couldn't stop laughing.  \"Hahahahaha!  Goodness!  I didn't think such noises were possible of you humans!  Ah yes, good show indeed!!\" said the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling weakly at the King, Link chuckled very weakly and plopped back down to the ground, both hands rested atop his gut.  Just then, King Zora scratched his chin and pondered to himself.  \"Hmmm, I feel as though a reward is in order.  Take some time to rest and when you've recovered from the taste of victory, return to me, and I'll have an appropriate prize ready for you.\"  Leaning back, still resting both hands atop his expanded gut, King Zora turned to his young daughter.  \"Ruto, my dear, would you please be so kind as to help our young champion out?\"  Ruto nodded, then glanced down at Link, overwhelmed by the mere sight of his surprisingly bloated stomach.  It stuck outward by at least 5 or 6 inches, more than she'd ever seen from the typically food crazed Link.  Smiling gently towards him, she helped hoist the young man from the ground and helped the bloated hero of time leave her fathers chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two exited, Link's stomach continued to groan viciously, causing him to moan in pain as a result.  \"Something wrong, Link?\" asked Ruto.  \"Ugh, I....\" Link started, before pressing his fist to his mouth and stifling a loud burp which could still be heard from a distance, soliciting another chuckle from Ruto.  \"...I've never eaten that much before in my entire life.  My stomach feels like it's about to burst wide open....\"  Glancing down at his bloated but still muscle bound stomach, she poked it gently, causing another pain filled groan from Link.  \"Hmmm, you HAVE overdone it in the past, haven't you?\" responded Ruto.  Link chuckled sheepishly, scratching the back of his head embarrassed weakly.  <br>\r\n\"But true, I've never seen you go THIS overboard before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Ruto suggested...</span></div></div>",

Ruto then smiled then walked Link towards her own private chambers.  A much nicer part of the domain than most of what Link was accustom.  She then walked him towards her King Sized Waterbed, immediately making him nervous.  \"Uh, l-look, I-I'm not sure so sure t-that you wanna-\"<br>\r\n\"Shhhh, relax Mr. Hero, it's not like that,\" laughed Ruto as she laid the bloated young man onto the bed next to her.  Link winced, unsure of what to expect, when suddenly Ruto placed her rubbery but cooling fish hand gently atop Link's swollen belly.  Link glanced up curiously at Ruto, who smiled gently back at him and said, \"I want you to relax.  Your belly is incredibly tense from ingesting so much in that little eating escapade you had with my father, so I'm going to ease it for you.  Alright?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was about to say something, but then Ruto started rubbing gently, caressing and massaging the tensest areas to Link's swollen stomach, and immediately, his stomachache almost seemed to fade away, instead all he could feel was blissfulness and satisfaction.  The feeling of Ruto's naturally cold and delicate hand massaging against his bloated midsection was indescribable.  Soon the moans of pain he was emitting became those of relaxation and ecstasy as he eased into putty in Ruto's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ruto was enjoying a similar bliss.  The feeling of Link's swollen but still muscular bare belly against her palm, her fingers, was every bit as wonderful as she envisioned it.  She was in awe at how fantastic Link looked and felt with a belly instead of his normally flat and tone abs.  More important than that, Link seemed much more relaxed and open to her in this state.  Maybe not enough to marry her, but intrigued enough to continue doing what he's doing; with her.  To her, he looked perfect to her, but then she found herself wanting Link's belly to get bigger.  To take on more and more food so she could ease his aches enjoy the feeling of his bloated belly against her Zora flesh.  It was blissful transcendence as she continued to massage his stomach.  That peace was soon interrupted when her massaging worked up some of the pent up air that had been festering in his gullet since the eating competition.  Link felt it rush up his throat and tried desperately to keep it concealed.  Ruto noticed this, then asked, \"Something wrong, Link?\"  Link shook his head nervously as he tried desperately to keep it contained, but it proved no good as the air forced its' way right out of his mouth and into Ruto's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink belched furiously for several seconds straight as Ruto winced at the hot air wafting over her face.  When his burp finally reached its' apex, Link's eyes widened with terror.  He had just burped in the face of a PRINCESS.  He then glanced back at her horrified, and desperately said, \"By the Goddess, I am SO sorry, Princess Ruto!   P-please forgive my vulgarity!\"  But Ruto said nothing.  Instead, she glanced back at Link and smiled, causing a look of confusion to take the place of his look of terror.  \"Mmmm, that smelled nice,\" she finally said.  \"....what?\" was all a dumbstruck Link could say in turn.<br>\r\n\"Come now, there's nothing to be ashamed of.  Your poor tummy's trying to work off a ridiculous amount of fish.  That's only natural.  Besides, in Zora culture, that's a sign of appreciation.  That you enjoyed your meal.\"<br>\r\n\"...It...it is?\"<br>\r\n\"If my father lets out half the noises he lets out in front of his subjects, then it's more than okay for you to ease some of that tension in your tummy.  Especially if it's just for me.  In fact, I insist,\" said Ruto, trying subtly to ease Link into embracing this new means of consumption and all its' forms.  Link glanced around a bit nervously, then shrugged, before saying, \"Well, in that case...\"  Link then thumped his chest a few times, until<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's second belch was even louder and bassier than before, carrying on longer and echoing throughout Ruto's chambers.  She smiled, watching Link sigh with the relief of letting loose so much excess air at once.  Patting his belly, he smiled back and said, \"Thank *uuuuuuuurrrrrrp* you for the fish, Ruto.  It was abso-*URP*-lutely fantastic,\" said Link, really getting relaxed, as Ruto had hoped.  He then moaned with delight and followed with, \"and I can't even begin to describe how wonderful this feels.  I can't remember the last time I ever felt so relaxed.  I mean this is better than the Death Mountain Hot Springs...\"<br>\r\n\"You're too kind,\" said Ruto with a smile as she continued to rub Link's belly, \"y'know...with Ganondorf and his minions slain, I bet thing's have dulled down a bit, haven't they?\"<br>\r\n\"Pffft, if that isn't the understatement of the century...\" responded Link as he rolled his eyes.  \"But still, Hyrule is finally at peace, and I could not ask for a better outcome.\"<br>\r\n\"Nor I.  As a sage, I am eternally grateful to our dearest savior for all of his efforts, and would like to repay him with the bliss and tranquility he deserves...\"</span></div></div>",

Link, too stuffed to oppose the idea, simply nodded as she helped him down towards their guest quarters.  \"Don't worry, you won't be disturbed in here.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Ruto.\" said Link, still clutching his sorely swollen middle.  As he entered the chambers and plopped onto the bed, Ruto unlocked a chest and took out a glowing green potion, then handed it to the still groggy Link.  \"What's this?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n\"Oh, consider it my own little reward to you for beating my father in that little competition.  It'll help ease the pain in your tummy, simply drink it and rest easy.  Also, the bottle's yours to do with whatever you please afterwards.\" responded Ruto.  Smiling, Link took the bottle and thanked her.  Ruto smirked back and took her leave, mentally chuckling to herself.  Finally alone, Link took a little look around the royal guest chambers.  Unlike a lot of Zora's domain, it seemed rather finely furnished.  Mirrors, a large closet with Zora-based armors and tunics locked away, but most importantly, a king sized bed, something a young man could very easy use to rest off such an intense food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the strange glowing potion, Link popped the cork open and took a whiff inside.  \"Doesn't smell too fishy...\" thought Link, before he shrugged and took a hearty swig of the potion, consuming it in one large gulp.  Pulling the bottle from his lips, Link belched loudly, then patted his belly happily.  \"Mmmm, not half bad!\" he said, a bit surprised, then he pressed against his belly curiously.  \"Well, I don't FEEL any different...maybe it takes effect after a nap or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Link plopped onto the bed, his gurgling stomach sticking upward by just a few inches as he rested one hand atop it and began rubbing in slow circular motions, before slowly drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few hours, Link woke up, only to discover...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Link and King Zora scarfed down as much fish as they could muster.  Link would rapidly tear the meat from the bones and stuff it straight into his mouth, while King Zora would simply stuff the whole fish in his mouth, and just swallow it whole.  Seeing such an inhuman display of consumption, Link tried to eat faster, getting a little more competitive as he consumed more and more fish at a rapidly speedy pace.  Ruto watched, enticed; watching a shirtless Link continue to desperately chomp away at fish meat.  The rest of his body was a perfect, muscular form, and his stomach; though still muscle bound, had begun to bloat outward quite noticeably with an ample amount of fish meat.  \"Wow, he really does look good with a bit of belly on him...\" she thought to herself as the competition continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time went on as the fish in their buckets continued to deplete rapidly.  But no matter how much Link consumed, the King was simply too vast an eater to defeat.  Link's eating pace began to slow down, as he winced in pain, groaning a bit as he reached over for another fish.  But as he brought it to his mouth, the young Hylian could eat no more.  Groaning a bit more audibly, Link dropped the fish back in the bucket and clutched his slightly bloated stomach in pain.  \"Urgh...n-no more...you win, your highness...\" groaned Link in pain as King Zora had just finished scarfing down every last piece of fish in his bucket and laughing heartily.  \"Oh ho ho!  A valiant effort indeed, young man!  But I fear you are out of your element when it comes to consuming fish against a Zora!  Let alone a Zora as vast as I!\" the King exclaimed, slapping his fat belly with both hands for emphasis.  He then looked down at Link, who was still groaning in pain and looking a bit ill, then tilted his head with a bit of concern.  \"Oh dear, you're beginning to look a little green around the gills there, my boy,\" said the King.    Link smirked a bit groggily and said, \"S-sorry, sire.  But...*urp*...I don't think I've ever eaten this much fish in my life...m-my stomach is killing me...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness.  Ruto?  Be a dear and please take our young champion to our guest quarters?\"  Ruto nodded and placed one of Link's arms around her shoulder as she assisted the young Hylian towards the royal guest quarters.  She gently placed Link atop the bed where he immediately plopped backwards, allowing his bare belly to stick upward a few inches.  Smiling, she sat besides him and began to rub his belly affectionately.  Link smiled with delight, enjoying Ruto's gentle massaging of his aching midsection.  \"Oh wow...Ruto, that feels incredible!\"  Ruto smiled and said, \"You've earned it, Link.\"  Feeling how tense and hard his bloated volleyball sized belly felt, she admired the touch and sensation more, and noted, \"You certainly outdid yourself this time, didn't you, Link?\"  Link opened his mouth to respond, but instead let out a huge belch which lasted several seconds straight.  Ruto laughed, patting Link's belly playfully and said, \"Well, excuse you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bit, Link tried to apologize, but burped once again instead, his face getting even more flush with embarrassment.  Ruto laughed a bit and said, \"Don't worry about it.  Your stomach's just not used to working off so much food at once.\"  Link shook his head and said, \"I almost had him too...\"  Ruto smirked and said, \"I've never seen a human keep up with my father as well as you did.  But he's unmatched when it comes to eating fish.\"  Link scowled and said, \"Well...let's see if I can't fix that...\"  Ruto, grinning a bit to herself, decided to egg Link on by adding, \"I don't know, Link.  The only being on all this land who can eat even REMOTELY as much as my father is Lord Jabu Jabu, and we saw first hand how big HIS belly is.\"  Link scoffed and, confidently but still weakly, said, \"If I can beat the King of Evil, but can't eat more than the King of Zoras, then what kind of hero am I?  I've gotta challenge your father to a rematch!  If I can train my stomach enough to be able to take in more food, I'll have no problem beating the king!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto continued to rub Link's belly and work up some more pent-up pressure pockets as she smirked to herself, seeing her plan come to fruition...</span></div></div>",

The only problem is you become twice as lazy, avoiding working out, sleeping frequently and just laying around all the time with little care to what's going on around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next makes you able to instantly digest food, making more room in your stomach for more food.

Always hungry for more and never getting full. However, it's greatest asset is also it's greatest drawback. You'll be constantly hungry, always thinking about food and getting hunger pangs when you don't eat within an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last spell changes your perspectives.
