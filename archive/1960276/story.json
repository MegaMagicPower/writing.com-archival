The one that has been angering many fan boys since 2010.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is now up to you to choose which one to make fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuidelines to pros and cons: Cons: The Space Jam version is more difficult to make fat without altering her personality somewhat, Pros: but it's well worth it if your writing talent is good enough and you will receive lots of praise for talent and determination to make it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPros: The Loony Toons Show version is easier to make fat due to dim wittedness (provided it be convincing enough) Cons: Unfortunately because she is the less popular of the 2 you may have to work extra hard to prevent any sort of backlash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... what's it gonna be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOops almost forgot, I will not allow \"cop-outs\" like, \"she just got hungry\" or she did it for no reason. The True Fan Fiction writer works with the characters personalities to the best possible degree. Not worps them to suit their purpose.</span></span></div></div>",

I hope you feel the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I know this next part isn't gonna make any sense but just bear with me on this one, this chapter begins a storyline that takes place in an alternate reality where the events of Space Jam never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that this Lola is the Space Jam version so why would I do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause looking back on it now I realize that the movie was an awful attempt at advertising, and that Lola Bunny was the only good thing to come out of it (aside from 2 soft songs in the soundtrack.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo please understand that everything else about the Loony Toons is the same as before. Lola still exists and she still has the same personality, she still plays basketball (until we make her too fat for it right? HA!), she did before she was remade into that show (go to the other version chapter for that one this isn't about her) and she and Bugs Bunny will still get to meet (or not depending on your choices).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway time to pick a setting/motivation for the beginning of her Weight Gain story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasketball Court = Lola is an amateur player who often plays by herself and gets lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym = She regularly works out at the gym in an attempt to stay skinny and so that some non-existent hunk will notice her when she makes a life-changing discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaf\u00e9 = On a day she takes off from playing Basketball, she becomes hooked on a certain food.

I honestlty don't understand how THIS Lola is less popular. The biggest gripe with the original character, to my understanding at least, was that she wasn't funny and way too serious. The current incarnation fixes that so what's the problem now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat  being said, here's my take on the WG scenario. It's based on canon events but feel free to change things. The first idea comes from an episode where Porky Pig, working as a caterer, improves business by dipping into his grandma's old recipes. Bugs becomes utterly addicted to delicious but unheathy treats like Butter Pie and Butter and Molasses Fritter, leading to him becoming quite huge. Shall we put Lola through a similar ordeal or something else?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bugs sighed and rolled his eyes; Porky was blowing the situation out of proportion again. Porky had received a large catering order for a party at some place or other in town. The problem was, said party had been cancelled due to a sudden change in the weather, which happened only after Porky had prepared all of his baked goods. The food he made was fresh, and were only in the best condition during the first few days of their creation. \"Porky, just get someone else to buy 'em, and your problem's solved.\"<br>\r\n\"B-b-but who would want to buy so much food on such short notice?\"<br>\r\nJust then Lola walked in causing Bugs to sigh in relief. Lola could be easily swayed, so he should have no problem convincing her to buy Porky's goods. He did feel slightly guilty for the way he was using her, however she was rich, and Porky could easily get annoying, so he didn't dwell upon the feeling for too long.<br>\r\n\"Ooh something smells nice!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lola,\" Bugs said, \"Porky made a truck-load of food, but no-one's buying it.

Her stomach started to growl, making her cheeks turn pink. She really hoped that food would arrive soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later the food arrived. When Bugs described the amount of food as a truck-load he hadn't been exaggerating. In fact, he'd made an understatement. Three huge trucks parked up in front of her apartment, and she could see men hauling the food she had purchased into bin bags, when she heard a knock on the door. She gave a squeal of excitement and ran to the door. When she opened it, she found a man stood there with a hard hat on his head and a clipboard in his hand.<br>\r\n\"Are you Miss... Lola Bunny?\" The man inquired, looking at her with a hint of confusion in his eyes. It isn't everyday you see a walking, talking rabbit, and he was new to the area, so didn't know about its more... Peculiar residents.<br>\r\n\"Yes! That's me!\" She replied, bouncing up and down in anticipation.<br>\r\n\"Ok.. Well to receive your order, sign here, here and here.\" He indicated to a different space on the paper each time he said the word 'here'.<br>\r\nShe frantically signed the paper, and jumped onto her couch, waiting for the food to be loaded in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several hours, but the men had finally managed to bring all of the food inside. Every room in her apartment was piled with food, and some of her furniture wasn't even visible due to the vast quantities of food piled upon it. Just then, her stomach rumbled again. If she thought that her stomach was loud before, then there were no words to describe its volume now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decides to feed her growling stomach, but what type of food does she start with?</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ve come with our catch of ze day!!\u201d announced the captain. One of the sailors lowered a crane carrying a net filled with schools of tuna, opening up as soon as it hit the deck. \u201cHooh, quite a lot are swimming about time of year, no?\u201d he commented. \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting quite ze haul zis month\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope gaped in a mixture of awe and elation, salivating greedily as she witnessed the massive pile of fish laying before her eyes. \u201cCome to mama, ma little tummy swimmers~\u201d she said, ambling towards the boat. But then she realized, shaking her head and snapping out of her trance. \u201cWait, how am I supposed to sneak zis into ze house without getting any of ze fishermen\u2019s attention?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her brain hatched an idea. She went to the nearest payphone and ordered a package from ACME. She was worried it would take some time to reach her, but Mailbird Roadrunner had only arrived with it in a matter of minutes. He stopped behind her, though she remained unaware of his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently placed Penny\u2019s order beside her with his beak, after which he notified his presence with his signature call. \u201cMEEP MEEP!!\u201d he beeped, heavily startling Penelope in the process. \u201cEEEEK!!\u201d she shrieked, jumping quite a distance upwards. Fortunately she landed on her feet, being a cat.<br>\r\nShe signed her name on the ACME contract, slightly annoyed by Roadrunner\u2019s noisy entrance. With that, Roadrunner beeped his gratitude to her for ordering before zooming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsheathing her claws, she tore open the package with joyous vigor, revealing it to be a bottle of Invisibility Perfume. She sprayed herself with it, snickering in glee as she did so. Sneaking aboard, she picked up as much fish as she could carry, making them invisible as well by rubbing them against the perfume droplets on her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed to her hideout, the perfume wearing out just as she reached its vicinity. She found a small hopper vent at the side of the house. \u201cI may need some assistance fitting through zis in a couple weeks\u201d she remarked to the viewers, giggling at her witty jest. She slipped inwards through the vent, landing on a front-load washing machine directly below it. She found herself in an empty laundry room which, while not completely filthy, was still shrouded by a lingering stench. \u201cPEW!! I might as well use some of zis stuff in here\u201d. She sprayed the room with her perfume...removing most of the walls in the process. \u201cAt least it smells nicer now, no?\u201d she said, somewhat embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped off the washing machine, ready to enjoy her quick-spoiling spoils but before she did so, she realized something. \u201cOh, I may need something to wash zis down\u201d. She went outside and used a payphone, ordering some milk to compliment her fish, as well as to aid in her plan to lose Pep\u00e9 once and for all, due to its notable fat content. Milkbird Roadrunner rushed in with her order, scaring her once again with his blaring beeps. \u201cEEEEK!! WOULD YOU CUT ZAT OUT!!?\u201d she rebuked. Roadrunner only stared, still displaying his mysteriously consistent grin, juxtaposing Penny\u2019s incandescent expression. After a moment of silence, he pulled out another contract, which Penny signed, more irritated than last time. Once again, he beeped his gratitude and belted off. \u201cHmph, and people say my kind are rude.\u201d she said, already growing sick of Roadrunner\u2019s inconsiderate appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently carried the bottles through the vent, careful not to shatter them. \u201cAnd now, \u2018tis time to feast. Bon app\u00e9tit.\u201d she said proceeding to stuff herself with fish and milk. She ate like a queen, savoring every bite and enjoying every gulp. By the time she was finished, her provisions were picked clean, surrounding her with empty bottles and fish skeletons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope lied supinely in the middle of the room, sighing in satisfaction with her recent bout of gluttony. She looked down and poked at her distended stomach. \u201cZis may be food now, but as I carry on with ma gluttonous scheme, it\u2019ll turn into fat, and continue to build up in my system until ma thin, graceful figure becomes so plump and juicy, zat Le Pew will be far too disgusted by it to ever chase moi again. Ohohohoho, Penelope you genius, you\u2019ve finally found a way to rid your life of zat troublesome skunk once and for all!\u201d she said to herself, proudly reminiscing the successful unfolding of her master plan. \u201cYawwwwwn, all zat stuffing has made me quite fatigu\u00e9e. I had better get some rest.\u201d she said, falling asleep soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passing weeks were spent routinely, with Penelope using bottles of Invisibility Perfume to smuggle the S.S Canard Assis\u2019s daily catches into her ramshackle refuge, guzzling them down with milk, and dozing til they digest. She eventually began to gain some weight during her heists, slowing her down gradually, which she compensated for by using up more perfume to stay invisible longer. As every few days passed, her figure started to plump. Her limbs grew thicker, her face became chubbier, and her tummy got softer. And her wiggles through the vent got tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rose over the horizon as the last day of the month arrived. A small ray of sunlight shone through the small hopper vent and onto a mound of fish bones. Awakened, Penelope arose from it, yawning and stretching. She smacked her lips and began to scratch her stomach, only for her claws to sink in much deeper than they usually do. \u201cHmm!?\u201d she said, looking down intrigued. Her previously slender tummy has now grown significantly rounder and flabbier. She jumped to her feet, causing it to jiggle a bit. \u201cOh!\u201d she cried, startled by the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly bulges out so far it manages to obstruct her feet. When she leaned over to see them, she noticed her previously svelte legs now look like she was being supported by a pair of plump, charred sausages, with no hint of a thigh gap between them.<br>\r\nShe then moved onto her arms, which have also grown quite pudgy. She pinched her upper arm, squeezing a relatively considerable amount of flesh from it. \u201cMy limbs, they\u2019ve gotten so...plump\u201d she said.<br>\r\nShe lowered her gaze back to her belly, drooping down like a giant marshmallow was melting from her torso. She groped it, feeling it\u2019s flesh bulge between her chubby fingers. She felt her sides, squeezing her newly formed love handles. \u201cAnd ma waist. It has become so round and squishy. It...fills my hands trying to grab it!\u201d.<br>\r\nShe moved her hands toward her face. \u201cEven ma cheeks have plumped up\u201d she said, grabbing her chubby cheeks. And finally, she moved a finger down to her chin, finding it encompassed by a soft, thick layer of excess fat. \u201cI\u2019ve grown a...double chin\u201d.<br>\r\nShe\u2019d finally done it, weeks of excessive feeding and sleeping between meals have considerably softened her body.<br>\r\n\u201cLook at moi, I\u2019m so...so fat\u201d she said, mesmerized by her new, hefty figure. She found it hard to believe she\u2019d ever get this fat in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing her plan\u2019s final stage can finally commence, her eyes narrowed and ears lowered behind her head as a malicious grin slowly spread across her face. A low, deep, vengeful laugh escaped her lips. \u201cPrepare to be repulsed by ma plumpness, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew\u201d she said, rubbing her paws together. Abandoning her shelter, she jumped off the washing machine and through the vent, only to get stuck. She struggled to escape, but was far too chubby to budge. \u201c...well, I wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d she said to the viewers, alluding to her statement earlier that month. Luckily, she saw Mailbird Roadrunner zipping towards her path in the distance and called for help. Rushing over, he grabbed her paw with his beak and tugged as hard as he could. She managed to squeeze free and got up to dust herself. \u201cMerci, monsieur oiseau\u201d she said, grateful for him despite his previously annoying behavior towards her. She then asked for a ride to Pep\u00e9\u2019s perfumerie, to which he complied and carried her there on back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching her destination, she hopped off and waved Roadrunner goodbye. Striding confidently to the entrance, she knocked the door, followed by Pep\u00e9 opening it. \u201cM-M-MADAME!!?\u201d he squawked, shocked by her new appearance \u201cIS...IS ZAT REALLY YOU!!?\u201d She smirked, ready to strike. \u201cWhy, yes it is~\u201d she said seductively, despite her opposing intentions. \u201cHave you noticed how...soft I\u2019ve become over ze month~?\u201d she said, patting her tummy. \u201cOh I couldn\u2019t help myself, I\u2019ve been indulging in lots of savory, delicious food. And look at what zat\u2019s turned me into: a big, fat, marshmallow of a kitty~\u201d she giggled, jiggling her belly. \u201cAre you willing to accept moi after zis, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPep\u00e9 stood there, addled by her question.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">We've all seen someone we like from Loony Toons Expand and get fat once in a while, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and others. But never the women, (sure there would be a fat one every once in a great while but we've never seen one of the iconic characters ever go from skinny to fat, at least not yet,) But now is your chance to give the girls/women their fair chance at expansion. At your leisure, Just be sure to follow the very few basic rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: Only the anthropomorphic (talking animals) are to be the ones who pack on  the pounds (Characters Like Elmyra, and Granny, are off limits, because nobody really wants to see that.) But I digress it's ok to put them in as mentioned or have them play bit parts. They just can't be the main focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Because the Rating of this item is 13+ your not allowed to make the characters have sex, or mention any of their private parts by name (even though on chars like Bugs Bunny they cannot be seen even when they ARE naked, CARTOON LOGIC AHO!!) But it is ok to make them kiss mouth to mouth because let's face it's already been done plenty of times in the cartoons... if you know what I'm talking about... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: As much as I support gay rights I'm afraid I can't allow homosexual couples here in this story, no offense please don't sue me it's just that strait couples give a WIDER sense of variety, that is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope that covers everything. And here is a link to  a very long List of all Loony Toons Characters published by The Warner brother's company.</span>  <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Looney_Tunes_and_Merrie_Melodies_characters\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Looney_Tunes_and_Merrie_Melodies_characters...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Oops.
