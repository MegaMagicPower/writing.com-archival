He had no time to react before he was swamped over by her seemingly endless tons of soft creamy blubber and he was only the first to feel Noel's surging girth her humongous rolls and handles not to mention every other part of her being spreading through every part of The 13th Hierarchical City \"Kagutsuchi\" as she effortlessly engulfed the entirety of the town with so much of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel herself was unaware of this startling change only much later would she awaken to realize that Kagutsuchi was no more and in it's place was a grand city-sized Noel Vermillion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards no one really opposed the idea of renaming the city after the mountainous blonde especially after she had decided that everyone should continue living out their lives on her gargantuan flab. Surprisingly the NOL did not step in, strangely the current Imperator Librarius along with Hazama seemingly disappeared after Noel's tremendous fat flooded over Kagutsuchi, some with an understandable hatred for Terumi believed they were still out there, somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said life began anew and while it was her idea Noel was still a bit unnerved whenever it clicked in her head that she was truly the size of a grand city! Still she had her friends to help and support her and on this day after she had awaken from her slumber Noel felt the sensation of someone approaching her still adorable yet fat-surrounded face.</span></div></div>",

It was a small, rather cute yawn that contrasted with how heavily the city-sized beauty had slept, small tears forming in the corners of her eyes as she closed them. Even at this size, her fat arms had managed to reach up close to her face, but were still stubby from all the flowing fat in her body. Noel's emerald-green eyes were half closed as they focused, a figure approaching her. The shape seemed somewhat recognizable, but it seemed different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep well?\" A friendly, albeit somewhat teasing, female voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ts-Tsubaki...?\" Noel asked sleepily. She was still groggy and she had to try and stifle another yawn as she looked at the figure in front of her. The woman held her ground and took a firm stance, holding her hat in place from the rush of wind as Noel yawned once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it was Tsubaki. She was still wearing her NOL uniform, but for some reason it was black. Noel's eyes focused more as she opened them up and was she surprised. Since she last saw her, Tsubaki had become rather plump, having gained at least a good 80lbs since they last met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what happened to you, Tsubaki?\" Noel asked, of course. Her voice was still a bit tired, as she was, but she was mostly awake now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh well Izayoi went out of control at one point, thanks to Hazama. My uniform changed after it happened, but I snapped back when I saw-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Tsubaki froze in place as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, do you mean my new figure? W-well I just took to eating a lot after I broke free of Izayoi and...after I came to terms about Major Kisaragi\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel didn't know what she should rightly be feeling at this moment. Tsubaki had been trying to kill her recently, but had finally come back to terms. Somehow, she was back. Her dear, dear friend was once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki smiled as she looked at Noel's face, the city-sized girl's brilliant gold hair blowing in the wind brilliantly. She carefully tread up Noel's flab, climbing on her hands and knees towards her face. Unsure what to think at first, blushing as she got the wrong idea, Tsubaki gently took Noel's hair, pinned it back and then placed Noel's old blue beret back on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not with NOL anymore but...you always did look nice like this.\" Tsubaki said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel blushed, smiling shyly as she looked appreciatively at her old friend with her large, innocent eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsubaki's smile deepen slightly as she took in the sight of Noel's shy blush just looking into her friend's wonderful set of eyes the redhead momentarily lost herself in them completely forgetting how immense the blonde had become due to Hazama's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the thought of Terumi's alias Tsubaki's demeanor harden luckily for her Noel failed to catch the quick change of expression. She was no slouch however and Tsubaki was able to recover fast enough before she could insert a sense of worry into the city-sized girl's mind. She was still Noel after all, there was just a lot more of her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I take a seat?\" Tsubaki asked with a bit of rare amusement in her vocal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Tsubaki...there's...plenty of me to go around now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blush from before returning as Noel responded with the same bit of rare humor just as Tsubaki had earlier. To her credit the redhead figured that growing into a literal city-wide beauty must still weigh heavy on Noel, Tsubaki doing her best to silence the chuckle born from the rather unfortunate pun in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it appeared to her that something must have triggered in Noel's mind her bright peaceful eyes lighting up similar to that of a child's receiving a new toy. It was far too adorable causing her to quickly turn her head to one side in an attempt to hide the hard blush on her heated cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with a smile on her lips Tsubaki let out a short cough just before Noel spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki...it just dawned on me, I'm so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Noel you're just realizing that now?\" Tsubaki interrupted with a friendly bit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I mean, Tsubaki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde responded as she forcefully puffed up her already puffy cheeks. She was so flustered and yet so adorable it took a great deal of Tsubaki's self-control to not latch herself onto Noel and never let go, a part of her wondering if this was how Makoto often felt when around their blonde best friend. Of course the squirrel girl often did latch on but that was besides the point she thought in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\" Tsubaki asked as she attempted to clear her head of her previous thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...um...my...bre...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could easily see the struggles Noel was going through unsure of what was causing them as well as curious of the blonde's realization she urged her to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My..boo..\" Noel again struggled to get the proper words out. Still puzzled Tsubaki leaned in vastly closing the distance between them. Both ladies however seem to ignore the lack of personal space as Noel whispered into Tsubaki's awaiting ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your\" Tsubaki paused just as Noel finished explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your...breasts...you're wondering about your breast size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel nodded quickly yet carefully, remembering she didn't want to cause any violent waves to surge through her city-sized girth, her embarrassment clearly showing as her face lid up in a strong shade of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain to her credit Tsubaki recalled Noel's notable self-esteem issues when it came to her lack of bustiness, Makoto and her always did their best to cheer her up even if their own ample chests didn't help things at times especially when it came to Makoto...that said just as before she'd be here for Noel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Tsubaki you have to tell me.\" Noel stated nearly whimpering there was no way she could deny her now so with a quick assuring sigh Tsubaki smiled if Noel wanted the truth she'd get the truth.</span></div></div>",

She hadn't even been given the good news and already Tsubaki was feeling elated just picturing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't see from here.\" Tsubaki said smiling, \"But your breasts are just as big as the rest of you. In fact, I think some have said they're quite large even for a woman of your proportions!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel was silent for a moment, a look of utter awe on her face. Tsubaki wondered if this news had been too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're not...you're not lying are you...?\" Noel asked shyly, her expression changing to a somewhat pouty and nervous one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki smiled reassuringly and reached into a pocket on her outfit. Out of it, she pulled a picture of Noel, city sized as she was now, and showed it to the absurdly fat and absurdly adorable woman's face. Noel's mouth opened slightly agape, her eyes shimmering as she looked at the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a cascading mass of fat who really had spread out so much there was no long a trace of Kagutsuchi anymore, that much she had already known. However, in the picture she was able to see a pair of huge, massive orbs on her chest. Breasts. Large, wonderful fatty breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel's eyes opened wide as she squealed with glee and giddy, childlike laughter gushed forth. Tsubaki was holding everything back to not be overtaken by just how sweet the blubbery beauty was acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I'm busty Tsubaki!\" Noel cried out in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost looked as if she would break out into tears of joy any moment. In order to at least get in something to enjoy more of Noel's uncanny blubbery cuteness, Tsubaki lay down around the blond's thick neck and hugged her while looking up at her face. Noel seemed to calm down as she looked down at Tsubaki, eye demeanor returning to that of the shy \"shrinking violet\" that many knew her as. She was still celebrating inside now that she was a shrinking violet with possibly the biggest breasts in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Noel...\" Tsubaki said nervously as she looked up at her. Tsubaki's face was almost as red as her hair as she looked up at Noel's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...Tsubaki...did you have something important to tell me? You seemed to have serious business when you came up here. U-uh, not that I don't think that's the only reason...I like being with you...a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel's gaze shifted to the side as her face turned pink again. Tsubaki's eyes opened a bit. It was true, she did have something important to tell Noel.</span></div></div>",

Understandably Noel was astounded yet the passion from deep within her dearest friend soon overcame her and she found herself closing her eyes just as Tsubaki had the moment their lips met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Noel actually felt her grand self quiver just a tiny bit after Tsubaki had pulled away almost instantly noticing the expression of embarrassment on the redhead's face, clearly this was one of those rare spontaneous moments Tsubaki had ever taken part in. She wasn't sure what to properly say so she waited for much thinner woman to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Noel...I've just, I've been waiting to do that for some time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer confession surprised Noel the first thing that came to mind was how she was well aware of her friend's affection for Jin Kisaragi, what had changed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait she remembered how earlier Tsubaki had mentioned she had \"come to terms about Major Kisaragi\" it was something she had put out of her mind as two of them began to better converse with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it was Makoto that made me realize it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It?\" Noel innocently questioned curiosity filling her emerald eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Major...Jin he has his own things he must accomplish and while I can always support him, I can't be with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel watched in respectful silence as she nearly make out the short sense of sadness overcome her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said when I finally got around to speaking with Makoto she made me realize something, Noel. As horribly cliche as it may sound what I needed, no who I needed was always in front of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki smiled softly as she stared directly into Noel's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it to Makoto to tell me that I had just focused on the wrong blonde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared another kiss Tsubaki taking the lead until Noel shyly joined in as they stayed locked together for sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly due to a need for air did the two of them part from another Tsubaki, much like Noel herself, smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe that I've fallen hard for you, Noel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And like I said I've always enjoyed being with you, Tsubaki.\" Noel responded in her usual shy fashion which only fed the emotional fire burning inside of Tsubaki the flush on her face once again as deep as her hair as she felt the returning desire to take in the taste of Noel's gentle lips...but as she leaned in there came a sudden interruption...</span></div></div>",

She heard an audible growling, followed by Tsubaki's cheeks flushing, for a different reason that before. Noel giggled, her puffy face lighting up with simple amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry, huh?\" The bulbous woman giggled with a simple, cute smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki started smiling herself, the blush not fully dissipated from her face, and only nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment some men and women in robes arrived. They were former Ars Magus users of the NOL who had decided to serve in tending to the new living city's daily needs along with others. For now, they simply came by to bring Noel her breakfast, loaded inside of massive bowls that either needed to be lifted through use of magic or by aircraft, which were believed to have, at one point, been normally sized before being resized through Ars Magus. At Noel's request, they also brought normal sized portions for Tsubaki to enjoy with her beloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Tsubaki actually had a reason for putting on weight, one that was of great importance to her. She was keeping it a surprise, though for how long it could be labeled as one she didn't rightly know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would also be hard for her to eat if all she could concentrate on was staring at Noel's face as she enjoyed her own food. Noel's smiling was too damn cute for her to look away and watching her get crumbs around her mouth, the embarrassed pink flush on her puffy face as she burped, followed by a bit of shy pouting before going back to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering she was still rather hungry, Tsubaki climbed up to Noel's face and grabbed one of the huge \"crumbs\" that had fallen from a steamed dumpling she had been eating, which was the size of a basketball. Opening her mouth, Tsubaki started to take large bites out of it, which Noel found somewhat strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well someone has to help keep you clean. Plus, why let good food go to waste?\" Tsubaki said teasingly with a wink as she stuck her tongue partway out of her mouth, then proceeded to eat another giant crumb laying around nearby on Noel's vast flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel sighed after another small burp, wishing she had enough reach with her arms to rub all of her blubbery belly after that meal. It was nice to know that she certainly didn't have to worry about watching her weight anymore, the thought making her giggle to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki felt content, if rather stuffed, thanks to her own meal. She laid back, comfortably sinking into soft, creamy fat underneath her like a foam mattress. She rubbed her stuffed belly, standing out as a bloated sphere underneath her uniform. Laying near Noel, in her cloud-like flab and this feeling of fullness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki mused if this was really heaven for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Tsubaki...?\" Noel asked nervously, her vibrant eyes shifting nervously a little as she smiled politely. Her puffy cheeks were pink again thanks to the adorable young woman's uncanny shyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki rolled over and raised herself from within the flab around Noel's neck. She walked right back up to Noel's face before laying back down in her flab. Noel couldn't help but notice Tsubaki's plump rear behind her as she laid down, making her face turn a deeper, redder pink her pupils dilating slightly. Noel took in some deep breaths, being careful not to accidentally suck up and swallow Tsubaki while also trying not to disrupt the lives of the people who lived on her.

Noel closed her eyes and pouted as she kept trying, which Tsubaki started to notice. Noel finally gave up with a moan of disappointment, which was so cute and admittedly silly Tsubaki could only laugh, a wide grin forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in and gave Noel a smooch on her lips, placing her hands on Noel's fat face.

Her already enticingly short orange skirt rose much higher now, showing off her ample, fat-enlarged ass and her breasts became almost twice as large as they were before. However, both of them knew much better than to assume Makoto's softer body meant she was any softer on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto...Tsubaki I understand now but...why did you put on weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beastkin woman's face became laid back as she tilted her head, raising her arms behind her head and shifted her eyes upwards as she recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...when you were blimping up from Adventus, I wound up checking in on other hierarchical cities. But, each of them had such great places to eat off the beaten path, it was insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's grin returned in full force, accompanied by a small amount of drool running down from the corners of her mouth as familiar tastes and memories of soups, grilled meats, sweets and so forth teased her tongue, making her stomach growl as she did.

As she did, she looked away, blushing lightly with a guilty look on her face that seemed to equate to a shy \"Shut up, both 'a ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you two finally hooked up did you?\" She said passingly after swallowing a mouth of nuts. Noel and Tsubaki both flushed, their faces lighting up like street lights at their friend's comment as they looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's grin became wider and more mischievous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh so you really do work like *that* do you~?\" She teased, her eyes half-closed in a catty glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blobby city-sized girl and her smaller red haired companion remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...we're....\" Noel responded as she pouted nervously.

Meanwhile Noel could do nothing but watch her own face that familiar shade of pink unsure as to what she should say or do in this certain situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after releasing the poor woman the squirrel girl chuckled in a mighty manner as Tsubaki attempted to cool her flushed face, things had been so hectic for a while she had forgotten how playful Makoto could be.

She always made sure to keep herself well-fed, lest this city-sized girl's rumbling belly cause an earthquake for her denizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki sighed, looking down at her stomach. She decided she could eat another bite or two, plus she didn't mind gaining much more weight. If anything, it would help her get that much closer to her beloved Noel. Makoto however was just happy to eat and before she could see, the energetic squirrel had already latched herself onto Noel's thick neck and puffy face, Noel crying out from how sudden it was and how Makoto's breasts and belly squished against her. As shocking as it was, she admitted that the feeling of another person's fat body against her own felt pleasant. Maybe if Tsubaki gained more weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of asking her was too embarrassing, making her face flush even though Makoto had pulled herself off (with some urging by Tsubaki, but nonetheless) which neither of the two noticed because they were busy talking among themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food came shortly, once again brought in huge portions for Noel with some normal sized dishes brought for Tsubaki and Makoto. Tsubaki herself mused that maybe they should bring an extra Noel-sized dish if they were to quell Makoto's appetite, which made her squirrel friend puff up her cheeks and flick her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki groaned inside. How was is possible for one person to be this cute!? She couldn't tear her eyes away even as she ate while she watched Noel happily stuff her mouth full of food, accompanied by childlike happy cooing as she ate with a wide smile. Her heart felt tight as she had to learn forward and hold down a groan for some reason as she observed Noel happily eating her second breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto herself showed as big an appetite as ever, devouring and slurping up food like she had been starving for days, letting crumbs and broth stick to her face and even fall down onto her person, staining her top and her plump belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki finally managed to tear herself away from Noel, her gaze fixated on Makoto. If she got thicker, like her friend, if she got fatter would Noel...would she like it? This tough, while it started out as passing, began to get taken out of context by Tsubaki's affection. What was a query became a possibility and then a goal. What started out as \"Would Noel like it if I got fatter?\" became \"I must get fatter for Noel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that thought, her stomach felt less bloated and Tsubaki began to tear into her food. Noel herself was surprised. As long as she knew, Tsubaki always had a humble and well-mannered approach when she ate her food, but now she was tearing right in. To make things even more surprising...</span></div></div>",

That did not, however, mean she wouldn't show signs of discomfort as she tried her dearest to pack food inside of her bloated stomach. Makoto was already eating up a storm as usual, but the redhead still had to keep up! It still came with a cost however; in her effort to out eat her gluttonous friend, Tsubaki's stomach began to puff up and swell larger as it became filled with more and more food.

She began to slow down, eating slower, eating less food at once...eventually she felt so stuffed she had to put her food down and placed her hands on her swollen, plump stomach, allowing a tired belch to pass her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki struggled, but she still hung in. Makoto had stopped, all she needed to do was eat more food than her now.

The Noel she knew was a gigantic city-sized girl and yet here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki!\" Noel repeated with a wide smile as she made her way over happily wrapping her arms around the taller girl's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki was taken back by the sudden affection yet there was no possible way she could deny Noel any sort of returned affection. As she wrapped her own arms around the smaller blonde she came to notice that she too was wearing her old school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it ultimately mattered to her all that really did matter was that she her lovely Noel in her arms. The two girls smiling neither saying a word as their lips met with one another. Tsubaki drinking in the blonde's sweet innocence while her own mature nature led Noel forward as their kiss deepen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel smiled her usual smile as they broke away asking the redhead if something was a matter she denied with a simple sway of her head instead she simply focused on the shy beauty before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused however when she came to notice that Noel was notably bigger, chubby pairs of arms and legs along with a cute muffin top causing the top of her uniform to ride up a tad bit. As the blonde titled her head innocently to one side she also noticed the slight double-chin beginning to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this felt off yet she shook it aside as she reached back toward her love restarting their lip lock from before. Unaware that as they continued kissing she too was beginning to grow fatter and of course the same could be said for Noel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Tsubaki pulled away as her now exposed belly began rubbing against Noel's own stellar flab several sizes larger then the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me Tsubaki.\" Noel requested and as usual there was no denying the blonde beauty, no part of her even wondering where the tray of food had appeared from. Instead she kissed a single strawberry before slipping it into Noel's awaiting mouth her love giggling as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went Tsubaki feeding the growing Noel until she was fully immobile enough to serve as a makeshift bed for the redhead who was currently busy smothering the adorable blob of a blonde with kiss after kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt as if she were in own private heaven and it wasn't until she overheard her name being called out to her that her subconscious began to fade out of the dream world and back into the reality she had always known.</span></div></div>",

She could be considered outright fat with a rather impressive-looking bust, a jiggly, fulsome and round posterior and a plump, somewhat bulging, belly. Tsubaki grabbed at her new bulk, squeezing it at both sides in her hands, eliciting another giggle from Noel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look...you look cute like this.\" She admitted, her puffy face flushing pink as a guilty, shy smile formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki's face instantly burned as it shone red as her hair, her blue eyes nervously darting around as she let go of her belly, folded her hands on her lap and could only think to respond with flustered giggling. She was so embarrassed, she didn't even realize what Noel was asking her until she saw the blushing, bulbous blond's lips moving, but no sound coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...I'm sorry what did you say?\" Tsubaki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel looked down, pouting as her whole fat face turned pink, nervously trying to gather her words.</span></div></div>",

She had a full, round belly that reached down past her crotch area, huge breasts that must have outsized her head by three cup sizes and an ass so massive, full, round and jiggly that when she finally managed to get up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIIIIIP!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge rip formed in her pants behind her, revealing her white panties with wing outlines on them. Realizing this, Tsubaki could only let out a cry of embarrassment as she did her best to cover her exposed butt with her plump, gloved hands, her bangs falling over her eyes and her rounder and plumper face turning red as a cherry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel stared at Tsubaki, admiring her new figure. She looked so thick, so soft and round and so...beautiful. True, as far as she remembered her friend had always looked wonderful, but now something about her with all her new and thick fat was...inexplicably alluring to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you look wonderful Tsubaki...\" Noel complimented her now rather thick love shyly, her voice quieted by her shy nature as her cheeks became pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki looked up at Noel's puffy face and smiled.

She hoped this didn't mean that degree of eating was normal for Makoto and her family, and to a greater extent hoped her friend never invited her over for dinner lest she remain grounded at the table by her own full belly, like recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting that out of her mind, Tsubaki walked towards Noel's face in order to see about showering her beloved with kisses. At first moving was awkward due to the redhead's thick, puffy fat legs which rubbed together so closely as she walked she needed to split them apart and in order to keep balance she held her thick arms out by her sides a bit, turning her walk into a full on waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel blushed as she observed Tsubaki's thicker form approach her, feeling the reverberations from Tsubaki's heavier figure walking along her plentiful creamy fat before she made it to Noel's face.

As she continued on her body seem to blow up at an intense degree Makoto happily giggling as doughy snacks and thick calorie-filled portions of food fell into her mouth, down her throat, and eventually ending up in her awaiting expanding stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good!\" she stated with a chuckle before stuffing her mouth full of various treats her body further exploding with new fat just so it was large enough to house the absurd amount of food the squirrel girl was gorging on, it was doubtful if Makoto was even aware that she may have already doubled her weight and at her stellar pace she'd soon triple her size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brought up the question just how far was Makoto willingly to go? At what point would the perky squirrel girl consider herself \"big enough\"? It was hard to see if even she had an answer at the moment as she continued to press on her focus solely on getting fatter and fatter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Makoto laughed to herself as she gripped her blubbery belly, food packed in her cheeks in a manner befitting of her squirrel nature as she admired her impressive bust looming in front of her gaze. If she was gonna do this, she was gonna go all the way. Every piece of food in front of her had to go, no question about it! With her nigh limitless stomach and determination, Makoto continued to stuff and fill herself, fat piling onto her body with each mouthful of food. She started gathering up the giant crumbs from Noel's meals and eating those too, stuffing them in her mouth like giant nuts before chewing them up and swallowing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto licked her lips as morsel after morsel passed them. Her ditzy manner of thought took over as she mused about how wonderful it was letting herself go. She ate what she wanted, when she wanted to and on top of all that all this fat didn't feel half bad! Plus, it wasn't like it was any different from what she did every winter. Makoto chuckled as she remembered that year in the Academy when she went too far with it and when Noel opened the door to her room, the then lithe blond was swamped by the creamy, soft fat of Makoto's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess the reason I got these curves is all that hibernation bulk stuck.</i> Makoto mused, laughing inwardly as she stuffed some tasty nut bread slathered in butter and cooked in bacon using a hot plate Makoto had brought with her. Just in case, she had told Kokonoe as she went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she thought a little more, it was sort of ironic. Every winter she had gorged herself, Noel had somehow fallen victim to her soft fat, even if it was simply a surprise hug that trapped her shy, emotional friend in her thick fat. The way Noel blushed and reacted staring at her afterwards was probably a heads up in regards to her now apparent interest in women, especially fat ones, if Tsubaki was any indication. Whatever it was, Makoto shrugged to herself as she stuffed another helping of fat-laden food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">BB</font><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">UUU</font>urrrpp!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto allowed a rather unladylike belch to pass her lips as she sighed happily. She enjoyed the noontime sun shining on her as she lay in Noel's bountiful, downy flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Noel eats at the rate she has been...eheh...*Urp!* She'll have to be re-dubbed as the 12th Hierarchical city by next week...\" Makoto mused as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick fat decorating her must have made her close to double Tsubaki's size by now. Her huge breasts looked like small beachballs, the perky round orbs swollen with fat. Makoto giggled as she hefted them in her thick, doughy arms, making them bounce in a playful and alluring manner. Her face had rounded out, her adorable round face and puffy cheeks making her look more squirrel-like on her own and her blubbery butt, which made her skirt nigh-on useless with it's bubbling, bountiful size and accompanying flared, fat hips, revealing only her enticingly small black underwear, her thick and blubbery legs spread apart as Makoto lay on her back so they had room on their own, since her fat thighs pressed so close together now. Her belly stood in front of her like an impressive, looming mass of lard and fat, blocking almost her whole vision as she laid back and spread down to her calves. She would just barely be mobile if she could find the strength to stand up, but that suited her just fine. She was used to it from all her \"Hibernation feasts\" and last she checked, her limit was...what was it again?, she wondered as the number disappeared from her head. Well it was more then this, she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto sighed, leaning up from her comfortable position and looking down at her much thicker, jigglier body as she let an amused laugh escape her mouth.</span></div></div>",

Yup they were still adorably cuddling together but that wasn't what surprised her...what had was the fact that Tsubaki had gotten fatter since she last laid eyes on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How the?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered truly confused as to how the redhead had puffed herself up without her picking up on such a change? It's true she was occupied moments ago with her feasting but still she should have been able to have seen Tsubaki plump up from at least a corner of either eye. So what gives how did she pull off such a move?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few grunts of annoyance later, wither they were born from physical frustration or from her best friend's sudden growth was anyone's guess, Makoto at last found her proper footing her blubbery form jiggling loosely for a moment or two. Determined to find out how Tsubaki grew she began making her way over toward the young lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing Noel's soft creamy neck fat proved to be quite a enjoyable pillow for Tsubaki her eyes shut yet not quite asleep yet. She wasn't sure if Noel was however and soon she got her answer when her the massive blob of a blonde called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sense of justice and need to protect Noel at any cost caused her eyes to snap open! Had that monster Hazama returned for Noel? If he had even with this new weight of hers she'd give him everything she had to keep her love safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way that snake is ever taking Noel again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted when Noel mentioned that it was Makoto who was making her way over toward them and the reason behind her surprised tone was because their furry friend had plumped herself up while the two of them were busy so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Noel thankful that Tsubaki had failed to catch her deepening blush as the redhead choose instead to focus on Makoto's approaching form instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had made her way over Makoto and Tsubaki each wore expressions of confusion it seemed that neither wanted to mention about the other's new gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look cute with that new weight, Makoto.\" Noel muttered out shyly ironically being the one to break the sudden air of silence between them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks Noel\" Makoto mentioned with a quick smile before she turned back towards Tsubaki, \"So um...well shoot I'm just going to say it, how did ya get fatter without me noticing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto asked poking a plump finger deep into Tsubaki's doughy belly, the redhead's face flaring up to match her hair as she instinctively swatted away her friend's hand. With that done she could concentrate on what Makoto had asked of her.</span></div></div>",

Tsubaki looked downwards with a shy pout on her face, her crimson blush deepening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto, not wanting to seem rude, lightly cleared her throat, her tail moving from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh sorry!\" Noel's innocent green eyes shimmered as she returned back to the main subject. \"Well...Tsubaki actually had something more important to tell me, but she said it could wait after her...confession. I asked what it was while you were busy and she told me what it was. It turns out, because of the fact I was, I guess, too happy and optimistic for Hazama's plan to succeed, instead all the Azure Grimoire I was given had released inside of me was pure energy. However...because of my emotions and my memories flashing before me, as well as trying to hold onto my consciousness, a few...subconscious desires shone through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel shyly looked away, her eyes glimmering as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of them...that energy was stored inside of me as massive amounts of fat, as you can clearly see. In other words, the fat stored inside of me is literally pure energy created by the power of the Azure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's eyes were wide as her tail stood on end. So Noel's fat was just all the power Terumi released!? So by making her this fat...no, even if she was powerful how could she fight in her current state?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait, hold on...what does that have to do with Tsubaki suddenly plumping up?\" Makoto asked, placing her hands on her wider hips, her thick arms pressing against the side of her corpulent belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm getting too. It seems that, because what I hold is the True Azure, I can control it at will. And...since I can't really fight, I decided to bestow some power to Tsubaki since...well, why wouldn't I trust her with my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki smiled brilliantly, folding her hands behind her as best she could. Makoto scratched her head as she closed her eyes and thought for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get it. So since you decided to power up Tsubaki, like you, all the energy you gave to her became a bunch of fat right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel wanted to nod, but since her neck fat prevented that she just said it outright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. And because the energy comes from the Azure, who knows? It may even make her Ars Magus less risky to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto didn't expect this. Then again, Kokonoe mentioned something about high energy readings the day Noel became the new 13th city, which may have been it. She was honestly surprised Noel didn't explode or something from all that energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...wait, how exactly DID you give your energy to Tsubaki anyway?\" Makoto asked out of genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel's soft, puffy face lit up pink as she tried to gather her words. She started wishing she knew where in her flab Bolverk, her guns, had been buried so she could feel a bit more confident and less shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...\"</span></div></div>",

She just wanted to provoke them into showing her what they meant. Noel blushed, her puffy pink face staring downwards. Tsubaki exhibited a flustered expression herself, but still tried to keep calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean...? You just want to see Noel make me fatter through kissing me. N-not that I mean that's a bad thing at all, I just...I-I mean I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki fumbled after that, her speech quieting into mere embarrassed mutterings as she clasped her hands together, squishing the sides of her thick arms against her doughy, soft belly. Makoto's grin widened, if it were even possible and her ears twitched. She thought she had them where she wanted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just show me. I mean, what's wrong with lovers making out?\" Makoto teased further, making a kissy face as she did while crossing her arms as best she could stand to with her breasts and corpulent belly in their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki and Noel looked into each other's eyes. Their faces were lit up with shy blushes as they thought to themselves at first, but then Tsubaki gently placed her soft, plump hands on Noel's adorable puffy cheeks, kept her ocean blue eyes locked on Noel's eyes of crisp emerald. She leaned in slowly, making Makoto's heart beat in her chest as she felt herself start to get caught up in the passion of the moment, munching on some movie popcorn she found stuck in some of Noel's flab. Tsubaki gingerly kissed Noel's lips while wrapping her thick arms as best she could around Noel's thick, fat neck. Tsubaki's breasts and belly squished against Noel's fat, making her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel focused her mind and concentrated on the power within her blubbery body, channeling the Azure though herself and although neither Tsubaki nor Makoto could have noticed, with her eyes closed as she enjoyed Tsubaki's embrace and all, but Noel's eyes became cerulean under her eyelids. The power of the Azure flowed into Tsubaki, sending a \"spark\" of sorts through her body, making Tsubaki moan as she kept her lips locked tightly on her beloved Noel's. Makoto stared in awe as Tsubaki blew up before her with bountiful, soft fat as she was filled with power, billowing forth and tearing at her uniform. The buttons on her brassier began to come undone as it was forced apart, revealing Tsubaki's billowing cleavage as her breasts spread out further, her uniform rising higher and higher above her now bulbous belly. Her pants split and tore further as Tsubaki's billowing bottom and thickening legs ripped her pants in back and tore at the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Noel had broken her liplock with Tsubaki, she had grown larger then Makoto again! What was strange, however, was even though Tsubaki's bulging, bulbous form should have been too heavy for anyone, Tsubaki herself felt just fine. It was like all her new fat was light as air, leaving her more then capable of walking and only presenting problems due to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...\" Was all Makoto could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki smiled, looking down at her new chest which seemed to just barely squish upwards against her second chin by this point. She blushed a bit at how...indecent she must have looked, but at least only Noel and Makoto were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki paused as she stared at Noel's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noel are...you alright?\" Tsubaki pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, why do you ask?\" Noel sounded nervous, even more so then usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto couldn't see what was happening. Her mind raced with all sorts of possibilities, problems that could have come up, but those were all put to rest with Tsubaki's next sentence, the red-haired woman placing her hands on her wide, flared hips, making her ponderous rear wobble slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is your nose bleeding?\" Tsubaki asked in a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel gasped aloud in shock, her blush only intensifying as she noticed it was true. Blood was trickling from her nose and dripping out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noel Vermillion, you big blobby pervert.\" Tsubaki teased with a heartfelt grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel allowed a cry to escape her lips as they quivered, her face lighting up pink as she tried to think of something to say back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Makoto interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that make ya kind of a hypocrite? I mean, what about all the romance novels and shoujou manga you had stashed under you bed back in the Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different?

Noel was totally flabbergasted, waving her hands, useless as it was at the moment, as she stammered nervously and started crying nonsense, yet adorable, sounds as her face felt hot from the intense blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts finally slowed down and came to a halt, jiggling in an alluring manner as their growth ceased, the twin spheres managing to grow to the point they, even at her current blobby size, slightly blocked Noel's sight of the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Noel...what did you do?\" Tsubaki asked, her voice nasally due to her nostrils being stuffed with red, blood-stained paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I just remembered the fact that I have such large breasts now...such large, wonderful, soft looking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOEL!!\" Makoto and Tsubaki cried out in unison, making Noel make a sound that could only be described as a squeak as she once again returned to reality. However, in her mind, she was making the most of it as an image of her danced and jumped and cried in joy, almost making the feeling of euphoria that this was real for her too much to keep inside. She managed to hold a good poker face however as Tsubaki placed her hands against her hips, puffing up her already cute and puffy cheeks slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will I do with you sometimes?\" Tsubaki bemoaned in a rather maternal sounding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel only giggled shyly. As Tsubaki turned around, however, she saw Makoto had curled up and cradled herself in Noel's deeper, soft cleavage, smiling happily as a bit of drool trickled from her mouth, her doughy belly rising and falling with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no more nuts...well...maybe those two you got there up that oak tree~\" Makoto muttered to herself in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki felt a large drop of sweat roll down the back of her head. She wasn't surprised, given it was Makoto...but she did feel a bit jealous. Noel was HER lover after all... Pushing Makoto onto her corpulent belly as she rolled the blubbery, almost immobile, squirrel aside, Tsubaki took her \"rightful place\" between Noel's soft, amazingly large, mountain-size breasts and tilted her hat over her head as she drifted off to sleep, dreaming of a combination wedding with Noel and execution of Hazama and Relius. Tsubaki wore the tuxedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel smiled as she watched her friends nap in her breasts. Being busty, such a caring lover in Tsubaki, a life of eating and fat and companionship...it was more then she could ask for. Noel watched the sun fall on the horizon, a brilliant orange glow behind the actual mountains off the horizon. Noel yawned, deciding before bedtime, she would use her Azure one last time, consciously, and...</span></div></div>",

Able to convert seithr into energy for human use, the key to properly tapping into the power of the boundary. <br>\r\nIt is so rare that no usage data has been ever recorded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little more tests. Then, I can finally save you.\" She murmured as she pinned the grimoire on her right ear.

Awoken from a nightmare, LaoJiu the panda accidentally tapped into the boundary in its temporary frenzy and went back to sleep again. This caused a sizable amount of seithr to flow into Litchi.

However, Litchi did not stay rest easy. Fearing future abuses, she gathered all the remaining grimoires from all over the world to be kept within her.

Kokonoe had diagnosed Litchi's recent behavior as this. As the corruption began to take greater hold of her, Litchi's appetite began to increase sporadically. She wasn't like Arakune, who would eat living beings, but she would still eat inanimate objects like windows, sections of a wall or even vending machines just to sate her appetite. The chaotic nature of the Boundary also caused a...mutation. Thanks to it, a large, throbbing cock had formed on Litchi which drove her mad with perverted sexual lust and continued to do so as she ate and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLitchi moaned, tapping more energy from the Boundary as she focused it into Seithr. Her Staff reacted and expanded while inside her cock, making Litchi throw her head back and moan loudly and passionately in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLitchi may not even have been aware or even cared this was the result of the Boundary altering and corrupting her very being. In recent days, Litchi had become slovenly and lazy. She took actions of least effort and her manners had all but disappeared as she could carelessly belch and cum given the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, the one thing that drove at her in the back of her mind was Arakune. She had to help him, had to find a way to cure him! Even if she was a part of NOL now, she still needed to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLitchi moaned as she felt the tip of the staff became hot inside of her dick, inciting greater pleasure. Litchi threw her head back as best she could with her thick, flabby neck and let out a loud guttural moan as she came hard. Cum sprayed out of her dick and poured onto the table in front of her, spewing all over her table and coating the mountain of food in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So you would like our extra large beef bowl special?\" The waitress, a young red-haired girl in a Chinese dressed asked, thankful she remained spotless after that spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Mmm!* Yes please!\" Litchi said between scooping mouthfuls of food and her own seed inside her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BBBBUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPP!!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as the waitress turn around she jumped as she heard Litchi belch thunderously. The blubbery oriental doctor's blubber jiggled, especially around her face and multiple chins. The waitress sighed, at least glad this massive slob of a woman would have no way of running out on the bill. Litchi merely continued to scoop food into her mouth, licking her lips as they became stained from her messy eating and food dripped and dropped onto her fat body, most getting caught in her rolls or stuffed in her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLitchi grabbed some of the normal portioned beef bowls sitting on the pile of food she had already and poured them down her blubbery belly, enjoying as the thick, warm broth poured down into her folds and dripped down her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pile of food had dwindled to more normal looking portions, the doors to the kitchen opened. Litchi looked over and what she saw caused her dick to rise so quick it slammed against the underside of the table and knocked what remained of her meal over. Three beef bowls so big they needed to be carried by four people each were brought out to her and placed right before her. Drool flowed from Litchi's mouth and onto her breasts as she stared, her eyes twinkling like stars. Grabbing the first one eagerly, Litchi brought it up to her lips and noisily slurped it right out of the bowl, sucking up everything inside like a vacuum. She would have liked to pour some on herself, but it tasted too rich and delicious to waste like that! The process was the same fort the other two, Litchi's blubbery belly becoming bloated as it was stuffed with more food, her clothes warping around her mountainous breasts and her blubbery ass, which stuck out from behind her with all it's round fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b> <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!!</font> </b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLitchi belched so loud her full blubbery belly shook and the light fixtures on the ceiling all shook and fell off from the powerful force of wind.

Swallowing for a bit Litchi then did something surprising and spat the girl back out, only she was completely naked.<br>\r\n\"Waaahh!?\" Kagura, though glad to be alive and out of Litchi's mouth, was shocked as to why Litchi only ate her clothes.<br>\r\nRunning to the storage room, she clasped her private parts in her hands as she went to relieve herself of the shock she had just experienced.<br>\r\n\"That shall teach you to stop me, now...all of you, please continue making my meal, I've got more stuff to eat!\" Litchi licked her lips as she masturbated in eagerness to try out that yummy looking stove to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Litchi begins to eat the restaurant in its entirety, but she also decides to relieve her rock hard dick as well in unorthodox ways, and then she finally gets her meal by the scared and astounded chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Litchi begins to eat the restaurant's appliances, when a familiar figure appears and is shocked by her appearance, having not seen her in a few weeks.</span></div></div>",

Litchi sat down to rest on her haunches, another, tired belch escaping her lips, one last glob of cum squirting from her dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh....*Bbbbbuuuuurrrrppp!!!* Ahh...Kagura, I must say, you were fantastic...\" Litchi purred, her fatty hands stroking the sides of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...tha-*Uuurrrrp!!*-thanks...\" Kagura muttered tiredly, feeling her mind drift off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

Sure the woman was a frequent visitor and had always payed for her meals, which were very large, though tiny by today's amount especially given her choice of \"food\", but this was easily enough to repair all the damage she had caused and still plenty left over as profit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miss...h-how did, how would you ever get this much money on you to spend so casually?\" The manager stuttered as the other staff members gawked with glee at the amount of cash they had been given. Litchi merely stuck her tongue out playfully and put a finger to her chubby cheek. \"Oh when you're like me, you find its very easy to get a hold of money like this...I think that waitress of yours will be bringing in similar amounts with how she is now, she's out in the back alley sleeping like a baby.\" Litchi then left the restaurant staff with a hearty belch and a goodbye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked about Orient Town, Litchi Faye-Ling surveyed the local market of its wares, everyone around was mostly doing their own thing, some waved to the doctor, others looking away, though out of embarrassment of her nude form then anything else. Litchi chuckled to herself as she remembered when she first got like this around 3 months ago, everyone would stare at her, gawking at her massive form and her gargantuan cock. She found it quite embarrassing at the time but now had no problem with herself and neither did most people, at least those who had grown accustomed to the good doctor's change. Coming up to a favorite vendor of hers, one for the delicious mantous she sold, and two was that she was pretty good fuck when need be.<br>\r\n\"Ahh Miss LitchiUUUURRRRRRRPPP!\" Nice to see you again today, 5th time this morning!\" The woman who had just greeted Litchi was one of the many people the doctor had changed after her own physiology had been warped by the Boundary. Once a svelte woman, now a gigantic, though still tiny to Litchi, woman. She to also beheld a cock, and was currently showering her wares in them, having called the treat her own \"Creamy Delight Mantous\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Miss Mei!\" Litchi greeted the mantou seller as their food stained, and cum filled bellies pushed together, the touch of Litchi's fat made Mei cum even harder and it splattered into the fryer. \"I see your making another batch of your cum drenched, deep fried mantou?\" Lithci licked her lips just from the thought of them, deep fried mantous were delicious and very fattening, but with all of Miss Mei's juices overflowing on them it just enhanced everything about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am, though I've already gone and prepared you your own batch, these are just for me.\" The woman then proceeded to fish out from her shelves of fat, several cum soaked mantous, and gave them to Litchi, to which she promptly devoured. Mei then went and shoved a few of the sweets she had just finished into her belly button for safe keeping, and like the doctor she had grown to enjoying eating from that part of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I must say Miss Mei, I don't know whats better, your mantous, or your cum!\" Litchi and Miss Mei then began to vigorously thrust their cocks into each other's flab. Cum and food flying all over the place, as Mei smashed her fat into the far larger woman's girth. The two woman moaned, burped, and farted as immense pleasure waved through them. Now one would suspect this would get a few heads turning to such ridiculous actions, however the people of the town had become so used to Litchi's antics and those she had made into fat gluttons like herself, that it was really quite normal nowadays. As the two continued, Litchi grabbed the fryer and poured the hot grease right into her belly hole and messily slurped it up, putting her head deep into her own adipose, to which Mei joined in, her cock still in there alongside her head and Litchi's. As the doctor was slurping away she pulled her dick out of Mei's fat, and began to spray it outward into the streets and whatever was in front of her, be it a building, a person or an animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis slobbish act of eating, cumming, and fucking continued for another 5 minutes, Litchi then sloppily kissed the seller and gulped down a gallon of cum that Mei blew out in a small shot, and went on her way, going around to see what else she could do for today, as she had Linhua taking care of any duties today at her clinic. \"<i>Perhaps I should go visit the Kaka clan, I've been wanting to play with the kittens since I last saw them...I wonder how big they've gotten since last time..</i>\" as Litchi thought about making a mess with the Kaka Kittens, she sensed something amiss all of a sudden. Something....that just felt odd....</span></div></div>",

It had been the same thing over and over again for the past 100 years that have been looped over and over again more times then the young vampire could count, and needless to say, she was getting sick of it. But no matter how hard she may try, nothing she did ever seemed to finally put an end to the endless loop she had been forced to endure more times than any normal person could ever stand. Then again, Rachel WASN'T a normal person, and she was perfectly aware of that. Anyway, back to business. Rachel was bored and she needed something to break up the dull humdrum of the endless time loops. Something to make this loop... different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel: ...I'm bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNago: We can see that princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGii: yeah, you've barely touched your tea and cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGii and Nago were Rachel's faithful familiars, they tended to her every whim and served her every command. Though Rachel often abused the crap out of them, deep down she really did care for them... maybe... well if she didn't it wouldn't seem likely she'd keep them around, right? Anyway, Rachel looked at the cookies laid out on the plate in front of her. Simple homemade chocolate chip cookies with her favorite brand of tea to go with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel: Nago, Gii, I need something new. Something to break the monotony of these endless time loops, at least until they start again. Any suggestions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNago: That depends, how desperate for a change are you exactly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel: *sigh* at this point, I'll do just about anything to change things up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNago: Then I do have one idea in mind, although it is quite drastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel: And that idea is... what exactly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNago: Well...</span></div></div>",

Why would the Princess ruin her figure intentionally?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNago: Just hear me out princess. Now I know this will sound crazy, but there ARE people out there who not only enjoy larger women, but some people enjoy being larger themselves. Strange, I know, but who knows, maybe they're onto something. Besides, if it turns out they're wrong and it's no fun, it's not like you'll have to endure it for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought that over in her head for a moment. On the one hand, Rachel despised the idea of ruining all her hard work to maintain her petite frame, Nago did have a point. And if she truly didn't like it, it was no big deal, after all, she'd be back to her old size once the time loop restarted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel: Well... I suppose it wouldn't hurt to try it. After all, what harm could it possibly do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGii: You mean you're really going to go along with it princess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel: I don't see why not. After all, Nago is right, any weight I gain will simply disappear once the Time Loop resets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGii: Well alright then, if you say so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel finished her tea and looked at the empty cup, then at the cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel: Gii, I will require more cookies and plenty of milk. Nago, please inform Valkenhayn of my plans and have him bake me a feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNago and Gii: Right away Princess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rush off to do the tasks that were appointed to them. Rachel picked up a cookie and bit into it, the cookie was soft and warm, fresh from the oven and had a perfect chocolaty taste to them. Though cookies alone would not make this plan work. Rachel was well aware of that fact. She would need to eat a lot, much more than she had ever eaten before, if she intended to gain a significant amount of weight before the Time Loop restarted. Soon...</span></div></div>",

Rachel looked over the large spread in front of her, not sure where she should begin. Rachel had to admit, now that she was looking at all the foods she'd finally be able to eat now that she didn't need to worry about her figure, the idea of gaining weight seemed much more appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel: Lets see... where to begin... there's so many different choices. Cookies, cake, ice cream, eggs, sausages... is that a donut with bacon I see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNago: Yes Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGii: Apparently it's a well known dessert in some parts of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel: well then it must be good. Guess I'll give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel picked up the bacon covered pastry and bit into it, the crunchy bacon and soft dough and frosting made for an interesting combination of flavors. She quickly finished the donut, picked up a fork, and stabbed it into a large, juicy sausage. She bites into it, some of the juices from the sausage dripped down her chin, but Rachel was too preoccupied with the taste to really notice it. When she finished the sausage, she moved onto a large, fluffy cake, taking large bites out of the large cake, quickly filling her belly, which was already getting rather big as she continued to stuff her face with the many delicious goodies before her. She just ate, and ate, and ate, with Nago and Gii watching in awe as their princess continued to stuff herself, clearly she was enjoying her new found freedom. The feast quickly disappeared into Rachel's growing gut, which was quite noticeable as it strained the top of her dress, threatening to burst it open at any moment. As Rachel finished off the last bite of her feast, she rubbed her stomach with a satisfied smile. Her belly now free from the confines of her dress, it rested on her lap, gurgling and groaning as the little Vampire's tummy struggled to digest the biggest meal she had ever eaten.

She was thankful her uniform, which was Izayoi itself, seemed to grow with her, retaining its usual bagginesd to mask how large she truly was. However, she considered whether or not that extent was limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are Tsubaki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead looked to her left, seeing her friend, Noel, walk past the tall plants, sunlight almost shimmering off her golden hair as she wore it down, like back in the academy, instead of pinned under her blue beret. She had become more confident since her rescue from Terumi's clutches, but that wasn't to say she was no more the shy, sweet girl she'd always known. The crimson haired woman smiled, taking her own white hat off and placing it to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Good Morning.\" Tsubaki said, resisting an urge to ask about breakfast. If it helped her lose weight, a slice of plain toast later would be preferable, was her justification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-actually, I discovered something last night. I can counter Izayoi stealing your light, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki's eyes opened wide for a second. A way to keep Izayoi from stealing her sight? It felt like her training had been a minor waste, but it all went towards becoming stronger...all towards keeping Noel safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so if the risk is worth it, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Please, go ahead.\" Tsubaki said with a smile and a nod. Even though she had not listened to Noel at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? A-are you sure?\" Noel asked, a bit hesitant as she folded her arms behind her back. Tsubaki nodded with her smile remaining on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it helps me protect you, such a drawback is trifling.\" She replied, even though she had no idea what the drawback was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel sighed, taking the quill, the short sword, and book in her hands. Focusing, an azure light bathed the two, before spreading to the uniform. Tsubaki felt a warmth in her body as the light advanced, before dying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...should work, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki was already charging Izayoi, much to Noel's shock, as she held her short sword aloft, crying out dramatically as she swung her blade, creating waves of brilliant light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki smiled. Her vision wasn't blurring, which was a blessing...but she felt a bit...larger. Placing a hand against her stomach, Tsubaki realized why. She'd grown from chubby to full-on fat! Her stomqch was a rotund gut with puffier arms and legs, a huge, shapely rear extending from behind her and two round, trembling breasts, big as her head, resting on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the name of-?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I warned you Tsubaki...\" Noel muttered. \"This altered version of Izayoi steals a person's 'lightness' now if you use it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lightness?\" What did Noel mean by...no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wh...wh...WHAAAAT?!\" The usually mature redhead pracrically erupted with shock.</span></div></div>",

Speaking of Tsubaki she was unsure if to wither thank or complain to her softer stomach for keeping her from doing something potentially crazy with Noel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two said simultaneously causing the mood to lighten somehow as they fought the urge to now laugh with one another choosing instead to chuckle lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Noel I really didn't expect that to come from me.\" Tsubaki stated apologizing although what \"that\" meant remained unclear, was she speaking of her gut or her heart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Tsubaki\" Noel smiled that smile that made the redhead smile in quick response, \"Why don't we go get something to eat, huh. My treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Noel I couldn't ask you to pay for us both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven her new size the redhead certainly didn't want to impose when it came to the price of a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's okay. Makoto paid me back and a little extra from this one time I lend her enough to pay up her drinking tab.

With her hat now back resting at top of her red locks of hair she took Noel's hand in hers, the two blushing a tad bit again, as they made off for whatever eatery they could find.</span></div></div>",

Tsubaki couldn't believe that Makoto could still waddle, let alone she was hungry enough to get extra helpings, watching in fear as the squirrel loaded plates with mountainous helpings of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some a' this...some o' these...a lot of those...ooh, I dunno what the heck these are, but they smell awesome~\" Makoto chirped as she merrily piled plates upon plates with even more food. Tsubaki feared that by the time Makoto was full, she would have busted down the whole building with her bulk...and then she'd make room for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-M-Makoto, please compose yourself.\" Tsubaki muttered, trying to save face in the presence of such terrifying gluttony. \"If you keep eating like this, for all we know you could explode...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto laughed heartily as she turned around, giving Tsubaki a hard pat on the back. So hard Tsubaki and Noel could have sworn they heard something crack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I thought Noel was supposed to be the worrywort of us!\" Makoto jested as she laughed, her belly quivering like gelatin. Something about it seemed rather hypnotic, Noel's eyes absolutely fixated on the jiggling mass of creamy flesh. \"Besides, Tsubaki, I been eating everyone I know under the table ever since I was a kid~ Plus, with my dily regimen I barely gain any weight! So I'm pretty much free to stuff my face till I don't even have room for a mint!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki groaned, leaning against the wall as she rubbed her sore back while she watched the blubber-laden squirrel girl waddle her way back to the table, the wobbling of her immense ass cheeks almost putting the redhead in a trance before she shook the thoughts out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Makoto was beginning to look like a parade float version of her normal self and she was only filling with more fat. Generous helpings disappeared into her mouth, only making the squirrel bigger, fatter and of course, more curvacious. Noel was squirming at the sight of Makoto's huge breasts, her envy acting up again, but also a strange sense of admiration for the massive mounds as the perky boulders of blubber grew atop Makoto's fat belly, as she only got bigger and bigger, inhaling almost all of her dishes. Piles of mashed potatoes three feet tall devoured in under ten seconds. Whole chickens, bones and all, vanishing down the squirrel's gullet. And of course gallons upon gallons of fizzy soft drinks guzzled down like a frat challenge, followed by a loud belch aiding to the frat analogy, all of it making Makoto even more massive. Her belly was starting to split the table as its trembling weight rested atop while her fatty pillars she called her legs only got thicker, her puffy arms still somehow bending easily to her will even as they only became larger and softer. Her breasts became even larger, big enough that she could probably wedge someone like Noel inside the soft doughy flesh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Noel, she walked over towards Makoto while Tsubaki was still trying to fix her aching back. For a moment, she wondered how Makoto wasn't naked with how much she was gaining, but how stubbornly her outfit clung to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Makoto...\" Noel said bashfully, her tone quiet. Makoto's enhanced hearing, native to beastkin, was the only reason her friend was heard over the sounds of her own gorging and glutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahf the mattah?\" Makoto asked with a mouth full of waffles before swallowing what she had inside, moving on to her next plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I-I don't mean to be rude, in...any way but...do you realize how fat you're getting...eating like this?\" Noel asked softly, her big emerald eyes gazing up at the mammoth Makoto, who must have clocked in at over 3,000lbs by this point.</span></div></div>",

The redhead desperately wanted to know why her dear friend was filling herself up like a hot-air balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel however would end up beating her to the punch, the blonde curious as well as to why her furry friend was eating with no end in sight. When questioned about the reasoning behind her gluttonous actions Makoto to her credit attempted to answer...only to realize it was rather difficult to do so when one had about a dozen pizza rolls stuffed deep inside one's own mouth...along with handfuls of nuts because a squirrel couldn't go without nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she swallowed everything in one big not to mention highly impressive gulp!

Why the hell do you guys think I can lay smackdown after smackdown by just using my fists while you have to use weapons...uh no offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto originally stated so proudly only to chuckle afterwards as she realized she may have indirectly insulted her two best friends. Thankfully Noel wasn't at all insulted nor was Tsubaki even if she still couldn't completely wrap her head around every last detail mentioned by Makoto.

Getting so fat seemed more and more appealing if it was something that could make Noel so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead smiled as she hugged her arms against her bigger belly, now far too fat and plush for her to wrap her thick arms around, the soft mass of malleable flesh growing even more as she finished the ice cream stuffed inside her cheeks. Her fat limbs pressing against it caused the civil young woman to burp daintily, her cheeks blushed as she covered her mouth with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I can understand why Noel likes this so much...\" She mused as she grasped some of her plush belly in her hands, her sausage fingers sinking into the creamy flesh a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may as well give her more to love.\" She said to herself happily as she dug right in to all the food around her, its immensely fattening contents working their magic on Tsubaki. Thinking like she imagined Makoto thought during her feast, she stuffed her cheeks full, chewed up the massive load of food, then gulped it right down. She didn't wholly like the act, but she at least carefully choose her food instead of gulping it all down like she was part snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-haied woman cooed as she felt herself blow up like she was a parade float version of herself. Was it the thought of making Noel happy or some...hidden desire? Maybe a combination of both?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever ir was, it coukd wait in her mind as she eagerly devoured some smoked ham, eating any and every bite of fatty food she could stuff in her gut as she filled out more and more of the room around her with her generous fat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she pasted a ton and a half in weight, or so she assumed, Tsubaki was quite amazed at not only the speed of her gaining but the fact that she was able to eat as fast as she could. Guess given the proper motivation one could do just about anything they set their mind to and she was doing clearly doing this as much for Noel as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't occurred to her although it would serve as quite a surprise that her while stretching like hell her attire for the most part was still intact, even her \"cool hat\" still sat contently atop of her crimson hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled again as her thick fingers accidentally rubbed up against her dome of a belly her fattening breasts quaking from the delightful action. Her massive butt soon joining in not wanting to be left out bringing out even more amusement from the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point it seemed to Tsubaki that she was an even gainer so to speak, much like Makoto's whose limbs were thicken and ripe with fat Tsubaki's gaining had caused to her reshape into a blob-like shape where her gut, ass, and breasts took on the great majority of the weight. There still some distinct differences however where Makoto was obviously greater in breast size Tsubaki was surprised to see her belly have a slight advantage over her the rest of her. She would have never figured that would be the biggest part of her ballooning form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that said she felt she was making good time no doubt Noel was still distracting Makoto so she still had plenty of time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was that? Sounded like an explosion went off back inside the interior of the squirrel-filling restaurant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving flung another blueberry pie to one side the first thought that went through her mind was the possible return of Hazama! Perhaps he was back to recapture Noel for whatever mad plan he had up his coated sleeve this time. Fueled by her devotion to protect Noel and her rage at her former emerald-haired captain Tsubaki broke out in a mad dash nearly tripping over her own two heavy-set feet due to the fact that she wasn't quite used to incredible bulk just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for her she didn't end up face-planting into the pavement below which would have no doubt set off a bit of a quake instead she righted herself at practically the last second and made for the door. She panted heavily, dashing being just as difficult as she imagined with all the added weight literally weighting her down, as she reached the doorway only to realize there was nothing there! Upon further inspection however she came across the door having been tossed aside as it were a toy something had ripped it clean off it's hinges...and that something stood right in front of her...Makoto's mountainous butt-cheek!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it all made sense to her...the explosion wasn't Terumi at all it...it was actually all Makoto's doing! That blasted squirrel's hunger didn't pause at all instead it seemingly increased and she had finally done it she had outgrown the entire building! She was thankful however that the three of them were the only ones left inside the shattered shop and two that the storage had somehow been spared the wrath of furry flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the little victories that counted right but right now Makoto was anything but little. A building, if not bigger, sized blob and knowing her Tsubaki figured she was still hungry for more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...yup sure is good to finally get a chance to stretch my legs as well as get some desert!\" the gigantic squirrel-blob stated happily seemingly ignorant of how astounding enormous she had become, her tail swaying from side to side as if to compliment her happy mood for more treats and eats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant any happiness Tsubaki may have had disappeared right out of her. She had transformed herself into a very large version of herself but she was absolutely \"tiny\" compared to Makoto's titanic size! How in the blue hell was she going to catch up to her not to mention what had happened to Noel was she stuck somewhere in all that squirrel fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea her mind running a million thoughts or so a second it almost felt as she would pass out then and there from stress over worrying for Noel's safety and as to how she was going to match not to mention stop Makoto?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be something she could do she wondered as she surveyed the wreckage around her not to mention the still intact storage room...</span></div></div>",

Just gorging on fatty food alone wasn't enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to eat it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, she used her gloved hands to pull at the shelves all the food had been stored on, twisting the metal into compact shapes with a strangely uncanny strength only somehow explained by all her extra body fat as she crammed the mass of metal down her throat. Her taste buds had become so sensitive and supercharged by her gluttonous intake that instead of rejecting the foreign substance, she swallowed it up with ease, dozens of pounds pouring onto her trembling form. Tsubaki breathed deep as she started gorging herself on metal, boxes, panes of glass...she even almost ate her own hat when it fell off her head and into her gaping mouth. She made a note later, in case she was hungry in the middle of the night. Just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-head had done much madder things in the name of love, and to her she would go to any extent for the sake of that love. Even if the term 'extent' applied to the absurd width of her waistline as it only expanded out further and further. She started to eat the walls themselves, pulling them off and swallowing segments of metal and plaster and wood whole as her weight climbed! 5,000lbs...5,500...6,000 and still growing strongly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzayoi, being an enchanted outfit, still clung to her form, albeit in a more provocative manner. Her swelling boulders she considered her breasts only trembled as they grew and grew, her hips widening out further as her butt billowed out behind her, the shapely mounds of pure fat wobbling with each step of her immense pillars she called her legs with thighs big enough to crush cars at this point! Bigger and bigger like a balloon, Tsubaki swelled with body fat,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If it's for Noel, it's more than worth it!</i> She stated boldly in her head as she closed in on a staggering ten tons in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki sighed as she pat her immense belly, sending a fit of quivering through the fleshy sphere. Even under the cover of her uniform, there seemed to be an uncannily soft and strangely alluring aspect to it. She felt herself blushing like a schoolgirl as she imagined Noel immersing herself in the deep flab, playfully poking her head out from her cleavage or her belly folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki shook the thoughts out, turning to serious matters.

The rest of her plumped face submerging slightly into her vast bulk as she relaxed feeling so carefree despite being so enormous. She had found this quaint little shop several minutes ago and after clearing some room, by using her grand girth to demolish an abandon nearby building, Makoto had requested that she be fed all the shop in stock. Politely of course she wasn't a monster...just a big fat blob of squirrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm glad you enjoyed it, Miss.\" one of the worker-girls, clearly unnerved by standing or was she sinking into so much squirrely flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My compliments to the chef!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...don't have one of those here. This is a doughnut shop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman mentioned wishing to get as far away from the gluttonous Makoto in her mind she kept hoping the crazy fat brunette wouldn't think of eating her too. Makoto had no intention of doing so obviously but how was this poor girl suppose to know that. Thankful when she was finally send away just like the others in the shop hoping that the furry blob was finally full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to lay back Makoto wondered where Noel had gotten off to? She was sure the blonde hadn't left her side even after had outgrown previous eatery but she hadn't heard a peep from Noel since, odd but she was sure her best friend was safe where ever the young woman was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her lingering thoughts of Noel were interrupted as she felt the ground beneath her shiver which really said something considering how massive she had become. What the hell was making the ground along with her own bulbous form quake like no tomorrow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you, Makoto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki?! She could almost laughter at herself for somehow forgetting all about the redhead. Her endless feasting and Noel's affectionate actions had made it so she had completely forgotten about Tsubaki something she wasn't about to tell her mind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever something about this reunion felt off Tsubaki's voice should be coming from way down below so why was it that she felt as if her other best friend was standing over her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe craned her neck as much she could to get a better view only to realize said neck had reformed into a sack of fat making it rather difficult for shift her eyesight to the desirable location. Instead she decided to get back to her feet so that she could get a better look at Tsubaki...what she saw as she turned on heel however was nothing she could have expected...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto hadn't come face to face with her dear friend as she expected she had come face to breasts much to her surprise! Her bust alone was enormous even bigger then Makoto's own, her uniform still clinging on amazingly that the clothing actually made them appear even bigger then they were and they were pretty damn large in the squirrel's opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her stunning bust was a belly that could pass for the restaurant the trio had been at earlier. Such an incredible-sized dome of pure fat extending many feet in front of her as well as to her sides much like her supremely widen hips while her butt mirrored her belly's eclipsing size yet just as with her top somehow still perfectly contained within the widest stretchiest pants in existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs same as her arms monumental in size so packed with blubber that it was a surprise her hands and feet had yet to sink deep into her vastness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all Tsubaki was gigantic and even that felt like the understatement of a lifetime on just weight alone while height-wise she was at the very least a head larger then Makoto if the two were of their long forgotten average size but they weren't and for the first time in a while Tsubaki had outdone Makoto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe no longer had to look up at the squirrel now the tables were turned and she was ready to take back Noel after all how could the blonde not fall instantly in love with her the moment she laid those large adorable eyes of hers upon the redheaded behemoth.</span></div></div>",

As she did, Noel climbed off her chest and onto Tsubaki's titanic belly, climbing her way up the massive dome of flesh as she finally walked atop the trembling bosom of Tsubaki, walking over towards her face, which was surrounded by fat from her face, shoulders and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noel...\"</span></div></div>",

Kokone head back inside without a word but soon returned with a small vile as she gave it to Noel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. this will be able to do the job for you. just drink it all down and you'll get the result's you want and maybe more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel bowed to Kokone and headed back to the girl's and began to head off but not without Makoto saying one more thing while in ear reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This great Noel! Now you'll be able to get bigger and even bigger breasts too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokone's ears twitches some.</span></div></div>",

She cooed and grinned to herself as the massive squirrel imagined stuffing her gob with cake and pie and chocolate coronets until she felt fit to burst, so utterly stuffed she felt like she could just curl up on the spot and get in some premature hibernation hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut such would have to wait until after she actually got her gluttonous mitts on some food. Food, glorious food~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kind of a shame I may have to get rid of all this blubber soon...</i> Makoto though as she pushed her fatty hands against the sides of her trembling belly, long too big for her to wrap her blimpy arms around. <i>Noel loves this stuff so much and it does have this uncanny softness to it. Eh, maybe I'll keep it! It's fun being so fat and I'm already uber strong as is! Maybe when I see that Hazama creep next, I could just sit on him and Relius and be done with 'em!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto giggled to herself, a wide grin on her puffed-up fatty face as her ears twitched. She watched Noel roll around in her fat, kneading it and rubbing her face in it and-was she trying to make a snow angel in her belly fat? Yep, she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave her another idea. With how big she was, Makoto could rent her cleavage and belly folds out as living space! She'd make a killing in the real estate market!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she needed more real estate to sell out though and she needed to make sure she had enough belly that any of her folds could easily accommodate the needs of an average two bedroom apartment and what would they do about plumbing, electricity and running water? How would they establish a mailing address?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, maybe she should rethink the idea. And maybe consult an agent before getting any further in her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's attention shifted elsewhere as she noticed that Noel had taken refuge in her trembling bosom, the blond having removed her cap as she began to nap betwixt her soft cleavage. She laughed a bit as she used her fat hand to softly pat her friend on the head, watching her smile in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she thought about it, where was Tsubaki? She couldn't have been left behind could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then again, she did waddle out of the buffet in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this sucks.\" Makoto muttered to herself as she puffed up her cheeks. \"I invited the two of them out here in the first place so I could play matchmaker! Those two have been pining for one another since the Academy, but they got so swept up in their own personal stuff they didn't realize it! Matchmaker Makoto isn't gonna just lay down and admit defeat, even for the most masterful of belly rubs! ...That actually sounds kinda nice right-No, no not now!\" She scolded to herself. She needed some way to kill time until Tsubaki got back, so that way she could assure the two were officially declared a couple!</span></div></div>",

That said she knew this area well not just due to her employment but from her personal binging trips. So she began to make the short trip to a bar not too far from her current location, carefully though big as she was Makoto was still just a fun-loving blob of a squirrel not a rampaging evil monster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later Makoto sighed in deep content her enormous form wobbling, quaking, jiggling away as she continued to chug drink after drink. After a surprisingly and equally awkward arrival Makoto had made peace with the owner of the bar having plainly stated that she was just here for some drinks and nothing more. Squirrel-honor as she had amusingly put it. So in the end she found a place out back and proceeded to get her drink on. The owner still unsure if was the right call that is until it was apparent that the building-sized beauty was fully capable of paying her fill of drinks. As they say money talks...even when it comes from a gigantic squirrel girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she called out for more the booze starting to haze her vision not to mention her mind Makoto took a moment to check up on the slumbering Noel. Yup she was still sound asleep probably having the sleep of her life considering \"the bed\" she didn't have the heart to interrupt the blonde from whatever it was she was possibly dreaming of in the end was probably for the best to let Noel have her rest while she continued to guzzle down all kinds of shots after all she still had room for so much more!</span></div></div>",

Her vision was a bit blurry and her thoughts were less focused, as she grinned from ear to ear while her fatty hands kneaded the generous flesh of her soft, fat belly. The squirrel cooed in delight from how soft to the touch it was, giggling like a child as she gave her globular gut a pat, which sent ripples through the flesh. Surprisingly, Noel slept contently through the quaking flab, smiling as she turned over on her fluffy mattress of breast flesh and muttered what must have been something about pandas, Makoto didn't pick up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it'd be wrong if I didn't have another drink to...my health.\" She said to no one in particular, her speech a bit slurred as she grabbed a bottle of rum, pouring some in a stout glass. \"Cheers!\" She said before pausing for a moment, then taking the whole bottle and pouring the contents into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with Makoto's body working in overdrive to somehow make her as fat as possible, all the empty calories in her drinks were pouring out onto her body, luscious flesh pouring forth as the giant blob of fat that was Makoto grew fatter as she became more and more drunk as well. Her spreading flab began to create cracks in the pavement as it spilled forth and cars people had parked nearby became lost under the avalanche of flesh, either crushed under waves of belly fat or squashed under her growing backside into a sheet of metal. And, of course, the squirrel's breasts only billowed forth as the twin zeppelins jiggled atop her chest,sending a chain of ripples down through her belly as well, as her body only trembled with growth, drinks of different smells, colors and makes all vanishing down her throat as she guzzled them like water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBUUUUUUUURRRRPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that mighty, drunken belch, Makoto stood in place for a moment and laughed before she returned to cuddling her fatty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gheheheh...lookit me. I'm like a...big...fluffy...plush toy, ehehehehe~\" Makoto slurred before another burp escaped her plump lips. Makoto was already unpredictable enough as she was, but drunk?

Tipped as she was caused this fact to be rather lost to her but at least it was able to briefly pause her continuous drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead the liquor-filled fuzzy blob turned her attention to her still, by some sweet miracle, sleeping companion. If she were still of sound mind Makoto would have chalked it up to Noel simply having even more sweet sleeping room then before like sleeping on top of a thousand of the softest mattresses one could possibly imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the squirrel was far from sober so her next thought was something else entirely...why was Noel so small? Apparently the reason behind such a difference in size hadn't occurred to her or perhaps due to her drunken stupor she couldn't remember anything pass a few minutes ago, whatever the case Makoto being the good friend she was decided to remedy the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her own special way of course which as the sleeping blonde and their fellow best friend Tsubaki knew often led to trouble of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this instance Makoto took hold of a funnel or something close to it, honestly she couldn't remember how it came into that fuzzy hand of hers, somehow was aware enough to place the tail end into Noel's slightly opened mouth then proceeded to pour shot after shot directly into the funnel leading straight down to Noel's unsuspecting form.

The blond's already shapely legs became even more shapely as they grew into grand fatty trunks, with doughy thighs of pale flesh colliding, while her belly rose above her like a fatty balloon and began spreading over her knees. Makoto smiled as she watched Noel's chest, begin to swell as well, the once flat Noel starting to become more well developed in that area, with big, meaty breasts only growing more large and luscious under her tightening NOL Secretary outfit, which clung to every growing curve of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*HIC!* See? Momma Makoto's not gonna let ya down...\" The squirrel giggled as she watched her friend swell up like a balloon of booze and blubber. \"S-soon you'll be as...as big and, and and and...and...aaaaand I forgot what I was gonna say...\" Makoto laughed at herself, sending her huge body into a quake of flab, which seemed to even shake the ground under her slightly. Noel kept on drinking and sucking down liqour. \"B, but I bet one day you'll be huuuuuge and your boobs will...make...someone, somewhere look reeeeaaally flat compared to your knockers~!\" she giggled, deciding that this occasion deserved celebration, which meant another drink! or seven, what the hell?!</span></div></div>",

The blonde laid on the fuzzy surface of the bloated beer drinking blob taking a moment to allow her senses to come around her eyesight resetting while her head pounded worse then even the time Terumi had kidnapped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time she had briefly lost her mind this time however was closer to Makoto punching her through the moon! Her brunette best friend would never do that though and she knew that well still her head was hurting something fierce nearly causing her to tip over to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she coughed as she realized that an object sat in between her parted lips! It was a funnel of sorts having removed it to prevent herself from choking it appeared as if it had been in recent use however as a thin stream fell downward out of the tail end. Noel could even bring herself to wonder why she had this thing in her mouth or what was dripping out so instead she choose to ignore the device placing it neatly aside she give it some more thought was her head stopped pounding like a steel drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards she found herself struggling to stand upright at first she assumed it was because of her head but her legs didn't feel light as paper no quite the opposite she felt heavy as if she were being weighted down by some unknown source. Instinctively she reached out allowing her hands to feel up the sides of her form for anything that could probably an answer she got her answer as her right hand glided across her now dough-like thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" she wondered she couldn't explain why but her legs felt thicker then usual Makoto was always the one to remind her that she personally had a great set of legs but this was different something was odd here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Noel exclaimed as her free hand accidentally rubbed up against her fatty backside! Her butt just by that simple rub was enormous far bigger then she could actively remember blushing heavily as she figured her underwear must be exposed for all to see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shame of it all practically made the girl want to hide herself under her hat as she reached for said hat however the tip of her elbows connected with the sides of her widen bloated over belly. She whimpered for a moment as she cradled the dome her stomach had become now rightfully frighten at the fact that after having taken a simple nap she had some way gained a surprising amount of weight! How much she wasn't quite sure but it was enough to certainly scare her back to her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she be so big so fat when did this happen to her how did this happen to her, so many questions flooding her mind as she tried to gather herself despite the panic attack she was currently suffering from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit she recalled how Tsubaki would tell her that one of the better ways to settle one's nerves was to simply stop and breathe. Let the bad out and the good in as she had affectionately put it...Tsubaki was always so good to her...so she did as told remembering the redhead's kind advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully it seem to work her rattled nerves beginning to settle down and even her head seemed a bit more clear she have to thank her best friend the next time she saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever during all this she had caught sight of another part of her altered body, her breasts...more importantly it soon dawned on the girl that she actually had a sizable bust and sizable was just one way of putting it. She had boobs and not just boobs but big ones at that round hug able melons was all she could think of as far as describing her bust size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly she hoped she could outclass even Makoto, completely forgetful of where she was at the moment, in truth however Noel was just content with at long last having noticeable breasts them being as big as they were was just an added not to mention greatly appreciated bonus. Her fears from before fading away as she focused on the joy of her most personal of goals being reached.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't help but feel an odd sense of self-confidence rising within her as she felt like she was sexy, like she could finally turn some heads with her chest which, ironically in a ways, now sported breasts bigger than a person's head by at least two or three cup sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where had she wound up and how did she get this way? All she saw around her was a vast pale expanse, like her own flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's see...</i> Noel thought to herself.<i> Earlier I was...eating out with Tsubaki and Makoto, who had put on weight since we saw her last... And when she started eating she just kept growing and growing...she was puffing up so much, I thought she would explode from being too fat...but she kept eating and eating...and getting sooo biiig..</i> Noel felt her heart beat inside her chest as she remembered how it happened, how her Beastkin friend just kept gorging to absurd degrees, growing so huge and luscious she was threatening to bust down the building. I brushed against her and she felt so...so soft... Noel blushed, cradling her face between her plump hands as she remembered how luscious and silky all of Makoto's fat felt...her fluffy belly fat, her silky smooth fatty breasts... <i>They were so soft and warm, I kinda curled up between them and fell asleep and then...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the blond's emerald eyes snapped open as she realized something. If she fell asleep in Makoto's cleavage, where had she wound up now? Did she get displaced? Roll off maybe? As she looked up, the blond's doughy jaw opened wide as she realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't moved away from anywhere since she fell asleep. Makoto had continued to gorge since she took her nap and was now chugging all kinds of calorie-laden beers, spirits, cocktails and anything with alcohol in it. Empty bottles rolled from where her head was, surrounded by a lake of fat from her chins, neck, back and meaty shoulders as they became caught between her doughy belly folds or rolled towards her cleavage. Noel was amazed at how gigantic Makoto had grown, to such an absurd degree she wondered if this was some sort of fever dream she was having. The blubbery squirrel girl was so immense, she was having trouble just fitting her flared hips in the streets. Both sides brushed against the buildings on either side of the road, her steamrolling ass bobbing and wobbling back and forth so much from it's luscious fat content that the shapely mounds would sometimes slam against the front of one of said buildings, leaving huge cracks if it wasn't outright busted down like it had been smashed by the world's jiggliest wrecking balls. ( It didn't help she was so drunk, she actually ate a street lamp on the way. ) Her belly flowed in front of her like an ocean of flesh, rippling and bobbing with every movement, but somehow failed to impair her mobility as the massively drunken Makoto waddled forth on her immense fatty legs, which wobbled and rippled as her chunky feet left imprints and cracks in the ground under her. Her undulations and jiggles were, of course, rather focused on her breasts as well, which heaved and shook so much, Noel had to firmly seat herself between them so she didn't feel like she was on the world's biggest carnival ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maokotooo--!!\" Noel squeaked as she hoped to god that her energetic friend could stop before all the shaking make her queasy. Immediately after she thought that, she started to feel a bit hot as her head was spinning like she had just jumped onto a carousel at mach speed. \"Ooohhh...stop the world please, I wanna get ooooooff...\" Noel groaned, her stomach still churning away gallons of hard liquor responsible for the hundred of added pounds on her person.</span></div></div>",

What you needed was something simple, delicious and greasy. Maybe some fried chicken, some pork and, of course, bacon were great picks for this sort of evening. She licked her lips in anticipation, her huge form continuing to jiggle and wobble as she took up the whole street with her adipose form, her belly and thick sides barely rubbing against buildings before her butt bowled some of them down. Maybe it was the alcohol in her mind making her think so, but being so damn huge was actually pretty cool...maybe even sexy, in its own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was lost in her thoughts, she saw a neon sign in the distance, serving as a beacon of light for her as she could easily smell the simmering, cooking meat coming from within. It was a large scale eatery, which meant it must have been rather popular. She grinned, quickening the pace of her waddling, which caused her gyrating backside to slam into a bank, knocking the wall down like cheap plaster as she stumbled from side to side, her beer goggles causing her to slam into building after building, muttering slurred apologies and random pledges to cover the bill later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached her destination, patrons inside slowly and casually running for dear life as they exited the building in a unified manner of not wanting anything to do with a giant blob of a squirrel girl. Makoto grinned as she approached the entrance, stopping as she realized that she had an ice cube's chance in hell of fitting in any doors now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...drive thru...\" she muttered to herself as she waddled to a random window. An employee, wearing a pink dress like someone who worked in an American Diner in the 1950's opened it up, even though the establishment had no drive thru, and poked her head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...ma'am, I take it you wanted to eat here?\" The waitress asked, cringing as she imagined the hell that cooks would go through making food for this monstrously massive woman. She hoped that their customer wasn't one of those types who swallowed people or worse, ate buildings. Some people still needed to pay off mortgages after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, hic, one of ev'rythin'...like...actually, just gimme all ya got, I, I can pay later. 'm good for it...trust me.\" Makoto slurred. Not only was she a huge blob with a huge appetite, but it was hard for the waitress to miss that Makoto was almost blackout drunk. Lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there wasn't much reason to disagree with a woman who could destroy the whole building simply by sitting on it, so the cooks simply had to grin and bear it. All sorts of greasy dishes, from breaded fried chicken, to baskets of bacon, to big sopping double cheeseburgers and baskets, literal baskets, of fries were carted out to the blubbery beastkin, who greedily gobbled it all down once it came close enough to her mouth. She cooed as she felt her stomach being filled, her appetite slightly more sated with each mouthful swallowed as delicate amounts of fat caused her body to puff up bit by bit, the titanic woman only growing into even more of a fat giant. Makoto blushed as she ate more, feeling pleased by her growth as she watched her fat body grow bigger and bigger still. It felt so oddly good to her, she just wanted more. Somewhere inside, the love of being a glutton was spreading further in her mind as she lost herself in the bliss of roast pig with cracklins as her body grew to such an absurd degree that her belly and butt were plowing through buildings close to her bulk while her breasts grew closer to the size of weather balloons, a single thought popped up in her alcohol-addled mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore.</span></div></div>",

The workers of the establishment having no real choice but to continue laboring away in hopes that maybe the beastkin blob's hunger would come to end. In truth they had no real idea as to how much Makoto could take in and this sudden liking into her gluttonous side was only fueling her growing stomach further to levels unreached before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto smiled faintly as she opened that black hole of a mouth of hers the second helping beginning as she continuously swallowed everything at times literally dumped into her mouth seemingly fast traveling to her stomach as her body jiggled like jello her growth much like her hunger continuing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so focused on her eating she failed to feel the sensation of her butt pushing into buildings far behind her not that it would matter seeing as how they destroyed moments later crushed easily by each cheek.

Her figure had blown out to the point where she looked like some exaggerated parade balloon version of her former self, thanks to her immense, quivering belly, her massive, bulging breasts which heaved from her every breath and her trembling ass, so thick, wide and juicy that all who looked at it for too long seemed hypnotized by the jiggly mass of flesh. It had been hours since she last saw Makoto and by extension Noel, who had likely taken refuge somewhere on the squirrel's massive form. She felt herself bristle a bit in jealousy as she remembered how much Noel fawned over the squirrel's softness thanks to her extra insulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can be just as soft as her, even softer. Why does Noel need to bother with her at all, really?\" Tsubaki thought aloud to herself, blushing a bit as she pushed her hands against the sides of her breasts, creating a collision of more soft, generous cleavage. She had eaten many a building in the name of love. But so far, the name of love did not hold overmuch pull as Tsubaki picked buildings that had been long rejected by their tenants and left in a state of abandonment and even decay. But it was still for a good cause!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, no way!\" Someone standing by one of Tsubaki's massive fatty trunks she called her legs muttered as he looked on at his smartphone, handing it over to his friend. \"Dude, look what my buddy posted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're, like, kidding me!\" His friend said, somehow able to see the picture through the shaggy sheepdog-like bangs over his eyes. \"That, that is not even possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was sent only so long ago man! The whole local area is abuzz about this chick! We should head down and see!\" He said, already running off, which forced his friend to chase after him in pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki took a minute to think about how strange that was. Social Media was quite the strange mistress, wasn't it? But it didn't help her much, did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of general curiosity, Tsubaki looked through the folds of her flabby belly, eventually pulling out her own cell phone from between her fat folds. She flipped though, tapping at it a bit to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw the pictures and her doughy jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all a series of photos taken showing off Makoto growing and eating like a woman possessed! She was gulping down absurd portions of food, almost inhaling it as every subsequent picture uploaded to the internet showed her bigger and bigger and-sweet lord she had a huge ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki shook her head from side to side, making her blubbery chins jiggly and wobble, even sending a ripple down to her huge breasts as she couldn't believe it. She knew now more than ever that Makoto needed to be stopped, one way or another. As quickly as she could, Tsubaki waddled her way down to where Makoto supposedly still was, as fast as her fatty legs could ever carry her absurdly jiggly frame. Many a passerby were either intrigued or disgusted by her display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, she found herself down to where Makoto was last spotted, huffing a bit as her cheeks flushed thanks to the distance traveled and the accumulated weight. She could see Makoto standing right in the middle of the city, even bigger than she was last photo and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, come on, get my good side~ Yeah, more like this? Oh, oh I haven't tried that 'draw me like one of your French girls' pose yet have I?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki stared blankly, blinking a bit. Makoto was actually <i>posing </i>as people took pictures of her with their phones and cameras. She was acting like this was a day in some building-sized blubbery beauty's modeling career, grinning and smiling (and oddly speaking slowly and clumsily, which could mean she was drunk) as she slowly approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay Tsubaki you can do this. Sure she's the same unpredictable Makoto she's always been and sure she's probably stinking drunk, which makes her even MORE unpredictable but...this is gonna be a challenge, isn't it?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How that top was able to keep them from being exposed to an indecent degree must have been one of life's greatest mysteries.

A massive hole, in the general shape of Makoto's current form, had been made, with cracks on the edges as she stomped through the streets into the evening.

She simply hoped that whatever escapade came of this next stop would be a bit more bearable on her.

While her appetites were disconcerting, Tsubaki could not deny there was something impressive about the strength that her friend could muster, all for the sake of protecting what was near and dear to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, this looks like a good place!\" The generously proportioned squirrel chirped, smiling as she quickened her pace towards the neon sign before her, representing a promise of good drinks and utter confidentiality between her and her bartender, regardless of whatever she may say.</span></div></div>",

Having always been rather large, Makoto had occasionally found trouble wedging herself between places that she could not simply destroy with strength alone.  Going around as she winced to try and find anything peculiar in the dark of the night, Makoto soon became bored having spent over half the day rummaging through rubble and finding old abandoned electronic equipment, that unfortunately were inoperable currently. The young woman sighed, bored and irritated with the lack of progress, she sat herself down on a pile of even stones and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this place ain't exactly in peak condition, but you think something would've survived the massacre...\" Sighing in boredom she kicked away a rock, making it collide into stack of other rocks, forming a chain reaction that caused the stack to fall apart. Smirking a little at the event, Makoto began kick away more stones, trying to set up larger and larger chain reactions. Soon though, she had gotten bored with that, sitting again, looking from a plateau out to the rest of the world. Finding herself bored she began play with her body, pounding and flicking her rotund gut, Makoto giggled at the sensation, this continued for a bit until she began to feel \"urges\", every now and then they just popped up, much like something else was right now. Up from below Makoto's belly rose her lengthening penis. Stuck in the moment of things, Makoto couldn't help in indulging into her carnal pleasures. Blushing with arousal, she began to remove her skirt just slightly to allow her appendage more freedom and slightly allow more access to them with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auugh...\" Makoto moaned as she gripped her erect genitalia. Its pulsing form felt warm in her palms, starting slow and going into a steady motion, she began to pump her hands across its shaft. Geting more excited, she moved one hand from her crotch and to the flab on her belly, gripping it and shaking it with gusto. After several seconds she let loose a guttural moan as her hermaphroditic seed blew outward from the plateau, down to the seither clouds below. This session of hers continued on for a few minutes...that is until in the middle of another load she was preparing a voice spoke up from behind her.</span></div></div>",

She felt a sudden, inexplicable heat, particularly around her face and her cheeks. She remembered Kokonoe had sometimes exhibited the same such body heat as a reaction to certain subjects, a reaction her data showed as \"embarrassment\" and the heat was a result of \"blushing\" on her face. She felt a bit weaker as well, her body lowering from its hovering state down onto her feet as she tried her best to glide ever so slightly off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Grrrwwlll~!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis noise resonated from her stomach once more, making Lambda feel even weaker. She didn't know what to do, as she never experienced this feeling in her life. She needed to curb it somehow, see if she could counter or quell it. The blond Murakumo unit looked around, gazing as she analyzed the environment through her visor. As her sights passed a large pagoda-shaped restaurant building, her sensors suddenly pegged it as a priority target. The Virus seemed to override her senses a bit so she would not only feel hungry, but have the ability to see out food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Priority target...acquired. Pursuing secondary goal; acquire sustenance...\" Lambda muttered aloud weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glided as best she could manage into the restaurant, passing the confused staff who, for the moment, wrote her off as a cosplayer who could use Ars Magus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda scanned the environment. While others looked on, her access her databases, learning how to properly behave in an establishment like this. She took a seat by an empty table, disabling her hover function so she could sit in the wood chair by the circular table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what would you like ma'am?\" A waitress in a Chinese outfit asked nervously while holding a notepad and pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...one of everything...\" Lambda said as her stomach allowed another starved howl to echo outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food came in mere minutes, but in that time Lambda almost felt like she would die if she didn't get something inside of her body, fast! She grabbed the first bowl of pork soup that was brought to her and started to fervently gulp it down, swallowing the chunks of meat and vegetables inside of the bowl as it filled inside of her belly. As she ate ravenously, setting herself on cuts of meat, soups, dumplings and dim sum, the virus went into its next stage. Any food that passed Lambda's lips was turned into body fat almost instantly. Not only that, the rate she would gain would be faster and greater then a normal human. Lambda was left blissfully unaware of this as bowls and plates were stacked upon themselves one by one, Lambda's supple form puffing up bit by bit with each bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff were befuddled as they watched Lambda eat as if she were nigh on starving (which was also how Lambda felt) while using the blades that floated behind her as makeshift wings like utensils to skewer and scoop food into her mouth. She tried to keep herself clean though, not using her hands unless her readings suggested it and cleaning herself off with readily available napkins if food spilled onto her growing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuurrrp!\" Lambda sighed contently after allowing an unladylike belch to pass as she leaned back in the chair, making it creak slightly from her increased weight. Lambda didn't know why she was so...soft suddenly, but the sensation felt pleasant to her. She wondered why her suit felt a bit tighter as it struggled to re-size itself and adapt to her new, larger form. Curious, Lambda ran a diagnostics check to see what was going on.

She thought back to her mission of finding Ragna for a moment as the more human side took over once more, now having a rather fat and plentiful belly to fondle and knead as her cheeks once again grew hot at the thought until a familiar sound reached her ears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Rrrrrwl...grrrrrlll...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...hungry again...I should find more sustenance...\" The porky Murakumo searched the streets once more as she started towards a ramen stall, now presenting various passers-by with a view of a delectable derriere as her bobbing float caused it to jostle and jiggle with the rest of her bulging figure.

It was about to, but then Lambda started to exhibit a sort of playful satisfaction at her newfound girth. The semi-sentient virus ceased as Lambda rubbed her hands onto her round, doughy belly which seemed to reach quite a ways down relative to her legs, looking down as her second chin pressed against her impressive breasts and her full booty wobbled behind her even as she merely floated in the air and glided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...soft...\" Lambda muttered to herself with a smile.

Gasping for air and grunting as he tried to extricate himself, the silver-haired Ragna gasped and panted as the wobbling, cuddly masses of arm-flesh clutched him to bulging breasts and a billowing belly. \"Oh RANGA I've been wanting to see you for so long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell? Y-you're...you're Lambda, aren't you? L-lemme go you nutcase!\" the always-blunt man growled as he managed to start shoving against the blubbery mass of belly that threatened to swallow him up.

They all eyed Lambda with awe as the almost 800 pound Murakumo Unit floated her wide ass onto multiple stools so her butt could be help up, her breasts resting atop the counter prominently as her belly squished up against it.

No at a rate Ragna was ESPECIALLY shocked at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...maybe you should have some beer with it as well, uh, sweetie.

She belched a bit, covering her mouth and immediately excusing herself to her beloved Ragna for doing so. Her face flushed as Lambda became more and more drunk, each mug seeming to somehow add more pounds of fat to Lambda's body with each drink. She very likely entered a four-digit figure for her weight long ago, now more fat piling on to bring that number higher as her round belly, massive breasts and impossibly large ass, wide ample hips and puffy legs blew out larger and larger like she was a living balloon of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...if I don't get swamped by her body first... </i>Ragna thought as she moved his stool to the side so he had enough room</span></div></div>",

Lambda's full form only wobbled more and more as she grew outwards, stools disappearing under her expanding booty as it swelled under her. Her suit squeaked and stretched like a balloon as it adjusted its size and tightened around Lambda's billowing body as she grew more and more. Ragna went pale as he wondered if she would reach a whole ton by the time she was finished and full. Then again as far as he also knew, her stomach had been replaced with a black hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hic* Ragnaaa...\" Lambda moaned. Her speech was still slurred thanks to the liquor, which must also have been impeding her thoughts even if she was finding it hard to pass out. Ragna looked up at her, but when he saw her fat, puffy chipmunk like face his dread melted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda had taken her visor off, stowing it in her comically over-sized cleavage, showing Ragna her glimmering and childlike red eyes. She had a worried pout on her flushed drunken face and she looked ready to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...not just gonna leave me are you? I...I don't want to be alone again?\" Lambda whimpered between drunken hiccups. Thanks to Nu's soul, Lambda could see her memories, a girl surrounded by darkness. She's alone and all she wants and all she knows of is Ragna. The one person who she doesn't hate among all of humanity. Lambda herself felt her original memories unlock. Her voice was less Nu's and more her own here. Her one fear, like Nu's was being alone but she also had feared losing her memories. When she was awakened by Kokonoe, her emotions had been lost, but she was regaining them over time. Was it Nu's soul and her affection for Ragna, an anomaly by this gluttony virus? Maybe both. But when Ragna looked at Lambda's eyes, he couldn't help but think of Saya. He knew what would come before he said it, sighing as he lowered his head a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't leave you alone. I promise.\" Ragna said with a straight, stoic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda's face lit up with childlike joy at Ragna's words. She enveloped Ragna again, but this time in a shyer and gentler hug instead of a bear hug, her impossibly over-sized bust pressed against his chest, reaching up to his chin even as the flesh squished and her belly almost enveloped Ragna's body minus his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda sounded ready to cry. Ragna cursed inwards at how confused these Murakumos sure liked to make him feel. Lambda turned to her meal, eating swiftly as she continued to exhibit a softened look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Ragna stepped off his stool, sliding it under Lambda's expanding, billowing rear end so she had more support for it</span></div></div>",

Having spend the time with the now ultra-wide Lambda, he had found himself growing more attached to the innocent Murakumo even as she steered just shy of the solid ton mark thanks to the bar's worth of food and booze now churning away in her bottomless belly. He hiked an eyebrow as he watched Lambda sway dangerously, a brewery's worth of beer working its hardest to black the poor girl out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HIC*\"Awwww...'sh all ouuuuut...?\" Lambda slurred as she staggered to her feet, her mind hazy enough to forget her hovering function and as a result putting untold pressure on the metallic boots around her legs. They let out a loud scream characteristic of metal being rent for a moment before bursting to shreds, leaving both thigh and newly developed cankle to spill down and jiggle freely, her knees lost in a deep, adorable dimple and her feet fattened to cutely swollen proportions. Tottering unsteadily back and forth, all of the various grumbling patrons that passed by stumbled and ran a little faster to avoid the bulging moe-blob and her ballooned belly as they swayed about, her suit shifting along with her untold amounts of blubber and hugging her curves dangerously. The less-stretchy metal bits burst off one at a time, each one feebly pinging off until the bubbling girl was left in simply the black bodysuit and a few hints of her silvery armor around her jiggling boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Be careful there!\" Ragna said firmly, taking a fat, person-sized arm in his own and helping to steady the drunken, colossal girl. Blurry eyes swept over to him, a worried look in her face as she looked down at the skintight suit and her blush darkening the slight bit more that was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-ragnaaaaa...th-this suit isn't too tight, is it...?\" the hyper-obese girl mumbled, starting the slow waddle to the door with her hover-function lost to the dizzied drunken depths of her mind. The red-coated Reaper simply found himself stammering as her hips shimmied and swayed hypnotically even as they broke down the door to the bar, the back of her suit wedged deep into the cavernous cheeks and outlining them to the last little jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...don't worry about it. Look, just...I bet you're still hungry, let's go find a buffet or something like that. Don't worry about whatever any shithead might say about you, just keep going. Got it?\" Ragna replied, a half-forced, half-sincere smile on his face as his own mind sat on the fence about the massive Murakumo. <i>G-great...don't tell me all of the bad experiences I had with that damn rabbit made me want a fat chick...t-though she's not that bad now that she's less obsessive...she's kinda cute actually when you get past the fact she could crush me like a twig if she tried that leaning trick again.</i></span></div></div>",

Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-R-Ragna I...I sort of don't want to go in like this...\" Lambda whimpered. She enjoyed her new billowing fat, this was true, but the nearly 2,000lbs wobbling cutie was starting to become less obsessive and more self-aware. As such, she realized how embarrassing it would be for her to squeeze into the restaurant with her bulbous form and she also was sure this place had a law against people with no shoes, which was troublesome for her adorably plump feet as she crossed her toes over and wiggled them shyly while hugging the sides of her belly as best she could with her puffy arms. She was pouting as her lip quivered and her eyes shimmered. Ragna sighed, rubbing the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Lambda. I'll go in with you, so you won't have to worry. Try to keep your feet hidden behind your belly apron though or you may get thrown out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda shyly nodded. Once again, she clung to Ragna's arm, the Reaper feeling it sink into Lambda's soft body and between her massive breasts as they wobbled independent of one another due to their size. Slowly Lambda waddled behind Ragna like a child too shy for her first day of school. Ragna brought Lambda to the table watching hair raise once more at her order. Lambda looked bashfully over at Ragna, twiddling her plump,thick fingers as she stared at him. They didn't do more then that, though, as food came. Lambda set her appetite on her meal once more as Ragna started to feel himself admitting; that massive flank of Lambda's was pretty nice looking</span></div></div>",

She smiled at Ragna through fattening chins and a now rather entrenched double chin that simply thickened and bulged as she grew, resting atop the blubbery plains of her breasts. The more she ate the more she wanted, cooing in her still buzzed state as her shyness once again flew away with her feasting. A bit of it remained as she occasionally reached back to tug the back of her suit from her deepening crack or forward to try to pull it out of her cleavage, only managing to tighten it more around her fatty frame and outline it even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn this girl can eat...I wouldn't be surprised if she cleaned out this place too...</i> Ragna thought to himself as he pecked at his own meal hesitantly, his eyes more glued to Lambda's frame as it fattened and swelled. They widened ever so slightly as he heard the creaking beneath the blond's destructive buns, imagining it to both be the suit expanding to fit her as well as the chairs bending to her will and weight as it shot ever higher. A thought of him enveloped in the jiggling, bulging buttcheeks came to mind, causing him to shake his head and have it replaced with the same scenario and Lambda's blimped-up belly apron. Every shake of his head forced a change to another part of the gorging girl's blobby figure, from her blubbery breasts to a crushing hug in her ample arms right down to a warm coffin of her wobbling thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda noticed Ragna's head-shaking, tilting her head as much as her thick spare tire of a developing chin would allow as she giggled. Her feasting ceased and her shyness returned in spades as she kept tugging, still feeling the flirty influence of booze washing through her brain as she wiggled atop the chairs. \"R-ragnaaaa...a-are you daydreaming about me?\" Lambda asked with a shy giggle, picking up a napkin and struggling to reach her fat face to clean it of the combination of steak sauce and pasta sauce that had gotten on her bulging cheeks. \"If...if you are, you can tell me...\" she added before hearing the screeching of the chairs under her and glowing red at the thought of them breaking.</span></div></div>",

Ragna bolted up from his seat and looked at her face as she closed her eyes like she was expecting a sharp blow and pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, are you alright, Lambda?!\" Ragna said in a worried tone as he stood by the massive Murakumo's side. Lambda looked up at him, realizing there was no pain to be felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ragna I...I can't, mmph!, reach my fooood~\" Lambda whined, looking as if tears would form in the corners of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna sighed for the umpteeth time that day, reaching up to the counter as he placed Lambda's food on her ballooned breasts and atop the shelves of her belly. Lambda's eyes lit up as she happily ate, using her wings to once again serve as extra hands and utensils to feed her. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can you...can you feed me, Ragna?\" Lambda asked shyly, placing her hands on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna sweat a little. While he was going to certainly say yes, the fact was the way Lambda asked him to do it...it sounded like she was asking him to do something intimate, which made him a bit...estranged to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, he had grown a soft spot in his heart for her. One by one, he would take servings of food, feeding the gleeful Lambda as she pleased, casing her to cutely coo and purr as she was fed. Lambda blushed and smiled whenever she felt Ragna's arm brush past her awesome bust, the massive orbs of fat wobbling from even that slightest touch, eliciting Lambda to giggle while Ragna tried to keep his cool. Lambda fat body just billowed forth across the floor from there, her body swelling and rising with more and more fat, much more then should have been possible even with all the food she was eating so fast! She even seemed to swallow the plates and bowls whole whenever she fed herself, which not only awed Ragna but made him worry this would hike up the bill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BBUUUUURRRPP!!</b> A-aahhh!! Excuse me! I'm sorry Ragna...\" Lambda gasped as she covered her mouth with her thick, plump hands, her face a pinkish red. She must have nearly doubled in size since she came in with how large she was. She would have to bust down another door just to make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really anything to be embarrassed about...\" Ragna said, only impressed that belch wasn't louder as Lambda belly gurgled to digest its large payload. Lambda moaned in bliss as she rubbed her taut belly. For once today, she felt legitimately full, a very pleasing feeling for the nearly two-ton blob. ...On the other hand, there was always dessert.</span></div></div>",

Having buried the memory of her hover function deep in her mind thanks to the sensation of the wobbling blubber along with the luscious tastes of everything, the nearly-two-ton Murakumo slowly stumbled to her feet. Panting and slightly out of breath even considering her immense stamina, her belly apron now flooded over her fat feet, a teensy tear in her otherwise skintight suit now open over the fold where her bellybutton once sat, now wedged between a pair of the luscious folds that made up her creamy apron. Her cheeks glowed as she felt her ass starting to graze the floors of the restaurant as well, wobbling lazily about in time with her trembling, titanic boobs as she shifted her chunky legs about in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dessert? I'd love it!\" Lambda squeaked happily as she took Ragna's hand in a fat, plumpened hand, her fingers starting to struggle with bending just by the merit of how plump and cuddly they've become in her fit of feasting. She began the happy waddle towards the door, her shyness causing her to once again resume tugging on the back of her stretchy suit and take smaller steps to minimize her wobbling, only to go even more red as her sensors picked up the sound of faint tearing around her gigantic cheeks, a matching sliver of torn bodysuit opening to match the one on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shoulda seen this coming...but I REALLY don't mind now...didn't expect her to smash a CHAIR with that ass of hers. Damn!</i> Ragna thought, noticing the tear and peeking back at it while Lambda wasn't looking to get a view of the supple, creamy flesh as it poked out and bulged against the resilient suit. As Lambda tried to squash her way through the doorframe, he sighed as his view was interrupted by the necessary job of stuffing the double-wide moe-blob out, the frame cracking and splintering due to the combined efforts of the Reaper's strength and Lambda's blubbery blobby frame. \"Come oooon...use those damn swords of yours or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda nodded as best as her fat, thick chin would allow, using the mentally controlled blades to neatly slice the frame open wider just as the silver-haired man gave an extra strong shove, sending her rolling a few yards ahead and leaving her dizzy in front of the ice cream shoppe in a wobbling heap. \"O-ooogh...t-thank you R-ragna...\" Lambda belched, her belly's hoard shaken up into a rather upset kettle thanks to the motion and resuming its gurgling as everything attempted to settle down. \"B-but...could you just...just roll me inside?\" she added while slicing the door to the parlor open despite the protests of the owner, her companion nodding with a sigh and setting her up at the counter with a grunt and some work of her own.</span></div></div>",

Ragna pushed, his hands sinking into the soft, supple flesh as Lambda gleefully rolled inside. While the owners were downright pissed at the impromptu carpentry, Lambda's face was more then enough to halt the protests of the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want that and...that and...ooh! Some of that!\" Lambda said like a child as she pointed to each flavor she wanted, just looking on in glee. Ragna, for once, felt himself smiling as he noticed how much Lambda's behavior as she softened up, and grew fatter too, seem to become more and more innocent like a child. Lambda's puffy face beamed with joy as she was handed a towering bowl of ice cream, decorated with sprinkles and fudge and marshmallows and cherries dotted all over. Lambda gleefully rested what was obviously her first bowl of the night onto her colossal bosom as she started to shovel ice cream in her mouth, staining her lips as she ate and giggling at the sweet, cool taste on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tho gooood~!\" She cooed through a mouth full of double-fudge brownie ice cream coated with hot fudge and melted marshmallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employees and the counter were in awe at how much Lambda ate and ate. Well, not really as she eclipsed the two ton mark easily and just continued to enjoy her food. She just ate as her form billowed forth with more fat, spreading across as she began to fill the moderate sitting space with her bountiful fat. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh? Ah, nooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda looked down. her visor had become a crumpled and twisted mess of metal between her bosom. She had forgotten for the longest time that she even put it there, the eye-wear now useless, like when one drops their glasses and then accidentally steps on them. Lambda pouted. First her armor broke, then just seconds ago her suit was apparently reaching its limit adapting to her new size and now she destroyed her visor. Lambda pouted as she looked down at her billowing bosom. She shoveled ice cream in her mouth, hoping the extra food would help her feel better. When she next saw Kokonoe, she could ask for a repair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda was, in no time, back to her blissful and adorable self as she glut herself, finding herself burping more as she swallowed up her ice cream and licked her lips, rubbing the sides of her belly with her thick hands as it grumbled and growled and churned from the massive influx of food inside the already taut and stuffed belly. Nonetheless, the pleasure Lambda felt was undeniable as her body spread out, her flanks ripping more of her suit while her belly rip rose more over her deepening navel while her titanic breasts also started to rip at her suit. Lambda was in distress, crying out as she gripped her body, the pressure of her massive, blubbery arms against her belly (which was still in a bit of a kettle)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BBBUUUUUUURRRRRPP!!</b> ...Excuse me, please!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ...caused her to belch again, immediately excusing herself as she did so, feeling her lightly-tanned face burn red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Lambda finished her ice cream feast before she got too indecent. However, her uniform was very much in tatters thanks to her newer form, the eclipsing orbs that were her breasts exposed a grand amount of her perfectly-shaped cleavage while her legs puffed up to insane degrees as her hips seemed to creep very close to reaching from the counter to the wall opposite and she could feel her peach like ass's blubbery fat rest on the cool tile floor as her bulging belly spread out in front of her. Lambda groaned, rubbing her belly as she wiped ice cream from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-too much...<b>BBBUUUUUUURRRRPPP!!!</b> I have a... Uuuurrrrpp! ...tummyache...\" Lamba whined as she rubbed her full, bulging belly, the adorable blob wincing in a cute manner as she pouted and rubbed at her belly as best she could while it groaned and churned in its digestive chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...at least you're finally full...\" Ragna said, rubbing the back of his head. He looked up as Lambda's blobby size made her rather tall compared to him. He hadn't felt this dwarfed even when he first met Tager. Reaching out, Ragna helped press and rub against Lambda's sore, full-to-the-brim belly, eliciting some moans of discomfort and belches as he tries to help stem the poor girl's indigestion. Lambda allowed her head to sink into the fat of her chins and thick neck a bit as she relaxed, wondering what wondrous possibilities awaited her and her beloved Ragna next?</span></div></div>",

Her belly continued to burble as she belched, Lambda now besieged both by her head and her mountainous tummy as she tried to cope with both at the same time. \"R-ragnaaaa...m-my head...my head really hurts...w-why does it hurt so baaaaad?\" she cried, the sheer amount of ice cream she had ingested giving her the mother of all ice cream headaches. The soft pounding of the headache even send jiggles through her fat, beachball sized cheeks and her cuddly chins, causing her to blush before whimpering again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got an ice cream headache, Lambda. I'm not surprised considering how much you managed to eat...\" Ragna replied before a thought struck him. Robots don't eat ice cream. They don't even eat. What could a headache DO to one though? Would her circuits be fried? Would she go back to the apeshit stalker she had been and try to just crush him under her ass? His eyes went wide as these thoughts shot through his mind, sending him into panic mode and forcing him to fret over the blubbery blob before him. Moving from his position near her mountainous tummy, Ragna opted to rub her forehead gently, only getting more of a squeak and a whine from the mammoth girl that made him stop. His mind became less rational as equal parts worry and fear wormed their way farther into his head before an equally stupid and panicky idea struck him. \"J-just wait here! I'll be right back!\" he said before running out of the store, leaving Lambda to keep rubbing her forehead with her chunky little hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait R-ragna! O-owwwwiiieee...\" Lambda whined, perched on her blubbery ass and still burping softly as her belly churned and gurgled. Flapping her fat feet furiously inside hundreds of pounds of thigh and cankle, she did all she could to show her discomfort, right down to wiggling her bulky arms and sniffling before her beloved came back in, hauling a massive cart loaded with booze behind him. His panicky state had led him to think of the \"numbing\" powers of booze, leading him to uncork a bottle and stuff the mouth between Lambda's plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink up!

Irish cream, whiskey, wine, brandy, beer, scotch...various colors and shades of alcohol passed the poor girl's plump lips as her face became redder and more flushed. Bubbles seemed to pop out of her mouth as Ragna pulled each bottle away after a certain point, considering all the alcohol being pumped inside the Murakumo Unit and her already upset stomach likely being turned into a burbling cauldron within her massive bulbous belly, extra fat pouring on as she spread out further, her hips flaring out closer to the wall and counter on each side as her belly and rear spread out across the floor more and more as the liquor only helped further add to Lambda's blobby form<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda hiccuped and belched loudly, even for a drunkard.

In fact, her headache was all but nonexistent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope she doesn't become an alcoholic because of this...</i> Ragna bemoaned internally as her poured a whole mini keg down Lambda's throat, her belly expanding outwards with fat and liquid as she savored drop after drop of creamy liquor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BBBBUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPP!!!</b> Raaaagnaaaa~ *Hic!* Guess whoshe ready for a nice naaaap~?\" Lambda purred drunkenly, running her hands over the blubber mass that was her belly, fat fingers grabbing and pinching at her folds playfully. Ragna's eyes had to be forced off of Lambda's wide hips and massive billowing breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well I guess it is kinda late...maybe we can check into a hotel or something...?\" Ragna suggested as he found himself a bit awestruck by her figure, but also cautious because of her intoxicated mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm~? Yeah a *HIC!* <b>BBBUUUuuurrrrrpp!!</b> hotel shounds nishe...eheeheehee~\" Lambda giggled drunkenly, hugging Ragna into her puffy body with a single arm as she looked down.

Her belly did the same as her meaty breasts bounced atop the fleshy apron, every bit of her down to her wobbly forearms jiggling and wobbling apart from any other part.

I'm not gonna let youuuuu or Kokonoe take him 'caushe you two are MEANIESH-hic-BRAP!.\" Lambda slurred, her eyes unfocused as she took another step only to yelp as a bulging foot trod on her tummy apron. The little slip caused her to topple head over heels, the peachy moons of her ass tumbling over her to cast Tager into shadow for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell...\" was all the massive black-haired robot could get out of his mouth before a deep divot between her bulky buns and her bulging back-fat swallowed him up, her poundage officially high enough to deepen her rolls enough to swallow the red-skinned fighter whole. Wobbling and sloshing atop her ass as he vanished deep into the crevices of her back fat, she looked around blearily for any trace of him, Ragna staring in awe at what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha haaaaappen...where'd that meanie Tager goooo...\" Lambda muttered, a few pathetic wobbles coming from the space that Tager had vanished into before fading fast, leaving Ragna to gulp a little at the prospect of him meeting the same fate at some point...</span></div></div>",

She hopped, making the ground shake a bit and shift under her, the ground where she landed crushed in a crater under her thick fat belly and ass which wobbled madly. Tager was flung out of her folds from the very impact as Ragna ducked down while the poor man skidded across the ground in an unconscious weighty heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Gently you talked to me/That alone made me feel your kindness/No matter how much I felt uneasy, you were always by my side~\" Lambda happily sang to herself in her drunken jovial state, an affable smile on her puffy face as she squeezed her way through an alley towards the nearest Hotel. Ragna, finding himself falling behind, chased after her as he was surprised how far ahead she was. For her size, Lambda was surprisingly mobile and fast.

Not wanting to hurt the obese girl's feelings though, he smiled begrudgingly and followed her elephantine ass along, noticing a few cute dimples that had formed from her alcohol and ice cream binge. Rather than ruining the perfect spheres, the little dimples seemed to magnify their plushness, simply reinforcing just how massive the butterball of a Murakumo had become in such a short time frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling into the hotel with Ragna in tow, the lecherous owner wolf-whistled at the sextuple-wide blond before winking at her companion, waiving the fee and simply pointing at a set of massive doors down a side hall, all of the other doors along the way widened for clientele who obviously preferred those of the \"larger\" persuasion. The Reaper simply sighed and tried to explain himself before Lambda grabbed his hand. \"C'moooooon Ragna...'m shleeeeepy...\" Lambda slurred, belching happily as she lumbered down the hallway and sliced the doorframe wider before she reached it to fit through without too many problems. Giggling mischievously at the sight of the heart-shaped double-king-sized bed, she waddled over playfully and plopped her buns down on it, turning to face Ragna and jiggling her belly rolls around playfully before reaching up to squash her behemoth boobs together, the tatters of her costume finally giving way fully from so much purposeful jiggling to reveal her entire plush, perfect, blobby figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee...Raaaaagnaaaaa...do you reeeeeeally like meh?

Lambda started patting her belly, watching the jello like mass wobble as her incredible girth shifted. Lambda laid on her thick, rolling back while she hefted the twin globes of her breasts in her puffy arms as she wiggled her toes more. She noticed a basket of chocolate bananas sitting by the bed, which she grabbed in one hand and licked her lips greedily as she did. The naked Murakumo took said banana, dipping it between her cleavage into what cream she couldn't reach, wriggling the banana between her boobs for a few seconds, before sliding the whole thing past her plump lips as she swallowed it whole. Ragna couldn't help but gulp audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shooo...you looove me Raagnaaa? Ehehehe~ Gooood~\" Lambda cooed in a mock-innocent, playful tone as she turned over on the bed.

She cooed as he returned the favor, his hands bouncing her chin up and down and causing her to laugh even more. The silver-haired reaper then started to bounce Lambda's bulging belly up and down with his feet, grinning as the cyborg's stomach resumed its angry gurgling and the blush returned to the drunken girl's cheek as she let out a roaring belch that jostled her thick cheeks. \"O-ooogh...ooooh Ragna...s-sho good~!

Did she...did she absorb the bed into her bulk somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lambda...psst! Hey! Lambda!\" Ragna said silently as he tried to peacefully awaken the sleeping robotic blob.

It was a dress, sort of like what a schoolgirl would wear with a design almost exactly like Lambda's old suit with long sleeves to cover her puffy, person size arms and a large skirt that was even wide enough to be practical for Lambda's large flanks.

She wore metal-silver stockings that reached even up to her massive, furniture crushing thighs and black slip on shoes that easily left enough room for Lambda to wiggle her swollen feet. Lambda folded her hands in front of herself, shyly looking to the side as her arms pressed against her belly and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would this...be b-better, Ragna?\" Lambda asked shyly as she observed her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'd say that works just fine for you.\" Ragna said with a smile. He took Lambda's thick hand, gently, carefully, in his own. Lambda was excited at the touch, but also nervous. She slowly followed behind, her burgeoning bulk wobbling from the slightest of movements as her thick legs collided and slapped together and her massive ass bounced and wobbled along the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...any ideas for what to do this morning?\" Ragna asked in a very straight tone while Lambda looked around, blushing as a few stray passerby's watched the two of them walk out of the Love Hotel...</span></div></div>",

Most of them simply shrugged and continued along, while a few more perverted men and even women gave the blond's thick hips and buttery buns a playful pinch or rub only to be scared off by a glare from Ragna. She felt protected now that she was near him and he was more accepting of her, squeezing his hand gently in her fat paw and continuing to waddle along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast sounds perfect to me. All of that...stuff...last night kinda got me hungry to be honest. I watched you eat more than I ate myself.\" Ragna chuckled, shaking his head before leading the bountiful girl to a large buffet, one that served breakfast well into the afternoon in case the colossal cyborg wouldn't be full before then. Helping her inside with a minimum of having to cleave the door open, the staff had been informed of a rather large monster cleaning out the restaurants, only to find that the \"monster\" was in fact a shy, bashful, colossal girl. Most of the more welcoming of the staff simply smiled and led her to a table, clearing others aside and making room for her wide bottom to settle in. Watching Lambda get settled, Ragna smiled and went up to the line for himself, Lambda being pampered further by the same friendly greeters who rushed back and forth to start piling plates atop Lambda's fluffy, fattened breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-ragna...do...do you mind feeding me when you're done?\" Lambda asked between mouthfuls of fluffy omelet that her swords carefully brought to her plump-lipped mouth, every bite adding just the tiniest bit of extra weight that quickly started to add up, her dress creaking for the merest moment before starting to stretch to fit her frame as it swelled. Ragna simply nodded and started on his breakfast, sharing a smile with the fattening girl and actually chuckling once more as some of the ketchup-topped egg dish plopped off of one of the swords and bounced onto her thick, bulky chin. Spearing it once more she plopped it into her mouth only to blush at the ketchup stain it left, struggling to heft her arms up to wipe it away and only managing to flub the blimpy limbs.</span></div></div>",

Once he set the napkin down on the table, however, he picked up a fork and started to feed Lambda omlettes, eggs and bacon as she sat there. She shyly looked over at Ragna, setting her swords down on the table for the moment and just letting Ragna bring the food to her mouth, making Lambda's bulbous body swell out more and more with fat as her belly was filled with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda herself started to feel her appetite ruin the moment, but still held herself back from total gorging so she could enjoy the moment with Ragna for a bit longer. Soon, however, that moment passes and Lambda started to grab food in her fat paws as well as using her swords to feed herself en masse once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you Ragna. Um...you can keep feeding me while I eat myself...\" Lambda said shyly, her form filling out the dress once more, causing it to readjust in size so she remained decent.

She twiddled her plump thumbs while looking away, then turning her attention back to Ragna. \"You do have something on your face actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forwards as best her thousands of pounds would allow, Lambda pressed her hands gently on Ragna's lap so as not to apply too much weight and then kissed him on his right cheek, where he had a small ketchup stain. Ragna smiled a bit at the coincidence, petting Lambda's head before she pulled back, allowing a satisfied, cute giggle to pass as she blushed and stared at Ragna's differently colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ragna, uhm...\" Lambda wanted to say something again as she looked at Ragna. This time Ragna locked eyes with her and his reply was almost instant. However, Lambda seemed to stutter as she tried to get the words out, wondering if she could even say them properly. \"M-maybe tonight...we...we cou...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voiced trailed off Lambda placed her blubber arms atop the folds of her majestic belly, clenching her thick hands into cute, balled up fat fists as she tried to work up her courage...</span></div></div>",

He took in stride after a few moments of gawking however, pointing at the pair and glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two have destroyed countless restaurants!\" he began before Ragna cleared his throat and put in \"Six at the most\".

I will have you two pay for the trouble you've caused, in the name of the Hero of Justice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharging at the pair, Ragna moved to stand in front of Lambda as the enormous girl let out a squeak of shock, her dimpled knees knocking as she tried to turn away from the charging \"hero\"...</span></div></div>",

Why the hell can't I just eat in peace for once?\" Ragna growled as Bang ran forward to deliver an impressive jump kick, which Ragna jumped over swiftly and then tried to dive down with a kick of his own, sending bang sprawling into what appeared to be a cart of Cabbages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda stood back watching. While she didn't see a need to worry about Ragna coming out on top at all against this man, she detected something rather troubling. Looking closer as Bang jumped back from one of Ragna's black shockwaves as he swung his sword, Lambda detected some faint power emanating from the 55-inch nail on Bang's back. She called up a holographic red terminal in front of her as she tried to ascertain what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...! A Nox Nyctores...? It's faint, but even in a dormant state it seems to have great power. This man, Bang, must have more to him then it appears.\" Lambda muttered to herself, her shy personality melting away as remnants of her cold and analytical former self shone through, which made her seem as if she were taking the situation too seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOIIIII~!! Ragna the Bloodedge, you coward! If you think you can win with sorcery then you know nothing of the superhuman senses I have been trained to as a warrior of Ikaruga!\" Bang bellowed as he hobbled forwards with one of Orient Town's lanterns stuck over his head. He held his hands out forwards as he slowly tried to find Ragna, who just stood there, staring blankly at Bang as he almost grabbed at a woman and apologized as he heard her scream, turning around only to bonk heads with a man passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...M-maybe he's just acting...?\" Lambda muttered to herself as she felt a large drop of sweat flow down the back of her head. As she puzzled more to herself, Lambda suddenly squealed as she felt Bang's firm hands on her colossal chest, his hands sinking deep into the massive mounds of perky flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?! Ragna the Bloodedge, have you tried to trap me in a pit of dough!? An equally strange and malicious punishment-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna's eyes went red as he took a fist, cloaked in energy black as night and thrust it right into Bang's head, sending the poor and hapless vigilante spinning like a corkscrew through the air as he skidded across the ground, his legs and rear raised in the air in a comical and humiliating manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, just hurry up and go down already! Die, catch a cold, go take a dump, anything as long as you just go the hell away!!\" Ragna bellowed as a black aura surrounded his body. Lambda held her chunky hands up to her mouth as she shuddered a bit, buckling her knees inwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBang groaned as he picked himself up, dusting off his legs as he flipped back and took his fighting stance once more, planting a balled fist into his other hand, then stepping back and waving a hand as if to say with his body language, \"Bring it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! True Justice is always prepared to fight until the end no matter what! Besides, I made sure to take a bathroom break beforehand.\" Bang said, the second part of his sentence spoken in a much more casual tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna sighed. He figured bang wouldn't give up so easily, but holding back was getting annoying. He wouldn't go all-out, but maybe if he just gave Bang one particularly firm strike he could end this fast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda was getting restless though. She knew Ragna could easily best Bang, that this wasn't anything to worry about but her emotions towards Ragna made her impatient and overprotective. She wanted to throw herself in, maybe see if she couldn't knock Bang away with her meaty buns and send him off so he wouldn't bother them again! But she should stay put! That was what she tried telling herself over and over. Stay put, Ragna can do this! But...what if he still gets hurt.

What trick are you pulling thisMMMMFUOHG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda smiled proudly as she managed to hop up a few feet with the aid of her hover system, plunking her colossal bottom down on top of Bang and situating it just right so that the ninja wouldn't suffocate or be dragged too deeply into the crevice between her bulky cheeks. Wiggling around and hearing the soft popping of an arm or leg, she looked over her shoulder as Ragna walked around the perimeter of the seated Murakumo. Kneeling next to Bang's head even as spirals seemed to flow around his eyes, he chuckled a few more times and flicked his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dumbass...ready to give up and let my friend and I eat in peace?\" Ranga asked as Bang started to come to, realizing the prison he was trapped in and gulping for breath as he felt his ribs starting to shift uncomfortably from the plush weight on top of him.

I too have known such a feeling, a hunger for justice that can't be quenched no matter what I do!\" Bang said until a sharp rap upside his head from Ragna brought him to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't mean that, dumbass. Her gut's been bothering her, so I've been trying to help her fill it up. Those places have a beef with her, they can bug us when she's finally full and happy.

His face was cold and unmoved even as his green eyes observed the fulsome wobbling of Lambda's whole body, but especially the bulbous apron of her belly, the massive elephantine moons of her ass and her impressive mounds that served as her round, supple breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...10:48 AM. Not only is that public intoxication, but it is far too early for anyone to be drinking. ...Not to mention that outfit could be a potential charge of indecent exposure.\" The young man thought aloud to himself as he looked on, keeping a gloved hand close to the hilt of his katana, Yukinasea. He watched on, but saw a young man with that girl. He wore a red coat over a black outfit of some kind, had silver hair and a large broadsword. He looked like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BROOOOOOOOTHER~!!\" An ethusiastic voice shouted, which made Ragna freeze in place and cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw hell.\" Was all he said before Jin ran in front of him in a flash, looking on with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother there you are! I counted how long it was since we last saw each other, I was so worried! We're finally back together, back-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRPP!! Hehehe, Ragnaaa I...think that wash a new record!\" Lambda giggled as a booming belch passed her lips. Jin closed his hand around Yukinasea's hilt as he looked on at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-what is this low-grade monster! Brother, is she keeping you her prisoner so you fulfill whatever black needs she has?!\" Jin said with unneeded worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of crap are you spewing?! Jin, this is...well she's my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother we have to escape! Quick, come with me now!\" Jin wrapped his arms up over Ragna's shoulders as he tried pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jin, what the hell?! Let go! She's not holding me hostage you moron!\" Ragna yelled as he dug his feet into the pavement as best he could. Lambda looked on lazily, rubbing at her eyes with a balled-up chunky hand as her blurred vision tried to make out the scene in front of her.</span></div></div>",

Grumbling and grunting as he tugged back, he didn't notice Lambda managing to clear her vision just enough to see her beloved being plagued by the blond katana-wielder. Her eyebrows furrowed as she let out a belch, stomping over to the pair and tugging Ragna's hand free easily before putting herself between Jin and him, giving her beloved a view of her generous, mammoth ass as it wobbled and jiggled lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey...shtop *BRAP!* being mean to my Ragnaaaaaa...he'she mine and mine alone, you sh...shtupidhead...\" Lambda slurred as she shoved her belly against Jin, the blond NOL agent blinking at how much force the whale of a girl could put behind the shove and moving to draw his blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You insufferable slovenly cow! How dare you get between me and my beloved brother! I'll slice you into shreds, and then take my brother, and we'll be together forever!\" Jin gushed, drawing his blade and slicing right at Lambda's tummy. She simply giggled as the sword sank into a few of her belly rolls, a cool tingly sensation washing over her as her power to absorb inanimate objects started to kick in, drawing Yukianesa farther into her tummy and pulling Jin along with it. \"N-no! Release me! Y-you whale, release me this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda cooed and giggled as the cool sensation grew stronger with every moment, Yukianesa starting to billow her out even fatter and faster than the untold gallons of sake had thanks to its status as a Nox Nyctores, the powerful Armagus causing a massive influx of weight that shoved against Jin and broke his grasp with the blade. The few moments left of its influence brought Jin to start to shove against the obese Murakumo. \"R-return my sword to me! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelping as the shoves worked with her own already hampered balance, Lambda flailed and squeaked as she soon found herself overbalancing, toppling forward onto the blond man and squashing him firmly beneath plush, wobbling bellyflesh up to his neck. Ragna simply watched in awe as Lambda blimped and Jin flailed, his brother's eyes starting to clear a little as the Nyctores' influence vanished moment by moment to leave him more lucid.</span></div></div>",

She started cheering and cooing as she felt herself blow up with more creamy, flowing fat as her gothic dress stretched more and more. Lambda's drunk state made her forget to reshape her dress's size, the polymers of the fabric stretching and warping as it tried to cover her billowing fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaay~! *hic* *Hic!* *BRRAAAUUUUUPP!* More fat~! More fat~!\" Lambda cheered as she waved her arms up and down with a grin of childlike wonder on her face as she enjoyed her growth in her drunken state. Ragna sighed as he looked on at Jin as he began to vanish more and more within the increasing depth of Lambda's bulbous belly, a hand reached up as if he were sinking in quicksand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as it may have appeared grim, Lambda's fat may well have been as far from fatal as possible, based on what Ragna knew from sleeping atop her last night. But seeing his brother plead and cry and beg, and the fact he was freed of that evil sword making him an insufferable jerkass. Ragna sighed as he reached down, grabbing Jin's arm with his artificial one. He planted a foot against Lambda's belly, atop one of her shelves that she called her folds and pulled hard. Slowly, Jin rose out from the fat, again fitting with a quicksand analogy as Lambda remained blissfully unaware as she fondled and played with her breasts as they swelled and puffed up with fat while humming something to herself. Ragna pulled and soon with an almost cartoon-like *POP!*...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaarrrgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin found himself free of the prison that was Lambda's belly. He was sprawled across the pavement, laying alongside Ragna while trying to catch his breath after having been nearly sucked into Lambda's fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Brother...\" Jin muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it. The only one who gets to take you down is me, okay?\" Ragna said as he caught his breath between words. He picked himself up and tried to help Lambda as she stumbled to her fat feet, which cutely and comically wiggled behind her as she got up, her form wobbling in a way that would have torn her dress asunder where it made of normal fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your BRAAUUURRP! Brother is a...poop head, Ragnaaa...\" Lambda said, giggling in a manner befitting her drunk state at the fact she said, 'Poop head.' Ragna groaned as he looked on at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ragna...you picked an interesting woman.\" Jin said in a calmer, but less jarringly cold tone, which caught Ragna's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks like Saya, almost. ...Even in her stupor, I can tell she has her merits. Brother, you better take good care of her or I'll hunt you down again.\" Jin said with a minor smile. Ragna's eyes widened with surprise. He acted more like...the old Jin. A cold and blunt edge, but not wholly bad. Jin smiled as her turned, his uniform whipping behind him with a minor, unintended flourish as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda hugged Ragna into her bulk before he could be left alone with his thoughts too long, the silence grating on the drunken android.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coooome on Ragnaaa~ Leeeetsh go somewhere else~! Come on!\" Lambda gushed as she cuddled Ragna into the blubber of her belly and the puffy fat of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what did you have in mind then?\" Ragna asked in a nonplussed tone with a small smile of his own.</span></div></div>",

Smiling at the bright lights and colorful exterior, she started to lumber for it energetically while dragging Ragna along, barreling along and knocking a few people aside including the bouncer as she squeezed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh Ragna~!

As he waited and hesitated, she giggled and started to dance by herself, her ballooned up buns and matching hips swaying to the beat of the music and causing her to stumble a little dangerously. She belched as the sake within her belly keg sloshed around, her face still bright red as she danced away, almost hypnotizing Ragna with how her plentiful blubber swayed and jiggled with every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...you have fun with that, Lambda...I'm gonna just watch...\" Ragna called back, smiling hesitantly as he watched Lambda jiggle and jostle around, most of the patrons grumbling and leaving but a few simply taking it in stride and actually smiling at the whale of a woman, using her bouncy fat as a springboard for a few of their own dance moves and causing her to giggle playfully as they tickled her. Her dress tore slightly more with every few gyrations of her hips and every few movements of her flabby front, more and more hints of her panties peeking through and a rather substantial amount of tummy now showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee...thish ish sho much fun~! *URP!* *hic!*\" Lambda gushed before she cued up her hover engines, trying a twirl and going wildly off balance before slamming to the floor. A loud crack echoed through the club as the wooden floor splintered beneath her heavy ass, leaving her a little dazed and shaking her chubby face around in shock.</span></div></div>",

First he would punch that guy, kick that girl away and as he bought time for Lambda to get up he would use the Azure to fend everyone off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all melted away when a sudden onslaught of cheering erupted from the crowd as Lambda tried to pick herself up onto her swollen feet, her body wobbling like pudding as she looked around at the praise being thrown her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, just amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a miracle she could even walk, but damn if that girl can't dance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hey over here! Lemme get a picture!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda giggled as she found her confusion melting away.

One at a time! Give her some breathing room!\" Ragna said as she sidled up to Lambda, taking her thick, fatty arm as best he could while she looked on and tried to appease the masses. \"We, uh, I think we had enough fun so uh...we should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey that was amazing, girl!\" One of the staff said as he walked up to Lambda, who turned and smiled at the young man. \"I dunno if the manager will approve or not but...just for that, help yourself to anything you like on the drink list. I'm sure there are plenty of people here willing to pick up the tab if the house won't. Right guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hearty bellow of cheering echoed from the mass of people surrounding them, leaving Ragna and Lambda in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she deserves payment for a show like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should make a career out of it!

Lambda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd merely started cheering Lambda's name over and over. Lambda knocked her dimpled knees inwards as she placed her chunky hands against the round, poofy cheeks of her fat face while shyly swaying back and forth a bit, causing her form to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... *Hic* Shuppose 'notha drink won't hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lambda! Lambda! Lambda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lambda!! I swear if you keep this up you'll black out!\" Ragna tried to shout over the crowd. However, he lost in the end as they kept egging Lambda on, as she seemed to almost inflate with fat as she held a hose tightly between her lips and started chugging wine right from a massive stock barrel as she blew out more and more. She could almost feel her mind becoming hazier as the alcohol entered her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lambda, I said stop! I seriously doubt I could drag you out so that's kind of why I'm falling back on yelling!\" Ragna shouted again, only for his words to fall on deafened ears as Lambda chugged and chugged, her form billowing forth as her dress was looking more and more provocative as it warped and tore, making her look more like a \"lady of the evening\" then a humble student at some gothic academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBRRAAAAAAAAP!! Whoo~! Bring it on, bring it on! 'Alloy shtomach Lambda' ishn't gonnaaaa loshe to booze *hic!* *hic!* no matter...how much I wanna shnooze!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore cheers echoed forth as Ragna gripped his ears in hopes of some silence as Lambda cheered herself and laughed. She looked down at Ragna and held him close as she whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ragnaaa~ Lambda haaaaas shomething she wants to teeeell yoooou~\" Lambda giggled in a singsong tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to tell me? And why the hell are you speaking in third person like Nu used to? Oh shit are you so drunk you've gone THAT far off the deep end?!\" Ragna worried as he started to sweat bullets while Lambda just giggled more, holding him close.

He figured at the least, the extra food in her belly would soak up the alcohol...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BLUURP!* Mmm~ so gooood. Heheh, Ragnaaaa you *Hic!* waaant something before I...I eaaat it aaall?\" Lambda slurred as she turned around, food smeared around her mouth from her rampant gluttony as she continued to stuff it full of delicious food without any pause or concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no you...keep eating, I'm fine for now...\" Ragna said nervously. Lambda at least sobered up enough she wasn't speaking in third-person for now, that was a good sign. Watching as she made her way down the line of trays, clearing out each and every one (but oddly relenting when she made it to the salad section) her mannerisms becoming less tipsy and drunken over time. Ragna just enjoyed the show, crossing his legs as he watched the blubbery moons of Lambda's ass spread further across the floor as her thick, bulky legs practically fused together further while her belly spread further and her breasts blew up in size like a pair of tender, fleshy balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUURP!* Mmmmgh~ I'm so fuuuull~\" Lambda sighed, cooing and purring happily as her plump hands explored her grander bulk as she gave her belly a quick pat with a big, childlike grin on her face, the blubbery surface rippling and wobbling from the impact on her bloated form.

She picked Ragna up from his seat easily thanks to his much tinier size compared to the blond Murakumo as she gently held him closer, squishing Ragna against her massive breasts as she cutely tapped the tip of his nose against hers, causing her to close her eyes and smile innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ragnaaa~ I wanna do some more stuff before it gets too dark! I wanna have more fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokonoe woulda never let me do stuff like this.\" Lambda moaned as she cutely puffed up her already puffy cheeks in annoyance while she spoke. \"She woulda said something about how I 'don't need' fun even though I remember seeing Tager read books and listen to classical music in his spare time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna paused, finding himself grinning as he observed Lambda's reaction and kind of wishing he owned a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Alright, let's go find something else to do.

Thank you Ragna~!\" Lambda cooed as she hugged Ragna against her bulk. Once she realized how much he was struggling and heard his muffled cries, her reaction changed to one of shock and embarrassment as she freed Ragna from the soft fleshy depths. As Ragna regained his breath he looked back at Lambda with as best a smile he could manage at the moment as she slowly followed him outside, accidentally hitting her head against the very top of the door frame even after cutting it wider for her to fit out of.</span></div></div>",

Please can we go?\" Lambda pleaded, leaning in more and turning Ragna's view into a combination of deep, deep cleavage despite her dress' best efforts and adorably fat, watermelon-cheeked face that held pleading eyes. Thinking about the possible bad effects that could happen for only a moment before the cute gaze wore him down, Ragna sighed a little and looked to the carnival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fine...I guess you wouldn't have gone to one thanks to that pink haired bitch, huh?\" Ragna said as he took the lead in walking towards the source of the colorful fireworks, Lambda following close behind and nearly skipping now as best as her bulky, blubbery frame would allow. Her fat little legs kicked up her belly with every step she took, causing her to giggle even more as the tickling sensation combined with her overwhelming cheer at being able to visit the carnival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so colorful!\" Lambda squeaked as she hurriedly jiggled from one station of the large carnival to the next, looking at all of the various stuffed animals to be won and the treat that could be bought to eat. She giggled at the sight of some of the performers as well, Ragna letting out a sigh as he tried to keep up with the massive girl up until she stopped at a baseball-toss booth, her gaze firmly on a large Kaka doll hanging from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-ragna...? Could you win that for me...?\"</span></div></div>",

He could have imagined Tao herself looking at it and mistaking it for another fellow Kaka knowing how ditzy she could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda let out a little cry of delight when Ragna said yes that almost made him clutch at his heart from just how sweet and cute the spontaneous outcry of glee. Picking up a single white baseball that looked brand new, Ragna gripped it in his artificial arm. While Carnivals were nice and this was no exception, sometimes there were seedier aspects, like rigged games or crappy rides made for the sake of profit. For all he knew, those bottles were glued together so no one could knock them all down. So he decided to have a bit of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinding up his pitch like he was an actual professional baseball player, Ragna stepped back keeping his differently colored eyes on the bottles and then, as his hand briefly burned darker then black, he threw the ball forward. The bottles all flew off the shelf as they were forced off by the strength of Ragna's pitch, which tore a hole through the booth and sailed off across the horizon. The man standing at the booth was dumbfounded, his mouth wide open in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that earned us first prize?\" Ragna said with a sarcastic undertone to his voice. The man only nodded slowly as he handed the large Kaka doll up to Lambda, who's puffy face beamed as she held it in her arms. She cuddled the doll against her thick fat in her person-sized thick arms as it squished in between her titanic breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Ragna!\" Lambda cooed as she continued to snuggle her beloved little toy against her blubbery body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah no problem.\" Ragna laughed as she rubbed the back of his head, blushing a bit as he observed Lambda's adorable demeanor. All of a sudden, Lambda stuffed her Kaka doll in between her boobs, where it would very much remain safe, then lifted Ragna in her soft, cuddly hands bringing his face up to hers and pressing him against her bulk as he looked into her shimmering eyes. Lambda suddenly showered Ragna with a myriad of gleeful kisses, her lips pressing against his as well as his cheeks and forehead. Once she put him down, Ragna had lip marks all over his dumbfounded face which looked as if he were about to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go buy some cotton candy next~! I'll be back, okay Ragna?\" Lambda said with a wide grin on her fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...sure, go ahead...\" Ragna said in a dreamy tone, still out of it from all the kissing as Lambda cheerily waddled her way to a stand with a large cotton candy mixer, humming happily as she made her way past the other people gathered around, smiling as she leaned over and asked for a bunch for herself. Ragna just stood back and couldn't help but stare at Lambda's rolling back and wide, massive rear that dragged and pressed against the ground in his semi-conscious state.</span></div></div>",

Noticing it fully as soon as he saw the lights around him dimming, he looked up only to see a big, bulky mass of black silk plummeting towards him before smothering him in warm, soft bulk. A soft laugh floated through the air as soon as a sea of wobbling settled around him, causing him to grunt and try to extricate himself from what had proven itself to be a bulky, blubbery butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear dear...little Ragna, you've been having so much fun it looks like...\" the obviously spoiled-obese Rachel Alucard chuckled as she munched away at a rather large, heavily iced strawberry cake. Every bite caused her 3800 pound frame to quiver and surge out until the last bite passed between ruby red, plumpened lips, surging her out to a square two tons of blubbery vampire girl. Squirming her unfit derriere atop Ragna, she savored the sound of slightly popping joints as she rubbed and kneaded a mammoth belly apron contained in her black blouse. Suckling her fingers clean of icing she smirked as she shimmied enormous, bulky legs around, her pear shape quivering mightily to contrast with the blobby Lambda and quivering much more to prove itself as a much more unfit, blubbery shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-ragna!\" Lambda cried, seeing the spiky tufts of silver hair and waddling hurriedly back to her beloved, a pair of colossally stacked cotton candy sticks stuffed into her fat little hands as she hurried along. Stuffing them into her breasts for safekeeping, she grunted as she started to try to shove against Rachel, only managing to squash her mighty breasts against the vampire girl's own endowments and whine softly. The blubbery blond huffed angrily and took the Murakumo's fat little hands, starting to shove back and growing redfaced quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who do you think you are? I don't care if you're even larger than I am, you don't simply start shoving against somebody!\" Rachel huffed as she shoved and squashed against Lambda, her cheeks glowing as she continued to wiggle her blubbery buns atop Ragna.</span></div></div>",

While Rachel had very impressive strength on her own, Lambda being so much more massive then even the spoiled vampire herself was certainly not making this easy for the blubbery pear of a girl. It didn't help Ragna any either as he felt Rachel's bulky buns squash and flow over his body, making any cries or howls of pain and discomfort he had muffled under the sheer sea of fat flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too out of the ordinary for him either; every so often Rachel was so bored she would do anything to spice up each different time loop. This time, Rachel had taken to a favorite pastime of hers. She would simply eat as much as she wanted, showing guiltless rampant gluttony all throughout the whole century before time looped over and she was skinny again. In addition, Rachel loved using her mass to play with Ragna, namely sitting on him and trapping the poor man under her massive moons of her rear while she glut herself, her growing bulk pressing down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she had not anticipated Lambda's intervention as the bulky Murakumo pushed and pushed. Rachel's face was red from a combination of embarrassment as she felt Lambda's bulk squish against hers while their fatty bellies and blubbery breasts squished together and even their chins seemed to be slapped against each other and fatigue as she tried to push. Sitting around eating for nigh on all of a century had really not been friendly to Rachel's strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulkier Lambda, however, had her own impressive stamina that allowed her to give one final push with as much might as she could summon, coupled with her drive to protect her beloved Ragna, as she sent Rachel tumbling backwards. Rachel let out a surpised yelp as she rolled backwards, her blubbery form rolling a good three meters as she stopped atop her bulky butt and groaned as she felt her belly in a rather uncomfortable and irritated mix from the cake she had recently polished off, causing her belly to groan and slosh and gurgle as belches passed her cutely plump lips en masse in between groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda protectively hugged Ragna against her bulk as she looked at Rachel, who laid back trying to rub her belly thanks to the uncomfortable stir it had been sent into as she belched and even hiccuped once or twice from trapped air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Ragna?\" Lambda asked with her concern laid out while she looked down at Ragna. As the red-coated man popped his joins back in place, Lambda saw he was...blushing? He also seemed to have a rather sizable nosebleed, but that could have been just as likely from having his face pressed into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch...damn Rabbit...\" Ragna muttered as he walked ahead, feeling his mood turn a bit foul. Lambda waddled behind him, poking her plump index fingers together. She considered some way to cheer up her beloved Ragna, looking down a bit as they wandered around the carnival while she pulled the cotton candy out of the storage area known as her massive cleavage, then took some small (for her) bites out of one absurdly loaded stick.</span></div></div>",

Looking down at her conservative outfit, she closed her eyes for the merest moment and tried to modify it to be more risque for the silver-haired swordsman only to squeak as she felt the skirt slide just inches too high before she dropped it back down. She worried a little before trying to move the neckline of her blouse down to flash more cleavage, managing to get that right before going back to work on her skirt. Before long she giggled as she felt a properly sized slit shimmying around her loaded thighs, causing her to speed up a little and nuzzle against Ragna slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-ragnaaaaa...do...do you like my new clothes?\" she squeaked, leaning in and flashing the colossally deep canyon, not taking into account what the extra gravity would do and accidentally flashing much more of her blubbery, plush breasts than she initially planned to. The lean also caused her skirt to hike up and bury itself between her cuddly love handles and her bulky hips, leaving her dimpled knees bare and everything below them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-woah! What the hell Lambda?! Where did this come from?\" Ragna yelped, his pale face going red as a beet as he looked the now scantily-clad Murakumo up and down, his eyes sticking around her globular, blimped up buns and her heavy, soft breasts thanks to the modified clothing. Lambda smiled a little as she stood back up, wiggling her wide hips around anxiously and smoothing out her blouse over her jiggling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well I noticed you weren't acting happy, so...so I wanted to cheer you up...I didn't know how I should have though, so...I did this...\" Lambda explained with a shy giggle, her anxiousness tweaking her outfit a little more and opening up a revealing slit across her creamy tummy, letting a bit of the blubbery mountain peek out. \"D-does it look okay?\"</span></div></div>",

She felt her heart race within her chest. Maybe she would keep her outfit like this, if only for a bit longer. It made Ragna happy and...it felt rather nice being able to have the confidence to walk around like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna found it hard to keep his eyes off of Lambda's blubbery body thanks to this new, impressive show of her assets. Her roughly 7,011 lbs body wobbled amorously and extra peek at her vast, soft cleavage and massive rear made him start to drop his guard a bit as he would occasionally stumble into passerby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...this is fine for now, right?\" Lambda asked nervously, biting on her fingernails a bit out of nervous reflex while knocking her dimpled knees inwards under the blobby apron of her corpulent belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...I feel better now, thanks Lambda.\" Ragna smiled again, holding Lambda's hand a bit more firmly as he shifted closer to her, slightly leaning against her bulk. Lambda smiled, using her free hand to grasp her other absurdly proportioned cotton candy stick from her cleavage and start taking conservative bites out of it so she could savor the sweet taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after that, the fireworks started to fire off with gusto, a whole impressive show dotting the sky as far as they could see! Lambda was jumping for joy the whole time, her blubber jiggling madly, almost making Ragna faint as cracks formed under her as well as an impressive crater. She cried and squealed in joy, following each one with childlike wonder as if she were watching a shower of shooting stars, pointing out fireworks of interest to Ragna. Ragna looked up at her face, how much this woman was enjoying herself. She wasn't some doll, she was no longer an emotionless robot of any kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Ragna, Lambda was the giant, sweet and gentle woman he would cherish for as long as he lived.</span></div></div>",

Various other carnival-goers took advantage of the free seating and sat down atop her cuddly belly-rolls, while Ragna simply clambered up near her massive mammaries and laid back against them with a smile on his face. Occasionally the massive girl would giggle and squeal at an especially loud or colorful firework, her body bouncing up only to come back down in a jiggling, quivering heap as her blubbery frame would jiggle. Before long, she spotted a man taking photographs not far away and looked down at her silver-haired love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-ragna...d-do you think we...we could get...a photo together?\" the blubbery girl asked, her attention off the fireworks now as Ragna looked up at her cherubically fat face. Smirking at the sight of the shy Murakumo blushing softly, he nodded and hopped off after ushering the other people perched on her overly obese frame away. Heading off to grab the cameraman, the silver-haired Bloodedge came back and clambered back up to the same spot he had been at, only to think before climbing up higher and nestling in right next to the blond's thick cheeks and cuddly chins. This caused Lambda to let out a soft squeak of surprise and her outfit to once against waver and warp, becoming even more risque as the slit up her thighs widened and a copy appeared on the other side, leaving both of the bulky trunks bare and quivering, while the neckline of her top plunged lower, a veritable valley of creamy cleavage appearing just as the photo was snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hopping down and grabbing the photo, Ragna blinked at the Lambda in the photo before turning around. \"Hey Lambda, is something w...w...\" he started to stammer before noticing the state of his beloved's clothing, so much cuddly softness bare now that his face started to glow the same color as his clothing.</span></div></div>",

Sighing, Ranga ran off as fast as his legs could carry him as he made his way through the gathering crowd of people to find a lavatory because goodness knows he needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda sighed dreamily as she watched Ragna. The whole two days so far felt like a dream. Here she was with Ragna, he and her, together in love and harmony. Lambda smiled, blushing as she felt memories of yesterday flood her mind. Some were oddly blurred and she could barely piece some together, probably due to all the alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I should cut down in liquor...I can't well spend time with my Ragna if I'm teetering over the edge more often then not...</i> Lambda thought to herself as she placed a plump hand against the side of her immense belly, her whole bulky form taking up a massive amount of space still as she made several heavy footfalls to see if she couldn't find a way to pass time with Ragna gone. Hopefully, there was a game she could play that offered food as a prize...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there. Stop for a moment so I can talk with you.\" A dreamy, if somewhat irate, voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, her fulsome form wobbling, Lambda saw that girl from before. Despite being two tons, she still carried herself with refinement and elegance. Her flawless coldly pale skin was devoid of any flaw or blemish and her fingers somehow seemed dainty as she used them to slowly and delicately brush away at some of her blond hair. Her large black and red frilled dress covered her ample form and remained conservative, yet that didn't stop the thick puffy fat of her arms from being partially exposed by the detached sleeves and the dress itself could do little to hide her pear like but otherwise blobby figure. Rachel Alucard the haughty Vampire had come back and was less than pleased to see Ragna wooed by the blubbery moe Murakumo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid I do not know who you are, but I must inform you that Ragna, that man you covet so much...he belongs to me.\" Rachel said in a cold, calm tone with underlying irritation as she stared at Lambda with her bored looking red eyes. Lambda was understandably flustered as this woman seemed to come from nowhere, but there was one thing certain in her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I won't do it. Ragna and I love each other! I won't give him up just because you tell me to!\" Lambda stated, holding her ground as she asserted herself, felling confidence well up in revelation of this romantic rival of hers, pouting as she held her fists up and stared at Rachel. However, the jaded Vampiress merely let out an amused laugh. Considering Ragna wasn't nearby, she could always make a new toy of this daring woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...if you will not submit Ragna to me, then perhaps I will win him from you. I propose a triad of challenges and if I win, I will be allowed to wrest Ragna from your hands.\" Rachel mused, a slight smile forming on her pale, delicate and puffed up face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda took time to asses the situation. It was plain as the moon in the sky above her that this strange woman would skew the competition in her favor. On the other hand, winning in spite of that would demoralize her and help further assure a victory. The risk may not outweigh the reward however. Was there a possible third option, maybe she could talk the woman down?</span></div></div>",

I already had plenty of practishe before hand so...ya just made yourshelf loshe you...dumb...losher...\" Lambda laughed after unleashing a cacophonous drunken belch. She rubbed a hand on her much larger belly, the liquor stored within her massive keg sloshing around causing her belly to gurgle as small burps escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel laid back on a makeshift throne of sorts which consisted of a shapeshifted Nago and a pile of all the empty bottles, kegs and jugs that contained the liquor she had tried to guzzle down so readily, a despondent expression on her face as she drowned her pains of loss in what remained of a bottle of fine red wine as Gii rolled around on her impressive stomach to calm the upset kettle inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet please...\" Rachel murmured as she tried to shake off her drunken state, turning her gaze away. Gii and Nago were surprised to hear Rachel address Lambda with what sounded like shy courtesy, sharing a concerned glance between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I shtill won't...loshe to you missh...uhh...whatever your name ish! I'm...not givin' up my Ragna no matter what! He and...he and, and, and I LOVE each other! Like...that kinda love you see in shoujou high school anime...that special kinda love...\" Lambda drunkenly declared as her full form wobbled and rippled from burps and hiccups escaping her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...the *Hic* next contest I declare shall be...whoever can consume the most of what mortals call 'cotton candy' in ten minutes. We shall have the contents measured beforehand and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww quit beatin' around the bush! I'm just gonna eat so much cotton candy that you never even fi-*hic* find any for miles of here!\" Lambda declared, a smile forming widely on her puffy face as she giggled in her drunken stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel shook her head as she felt the alcohol in her system flirt with her own perceptions as well, trying to shake it off as she once again sent her familiars to pester store and stall owners around the immediate area. Within moments, towering mountains of cotton candy were presented to the two blobby women, sugar masses so grand their height could even surpass Lambda's by an impressive margin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't make the blubbery Murakumo hesitate for a moment as she grabbed impressive handfuls of Cotton Candy, stuffing the confection down her throat quickly. Rachel was almost caught off guard as she saw, struggling to keep up. The plentiful pear shaped blobby Vampire blushed as she tried to mimic Lambda's eating method of shoveling handfuls of cotton candy into her waiting mouth, blushing and finding it awkward to throw away her manners so readily, stopping to take smaller, more elegant bites as she wiped her mouth periodically with a kerchief Gii would bring to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis proved her downfall however as Lambda readily vacuumed up her whole mound of cotton candy, hundreds of pounds worth of creamy fat piling on to her body. Lambda's body spread out, her outfit struggling a bit to keep up as the fabric struggled. Lambda's ballooning breasts poured forth, fighting a stalemate of a battle with her belly to cover more as it spread out around her, while her bulbous twin moons known as her buttcheeks filled and swelled behind her, wobbling lazily as her legs became thicker and thicker, fusing together as her thighs poured out and her hips widened. Rachel's own blubbery body must have grown a good quarter of her weight before, but Lambda was getting massive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheheh~ Two outta three! That's a win by default, isn't it, ms...red...eyed lady...\" Lambda mumbled victoriously as she rubbed her fuller, larger belly with her massive arms and cooed in delight as her thick fat pouring face around her face wobbled a bit from her cheery laughter, causing her massive multichins to slap against her bust slightly and make her massive mammaries wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...I...said there would be three trials and you must still compete in this second!\" Rachel insisted, not willing to give up Ragna so easily. But she was so bleary eyed and the liquor was seeping so far into her mind that the third challenge escaped her at present. What did she want to do again...?</span></div></div>",

Shaking her head to clear it, she gulped as she saw the colossal Lambda giggle and stumble closer, her porky hands on her wide wide sides and her frame wobbling and sloshing ominously. Drunken, soft burps continued to escape the Murakumo unit's lips as she loomed over the smaller blond before she beamed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooookaaaaay...\" Lambda giggled, leaning in and picking up Rachel in an odd sort of drunken sportsmanship. Waiting for the soused vampire to get ready, she soon started to shove against her, their blubbery bodies meeting with an amorous-sounding, meaty slap. Bellies shoved against one another and enormous mammary almost overtook smaller, comparatively-flat-chested breast as the two shoved against one another. Lambda's drunkenness started to work against her as her buzzed brain took the contest more as fun instead of the serious match it was supposed to be due to her previous wins, letting Rachel's still-impressive strength match hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnngh...s-stupid...o-over*hic*blown whale...of a harlot...\" Rachel grunted, easily heads shorter than the taller girl before her and trying her best to find a good grip.on whatever she could. Her cheeks glowed hotly as the liquor started to fry her haughtiness into a sort of tsundere shyness, hands darting for Lambda's sides before she pulled them back in a sort of shock as she grabbed at bare blubber. Moving to grab again, she blushed farther down the spectrum of red as her hands instead found meaty, plush hip-fat that her own plump hands sank into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee...I'm gonna wiiiiiiin for Raaaaagnaaaaa...*HICCUP!*\" Lambda gushed as she kept fighting feebly back, now focused more on the fun of squishing against Rachel and leaning in to smother the 'rabbit's' head in soft breast-flesh as they sloshed noisily against one another while ignoring the stares from passersby.</span></div></div>",

Rachel could feel the heat on her face from blushing, coupled with the welcoming warmth of Lambda's supple breasts, the enormous mounds wobbling as Rachel struggled and tried her damnedest to break free of the soft fleshy prison as her plump hands only sank into Lambda's blobby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning and whimpering shyly a bit, Rachel finally pulled her head free, but she noticed there was a reason why Lambda had stopped. Turning around, she noticed Ragna standing right there, holding two ice cream cones in his hand and which one was meant for Lambda was obvious considering the cone was as big as a plant pot and the ball-size scoops reached heads above Ragna himself. It was then a rather curious idea sank into Rachel's drunken head, one which was rather crafty, if only for the present moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lambda, I believe this is an opportune moment. Ragna...tell me...between this lush of a harlot and my own self, which of us better...interests you?\" Rachel asked calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna was given pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...WHAT.\" Was all he could say when he finally responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey don't *urp!* shtick yer nose where it doeshn't b...be...belong! Beshidesh...you gave me aaall this extra sexy faaat for me and him to play with. Riiiight Ragnaaa~?\" Lambda cooed as she posed for her beloved Ragna, her dress changing to a much more \"adult\" form as a jaw dropping amount of her immense cleavage spilled forth from the top, her massive perky breasts bulging forth as her belly wobbled while Lambda hefted a wide, bulky leg forward, rubbing one of her thick, cuddly hands along her inner thigh as he leaned forwards a bit. Ragna's face went red as he just stared in awe, sweat running down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well fine! Go ahead and take this flirtatious sow for your own then! Don't think I'm being petty about it, have all the fun you would with her if you only want her for her looks!\" Rachel pouted as she furiously turned around. While her chest was no where near as impressive as the almost twice her weight Murakumo, her massive shapely backside was visible even with the large skirt of her dress, as it wobbled under the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna's jaw dropped as he groaned, his forehead tinting blue as he felt the sweat roll down his red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell did I miss when I was gone!? And why do they suddenly seem like two different people?! They're drunk aren't they! Goddammit, I don't even wanna know how much coffee these two would need to sober up!</i> Ragna cursed his luck inwards as Lambda suddenly looked at him with her own bleary red eyes, suddenly shifting back to her shy and conserved persona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ragnaaa~ *hic!* I...I want to be with you...because I...I love you so much, Ragna! Please tell me you love me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna cringed as if cupid had just fired a hole in his chest where his heart used to be! Lambda's sudden confession threw him off.

Why do you suddenly change into two different people on me?! What's going on? Did they find their true selves in the Dream World?! Did they suddenly fuse together to take on the Archfiend!?</i> Ragna again freaking out internally looked on. He had to pick someone...but who!?</span></div></div>",

Lambda stood up with a confused look on her face while Rachel pivoted as best as she could on her bulky legs. Finding himself under the gaze of the two obese girls, the usually-fiery man clammed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Raaaaagnnaaaaaaa...we wanted to prove whoshe better for you! *hic!*\" Lambda slurred, waddling closer and enveloping the silver haired man in a soft, smothering hug that barely left the top of his hair exposed.

You too Lambda, even more so.\" Ragna called out to Rachel, offering a hand so to say as his actual hands and arms were trapped in the soft, blubbery embrace of Lambda's massive belly as it swamped the area around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping dead in her tracks as she heard Ragna's offer, Rachel turned around as she stretched out Gii and used him as a makeshift tissue to wipe the streaks of tears from her face. It was a sobering thought to see that Ragna, even if he had chosen the blubbery Murakumo who was so dearly cuddling Ragna, squishing his body in between her massive breasts and against her titanic belly as she dearly wrapped her puffed up arms around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I suppose returning to my estate in my current state would be unsatisfactory, especially to Valkenhayn. Very well Ragna, I will join you and your beloved heifer for the time being, but only so I may allow my mind to clear.\" Rachel responded, adding in her usual verbal battering at the end. Ragna scoffed with a half smile on his face while Lambda only protectively hugged him closer to her colossal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the trio did not need to walk far (or waddle in Rachel and Lambda's cases) as the three of them found a man serving hot fried foods nearby and as far as Ragna knew, greasy food was one of the best things to counteract and soak up the alcohol inside of a person. Rachel snapped her fingers, commanding Nago to resign to his fate as her seat, transforming himself into a stool as Rachel planted her massive rear down atop him, the feline familiar crying out in pain, which made Gii balk a bit. Lambda simply stood upright as she knew that any benches would simply get lost between her folds. At this point, the very bench that was propped in front of the store looked like an oversize tongue depressor stick for the massive soused Murakumo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to what was to come, the man at the stall served out massive amounts of hot food for the two gals, greasy soups and broth with burgers, fries and fried chicken, fillet of fish, you name it! Almost every form of fast food known to man passed the plump lips of Rachel and Lambda, each bite bringing forth delicate amounts of extra fat to their forms all the while poor Ragna was being squashed between the two, squished up against Lambda and Rachel's wide, fat womanly hips, their thick fat and sexy thighs and the thick bulbous sides of their massive bellies. Lambda cooed as each bite of food passed through, feeling the hot meal warm her up from inside as she took breaks to rub her belly, purring and cooing as she felt the warmth spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was much more controlled as unlike Lambda, elegant Rachel took conservative bites (for a blubbery gluttonous blob-pear like her at least) always using utensils to eat her meals while she would look to Gii to wipe her mouth of any grease or food when needed at periods of time as her butt burgeoned out behind her and her belly blew up forward while her breasts only grew the slightest in comparison to her belly and lower body. Despite being a vampire, Rachel could indeed enjoy the delicacies of human food should she wish and for lowly slop, what she currently dined on still held a sort of droll appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda sighed, giggling happily as she leaned back and pat her stuffed belly, sending ripples through the impressive mass all the way up to her immense breasts, which made the still quite small by comparison Rachel blush in both envy and...interest. Slowly rising from her seat, Nago groaned in a defeated manner as he changed back to his normal form, his eyes now spiral patterns from how spent he was while Ragna fell out from between the two bulky blond beauties, landing on his back as he gasped for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Nago in hand, Rachel forced him to change into a parasol as she held him daintily over her head, waddling away as her blubbery buns wobbled and squished and slapped together like massive gelatinous moons, sending Ragna's head in a spin. Before she was out of ear shot, Rachel turned around with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long for now, Ragna. Perhaps you and your bovine concubine will find solace with each other. If you two should ever wed, count on me to assure you he doesn't run off on you.\" Rachel called back to the two, directing the second part of her sentence at Lambda as both their red eyes met while Rachel left with a smile and a laugh, stepping through a large heart-shaped portal which formed from bats, which disappeared behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, that damn Rabbit never changes does she...?\" Ragna grumbled as he rubbed his head with a gloved hand, half annoyed and half relieved to see the woman who was admittedly one of his closest companions back to her old self. \"Well, you done eating here Lambda?\" Ragna asked his beloved blob, who had now returned to her old self. Lambda was still a bit buzzed, but not so much she had become an amorous flirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah I'm...I'm fine Ragna...\" Lambda said as she stared in his eyes. Lambda seemed to be nervous, sweating a bit as she panted. Ragna looked at her huge fat face as best he could past her immense breasts and corpulent belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What is it now?\" Ragna asked with a tone of concern to his voice.</span></div></div>",

Putting two and two together just as the slightly buzzed Murakumo took advantage of his confusion to widen the slit of her dress just a little more. Bulging, pale buttcheek started to peek out just as she waddled along, guiding her beloved towards a warmly glowing, pink-lit hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-woah woah Lambda...w-what are you pla...plaaaaaa...\" Ragna stammered as he now stared at wide, swaying derriere like a lost puppy. A goofy smile spread across the Grim Reaper's face as he stumbled after Lambda, lost in her charms even as she grew more self conscious about her lessening clothing. As she turned around to hug him back against her bouncy, blubbery breasts, she failed to think about the deep slit that her drunken self had created, causing her boobs to nearly tumble free before she scooped her beloved up and carried him into the hotel. She wiggled her hips furiously as she got stuck in the wide double doors originally intended for the more drunken of couples, only to be pointed towards a wide hallway leading to a massive room by the sleepy clerk at the desk. A lecherous wink was all Lambda needed to start waddling for the door at the end of the hall, Ragna fully taken in by her blubbery frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-ragna...I...I want...I want you...\" Lambda stuttered furiously as she closed the door behind her behind, Ragna slipping out of her arms and shaking his head yet again to try to clear it.

Clearly intended more for large...groups...rather than one massively fat girl and her teensy-tiny partner, it almost looked as if it would hold up to the Murakumo's planetary moons as she tottered for it, her outfit warping once more into some rather provocative nightwear. \"D-do you...do you really want me?\" she added with a shake of her buns that sent them clapping like thunder.</span></div></div>",

Her normally rather neat blond hair was a disheveled mess thanks to the previous night's activities, and the sun shone high in the sky as the long ponytail's worth of hair draped all around her plush body and the little blade cap across the room, just like her dress and her beloved's jacket. Panicking a bit now thanks to the full warm flush of alcohol being gone, along with the idea of what they did fresh in her mind, she let out a tiny squeak and got out of bed as fast as she could, tottering for a mammoth pile of stuffed animals that had been won here and there at the festival and snuggling in amongst them with her face a furiously bright shade of red. Her bulky frame hardly was hidden, mainly in part due to how voluminous her blubbery buttcheeks were, but they managed to confuse the entering Ragna for a mere few moments as he wheeled in a cart groaning with what seemed to be a literal continental breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lambda...you okay?\" he asked, his black shirt and pants in place as he rolled the cart along. His face flushed too, noticing the bare blubber of the Murakumo but rather surprisingly mellow about it. As he approached, a faint smile appeared on his face as the blond reached out and snatched some of the food to start stuffing her face. \"Man...I can't BELIEVE this, to be honest. Jin's not a psychopath any more, nobody's screaming the second they see my face, there's no bastards trying to kill me whenever I sneeze, I...I've got a girlfriend for shit's sake! I mean if this is a dream, don't wake me up!\" he rambled, not noticing the mountain of Lambda in front of him holding up a pudgy finger here or there to interject. \"I mean seriously, this is great!\" he added as he flopped into her belly, causing another squeak and a sudden shift of stuffed animals as Lambda tried to burrow deeper.</span></div></div>",

She snapped out of her stupor as she noticed Ragna laying atop her belly, looking down as he remained oblivious thanks to the mass of plushies separating him from the familiar soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I wonder where Lambda went? Maybe she needed to use the little Murakumo's room or something...wait, do robot girls even need to use the bathroom? Then again with how amazingly human she is, maybe I should just stop asking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uhh...R-Ragna?\" Lambda spoke up softly, her voice shakey and nervous as she looked down from a hole in the pile. Ragna looked up from where he was reclining, calm at first before he jumped visibly at the sight of Lambda's cherubic face seated within the pile of plush toys, her big, innocent ruby red eyes looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-ghaaa! L-Lambda, there you are!\" Ragna yelled as he got up to his feet, watching as the blobby woman rose from her hiding place, plush toys falling around her all over the floor, some even getting caught in her deep cleavage or stuck in her belly rolls. \"Geez, don't scare me...almost felt my heart try to claw outta my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry...\" Lambda muttered as she poked her cuddly index fingers together, causing her puffy arms to brush against her perky, fluffy bosom, which was barely held into her bra. Ragna felt heat rush to his face as he walked over to the cart, grabbing a bread roll and pulling it apart before slathering some butter on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" Ragna said, trying to act cool even as he felt himself, walking over to bring the warm, oven fresh roll to Lambda's mouth. The bulbous Murakumo smiled as she opened her mouth with a cute little \"Ah~\" before biting down on fresh bread and slightly melted butter, cooing as she felt herself eating a delicious treat. Soon, Ragna brought her over plates of eggs and bacon, french toast, waffles and pancakes, stacked to absurdly high levels and coated in butter and syrup and fresh, crepes and cripsy, golden omelettes decorated with a layer of melted cheese and ketchup. Each plate was eventually brought to Lambda's lips, her eyes lighting up as she giggled in delight at the vast range of food she had to break her fast with, her body delicately puffing up even bigger as the blimp of a girl only grew bigger and fatter with every dish her gluttonous appetite allowed her to clean off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a wonderful time last night...really...\" Lambda said quietly, a shy smile on her face as her puffy cheeks lit up pink, her cheeks dimpling from her angelic smile. Ragna felt his heart beat a bit faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...it...was something...\" He said, smirking a bit as he tried to remain calm. \"I...I just think it's weird that things are going good for me. I guess after you're through enough, you think the whole world's against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda stopped for a moment as she bit into an english muffin, blinking as crumbs stained her plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...thanks for being tons o' fun...Lambchop.\" Ragna said with affection as he smiled up at the blond blob, who blushed at the pet name, simply nibbling on more of her food, albeit slower and more timid. This hotel they checked into was huge, if it could fit a blob like her, she thought to distract herself. Unless Ragna had a friend who could foot the bill, they may have to dash out of here, which would be a problem, given her monumental size...</span></div></div>",

Ragna couldn't help but smirk at how shy and meek the overblown Murakumo acted even when she ate, seemingly still shell-shocked about the night before even as she wrapped her pillowy, lard-filled arms around him. Moving in for yet another kiss, the two lovers soon found the door to the room blown open as an odd pink projectile flew in, only to dissipate as its owner slowly heaved her immensely pear-shaped bulk into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...you two seem r-rather comfy...\" the mountainous Rachel puffed, having clearly packed on weight as fast as possible to compete with the blimp of a Murakumo.

Can't you see that I'm spending some time with Lambda?!\" Ragna shouted until Lambda hugged him, wiggling around and peeking at Rachel shyly.

How dare you do such a thing?!\" She sputtered, clearly flustered as she slammed her portly ass down on the floor in order to relieve her rather plump feet, the extremities in fact slightly plusher than Lambda's by the mere merit of the shorter blond being such a thick pear shape. \"Mmf...a-and you in particular, you overblown sow! H-how dare you...er...I mean, w-what you two did is just...how?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna rolled his eyes as he wiggled a little in Lambda's grasp, popping free and folding his arms as he glared at the gorging gothic vampire. \"Well you see, you bunny-leech...when a man and a woman love each other VERY VERY MUCH...\" He started until Lambda and Rachel let out startlingly similar squeaks, their faces flushing before he stopped and simply resumed his perch within Lambda's cuddly embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not what I meant!\" Rachel replied, still stuffing her face until the Murakumo finally managed to get her voice...</span></div></div>",

Rachel looked back at her, her haughtiness returning out of contempt for the overblown sow who stole her beloved Ragna, sweeping him off his feet by using her own vivacious body no doubt, making a flirt of herself in order to curry favor with him, given his weak mortal will. or at least that was what Rachel said to herself. \"Uhh...I was wondering...w-would you...well...we both like Ragna and all...a-a-and I do understand why...but, even if we can't exactly share him...couldn't we at least try to get along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked a bit surprised for a second, but hid it quickly on her porcelain face. She simply snapped two of her fatty fingers, immediately beckoning for her servants, Gii and Nago to bring her a special blend of tea that she never went without. She took the white cut, adorned with gilded patterns around the edge, calmly taking a gentle sip from the porcelain cup. \"...I don't like when one beats around the bush as they say. If you wish to tell me something, speak in plain language.\" Rachel said calmly as she took another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...r-right...\" Lambda muttered. \"What I mean exactly is...maybe we...we, we could be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel coughed, feeling the tea suddenly rush down the wrong hole as she groaned, grasping for her fat-buried neck as she coughed, Gii slamming himself against her back to help her. \"Wh-what...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I feel like you would be lonely without Ragna, which may be why you like him so much...you are a Vampire...you live longer than humans...plus...I really think you are a nice person, if I can remember last night correctly...from what I can remember.\" Lambda blushed as the knowledge of her drunken persona came to mind once more, feeling clearly very embarrassed based on the pink in her puffy cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong! I mean, yeah she treats us like dirt, but the Mistress is a nice girl!\" Gii chimed in, the fatty imp floating before Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, she has a hidden heart of gold buried deep inside.\" Nago smirked as he spoke slowly, walking out from behind Rachel. \"Why, she even paid for your bill up front for this hotel as well as paying off your various tabs around Orient Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WHAM!* *THWACK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNago cringed in pain and Gii simply laid on the floor, steam trailing from the spots on their heads where the servants were both struck as a red vein popped up on Rachel's forehead while she simply continued to drink her tea. \"Do you realize how rude it is to speak so out of turn unless spoken to?\" She said in a deceptively calm tone in regards to her actual temperament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry...\" Nago and Gii muttered weakly at the same time. Ragna and Lambda felt drops of sweat flow down the backs of their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uuhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Very well.\" Rachel said calmly as she finished her brew. With a grunt, she slowly rose up from her pillar-sized legs, her huge thighs rippling and her buttocks wobbling as she stood upright, straightening the skirt of her tailor-made dress that contoured to her belly and lower body heavy frame. She felt a bit envious that Lambda had such immense breasts compared to her. But...she was alright, as far as sows were. At least she had manners. \"I suppose I can entertain your request for the moment. ...I shall be what you could consider...a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda smiled, slowly waddling forwards, revealing just how scantily clad she was, her panties buried under all her flab and practically absorbed by her thick lower body, stretched out to absurd levels. She was holding a velvet, black bat plush doll, which she handed to Rachel when she got close, revealing a shy, uneasy little smile on her face. Rachel leaned forwards to take it from the larger woman, smiling a bit as she looked at it. It was at least cuter than Gii, she could say that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A token of respect, I see? Well I suppose it would be rude of me to decline. I shall take good care of it. Ah, I should check and see what the tag says about dry cleaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagna sighed, feeling as if he had dodged not so much a bullet as a cannonball.

The blond Murakumo smiled sweetly even as the shorter vampire kept as cheerful an expression as she could on her fat face, constantly comparing their bodies even now and mentally fuming at the rather luscious bounces of Lambda's breasts in the adorable black and silver dress she had materialized, more like a tent than anything else on her hefty frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem...so...L-lambda, was it?\" Rachel asked, stopping at a side stall to purchase them both a number of hot dogs to finish filling their oversized stomachs. Biting into one, the vampire girl adjusted her dress slightly thanks to the breakfast feast having shoved even more bountiful blubber into her derriere and thighs. \"Mmmf...perhaps you can...can explain why you...er...your breasts. Why are they so LARGE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda's face flushed softly at the rather uncharacteristic outburst as she ate as well, the occasional step sending her derriere slapping gently against the shorter girl's only to swing back and bop against something on the other side. She looked down at her rather immense bosom and couldn't help but giggle as she moved her gaze to Rachel's comparatively dainty chest. \"W-well...I...I'm not sure, Ms. Rachel...m-maybe I'm just m-meant to have more...more boobies than you?\" She offered, still scarfing down her food and giggling a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you implying that someone as prosperous as I shouldn't have a well-developed chest?\" the shorter blond jabbed, now starting to feel her weight quite keenly thanks to the simple act of waddling along through town She sighed as Gii floated up to dab away a few beads of sweat from her forehead, only to start puffing a bit and glare enviously at the cheerfully waddling Lambda. Having been used to simply teleporting around, her lack of fitness quickly made itself known as her stamina broke down more and more even as she shoveled more food into her mouth. \"B-because I'll have you know that I could easily just move this...this FAT around and give myself appropriate breasts for someone of my standing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hefty Murakumo simply smiled and giggled a little more, resuming the intermittent meals as the pair kept waddling along. \"M-maybe you're j-just going to grow them later then?

She relied so much on her servants and her own powers that she had become grossly unfit. Granted, if she actually did use her true strength in a battle, she could blow away any opponent outside of that dreadful Hazama with the same ease as squashing a grape under her fatty feet, which looked tiny compared to the rest of her despite how plump they were, but walking would be the bane of her existence. The feeling of her silky pale thighs rubbing together every time she moved her legs was starting to drive her mad and her jiggling body was neatly outlined by her dress. She was thankful that Gii was wiping away the sweat as it fell down her face, sighing as she tried desperately to keep up with Lambda, looking at her own hearty rear. Even if she was the smaller of the two, she felt some self-satisfaction in having the larger flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk, get your fresh milk here! All natural, non-treated milk!\" A man cried on the street as he stood by some large fridges. Rachel looked at him in curiosity. A peddler of beverages out on the street, now that was something neither she nor Lambda ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, that would be nice for such a hot day.\" Lambda smiled as she stopped, reaching into her deep, canyonous cleavage to pull out a tiny black and gold pocketbook, opening it as she pulled out some money, handing it over in exchange for a glass bottle, containing a pint of the white drink, the glass dripping beads of condensation as it was pulled from the ice box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, uh...lil lady.\" The saleman said with a nervous look on his face. \"Heh, I bet your friend could use some too. After all, my family's milk is so potent, why, I seen women walk away with broken bras after drinking it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused the gears to turn in Rachel's head, while Lambda simply cooed in delight at having something cool to drink during the hot, summery day. The vampire stepped forwards a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me sir...are you inclining that those women's breasts became engorged after drinking your milk?\" She asked in the most eloquent manner she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I imagine. What, I suddenly got you interested too?\" The merchant replied playfully, not knowing just how serious the fatty leech was. Rachel immediately snapped her fingers as Nago walked from behind her with a sizable bag jingling full of what were gold coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir I would like to purchase all of your milk if you do not mind.\" Rachel said without missing a beat. Lambda looked over at her in surprise as she continued to drink her own bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man hopped and skipped away with glee as he unlocked the freezers, grinning as he carried the bag of gold all the way to the bank. Rachel meanwhile licked her lips greedily as she used her sausage fingers to easily uncap or uncork bottle after bottle, chugging each one down in as dignified a manner as she could, drinking each down one at a time without allowing a drop to spill. Lambda looked on as the \"rabbit\" started to become engorged with milk, her fatty belly bloating from all the dairy that was filling her. Naturally, her thick lower body only got thicker, the skirt rising above her ripening ass cheeks, showing off her black panties with red bat outlines decorating them as her thick legs only squished together and her hips grew wider and more flared. Her breasts were growing sluggishly as they would have, given her figure, but to Lambda they seemed to be growing at a decently faster rate than one would expect. The pale spheres of flesh became jigglier and fuller as Rachel engorged herself on milk, pouring bottles, jugs and even large metal canisters down her throat. She gulped it all down feverishly, her body only swelling and swelling, her belly jiggling and sloshing as all the milk churned about inside, her dress becoming tighter as her swelling chest strained and deepened the line of her neck that showed off her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rachel finished the last canister a mighty, undignified and very unladylike belch passed her lips, echoing a bit as people turned heads to look at the source of the powerful sound. The fatty vampire blushed in humiliation as she covered her mouth, groaning as she struggled to stay aloft, her belly feeling like a leaden water balloon. Every step she took, her gargantuan gut jiggled and sloshed about, causing the milk filling it up to splash and slosh inside, making her groan and every couple steps more, she felt herself burp uncomfortably, causing milky white bubbles to float out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh,...Rachel are you okay?\" Lambda asked, frowning as she felt herself fill with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is...no worry of yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is.  I mean...we're supposed to be friends, of course I'll be worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish, naive girl...\" Rachel muttered. What struck Lambda as odd is, when Rachel said that, she was smirking, despite the discomfort of her distended belly. \"But...I do appreciate the thought...I *Uuurp!!* however...do not need any assistance...\" She assured, burping from the jiggling cauldron of milk inside of her. What she dreaded was that even if her breasts had become a more favorable size, though still lacked the sheer volume of Lambda's chest, every step was much more the chore than it ever would have and her stomach felt absolutely packed full with milk. \"...though I do worry if I drink so much as a drop more of any given liquid, my belly may burst forth like an overfilled balloon...\"</span></div></div>",

Just as the tanker of a blond reached the stand, she smiled contently and belched rather raucously, enough to leave Rachel groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what in the world was that...ugh...for...?\" She moaned, not quite operating with all of her faculties thanks to the dairy sloshing around in her stomach. Her thighs ground together as she tried to stop, the cool liquid inside of her helping to keep her from sweating too much from heat but the exertion still causing beads of sweat to trickle down her forehead.

Slapping a palm against her face, it was quickly pushed away by a rowdy burp that sent more bubbles into the air and prompted her 'friend' to go tottering off to the next stand, this one selling milkshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm now FRIENDS with...with a dimwitted hipp*BURP*o...\" She muttered, following after Lambda's bobbling ass and simply watching her inflate like a water balloon with every stand cleared.

Sodas, juices, frozen drinks...anything and everything that could be sold, would be sold. Rachel watched on, feeling herself in awe as she watched Lambda's hips take up more space in the alley, her buttcheeks jiggling as they grew behind her. Frankly, the vampire feared that she would be outclassed in regards to the size of each other's asses, as she did so Gii tugged on her skirt to hide her more swollen rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment she finished, a monstrous belch forced its way out of Lambda, the air travelling outwards in a loud roar, prompting her to squeak as she covered her mouth after. The rush of air had even blown her bangs back, which left her feeling even more ashamed as she styled them back in place slowly with her sausage fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how...how did you...?\" Rachel was in sheer awe. She barely tackled that whole milk stand, her body still feeling like it was filled with molten lead as she belched with every few steps, yet Lambda chugged enough liquids to fill a small pool, giggling as she rubbed her taut, liquid-filled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just have a really really big stomach.\" Lambda giggled proudly, blushing a bit as she continued to rub the sphere. This upset Rachel, even if she did not show it. She tried to hard to become the larger of the two and at Lambda's current size, she seemed to cement not just that, but even having the bigger rear. She needed to try something to make herself bigger, but with her stomach so engorged with milk, that was impossible as she was. No, she couldn't think like that. To further her horizons as a glutton, she needed to push herself...but how...?\"</span></div></div>",

Her eyes fell on a nearby outdoor grill, a pair of soda fountains hooked up to rather sizable tanks of cola each. She smirked as she started to waddle for it, Lambda letting out a shocked squeal and trying to step forward only to bumble around her belly and teeter back onto her bloated backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I demand you give me full access to those!\" Rachel commanded, Nago providing the stall owner with yet another bag of gold coins before watching his mistress heave her oversized buns toward the taps. The stall owner simply laughed and rushed away, leaving the vampire to fumble with the hoses to the tanks with her fat, chubby hands. \"Oh...how does one work this...? Perhaps...\" She mumbled, popping the two hoses into her mouth before commanding Gii to turn the valves on the tanks. Her eyes soon went wide as a torrent of sweet cola rushed down her throat, her gut feeling as though an ocean were rapidly filling it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Ms. Rachel! Y-you'll pop!\" Lambda cried, trying to get up but so full of liquid that her belly merely sloshed and jostled merrily, her fat feet flapping as she tried to work around it while belching away. She managed to make some slight headway as she shoved her tummy here and there, her legs flubbing about before she managed to plant her chunky hands on the ground. Even as she worked away, the already tanker-like vampire continued to chug down the colas, her gut quickly losing its folds and rolls and billowing out into a tight, rather loudly fizzing kettle of milk and soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-worshsfg...ideadsf...efermmf...\" She gurgled around the hoses, a tiny bit of the drink spilling down over her fat face before getting lost in the valley of her cleavage. Her breasts seemed to bounce a little more heavily than normal with each gulp, almost seeming heavier than normal as they swelled ever so slightly more. The bubbles in her gut threatened to escape, only staying put by the sheer merit of how much was being forced down her gullet.</span></div></div>",

While her chunky hands struggled to reach for the hoses, she couldn't tighten up the flow of bubbly drink, leaving her a helpless tanker of a woman. Lambda was clumsily making her way back onto her feet, at a level that could be considered \"Knee-level\" even though her flabby, liquid-filled sloshy gut kept her knees from really reaching the ground. Every little movement seemed to make Lambda's belly work up like a kettle, causing her to burp as she tried to save her new friend from bursting like an overfilled balloon. Even if it she wasn't ever going to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Rachel would certainly have appreciated the assistance, but the flowing carbonated cola just kept churning down into her. The vampired whined a bit as she felt her almost spherical belly swelling along with the rest of her. By this point, her skirt was useless thanks to her thicker figure as she filled out more, her juicy buns jiggling as she was forced to make more and more room for her tremendous trembling thunder thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda finally found proper footing, but almost fell over as she did. She yelped as she almost rammed into a collection of vases that were being sold, which would have been around her luck if she had broken any, but by some miracle, not a single dent was to be made. However, her recovery came too little too late as the hoses finally had no more to pump inside the plush vampire aside from air. Without the flow of Cola inhibiting them, Rachel sighed in relief as she pulled the hoses out, a few more residual drops falling into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny-leech smacked her lips, taking a moment to appreciate the rich flavor of the fizzy drink. When it wasn't being forced down her throat like she was some live water balloon, it tasted rather divine. She had strictly stuck to tea or tomato juice in regards to beverages, but actually tasting this...cola, that humans had invented...whatever it was, the drink was quite exquisite. She needed to remember it next time Valkenhaym was out buying her groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M, Ms. Rachel!!\" Lambda squeaked as she saw Rachel. \"Ohh, thank goodness. I-I was so afraid you would pop and-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And wh-when did I ever say I would pop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but when you finsished all that milk you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, my dear, is simply called dry wit. I did not mean it as a serious remark and if I did, my tone would likely have been more urgent, would it not?\" Rachel said calmly, doing all she could to keep herself from belching a storm as the cauldron of cola churned away inside of her, her face beet red from the effort and her voice a bit strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you look so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I will be fine. Your concern is appreciated, but unwarrented, Lambda.

The hours passed and the soda's effect on Rachel quickly started to show as her steadfast refusal to belch broke down and each step was punctuated by a bubble-inducing burp of varying volumes and pitches. Before long, the pair found themselves waddling through the park, the day warm enough that it was sparsely populated but still pleasant enough to meander through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...t-this is...q-quite difficult to handle...I...I must...*burp*...r-remember to imbibe that soda concoction in...in moderation...\" Rachel huffed, each step jostling her gut and sending it bounding and sloshing.

Ms. Rachel, w-watch out! T-there are monsters over there!\" She cried, only to blink as Rachel rolled her eyes and tried to turn her chubby face to look at her.

They are not monsters, nor are any monsters anywhere in this park. Monsters, in fact, are mere myths in terms of day-to-day life in a city such as this...\" She huffed, Lambda's expression growing less fearful as she saw the little chicks waddling after their parents before letting out a tiny squee as the cuteness started to wash over her. The voluminous girl soon noticed some butterflies flitting through the air, letting out a cheerful giggle before starting to barrel after them as fast as her monumental frame would allow. This caused Rachel to groan before puffing after her, each step provoking a loud belch and a wince before she simply managed to kick her shoes off, letting her pudgy feet free to be soothed by the grass. \"M-much better...not very lady-like, b-but even someone of my stature needs...needs comfort at *BELCH!!* times...\"</span></div></div>",

She eventually sat down, giggling in delight as she noticed a butterfly with red and blue wings and a black outline perching atop her paunches, slowly and gently flapping its wings as it stayed in place. Others fluttered about nearby, bringing much delight to the admittedly ditzy Lambda. Though given her innocence and the fact she knew little of the world around her to begin with, it was only fitting that her mind was like that of a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ergghhh... *BUURRRP!!* L-Lambda, you certainly are...p...proving to be a right pain in my backside this day...\" The fatty unfit vampire groaned as she wiped some sweat from her brow, her belly still bloated and vaguely spherical as it gurgled and sloshed, making her belch on a near-constant basis. She was thankful the Murakumo's curiosity allowed her a chance to relax herself, sighing as she tried to wiggle her toes before realizing they were far too plump now as they were to even move. Shame that, the grass felt so nice as it tickled the soles of her feet. After a while, however, she felt something stick to the sole of her foot. It was hard for her to know what it was, so she had to slowly rub her foot against the ground. However, that served her little, which forced her to command Gii to float down and peel what was apparently a slip of paper off from the sole of her right foot. Looking at it, Rachel could see it was a discount coupon for free drinks at a time simply designated as \"Happy Hour\" at a bar somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the Vampire scoffed at this notion. If ever she felt the need to imbibe in some fine wine, or perhaps a well aged brandy, she would prefer something from her personal stock back in her estate. True, what the mortal world had concocted in terms of tastes was in no way swill or gruel, but she had to abide by certain standards still given her designated class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rachel, Rachel look! There's a weird little animal over there!\" Lambda cooed as she pointed out someone's dog who was left sitting by a bench, panting and wagging its tail eagerly, but soon receded in fear as it noticed the many ton Lambda slowly waddling towards it as she giggled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I hope that this establishment at least has something palpable...\" Rachel muttered as she slipped the slip of paper into a slit in her skirt that served as a pocket. \"Gii...when is this 'Happy Hour' of which that paper mentioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, even though it's called Happy Hour, it's actually around four to eight in the evening. Uhh, d-don't ask how I know that...\" Gii muttered defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel paused, looking at a tall clock to see what time it was currently.</span></div></div>",

W-where are we going next, Rachel?

Her sloshing belly felt dense under the layers upon layers of lard coating it, once more huffing and puffing as she made her way across the park.

Rachel was gasping for air like a woman recently rescued from drowning as she slowly lumbered forwards, providing the coupon and muttering for a glass of fine red wine between multiple loud burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda shyly blushed as she was at least glad the interrior allowed them such free movement for such hugely fat blobs. Perhaps this place was very well off if they could afford this much space in the building. Carefully, she plopped her pillowy ponderous buttocks in an empty spot that had been made for the two, as Rachel was presented with a glass of fine red wine. She swirled the sample inside, allowing the scent to waft up under her nostrils, sniffing it delicately before drinking it down. She swirled it about in her mouth for five seconds before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...this will suffice.\" She said calmly, as one of the waiters at her behest wiped some residual sweat from her face. \"While you are at it, I would like many bottles more of any finer stock you have. And my friend will have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uhh...I guess I'll just have a...\" Lambda shyly looked away. She barely knew of any drinks to ask for, as whenever she got drunk, she would just guzzle without even noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Would you please serve my friend a cocktail then?\" Rachel said calmly. \"Something...sweet and smooth to appeal to her tastes.\" She said. Lambda shyly looked away, nodding as she approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes, thank you.\" Lambda muttered. \"And thank you Ms. Rachel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a trifling matter. Think not of it.\" Rachel said as she gulped down her wine, sighing as she enjoyed its fine bouquet. \"And if we are to be friends as you said, I do not think addressing me so formally is required. You may refer to me as Rachel from here on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda's eyes lit up, her mouth open a bit in surprise. \"A-ah, I see. W-well...thank you Rachel.\" She said with a meek smile, causing the fatty Vampire to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that from now on. It feels dreadfully out of place if you are so overtly formal with one you consider a friend.\" Rachel scolded as she waited for a waiter to refill her wine glass, while the one from before brought Lambda a cocktail. It was bubblegum pink in a martini glass with a pink lemon perched on the side of the glass, its juices dripping gently into her drink. Lambda thanked him as she took her glass, gingerly sipping it before realizing how surprised she was that it tasted almost exactly like pink lemonade with only a minor hint of alcohol in its flavoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is so good~ Can you please get me more?\" Lambda cooed as she took another gentle sip. Rachel smiled on her porcelain face as she moved onto a different stock of wine, sniffing it and swirling it about in the glass to see what flavor it was. As far as obnoxiously whimsical women went, Lambda was at least adequate company when she wasn't acting out of her dim-witted ideas or making her chase after the bulbous blond blob. Plus, if she were able to drink whatever passed as fine wine among humans for a discounted price and make herself larger in the process, it would be a worthy affair.</span></div></div>",

The bloated blob's mind once again started to fuzz and buzz with liquor as she ordered larger and larger drinks, eventually simply guzzling down novelty-sized glasses of all manner of mixed concoctions and turning her dress skimpier in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee...ANOTHER one!\" Lambda called, waving an empty glass about with a bulky arm and giggling merrily, letting loose a drunken burp and swaying just slightly. \"Hee...Lambda ain't drunk yeeeeeet!\" She added before smiling at Rachel and reaching over to hug her over the table.

However, she felt like her chest had gotten a bit heavier lately, rubbing at her breasts gently as she noticed they were a bit bigger than they would normally have been after how much she had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently rubbed her fingers against the absurdly pale flesh, feeling her face flush as she watched her fingers sink into the malleable flesh, which was admittedly somewhat sensitive. She wondered...had they gotten even bigger recently? No that couldn't have been right. She rubbed at them again, watching them jiggle ever so slightly. She could swear they felt a bit heavier. Filled with something maybe? No, that couldn't be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she felt flesh pouring forth, the now more timid bunny squeaking in surprise as she felt Lambda press up against her. Their fatty bellies collided in an audible avalanche of adipose, sending sensational ripples up their rubenesque bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...*Bluuurrrp!! I-itsh fun havin' someone...someone else to squish with~\" Lambda cooed as her own generous bosom squished up against Rachel's comparatively conservative chest. \"Shecially someone who squishes baaack~\" She cooed as she began to rub her chest against Rachel's. The vampire held down a soft moan as she felt the flesh against hers, looking down as she noticed her quivering boobs were swelling even larger! A button on the vestment of her dress popped off, revealing more of her pale bosom as the two spheres trembled. Rachel could swear she heard something...sloshing inside and when she touched one of her partially exposed nipples, she stiffly moaned as she felt something trickle down her breasts and run down onto her churning liquid laden belly..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-merciful heavens!!\" Rachel exclaimed, her face looking like an overly ripe tomato. \"Am, a-am I...am I producing milk...?!\" She said to herself. However, drunken Lambda overheard her and perked up as she finished off downing some vodka and a generous amount of kaluha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did you shay...*Braaaap!!* milk?\" Lambda asked as she burped drunkenly. \"L...Lambda wants shome...Lambda wants shome nishe, creamy milk...!\" Making grabbing motions with her hands, Lambda groped Rachel's chest, rubbing at her more buxom bosom as she craved some creamy milk. Rachel moaned, her face the epitome of a flustered expression as she meekly and quiety squeaked out plea upon plea, only for Lambda to not hear, her booze-addled brain craving more milk. The stimulation of having her bosom rubbed caused the bunny-leach's breasts to balloon in size, the quivering mounds jostling and shaking as the milk continued to fill them, making the twin mounds closer to Lambda's size as more milk leaked forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lambda, p-please, express some boundaries!!\" Rachel spoke up, her face a deep red as she panted desperately, gulping down a fine brandy to cool her core.</span></div></div>",

Wonder how it tashtesh...\" she giggled as she dabbed some up and licked it off her fingers, letting out a happy coo before lapping up even more off of the surface of Rachel's oversized bosoms. The shocked bunny could only squeak and let out soft, almost breathy moans as Lambda's tongue ran over the surface of her breasts, only to let out a yelp as some rather vigorous kneading and massaging provoked a sudden surge of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-lambda! C-control yourself!\" She yelped as she tried to drink down a little fine gin, only to spill it in the process and squirm around as the sounds of gurgling and sloshing started to grow quite audible even to the surrounding patrons from just how much milk was starting to build up. The bloated orbs started to eclipse her belly, leaving the vampire in two minds as to how she felt about the situation, quickly splitting into three or four from the sensations of Lambda kneading and practically pounding away at her tender, growing orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta have more milkyyyyyy~!\" Lamba chanted as she slurped away, her tongue and her groping working in concert to bloat her friend and milk tank's breasts out heavier and fuller. The gentle give of the vampire's formerly fatty chest gradually vanished as more and more milk filled them, the flow down her belly going from a trickle to a steady milkfall that quickly drenched her dress. The heavy mammaries quickly started to gurgle and slosh with every little pant as the bunny-leech tried to get away.</span></div></div>",

This notion alone seemed to distract Lambda, the meaty, drunken girl pulling her mouth away from the nipple as she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...a-and just how much were you looking to buy again ma'am? I-I didn't quite here that...\" The waiter said nervously as he looked up at the two behemoths of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J...just please bring us all the liquor you have.\" Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...you sure? I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will pay you in advance you know.\" Rachel stated as she caused her belly to shake, a bag of gold coins falling out. She had it on hand just in case Gii and Nago had run off, as they did given how Gii was talking to a chair next to Nago and Nago was lapping up a glass of whiskey with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter gulped, nodding as within moments, the waiters and waitresses came out in uniform marching order, carrying huge wood carrying crates filled with glass bottles of whatever they could imagine: Beer, wine, brandy, whiskey, vodka, scotch, sake...they even included ingredients like Irish cream and grenadine to go with it all. Lambda giggled in delight as she grabbed a bottle of hooch and proceeded to guzzle it down, hoisting some crate sto shove inside of her trembling cleavage while Rachel lifted them up in her huge puffy arms, hoping her stumbling wouldn't cause any sorts of spills. Rachel blushed as her billowing boobs bounced heavily, the milk-laden forms feeling like huge heavy balloons strapped to her chest. She waddled out of the bar slowly...and gasped as she heard Lambda behind her, the Murakumo crushing a four door sedan under her porky feet and the fatty apron of her belly, followed by some smothering by her ass cheeks just to be sure the car was crushed as thoroughly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh...look at how...how biggy we both a-are, Rachel~\" Lambda cooed. \"Mmm, so big and soft and squishy and we only get bi...bi...biggier!\" She giggled drunkenly as she got closer, while Rachel herself found herself missing the charming innocent maiden who Lambda had been not two hours ago. It was still afternoon, the evening sun receding while still leaving an ample amount of blue in the sky and they were already this drunk. Rachel breathed deep, hoping she would make it and swearing if this was somehow one of Terumi's wild schemes that she would tear him apart limb from bally limb.</span></div></div>",

The giggling, cheerful drunk that was Lambda hardly noticed as the vampire let out soft moans as each step sent her oversized boobs into a heavy bounce up, followed by a rather milky spray as they dropped down, or noticed as the poor little rabbit tried to knead and express the milk on her own, only to be rewarded with further growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee...Raaaaaashel...\" Lambda slurred, catching up to the distracted, distressed hourglass and cuddling close. Her ruby-red face curled up into a naughty smile as she squashed up against Rachel's back-fat, fumbling around before starting to squeeze and grope what she could of her friend's overblown chest. This caused Rachel to moan even more, trying in vain to wiggle away even as her breasts ballooned further out, nipples plump and leaking as her haphazard reapplication of her blouse quickly became nothing more than a milk-stained mess over the orbs. \"Kinda gettin' thirshtyyyyyyy...maybe I could get a drinky~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you've imbibed q-quite enough, Lambda. A-and you have all of the alcohol I purchased for you!\" Rachel retorted, only to let out a soft moan as she felt the fat Murakumo's porky digits start to tug on her nipples, getting soft jets of milk that splattered to the pavement. She looked around for any manner of distraction, noticing the streets to be rather empty. Likely due in part to her grabby friend having created quite the racket with the destruction of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwcmoooon...jusht a little milkyyyy from my big moomoo cow-bunneh...\" She slurred, managing to waddle around to Rachel's side before tripping over her stomach.  This sent her sprawling to the side, giggling as drunkenly as ever even as she plowed straight into Rachel and sent them both toppling over. The sudden immense pressure of the obese, flabby whale of a robot-girl was too much for Rachel, prompting a throaty groan and a soft squeak as her breasts surged out, growing tender and taut with their milky bounty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-lambda...n-noooo...n-not out...out in public...\" The rather meek and proper vampire moaned. \"O-others may s-see, and...and we may even find ourselves run out of t-town! W-what would mothers t-think if their children s-saw this...?\" She puffed, red in the face and only growing redder as Lambda's warm, heavy weight pressed down more and more, lips and tongue dancing around a plump, pink nipple before starting to simply suckle away.</span></div></div>",

With my only friend...my best friend!\" She said, trying to end on a happy note. It was very likely the booze talking, but Rachel couldn't help but feel some concern at that part as she slowly found herself allowed to rise up from freedom as the Murakumo no longer used her body as a fleshy prison to pin the porky pale woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can always play in the morning Lambda. Now please, let us return to our rooms...sake's alive that will be quite the trip, though...\" Rachel sighed, bracing herself as she started to waddled towards the hotel. Even drunk as she was, her memory was infallible, meaning she could easily find their way back. On the way through the soft grass, Rachel retrieved her shoes, keeping them with her. Even if her fatty feet were too big to be comfortable in the platformed pumps, she could always commission a cobbler to make a new pair for her. Slowly, Lambda made turgid steps behind, her belly bloated with booze as it sloshed and jostled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Racheeeelll~! Y-you're not mad a-*BUUUUUUUUURRRP!!!* N-not mad at me are you...?\" Lambda muttered, the booze making her brain a bit on the bipolar side as she worried she had alienated her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what? No, no no, I-I'm not mad Lambda, just...take some consideration into your actions. Have some tact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okaaay...\" Lambda muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two did not talk much after that. Lambda found herself busy getting distracted by the sights, looking at the lights all around her in a brilliant display, occasionally drinking an ale or a bottle of scotch from her share of the liquor crates stored on her person. Rachel felt like she was carrying two literal tanks on her chest as her pert breasts bounced and jiggled with every step. The vampire vowed to herself that she would make some form of reinforced, elastic nursing bra for her new assets. Heavens above knew she could use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself standing outside of the room she was sharing with Lambda and Ragna, clumsily wobbling the door handle with her chubby hand before she could grasp it and appropriately open it. Slowly, Rachel lumbered forward before collapsing onto the giant, plush bed with a sigh as she felt the pressure leaving her fatty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaahhhh~! This is exactly what I needed...~\" The fatty rabbit cooed as she tried once more to wiggle her fatty toes. \"Ooohh, all that's missing is a warm tub of water to dunk them in and a couple handmaidens to massage them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLambda yawned, slowly moving forward as she leaned onto the bed as best she could fit, her huge blubbery belly colliding with Rachel's, causing her to squeak as the other blond blob lay beside her, wrapping her huge pillowy pillars known as her arms around her as best as they could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my...best friend Rachel...bestie...best best...\" Lambda muttered drunkenly as she felt her consciousness wane before yawning, slowly drifting off to sleep. Rachel sighed. She wanted to get up but...she felt not disturbing the lumbering lard laden lady beside her took precedence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty minutes later, Ragna returned to the room, sighing as he held his coat in his hand. It had been so long since he got the damn thing washed that he was finally glad to see a laundromat that DIDN'T have his wanted poster in the window. It was almost like he'd just bought a new one, it felt so much cleaner and softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened the door, his jaw dropped as he saw the massive meaty mountains of Rachel and Lambda hugging right before him. The two of them cooed and hummed softly in their sleep, both blobs blushing bashfully with each other's company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...guess they do get along pretty well...\" Ragna muttered to himself. Considering the situation before him, he decided the best thing he could do was sleep on the couch.</span></div></div>",

May as well since such a great fighting game with well designed ladies, like many others, deserves a story where fans can feel free to fatten their favourite girl to their whims!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember, make your chapters well written: No paragraph long chapters and use good grammar and no extreme OOC. But either way, go nuts guys; your imagination is the limit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, I'll allow futa (dickgirls) for those who wish, slobby behavior, no scat, vomiting or peeing though, no characters dying, but I will allow for soft vore by some request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yeah ASIDE FROM THOSE RULES you guys are free to go nuts and make the girls big as you like. Item is rated 18+ so sex is a-okay :D</td>",
