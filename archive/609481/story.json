You were thinking about your life, all that you wish you would have accomplished by now, and your need for a little excitement.  You drifted off to sleep and entered the world of dreams.<br>\r\nOr did you?<br>\r\nYou are now in a dark forest.  The trees are as ancient as time and moan as the wind tickles the leaves.<br>\r\nIn the distance you see a bright, white light and are summoned to it.<br>\r\nA wizard, dressed in a flowing white robe speaks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been chosen, my friend, for a journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have I been chosen?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are great forces in the spiritual realm that are beyond your comprehension.  They have chosen you because of the courage and wisdom you have displayed in your life thus far.  You hold the key to the resolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping you are not sounding too silly, you ask, \"Is there a conflict?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" replies the wizard.  \"And you will learn of it as you journey forward.  There are others that have been chosen as well, but not all will choose the same path as you.  You will face many decisions and the first is now before you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish the wizard would be more clear, but you can see he is not disclosing any more information at this time.  Besides, it's a dream so you just go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hands you a scroll, listing your choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You will remain human and be blessed with the power of light. You will be able to cause temporary blindness to your enemies, and create large amounts of piercing light.  You also have the ability to control light sources: from blowing out candles to illuminating torches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You will remain human and have the power of darkness.  You will be able to create complete darkness as far as a 1 mile around you on all sides.  You will have a magical cloak that when the hood is worn, you will become invisible, but beware of using it too often, as it will have dire consequences!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. You will be transformed into a good elf.  You will gain mental powers and insights, able to send telepathic messages and images.  You will be close to nature, respecting it, befriending it; therefore nature will befriend you and come to your aid when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. You will be transformed into a dark elf.  You will gain mental powers and insights, able to send confusion and chaos to the minds of your enemies.  You will be close to the spirits of the dark forest and swamps, and they will serve you upon command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Remain exactly as you are.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe wizard awaits your decision.</span></div></div>",

Beware of the one called Domarion, for his power is great and he seeks to destroy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go great wizard, I implore you, please tell me more of my mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but quickly,\" he says, drawing closer.<br>\r\nContinuing in a low voice he shares, \"A great conflict is brewing between the forces of good, which are to the North and South, and the forces of evil which are to the East and West.  This forest has always been considered neutral ground, and for this moment still is.  But soon it will be a bloody battleground.\"<br>\r\nThe wizard pauses with a sorrowful look in his eye, as if he is seeing the future.<br>\r\n\"You have been brought here alone and in secret, chosen because of your exceptional abilities - your sharp mind, able body, and strong personality.  The fate of the forest and this realm will rest in your hands, and the hands of others just like yourself, who have also been chosen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is causing the conflict?\" you ask, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time to go into this now.  You will learn as you travel.  Be careful who you befriend.  Some can give you invaluable insight and help, and others live only to decieve and destroy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the wizard, in a flash of light, disappears from sight, leaving you alone in the forest.<br>\r\nYou can hear his voice in the wind saying, \"You need to journey to the Empire of Light, far to the North.  There you will gain perfection in your new craft and complete understanding and direction.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Waves of exhaustion flood over you as you bleed and struggle to remian conscious. <br>\r\nA warmth comes over your body as you are made aware of a presence.  Perhaps you have stumbled upon a dream, you think, as you see a bright light.  Emmerging from the light, a beautiful woman, dressed in white and shades of blue.  Her eyes a deep blue, her hair a golden blonde.  Large, silver wings flow gracefully from her back.  Her movements are delicate and beautiful;  she must be a dream.<br>\r\nThe world fades to black and your eyes close.<br>\r\nWhen you awake you are in a strange room.  Everything has a soft glow, as if you are still in a dream.  <br>\r\n\"I must have died,\" you think.<br>\r\nThe woman you saw earlier enters the room.  She is an angel.  Helping you sit up, she hands you a cup containing steaming liquid.  It smells minty and taste like tea.  The warmness of the liquid flows down your throat, into your belly, and your entire body begins to feel warm and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to speak but the angel stops you, \"Sshhh.  You are healing and need your rest.\"</span></div></div>",

The child steps nimbly onto rocks and over roots; you, meanwhile, just manage to keep up without making too much noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never asked for your name,\" you say. \"If you don't care to tell me, that's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's quite alright. My name's Samuel,\" he says. \"<i>I</i> don't like secrets.\" he adds accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel a little guilty, but the words of the Wizard echo through your mind, and you stick to your decision. Another thought forms in your mind, more a dim feeling like deja vu than anything else, but still--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was to understand that no one lived in the Swamp of the Ghost River.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel chuckles. \"No one's been to the Swamp in three centuries to find out if that was true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething deep inside tells you that this isn't exactly true, but still you press on. The orb in your pocket feels suddenly warm, but you know that this is just your mind reasserting its presence rather than a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next mile passes in the deathly silence of the Swamp. You follow Samuel on top of the ridge, keeping the stagnant water to your left and the forest to your right. Soon you can make out the fire with your eyes. Not long after you can make out the dark, solid shapes of houses. When you pass through the gate, you can see that the village is indeed trapped in an era that must have passed. Several of the houses seem ancient and decrepit. The stones of the structures are covered with moss, the doors rotting on their hinges. The roofs were once thatched, but now old wood is nailed to a few places where the grass seems to have rotten out or blown away by unruly wind. The only other uniform feature of the houses is that the windows are completely shuttered. The boards covering the windows are new, and do not seem to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a group of people, around fifteen, standing around the fire. At the sound of footsteps, they all turn. Their cloaks are all exact copies (fit to each person's size, of course) of Samuel's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA taller man steps forward. \"You've been gone three nights, Samuel Oakvale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, sir, trapped by the irregular movements of the Sun these past few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man regards you. A woman steps forward, passing the man and approaching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who this be? <i>Who this be?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A traveller I found trying to route the Swamp. Says he's going to yon Mountains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name, Samuel.\" five of them groan in unisom. \"What is his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't say.\" Samuel glances at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he human?\" The man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss.\" The woman touches your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man approaches you. You are struck by his handsome face, which seems without age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive our eccentricities, my good fellow. We here in the Wild Wood have seen few in several centuries. Allow us to house you for the night. The forest is a dangerous place at night, and the foothills of the Mountains are far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know much, but you know the Great Dark Forest hasn't been called the Wild Wood in a milenium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They could be trying to drug or poison you- you dare not trust anyone, after what the wizard said. But then again, if everyone ate out of the same pot... but they seemed strange- not quite normal.

My kinsmen have lived here in solitude for centuries, ever since Father River was swallowed by the Wild Wood. We've seen so few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other villagers had begun to make a line. You file in somewhere in the first half. When you finally reach the cauldron, you are met by a striking beauty with dark hair and piercing green eyes. But she smiles and pours some soup in a small bowl. It is purple, with a few red and green herbs mixed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made from the crushed flowers of a nightshade lavender,\" the beauty says. \"Makes a soup of deepest purple, but tis delightful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her, and sip from the bowl. The taste is exquisite, somewhere between cheddar cheese and peanut butter. You take a bigger gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beauty laughs. \"The visitor enjoys the nightshade soup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other villagers laugh heartily. You hold your empty bowl out to the beauty, who graciously fills it up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need not have too much, lad,\" she says. \"Makes you sick if you have too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and try to savor the soup as you walk away. Samuel smiles at you with some of the most perfect teeth you've ever seen. You can't help but smile back. You look around at everyone's smiling faces and it makes you so very happy. You laugh, and seven people laugh with you. Samuel wraps an arm around your shoulders. Your body sings a symphony of wonderful sensation as he touches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you enjoying yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"That feels amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" His voice seems to come after an eternity, which is strange. You know it hasn't been more than a second. \"What feels amazing? This?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubs your shoulder a little bit. The sensations are incredible, delightful. You chuckle bashfully. Your eyes close a bit. An hour passes in fifteen seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like this, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little weird, but respond truthfully. \"Yeah, kinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I help?\" The beautiful soup girl steps over. She rubs your back. Your eyes roll back in your head. You make a noise in your throat. She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear some drums start up a lively beat. You feel the beat in your being. You want to dance to it, and find yourself doing so, albeit sloppily. The girl dances with you, her elegance more than compensating for your awful dancing. She stares into your eyes, her hands roaming, pausing to rub your chest and stomach, and the smallest touch almost brings you to your knees. She kisses you, and you kiss her back, barely aware that you are doing so, reality is a dream, nothing you do really matters anyway. Your hands find her hips, marveling at the soft linen of her robe. Behind her, the villagers have begun a sort of line dance, all standing in a group. Jedidiah starts up a song in a strange language. The villagers respond in the same tongue. Another girl joins you and the three of you start to move toward the group. The soup girl kisses your neck, her hand disappears underneath your robe and rubs your chest. Samuel approaches you. You feel a bit optimistic, thinking that he might join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this thought, your wits return. Revulsion washes over you as you analyze his slight frame, the frame of a child. But you spot the athame, old and encrusted with rubies, in his hand and are overcome by a completely different emotion. You're still under the drug's influence, however, and your motor skills might not be up to the task of helping you out of this.</span></div></div>",

When your eyes adjust (rather quickly) you see it is an arrow. The girl crumbles to dust. The athame falls to the ground and gets stuck in the ground.

Seemed like she was just an ordinary and good woman, after all.<br>\r\n   The woman smiled. \"Wonderful. Glad you could join us. And just in time for dinner too! I am Layla, by the way, do call me that. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n   You bit your lip. What should you do?

On one of the seats was a boy your age, fifteen. He looked at you curiously with his piercing green eyes, trying to figure you out.

One of his eyebrows was arched, he did'nt look pleased.<br>\r\n    You took a seat, looking at the floor, your cheeks burning in fear, excitement, curiosity and shyness. The boy looked at you and asked, \"Hello Miss. My mother is accustomed to accepting travellers into the house. May I know where you are travelling to?\"<br>\r\n    Your heart skipped a beat when he addressed you. You mumbled, for you intended to keep it secret. <br>\r\n    \"Sorry. I can't hear what you said.\"<br>\r\n     \" I must'nt. I know it's rude, but I cannot trust you yet.\" You replied stronger now, looking at him in the eye, even if his gaze was practically making your heart explode. Yet you loved the way he looked at you, whichever way actually.<br>\r\n    \"My mother has trusted you. At least, show me your face. Do you think me a disguised monster?\"<br>\r\n    \"No!\" You exclaimed. You stood up abruptly and went for the door, fear beating inside you like a drum. You must'nt get your identity revealed to strangers ever. Nevermind rest. You will make do. <br>\r\n   You hurriedly walked back to the door, thinking which way to go while giving an apologetic glance at Layla. But just when you were in the doorway, a lean arm hugged you in the waist strongly, digging into your firm belly. You recoiled and wriggled, panicking if there was a monster behind you, but it was of little use. You felt vulnerable and you were pulled back and faced to the boy. He gripped your hands and took of the hood and stared at you.<br>\r\n   \"Okay. It's Meredith. Chill.\"<br>\r\n    He looked at your hands, which were holding the orb, and said, \"I happen to know the forest and I can help you go to the Lights Empire.

Sitting against a tree, you struggle to hold your eyes open and finally give in to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Madda has found some friends and leads them straight to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Madda, you have done well.  Here is your reward,\" the dark figure smirks as he hands the creature a purse of coins.  Madda scampers off with his prize as the dark figure approaches and silently raises his sword.  It comes down swiftly into your chest.  Your eyes open long enough to see a dark shadow looming over you before your life slips away.  Clearly, you should have been more careful who you trust.</span></div></div>",

Mentally preparing yourself, you take a step in. <i>Squelch.</i> The sound of your good boots sinking into the icky mud makes you want to scream. And yet... The water doesn't look as bad as it did when you were standing on the bank. You take another step. The water looks even clearer, but you are starting to feel sicker. At each step, the water gets clearer, cleaner, while you feel more and more nauseous. Finally, you reach the other side. You would be ecstatic, if you didn't feel so sick. And now the water is crystal clear! You crawl up the shore. Strangely, about three yards from the bank of the river, you find a large hole. Not a bottomless hole, it is only about 20 feet deep. So you lean over it and puke. And you keep puking and puking until the hole is full. You feel so grossed out. Then you realize... The vomit in the hole is all the filth from the water. You recognize the stench and strange color. And when you look again, the hole has disappeared. Was it your imagination...? You head over to the river and look in. It is deeper than before, you realize, and the water is the cleanest you've ever seen. Now it is filled with fish, crabs, lobsters... All sorts of water-animals. You are so thirsty, that you take a handful of the water and take a sip. You feel great! No, not just great, immortal, almost! Then you see a pack of dark shapes moving towards you through the water. You step away from the shore, but there pop up the heads and torsos of beautiful women! You gasp, looking at their tails. Mermaids! A brunette, obviously the leader, moves to the front of the pack. \"Hello, human. We would like to thank you for the power of light. You sucked up all the muck from here, and the water has broken the dams! We are free once again!\" \"What about the forest? Won't it just put the dams back up?\" \"No, it takes a lot of work to do that, and, after they saw the damage they did to their precious river, they've decided it's not worth the trouble. \"Oh,\" you say. \"So you were living in that filthy water all along?\" The brunette looks thoughtful, then nods. \"Yes, we have been. Trapped under layers and layers of poisonous muck. You must be a powerful human, to do that!\" \"Thank you,\" you say, blushing at her compliment. \"And the water is magical! It gives you super-human strength! And if you eat a lobster from this water, it gives you the power to speak to nature and animals. And if you catch a crab and eat it, you can turn into a mermaid when you go into the water. If you catch a shrimp and eat it, you can fly. And if you catch the rainbow carp and eat it... You have the power to control the powerful God, Pyui! But not for long. Here you are!\" One of the mermaids fills a canteen full of the water. You gulp it down, you are so thirsty, and then refill it. Another mermaid grabs a crab and kills it, giving you a bite of its flesh. Another mermaid grabs and kills a lobster, giving you a bite of its flesh. Another mermaid feeds you a shrimp. You thank them as you feel yourself growing stronger, growing a bond with nature, having the power to become a mermaid, and sprouting large, beautiful, glimmering silver wings. You tuck them in. \"Now, some gifts to show you our gratitude,\" said the brunette, One mermaid gives you leather arrow pouch filled with silver tipped arrows, along with a lovely bow. You sling them over your shoulders. Another mermaid gives you backpack that fits around your wings. Another mermaid gives you new boots, even finer than the ones you lost in the mud. Another mermaid presents you with a gleaming sword, and another presents you with gold. You put the sword into the hilt on your belt and gold in you backpack. They then give you a lovely red cloak with a hood and slits for your wings. \"This,\" says the brunette. \"Is an invisibility cloak. But you can only use it 3 times. So beware!\" Then with sweet goodbyes, the mermaids leave. You catch some fish for dinner and pack them away. Then you remember the rainbow carp.. It would be nice to have a God on your side...

My name is Winifred Gales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinifred helps you sit up and fetches you a glass of water, waiting while you recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a traveler, Dear?\" asks Winifred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am just passing through.  I think I was being chased, but I'm not sure by whom.  I haven't eaten all day.  Perhaps that and the anxiety of being chased is what caused me to faint.  I'm sorry to intrude.  I will be on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nonsense,\" replied Winifred.  \"Stay a while and have some food.  I've got plenty here.  Take some time to gain your strength before you are off.  There have been strange goings ons in these parts lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  Tell me more,\" you implore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, more and more dark creatures are in the forest and the air has become increasingly heavy and damp.  There have been more and more travelers as well - different sorts of people and elves, going this way and that.  They tell me a war is brewing, but I don't know much more than that.  I do know that I'm not sleeping as well at night, now.  I hear strange noises in the night that send tremors down my spine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen intently, gleaning as much information as you can while you help yourself to the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think the noises are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not certain, but I think they are orcs - terrible, ugly creatures meant for evil.  Sometimes I hear screeches, like the sounds of giant hawks screaming.  And then, unmistakably, I hear the voices of people; sometimes talking, sometimes yelling, and at worst, screaming, which startles me so badly my heart pains me.  I have put bolts on my doors for the night, although I hardly think it would stop anyone who really wanted to get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyebrows raise.  This place did not sound very pleasant at night, that is for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you thought about leaving the area, Winifred?  Is there a safer place you could go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinifred thought for a moment.  \"I haven't considered leaving, but if this place becomes a battleground, I feel it might be wise.  I'm not sure where I would go, however.  Is there really any place safe when there is a war on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in understanding as you chew on a chicken leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where are you travelling to, my Dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing your chicken you reply, \"the Dark Castle.  Do you know of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinifred's eyebrows raised, \"The Dark Castle?  Oh, yes, I have heard of it.  It stands to the far west.  Are you sure you want to go there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that you seem like a nice person.  I can't imagine what business you would have there.  It's not a pleasant place, at least not that I've heard.  I haven't been there myself.  I know it's not my business, but why are you going there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure how much information you should give.  You don't really know Winifred.  She seems innocent enough, but who could tell for sure at this early stage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who told you to go to the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wizard,\" you reply in disbelief at what you are saying.  \"One minute I'm home, the next I'm in a forest being told I'm going to be a part of saving the world.

Winifred seems kind enough and the sun is beginning to get low in the sky.

You had quite the mystery to figure out, it seemed.  A good night's sleep would only help.  In time, Winifred returned and led you to your room; a modest sized, cozy room with a generous double bed.

She immediately became invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your cloak will do you no good,\" a man's voice echoed gently in the air all around her. \"For we can see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? What do you want?\" she asked looking all around her to see from which direction the man was speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am called Samada, General of the Woodland Elves. We mean you no harm, as long as you bring no harm to the Woodlands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourselves,\" she asked as she removed the hood of her cloak. What use was it if they could see her already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put down your weapon, and we shall make ourselves known unto you,\" Samada requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sheathed her dagger on the side of her right forearm. It was small and easily accessible from there. \"I am Beth. I am not sure how I got her or even where I have come from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada, along with twenty different elves, cam out of the wood line to reveal themselves to her. They were tall, muscular men with pointed ears. All of them carried a bow, two daggers, a sword made of a metal Beth had never seen before, and long emerald green robes. Although the elves had different color hair of many different lengths, they all had a violet purple eyes, and a crystal that illuminated hanging around their necks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My men and I are scouts for His Majesty Seth Kildonan, King of the Woodland Elves. We have been watching you for several hours, to see if you were a friend or foe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I'm not here to cause any harm to anyone,\" Beth said dusting off her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with us, so we may eat and drink. The Woodland has many foes, who come out in the coldness of night. Their eyes are sharp and their hearing is keen. Follow me,\" Samada said leading her away from the place in which she woke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada led Beth and his men south. The elves were extremely careful not to break any of the vines or shrubs in the lush forest. They simply moved a branch here and there, then quietly moved on around the obstacle. Beth followed them, keeping her eyes open for anything else strange or foreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed by a waterfall that ran down one of the highest peaks Beth had ever seen. It had willow trees lining its creek, ferns all around, and huckleberry bushes filled with the tasty pinkish red berries. Beth smiled and drank the beauty in. If this was a dream, she wished she could build a house right here and live the rest of her days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come. We must not linger while danger is so close,\" Samada said passing Beth by. Beth ran to catch up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a strange warrior. Do you not know when you are being tracked?\" Samada questioned cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth, I am no warrior. I don't know how to use this sword or bow. I did take self defense class once, so I know how to use the knife. As for the other items, i don't have a clue,\" beth shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay close then. There is no time to teach you here. Once we get to the Village of Dan'ne, I will show you.\" Samada turned and whispered, \"Tha'mere dalimorah. Pashinglah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words the elves picked up the pace, and Beth found herself in almost a dead sprint. \"We must hurry. Gi'lorhim and his men are close. They must not catch up with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is 'Gi'lorhim'?\" Beth panted almost out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a goblin spy. A slimy filthy creature who has been kidnapping our women and children. He thinks we will tell him were the jewel of the Empire of Light is, if they torment our kin,\" Samada answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves pressed onward for several hours, only stopping for water and to let Beth rest her feet for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they reached the edge of the Woodlands. Samada crawled on his stomach out into the meadow on a hill that over looked the Village of Dan'ne Dale. \"Mattithya,\" he whispered. Beth looked over her shoulder to see one of the elves pass by her and started crawling like Samada once he got to the meadow. The two men talked for a few moments before the one Samada called 'Mattithya' crawled back to the Woodland edge and then ran back the the end of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada came back to the group also, after a few minutes. \"We will go in fours down to the village. I do not detect danger, but this way, if there is any danger, we will not all be caught up in an ambush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded. She picked up her pack of arrows, and put it on her back, leaving her hands free to only carry the bow. Samada, Beth, and two other elves who she did not know the names to, headed to the village first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't walk with curiously and speed, like they did in the woodlands. They now walked with assurance, wisdom, and pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village was an array of village of woodland elves, moving about the village purchasing goods of all kinds. The children were playing with little bugs, that appeared to be fireflies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are Wildflowere Pixies. They are small, but they carry the pollen of the wildflowers, which produce an amazingly strong healing power. Their wings produce a sound of music that calms the soul. They love to be around children. They like their energy,\" Samada explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed some of your arrows are broken. I can take you to F'lorin. He is amazing at fixing things. But, if you wish I can take you to the home of my father, where you can eat and rest. There is much to do tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And, a bed sure does sound good.,\" Beth said as she wiped the sweat from her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada smiled at her. \"You are a strange human, Beth. I have never seen one that spoke the way you do, or acted the way you do. What tribe are you from?\" he asked walking her down the lane. Children were running bout trying to catch the pixies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth laughed at what Samada had said. She waited to see if he really wanted to know what tribe she was from. when he looked at her with the question still on his face, she knew it wasn't a joke. \"I don't come from any tribe. I was born and raised in Winnipeg, Canada. We have people called 'Native Americans', who consist of hundreds of tribes, but I am not a Native American.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada looked awstruck. \"You mean you had no mother or father who raised you? You are an orphan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth smiled and shook her head. She didn't quite know how to explain it. She never really had to think about things like this back before the white wizard spoke to her. \"No. I had a mother and a father, who are probably worried sick about me by now,\" she thought. \"Where I come from our 'tribes' are called 'families'. My family name is Lavallee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth of the La...vallee,\" Samada parroted. Samada smiled and looked at Beth approvingly. \"You have a beautiful tribe name. My tribal name is the Hawkeye Tribe. We have been the leaders of the  Elf Warriors for ten centuries. It is a great honour to serve the king, and the spirits of the Woodlands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel blessed to have met you Samada,\" Beth said putting out her hand to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her soft hands for a moment. They were not course or rough, like the ones of the women he knew, from hard labor. They were smooth, and soft. It was then he noticed her complexion. Her skin was white, and smooth. Her cheeks were pink, like the clouds at sunset. Her eyes were as blue as the Great River. She looked like an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stretched out his hand to hers and gave it a shake. \"I am glad it was I who had found you first my lady. Gi'lorhim has been wondering in our forest for weeks, waiting for us to drop our guard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada led her to an enchanting home, made of (what looked to her) riverbed rocks. The front of the home was gardened in an array of strange,yet beautiful, flowers. Humming birds flew all around, drinking of the sweet nectar of the honeysuckle bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the home of my father, Rychin. It will be safe for you,\" Samada encouraged as he opened the thick redwood doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam! Sam! You are home!\" two little elf girls with long curly brown hair exclaimed, jumping up and down with excitement in their eyes. \"Mother, mother,\" the shouted as they took off running to another room down the marble hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are my sisters. Iris is the taller one. The little one is Lily. They get rather excited at times, but one can't help but fall in love with them,\" he smiled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBeth smiled at the little elf girls. They reminded her of her sister, who at this moment would be asking mother for just one more glass of water before she 'really' went to sleep. \"They're lovely Samada. They remind me of...\" she couldn't finish. She hadn't realized how home sick she really was, and to think that her mission had only just begun; according to the white wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada raised Beth's chin with his strong hand, so her gaze met his. She felt so alone. \"Remind's you of what Beth of the Lavallee's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth felt a lump in her throat. A tear ran down her pink cheeks. She hadn't realized the caring or wisdom she shown through the pupils of Samada's violet purple eyes. \"Of home,\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you have partaken of food, and have rested your weary body, we shall talk about why you are here, and try to figure out your destiny. The wisdom of the Woodlands and the peace of the Great River will explain things more clearly to us,\" Samada comforted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth smiled as her attention was drawn from Samada to the elderly woman who was heading this way, with Iris and Lily skipping next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, mother? See? Sam is back, jest like he promised!\" little Iris exclaimed tugging on her mother's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, I have returned home weary of travel, and hungered. May I seek refuge in the house of my father for my self and a weary traveler that the White Wizard placed in the Woodlands for my safe keeping?\" he asked his mother. He took the old woman elf's hand and kissed it gently and then lowered himself to one knee, awaiting her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samada, my dear son. You are always welcome to say here, after your journey,\" she smiled at her son, kissing him on his forehead. She then looked at Beth and took Beth's hands into hers. Beth felt warmth, love, comfort, and peace serging through her hands that were being held; piercing the utter most parts of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I to question the White Wizard. If in your path this lady of the woods has been place, then in this place shall she find comfort for her soul, food for her stomach, and a bed to rest. Come my lady. Lay down your burdens and be comforted in the house of Rychin, my husband. I am Dawn from the house for Flor'rin,\" She smiled leading Beth to a place where she was helped out of the satchel of arrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada took off his weapons, except his dagger that was strapped to the inner left ankle. Beth followed suet and left everything in the closet of the great hall, except the dagger strapped to her forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked all around her as she was led into what looked like a great reception room. It had an oak dinning table that stretched the full length of the vast room. The windows, that looked like they were made of pure crystal, were treated with pastel shear fabric that looked as thin as lacy paper as the wind blew gently against them. It looked stunning. In each corner of the ceiling, an angel statue was posted sitting in prayer, guarding the people within its boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn pointed to the table for them to sit, as she went to the great kitchen to prepare the feast. Samada pulled out a chair for Beth and then chose to sit opposite her. Iris and Lily sat on either side of their big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris looked at the kitchen doors to see if her mother was listening. \"Did you fight any...goblins, Sam?\" she whispered using her tiny right hand to cover the movement of her lips, so anyone who wasn't close would know what she had been asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today, little one,\" Sam smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris sat back in her chair and pouted with her arms crossed. Then she sat straight up and asked, \"Can you tell Lily and me a story of one of the times you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Lilly shook her head, causing her little curls to swing back and forth. \"You know those stories give me bad sleeps! Sam, please don't tell one of those, please?\" Lily begged pulling on the sleeve of his emerald robe. \"Tell us the one of the Pixie Princess. The one who gave you that shiny globe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada looked into Beth's eyes, which were gleaming in laughter. Beth was enjoying the girls, as well as the safety of the grand house. \"How about when you girls go to bed? I'll tuck you in and tell you a pixie story then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" the girls shouted in unison, clapping their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, an elderly looking elf came into the dinning hall. \"Father!\" the girls shouted as they got up and ran to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly elf held out his hand to calm them down. The girls stop running in mid stride. the both regained their composure and stood in front of their father with their heads bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady elves must move with grace, so they do not fall and hurt themselves. I love my little ladies, and do not want to see their snowy white skin bruised like a bunch of dwarfs playing in the dry river beds,\" he reproached with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't mean to father,\" Iris apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily looked at her big sister and then at her father. \"Can I have a huggy love and a kissy smack now father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and Samada covered their grinning face with thier hands and waited to see what the old man would do. He opened his arms, and the girls came to him with their arms wide open. They kissed their father on both his cheeks and then let go of the embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada stood and took the hand that his father offered him, and gave it a hearty shake as he too kissed both cheeks of his father. \"It does my eyes good to see you in good spirits father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its good to have you safe in my house once more, my dear son,\" he smiled. His attention then turned to Beth, who was enjoying the love that was so publicly shown. Beth wondered if she could remember the last time she had embraced her father and told him how much she appreciated<br>\r\n him and her mother. She was embarrassed to think it had been so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see my house has welcomed a pedal from the apple blossoms of the Woodlands,\" he smiled as he offered his hand to Beth. Beth stood and gave him her hand. He brought it to his lips and kissed the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Beth of the Lavallee tribe. She has been sent by the White Wizard,\" Samada said. \"Beth, this is my father, Rychin from the house of Anigoran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An honor to be invited to your home sir,\" Beth smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit, sit. Your journey has been long, and your burden was heavy. Enjoy the feast in which my house has prepared, for we have much to discus before our eyes can rest,\" Rychin announced to his guest and son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we stay up too father?\" Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little lady elves must have their sleep if they are to ever be as pretty as the Pegasuses, which fly through the air,\" their father smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, father,\" the girls echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Dawn came out of the kitchen with a platter of corn on the cob, and a large crystal bowel of tossed greens, and sat them on the table. She leaned over nd gave her husband a kiss on his forehead. \"I'm glad you made it for supper my dear husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't be late for your apple cobler dear,\" Rychin grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth waved her hand at him, smiling as she went back into the kitchen. She returned carrying a tray that had a golden roasted turkey. She sat it down in the middle of the table where they were sitting and then sat between her husband and Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRychin stood and the rest of the family held hands. Dawn and Samada took Beths hands as Rychin began to speak. \"To the fields of harvest, our house gives thanks. For it is your soil that has grown the harvest in which we now partake. To the bird of the forest, we say thanks. For, it is because of your sacrifice that we can partake of your meat to fill out bodies. May your spirit take flight once more to the flok that awaits for you in the heavens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRychin then took a knife and cut the large bird, feeding Iris and Lily first, then Beth, Dawn, Samada, and himself last. The food was filling. Beth couldn't remember the last time she had the oppertunity to sit at a dinner table and eat among those who were family. Not even her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a helping of thier mothers delicous apple cobbler, Lilly and Iris were shoo'ed off to bed. \"But, you promised to tell me a story about the Pixie Princess Sam,\" Lily's little lips quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada knelt down to his little sister and dried her tear with his thumb. He kissed her little pointy ears and her nose. \"You don't want to let the pixies fly away, because you scared them with your crying now would you?\" he asked holding her little head in his strong hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head no, looking all around with her eyes to see if she really scared the pixies away. \"Then no more tears,\" Samada ordered with a grin. Lily nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father had need of me for a few moments. As soon as I tarry with father, I will come to you straight away and I shall tell you all I know of the Pixy Princess Alhora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise?\" she sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give you my word as a General,\" he said standing up and saluting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covered her mouth with her tiny hands and giggled. \"I can't wait!\" Lily then turned to Beth and waved good-bye, in which Beth returned the wave with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada turned to face Beth once Lily was gone from the hall. \"Father carries news of the Dark Castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dark Cas...,\" Beth muttered. \"That's where I have been told to go by the White Wizard! Has your father just come from there? Can he help me get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada looked at her with his eyes bulging, \"Are you mad? To go to the Dark Castle alone is a death wish, and almost impossible. If one makes it past the goblins and orcs after crossing the haunts of the Ghost River, one still has to navigate the Great River!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Great River can lead one to one of the only safe places one can use for rest...the house of the wise elves of the River of Dan. But, its pointless, because no one has been able to navigate that river with any success in over a hundred years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itsn't there another path we may take?\" Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada shook his head, \"The terrain might be better , but there are creatures there that are more terrifying than orcs or goblins. Many have gone before. The ones who HAVE made it back were made mad. Some of those places have creatures that even the Wise Council of the Elves don't even know about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be a way!\" Beth pleaded holding her head in her hands. \"Why would I be sent there, if there was no way to get there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada took Beth by the arms and hugged her, to comfort her. \"I have a map, and I've been studying the terrain since I was but a lad, and have found no SAFE way of entering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked up at him for a moment in thought. \"May I see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Samada said. He led her back to the great hall and took the map out of his satchel. He opened the brown rice paper scroll on an endtable nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, this is the Empire of Light to our north. It is the home of the Great Wizards of Najah, The Land of the Empire. The white wizard resides there, and takes council within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the south, is the Great River, and the Forks of Dan. The wisest of elves abide in the deep beautiful forests, except the walls of the river are too steep to walk and the river rages between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here,\" he pointed on the map. \"But, we are surrounded by caves, which are homes to those filthy little goblins. And, below them are the Orcs and Elves who have turned their powers over to Lord of Darkness. They are evil, cunning, and can take on many different forms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamada liffted his illuminating crystal that was hanging around his neck. \"When a dark elf is around, our crystals illuminate red. When in the presence of the wise elf they illuminate green. When in the presence of kin they...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They turn purple,\" Beth finished. Samada nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the west, over here,\" Samada marked on the map, \"this is the Ghost River. Many evil things abide here. Its a vast array of mines, graves, and shafts. All are patrolled by goblins and dwarfs, who want nothing but gold and materialistic pleasures. They care nothing for life or the welfare of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The forests that surround the Dark Castle often end without warning. Many of friends have met their fate on those cliffs,\" he said walking away from the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth took the map and looked at it harder. There must be some way to get to the Dark Castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samada! Come, join me in drink and in thought my son,\" Rychin called down the hall after him. \"Bring your guest, if the lass wishes to partake in word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you join me in conversation with my father Beth?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beth smiled at Samada as she folded the map and stuck it into her coat pocket. Samada led her into a different part of the house. Candles flickered against the darkness, and a fire in the brick fireplace warmed the coolness in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit my son,\" Rychin jestered to an over stuffed couch opposite him. Samada led Beth to the couch, and he and she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRychin sat looking into the fire, while puffing on his corn cob pipe. smoke trickled our his lips and nose as he sat in thought. Beth felt a chill runup her spine, causeing the hairs on her neck to stand up. She tugged her coat snuggly around herself, as she too started gazing into the flames of the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see, father?\" Samada asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see darkness...and sufferung. The hand of Zarenian grows powerful,\" Rychin puffed on his pipe some more. \"Ones who the Woodland Elves once called allies and friends now betray us. We will no longer be safe in this dark hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRychin took a pouch from his robes and opened it. Inside was what looked like teal grains of sand. Rychin took but a pinch, and tossed it into the flames of the fire. The fire raged hot and a puff of smoke boomed out with a flash. Beth jumped back at the unforseen explosion, however Samada and Rychin sat still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be no rest for the Woodland Elves, for war is imminate. The eyes of the Elves of the Great Council will be callused. The Humans' faith is waivering. The Orcs seek to gain a treaty with the Dark Elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goblins rage war with the Dwarfs, who have an unforseen future. Their love of materialisic goods may overtake them, if they are not careful.\" Rychin turned to Beth and looked deep into her eyes. Beth wanted to turn away, but her spirit wouldn't allow it. It was like she was being drawn into the mind of Rychin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, my lady, hold the key to our world. Our future, as the future of the Mystic Forest, lays in your hands. Your paath has been presented before you, yet you are unsure. Trust no one, for they trust you not. They arrows in which you have touched, carry two faits. Choose wisely, and you will be a stepp closer in saving us all. Choose in haste, and quickly will we fall from the top of the mountian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth took a big gulp. She had never been trusted to do a thing in her life! Who in the world was she supose to save an entire world? She looked at Samada, who was sitting with his eyes closed, drinking in the words his father was prophesying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRychin took Beth's hands into his old ones, \"Follow the wind, which carries the spirit of our ancestors, for they will lead you in the right path. Do not trust your own eyes, but my you be given the sight of the egale, for thier sight is keen and powerful. May you not be harmed, as you make your journey. The woodlands will give you the use of their beloved Pixie, Alorha. She will mend you if you should be harmed,\" he said as he got up and opened a window in the east part of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds of the window being raised, Beth saw a the fluttering of tiny wings flying to her. She held out her hand as the little creature landed in her palm. It was a lady pixie. She stood an inch and a half tall. She had short blond hair that were in an array of ringlets with wildflowers pinned in different spots in her hair. She had green eyes that sparkeled, and didn't wear any shoes. The little pixie glowed as she bowed before Beth. Beth nodded back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give you one last thing to help you on your quest...my son Samada. For he knows the forests and the land well. He has many friends in the animal world, as well and the mortal. Trust his path, for he will not lead you astray,\" Rychen said putting a hand on his son's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go. Rest, for you have many things ahead of you.\" With that, Rychin left the two in the sitting room alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and Samada didn't speak a work. They both went to their own rooms to rest. Alorha followed Beth into her room, and found a basket of arranged flowers on a table near the bed. Alorha flew to the sunflower and laid down. Beth smiled at the little pixe as she too got into bed and rested. Tomorrow would be a big day. She had a few places she needed to go to before she would begin this ...quest. She just didn't know where to go first when she woke up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beth woke up not sure where she was. Warms rays of sunlight swept across her face. She rubbed her eyes, thinking that she was still in a dream. Once she sat up in the bed, she relised that this was no dream. Alorah was still sleeping peacfully, curlled up in the center of a sunflower. Beth smiled at the little pixie. She looked like a beautiful doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth walked over to a silver breakfast tray, possibly placed in her room by Samada's mother, and poured herself a fresh cup of hot coffee. She walked over to the window that over looked the veranda, and drank in the beauty of the little elvish town. She looked up and down the street, until something caught her eye. It was a sign that read \"F'LORIN'S REPAIR and CURSE/MAGIC SPELL REMOVAL SHOP\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My arrows!\" she remembered. She buzzed around the bed, while taking off the nightgown Samada's mother lent her. When Beth opened the closet door, she saw clothes that weren't hers hanging in the place she had expected her own clothes to be hanging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to put on clothes that didn't belong to her without getting permission of the owner, but this was important. She needed to get to that shop! No time could be spared on formalities. She quickly got into the items that were neatly hung: light brown denim jeans, coral-color blouse that had long sleeves that she neatly rolled up to her elbows, a brown utility vest, black mid-calf boots, black leather belt with pouches of all shapes and sized fastened to it, and her pack of arrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a little awkward wearing these items. She walked over to the vanity in the middle of the room and took a look at herself. Upon looking at the sight, she quickly turned around and put her hands over her eyes. She looking like one of Robin Hood's freakin' Merry Men! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to grab the hair brush, making sure not to see her reflection, and brushed her hair so fast and hard that it hurt to the point of almost wincing. She set it down and rushed out of the house as quickly and quietly as possible. She didn't want to wake any of the hosts of the house up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned down the alley headed for \"F'Lorin's Shop\". She watches all the elves going about their daily chores, which she would have never seen in her home town this early in the morning. She came to the conclusion that their were more people up at seven in the morning here than in anywhere in the States.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled to all the elves that said good morning or smiled at her. It didn't take long for Beth to reach the shop. The outside looked like a normal adobe shop, decorated in an aray of hanging baskets of flowers. But that was nothing as compaired to the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth entered the shop and stood in the middle of the grand shop looking at all the things that sat on the shelves, in cases, hanging from the ceiling (or better floating in the air), and stacked neatly on counter tops. There were green bottles of Skinner's Slow Seeping Slime (which was garunteed to get rid of any pesky critters that may try to get into your house through drains or faucets), boxes of Winee'Sha's Wonder Working Wands, baskets of garlic neclaces and roseries (which promised no vampire would come within miles of you or your home), Elvan and Elvan Q-tips (garunteed to get even the pointies ears clean), swords for all occasions (for social engagements or for battle front warfare), books on every subject one could fathem, and other articles that Beth couldn't read due to the elvish writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help...,\" the shopkeeper stopped speaking as Beth turned and faced him. The old man stood with a hunched back, and ballanced himself with a rosewood cane. \"Ah, yes! Miss Beth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's mouth dropped. \"How did you know my name?\" she questioned. She had never seen this man before this very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrystal never lies. She see's all, and knows all. For, she told me just last night that you would be seeing me this very moring. You have stumbled onto some items. Very curious items...curious indeed. Follow me, for we shall help you to decide your destiny better in the presents of Chrystal.\" The old Elf turned and headed into a dark room, lit with two candles, which was the only light source of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth walked through the strings of beads that hung in the doorway and looked at her new surrounding. Beth didn't believe in any hocas pocas garbage, but then she never belied in pixies or elves either. what she did find odd in this place that was already odd to begin with, that F'Lorin and she were the only two persons in the room. \"Where is Chrystal?\" Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment F'Lorin removed the purple silk cover off of a clear ball. He sat down in a mohagany stained chair and pointed opposit him, suggesting to Beth to also take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth, this is my dear friend Chrystal. She and I have been together since the begining of the Evlish time.\" He closed his eyes as Beth sat down. The only sound was that of her breathing and the faint of breathing noise F'Lorin made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place the items on the table, but touch none of them with your bare hands.\" Sam did as instructed. The ball lit up with smoky blues, purples, and pinks. In acute flashes, Beth say Samada running as he shot arrows, Beth holding on for dear life on the edge of some rocky cliff with her feet dangling, other people and beasts unknown to her fighting, killing, beating, and crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nF'Lorin took a piece of smoking sweat grass and encircled the ball with it. Almost immediatly the ball changed to colors of orange, yellow, and green. With this new change came the change of the scenes inside the ball. Samada with his hand on Beth's cheek. Beth riding horses across the country side with what looked like a small army of Elves, Scourcers, and Witches. It appeard victory was just one on some great balltefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this mean? What are you showing me?\" she asked as F'Lorin circled the ball one more time and the ball went into grey and white mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means be careful of the arrows you use. You have come across the arrows of fait. Choose one, and you have saved the lives of us all.\" F'Lorin stood up and placed the purple silk cloth back onto the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I don't chose the right one?\" she pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then this will be the last you or I see each other. The time of the Woodland Elves will come to a deadly end and life as you and I know it will no longer be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What bout the last grey and white smoke? What did that mean? does it mean anything at all?\" she implored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the fog of uncertanty. You will come across an item that will either be of extreem god or extreem evil. Only you will be able to decide what to do with it and its powers. If you don't hold onto it, or someone else finds it before you, all is lost.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You step backwards trying to distance yourself from this unnatural shadow creature. You stumble, you fall. Hitting the hard forrest ground you graze your palms.

What else is there to do, save cry? Laughing feels good, it staves off the fear and you breathe in big deep breaths of fresh forrest air.

You move onto your knees and crawl cautiously towards it, not trusting your legs to walk just yet. You reach out to touch it and your hand moves through it like smoke. I wonder... you pool your new found shadow powers into your hands and reach out again. This time your hand connects with something solid. You run your hand over the creatures head and it shudders, yet rubs its head harder against your hand like a happy purring cat.

Derin introduces you to his scouting band, although you'll never remember all their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost wordlessly the group turns south and begins making it's way through the forest.  The other elves move so silently, you cringe inwardly imagining that you'll soon be embarrassing yourself by crashing through the bushes like an drunken orc.  Surprisingly enough you make little if any noise at all.  You seem to . . .remember (is that the word?). . . just how to place your feet, and where to step.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that the scouting party (yourself included) moves faster through dense brush, than you used to move on an empty sidewalk.  The party stops once at about noon to drink from cold, clear stream and nourish themselves from some flat cakes they carried in their packs.  The other elves generously shared their food, and upon tasting some you found it rapidly refreshed your tired limbs and renewed your strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just around dusk in the forest and Derin made the announcement that you were almost there.  Soon the forest stopped getting darker and there seemed to be a bluish, green illumination coming from up ahead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if of it's own accord the underbrush vanished, and the trees pulled back off the trail.  You looked down a gentle slope onto a beautiful city sprouting up between two hills, surrounded by forest.  There are lite blue, white and green glowing globes lining the streets, and  many of the homes appeared to be made in living trees.  There are two or three streams and bridges bisecting the city, and several fountains sprayed water into the air.  The misty spray from the fountains gave everything a fresh, morning dew apperance, but also gave it a surreal feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look at the clock: 7:45am. Rubbing your eyes you rise. As you slip on your warm fuzzy slippers, you realize you are in your elven clothing. Confused, you look in the mirror, but appear \"normal,\" except for the clothes. You grab your soft pink and green plaid robe and cover your strange clothing.<br>\r\nShuffling out your bedroom door, the house is quiet and you are alone. Walking into the kitchen you open the refridgerator. The light is blindingly bright inside and a burst of hot air hits you. Shocked, you slam the door shut quickly.<br>\r\nHearing a noise, you and spin around. It's the wizard!<br>\r\nHe stands there in your kitchen in his white flowing robe and magical staff. His beard stark white, eye brows protruding from his narrow face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"All I wanted was a glass of milk,\" you comment sarcastically, \"but instead I get a wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the end of his wand is a dark glass ball. He lowers it and you look closely. Inside you see a group of people in a circle, arguing. In the middle are large papers with sketches. Upon further inspection, it looks to be battle plans.<br>\r\nThe scene changes into dark elves, both beautiful and hideous at the same time, slitting the throats of the woodland elves. They have ambushed them in the forest. Orcs destroy the forest to fuel their fires for weapons: Horrible, terrbile weapons of steel and granite. A castle, black and twisted in the twilight, rises up. A dark cloud looms over it, and as it shoots a lightning bolt, a face is illuminated. A giant red goblin evily grins, lusting for blood. <br>\r\nYou are brought back to stare at the wizard, who then turns and directs your gaze to the living room. Hearing angry voices, you inch closer to see. It is the voices of your parents, and suddenly you are a young child again.<br>\r\nYou look around the corner just in time to see your father lob a punch, hitting your mom directly in the face. Blood spills from her nose and tears stream down her face. She turns to run, but he grabs her arm, jerking her back to him. His cruel expression is like a knife in your soul. Your watch and listen as your mom wails and begs for mercy. There is no mercy in his eyes and he gets ready to send another blow...<br>\r\nThen they are gone and you are looking at the wizard again. Tears flowing down your cheeks like rivers, you shake your head in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were young,\" says the wizard sympathetically.  \"It was a shame you saw those things. Even now, your only memory is in dreams, because your conscious mind refuses to remember such horrid times. That day you were taken by the state and soon adopted to live a normal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping a tear you ask, \"What became of my parents, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard continued, a sorrowful expression on his face. \"Your father killed your mother and then killed himself. No one had the courage to tell you the truth about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders shake uncontrollably as you sob.....and awake.</span></div></div>",

His emerald eyes laugh at you, drawing you immediately to him. The laugh lines around his eyes and mouth allude to the fact that he likes to laugh, and does it often. Here, you think, is another ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed with this knowledge, you turn at last to your rescuer, but you are unable to meet his gaze just yet. So you run your eyes over his atire and realize he is more formally dressed than yesterday. You suddenly feel dirty, grimy and self-concious. You rise in a hurry, mumbling some unintelligble excuse to excuse yourself from the table. As you rise, he rises with you a gesture of respect which makes you uncomfortable. You look at him to tell him directly that you do not deserve such an honor and find yourself drowning in his gorgeous blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sink into them, stuck by the depth of feeling you sense emanating from him. That new sixth sense comes into play and you suddenly realize that your rescuer is attracted to you. Enarmoured with you. Perhaps even, in love with you. Unconciously you smile at him, a smile made even more brillant and lovely by the fact that you are now an elven maiden. He smiles back at you and you found yourself breathless.

And so you turn to your friends, silently granting them your full trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I tell you, may we go somewhere less...crowded?\" You ask delicately, understanding that even as you do, you will undoubtly anger and insult some of the elves present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerial looks at you in surprise, then turns to Emerald Eyes. \"What do you think Ranor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The grove will do nicely.\" He says and you all get up and leave.</span></div></div>",

You think back to earlier when he was challengeing Heero. He wasn't just any one. He wasn't even a normal Elven warrior which was honor enough. But a prince!! An Elven prince!! Wow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanor finally whips around and confronts you. \"How?\" He demands. He grabs you by the shirt color and flings you against a tree. The tough bark bites into your back and you twinge with the pain. You try to reach out to the tree to ask it to soften itself, but it is as tough and unyielding as stone. You understand that you have upset their master and the forest is no longer your friend. \"How can you know that! We have been so careful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire,\" Heero breaks in. \"look at her face. She is no traitor. She is not a spy either.\" He continues, answering the suspicion on Ranor's face. \"The dark elves know nothing of our plans. Besides she is not evil. The grove accepted her remember? It has never failed to spot a dark elf. Her heart is pure, no matter what her reasons for being here are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanor growls in your face for a moment and then releases you. Aerial looks from you to him and then to Heero.

You sit and watch in wonderment, understanding that some massive power struggle is going on. Aerial and Ranor in direct conflict about something, and Heero, well you aren't quite sure where Heero fits in. But you guess that he is the eyes and ears of Ranor. They've been up to something secret so perhaps that explains Heero's cool reception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerial breaks eye contact and says, \"Fine. I'll tell her then.\" Ranor opens his mouth to object, but something stops him. Aerial turns to you. \"I believe your story mistress. If you do not object, I would like to give you an Elven name.\" You are humbled by such an honor and know that you can not talk, so you nod and she continues. \"Thou shalt be known as Faereth Silverrose from this moment forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name fits you well and you are honored they have accepted you, mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am grateful to be intrusted with the honor of an elvin name.

They are just as strange to me as they are to you, and I am still searching for answers.  I have been sent here to help, and that is the most I can attempt to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bow yourself in their presence as a sign of humbleness and respect, now knowing who they are.

Farewell.\" With that, he gently but powerfully grabbed you and placed you over his shoulder, making sure to keep a sure grip on your legs as not to lat you fall. For your abductor, he was surprisingly polite.<br>\r\n\"So how are you milady? I do hope you aren't too uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n\"You certainly are gentlemanly for abducting me.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, there's no need to be sour. May as well make the best of the situation, don't you think?\"<br>\r\nYou answer with silence, and he can feel your body shift in irritation and a child-like pout creeps onto your face. <br>\r\nHe removes you from his shoulders and seats against a tree trunk. \"Now let's have a look at you, shall we?\" He stands back and studies you, as the slightest expression of admiration creeps into his eyes. \"You truly are a thing of beauty.\"<br>\r\nRefusing to make eye contact, you stare at the ground in a pout.<br>\r\n\"The princess is pouting?,\" he says as he kneels in front of you,\"Let me see your face.\" Swiftly but slowly, he cups your chin with his hand and brings your face up to his. Still in a pout, you stare down, but can only see his arm.<br>\r\n\"You are even more beautiful when you're not running from me. Now how could I get you to look at me, hm?\" Suddenly, he kisses your forehead. You quickly jerk your head up in shock and surprise. Suddenly, you find yourself staring at him.<br>\r\n\"Well hello there milady. Nice to finally see you're out of that awful pout.\"<br>\r\n\"That was a horrible trick!\"<br>\r\n\"I do apologize, but if you had simply looked at me in the first place I wouldn't have had to do that. Your eyes are exquisite.\"<br>\r\nYou realize that you have not seen yourself since the wizard transformed you.<br>\r\n\"Do you happen to have a mirror of some sort?\"<br>\r\nLance chuckles as his dark hair falls into his eyes. \"Do not worry, milady. We will soon be at our temporary living quarters.\" With that, you are, again, hoisted over his muscular body and continue your journey.</span></div></div>",

You now feel that it is safe for you to continue forward, and you only hope you will not have to encounter them again.<br>\r\nYou slowly stand up, still looking in the direction they left.  Taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly, you turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are 6 sharp and ready arrows pointed at you, aiming at every vital point of your body.

I was not certain I could fight them alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf nods as if he already knew that and motions to the others to lower their bows.

You and Zaron continue to walk forward, crossing over a wooden bridge that leads to the largest tree you have ever seen.

But I must do this alone.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaron smiles slightly and nods his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has chosen wisely yet again.\"  Zaron says before he smiles a little wider and walks toward the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand and wait and watch him walk away.  You turn as the door to the house of Mikia opens.  The door is a large wooden door with steel reinforcements.  The wood is smooth.  This house has not yet seen battle.  <br>\r\nYou step across the threshold and pause to allow your eyes to adjust to the dark but you are pleasantly surprised that you new eyes do not need to adjust.  <br>\r\nAcross the room is a large chair.  The chair is vacant but you can still see the seat slowly returning to its original shape as if someone has just left it.  You look around and notice no other items in this room except for the chair and a long colorful rug leading up to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing isn't it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to where the voice is coming from and from across the room and behind a pillar comes a tall figure.  Long hair that reaches down the back of his legs.  You see by the ears and eyes that he, too, is an elf.  His long robes flow ever so slightly as he walks toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"  you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your new eyes.  You did not have to wait for them to get used to the dark.  You will find all of your newfound abilities to be equally, if not more, amazing that that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  It did surprise me a bit.  Do you know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know you?  Your arrival has been foretold by the Elders of Old.  We are all expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him for just a moment.  By this time he has made his way to you and is standing but a distance away from you.  Part of you is still apprehensive about all this but his eyes are friendly and there are no weapons about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, my new friend.  Although no weapons made by man are around you must still be cautious.<br>\r\nNow, come, you must be hungry after that long trip.

She shall discover her abilities in due course.  The magician knows all.  That is why he chose her.\"<br>\r\nYou silently step and touch on the wood of the door.  Your hands begin to tingle once more, and you can feel as you are slowly enveloped by a secure blanket of wood.  The door seems to welcome you as you effortlessly become one with its being, and the tree that once was merges with the elven being that is.  You never have to break your concentration, still eavesdropping and becoming the wooden door.  Now, however, you can see.<br>\r\nZaron, his golden-white hair shining, is gesturing fluidly with the gracefulness adn ease of his speaking.  \"Yes, I know.  The magician knows all, sees all, is never wrong, always chooses and appoints...  I just am expressing my concern that she is not ready for this.  By all accounts, she hasn't even spent a full day in the incarnation of an elf!\"<br>\r\nYou see Mikia raise his hand in a gesture to calm or stop Zaron.  Strangely enough, Mikia's piercing gaze swivels and lands on the door--unmistakenly over you!  \"I agree with the magician if he believes she is ready.\"  Mikia gave a barely imperceptible nod of the head in acknowledgement, but you caught the movement.<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\nMikia's lips turn upwards in a grimace-like smile, and, in a way, almost rueful in the bittersweet, mocking way of the elves.  \"She seems to have discovered, of her powers, the ability to become one with elements and figures of nature.\"  He paused without breaking his gaze.  \"It is all right,\" he urges quietly to you.  \"Come forward.  This is more your decision than anyone else's.\"<br>\r\nAs easily as you entered the wood, you feel yourself leave, your form molding back into its soft, curving manifestation.  You seem to be able to sense a deep, strong emotion from Zaron, yet you are unsure as to what it is exactly.  \"Why have you been talking about me?\" you ask, trying to avoid Zaron's gaze.  You manage to catch it anyways: awe, admiration, a strong and connective bond...  There isn't much you can make of it.  \"If this concerns me, give me the decision to make myself.\"<br>\r\nMikia nodded, his eyes glowing.  He seems to realize Zaron's reaction.  \"Yes.  You are a perfectly capable elf.  That is why we wish to know: do you want to travel alone, or with a companion?\"  Mikia's stare is intent.  \"You are harnessing your abilities well, handling them--somewhat--appropriately.\"  The elf smiled again.  \"As you may have heard, Zaron has expressed his concern that you need a companion on your journeying.  The roads are hard and treacherous, especially where you must go to fulfill your task.  In your opinion, with best interests in mind, would you find it easier to complete your mission were I to send, say, for example, Zaron with you as a companion and equal?\"</span></div></div>",

You know the name is not what you were called before the wizard summoned you, but you can not remember any other name. You notice Zaron's eyes ever so slightly widen and shift from your eyes to your mouth.<br>\r\n\"Kaira...yes, that does make sense. Now, tell me, can you tell more about a person by listening to their voice than watching them?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you say shocked,\"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n\"Kaira means melody. Your voice and breath are very powerful and, listening is of great importance to you,\" Zaron said with great admiration in his voice. \"Take a look at the stream, now. Sing it a light melody.\"<br>\r\nIntrigued, you stand up and walk to the middle of the shallow stream, quietly humming as you do so. To your surprise, your clothes do not get wet. The water seems to form a pocket of air that follows you. when you get to the middle, you take a deep breath. Before you realize it, you hear your own voice flowing with the water. You're voice has never sounded this sweet ad strong. Ribbons of water connect with your finger tips and you will the water to form a dome around yourself. Your tone of voice shifts sightly and your hands do an intricate dance with the water ribbons. You watch in awe as the water trickles upward, around you. Soon, you realize that the water itself is singing back to you. Not vocally, but mentally. You let your instincts take control of yourself, and you somehow manage to keep your dome intact while walking back to Zaron.<br>\r\n\"Kaira...that was amazing,\" Zaron says, \"I had no idea you were that powerful.\"<br>\r\n\"Neither did I,\" you say,\" but I am glad we found out now while we have time to improve than when we really would need my skill, like in battle. Zaron, what is your talent? Do all elves have a special talent?\"<br>\r\n\"Not all elves have talents, no. Some are generic, just here to survive and help others survive. I have a very developed feeling sense. I can tell when people are lying by their heartbeats, which i feel though the ground they're standing on. That is why I was so concerned with your safety, because I could sense your nervousness and agitation. By the way, I am truly sorry we frightened you earlier.\" <br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a very delicate and stealthy footstep about 2 miles to the east, and you can tell my the change in Zaron's expression that he senses it too.<br>\r\n\"Zaron, can you tell what it is?\"<br>\r\n\"I am not sure yet, but I am almost positive it is an elf. Listen to the trees and grass around them. Can you decipher any of the noises?\"<br>\r\n\"Let me try.\"<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and focus all of your energy on the strange footsteps. They are delicate, but not as dainty as a female's, so it must be a man. The forest seems to hum and glow where ever his feet touch earth, so he can not be a evil elf. You relay this information to Zaron.<br>\r\nHis expression becomes puzzled, then he gasps.<br>\r\n\"Kaira, we must hurry!\"</span></div></div>",

You never lost your footing, swerving from side to side through the trees. You took a moment to turn to Zaron and frowned at the worry in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Zaron! I sense no evil from him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never will.\" Zaron announced seriously and narrowed his eyes. \"This man is not evil but he is not an elf! I am unsure of what his intentions are, he is unpredictable!\" Your eyes widen, for if he was not an elf what was he? Focusing on the task at hand you listened to the land and trees to try and locate the being. You concentrated on the rough lull of the trees on gasped at their worried shouts. <i>Look out, Look out! He is nearing!</i> \"Zaro-\" You called out quickly before being knocked to the ground by a green blur, and skidded across the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaira!\" Zaron shouted, leaping to your side in an instant. Whispering a quick incantation, Zaron pulled out wooden lance made of many intertwined branches, it hummed with power and rattled the air surrounding it. You gapped in awe at the power you felt humming from the weapon, before shaking your head and standing up instinctively readying your bow and arrows. You set your back against Zarons, the both of you keeping vigilant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zaron, my good friend! Why must you be so serious?\" A deep voice echoed threw the woods, chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaron glared out of the clearing with a grimace. \"We are NOT friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, don't be so harsh! Don't tell me your STILL angry with me?\" The voice spoke good naturedly, suddenly very close to you. You quickly whipped around firing an arrow at the source only to have missed by a millimeter and the bow knocked from her hands. You gasped as you were slammed into a tree a large hand gripping your face, you yelped and kicked at the attacker as you tried to gather your wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh? Who's this pretty miss? She actually managed to nick me......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release her immediately Dalio!\" Zaron demanded calmly. You wince as you felt the grip on your face tighten, breathing deeply you calmed yourself and sunk into the tree finally etting a good look at your attacker. He stood an inch taller than Zaron, with deep green eyes and a wild brown mane that spiked back. He was slightly menacing with sharp teeth and dark ruin marks etched into his arms and chest. The only clothing he seemed to have was a pair of dark green pants. You shivered slightly as his eyes lit up with interest. \"Oh? I can do that to!\" He announced reaching into the tree but was knocked away with a fierce blow to gut from the end of Zaron's lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough Dalio! Why are you here? Come to destroy even more elven lives?\" Zaron said grimly, as you exited the tree warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalio sighed in an exasperated manner. \"That was an accident-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call recklessly abusing your powers and ending hundreds of innocents an accident?\" Zaron interrupted coldly. Dalio paused for a moment as if to rebuke him but stopped and shrugged. \"What can I say? Us sprites like to live o the wild side.\" You stared at the being in disbelief , how could he brush off such serious inquiry so insensitively....and yet the forest was just as accepting to him as it was for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway I haven't come this far to cause any....mischief right now. I'm hear to join you on your way to the traveler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Zaron questioned in disbelief. You stared at the sprite unsurely....maybe...if he were to come.</span></div></div>",

It seems like a small meal for such a large group (there are seven of them, and only one hobbit or dwarf on the spit), and they will probably still be looking hungrily for more after they finish.  <br>\r\nAs you cautiously, quietly climb down the tree, their ugly, greedy faces assault your mind.  Now what will you do?<br>\r\n1.  Take the other path<br>\r\n2.  Leave the path to look for a way around the creatures.</span></div></div>",

A chill wind causes you to shiver abrubtly as, simultaneously, the feeling of the creatures' nearness fades away.  But it is a relatively still, clear day...  No matter.  You travel on, enjoying the slight, growing warmth of the early day.  It occurs to you that you are heading South, on the way to the Rivers of Dan.  This path simply seems altogether more peaceful and removed from the kind of troubles you have just witnessed.  You travel, unhindered, for several days before experiencing a new, even more pleasant, sensation, one that is strangely familiar to you, even though you would swear you have never been in this part of the forest, in this forest, or even in this world before.  You slowly come to realize that you are in the vicinity of your own kind now, the good Elves.<br>\r\nAnd in direct answer to your thoughts, you hear a sweet melody rise and spread around you, like a thousand crickets taking up a beautiful chorus.  You recognize it as a song of welcome.  You have come home.  As you travel, you begin to spot strangely familiar elements.  But how...?  As your steps slow, your thoughts, along with your heartbeat, speed up.  You have been here before.  You have come home indeed.  Around you the melody changes; words take shape; the words are of home, family.  <br>\r\nFriendly forms materialize before you.  As they approach, you recognize... your brother...  your little sister... your parents... your grandparents!??!!<br>\r\n\"Leuci!  Welcome home!\"  calls your brother, \"Where have you been?  Are you well?  Come, tell us all that has happened to you in the past weeks, and we will tell you what news we know!\"<br>\r\nThe speed of your steps doubles, triples.  You first run to your brother, then hug him tightly as he whirls you around him, then you pick up your sister in the same fashion.  And you cover your elderly parents and ancient(?) grandparents in kisses as they laugh with pleasure and express there relief to see that you are okay.<br>\r\n\"When you left us, you could only say that you needed to find news of the trouble about, and it would be safest for you to go alone.  We learned long ago not to argue with you when you have that tone in your voice, that look in your eyes.\"<br>\r\nThis evokes from you an involuntary laugh.<br>\r\n\"Well, come, let us talk in the comfortable shade of our lovely home!  The sun will soon be high and it will grow even warmer,\" says your brother.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You all walk together up the forest path, enjoying each others' company and the forest and the early day sun.  When you reach the palace, you are awestruck.  Nowhere before, not even in your strange, secret memory can you recall a dwelling of such beauty and grace.  There are high towers that are not made of stone or metal, but if they are made of wood, they seem to be carved within the very large, living trees, even as they continue to grow straight up from the ground.  The rest of the dwelling seems to be made of living things, too, for its presence does not appear to disrupt its natural surroundings, but rather to fit right in.  Its colors are those of its surroundings, shades of green, blue, brown, red, and orange, and combinations thereof.  The central structure is smooth--it has the look of a home (a very nice, very spacious home) within a hill, and with the dome or ceiling plucked of vegetation and with the earth patted smooth, painted with earth colors, and dried as if in a kiln, only the doorways and the windows reveal long leaves, which act to separate the interior from the outside.  Upon entering, you are further astounded by the patiently-carved and carefully-stained and colored furniture, covered with cushions and cloth just as painstakingly dyed, woven, and sewn, to make the place look nearly as if it were still growing in place somehow, and everywhere as comfortable as if one where resting on the finest down.<br>\r\nYour brother speaks first: \"I understand why you left.  The elves of the South are preparing to travel to The Empire of Light, to rally forces with the good wizards there and to turn back this evil army we have sensed gathering in the West.  Did you discover anything of their intentions?\"<br>\r\nYou sigh.  \"To be honest, Leuki, I don't recall ever leaving.\"  Then, after another deep breath, \"I don't even recall being an elf.\"<br>\r\nThis evokes looks of astonishment from all your family.  Then all at once they must return to their senses, because, at the same time, they all begin expressing their concern.  Finally, your father, Jemmah, breaks in authoritatively.  \"Now we cannot all talk at once!\"  Then to you:  \"Were you hurt?  Do you recall anything of your recent past days?\"<br>\r\n\"Very little,\" you say.  \"It seems as if I dreamt I was human, in an entirely different world, and in that world I went to sleep and awoke in this one again, but still as a human.  I encountered a wizard who returned me to my previous self and disappeared.  That was only this morning.  Since then I have only been, almost by chance, making my way here.  I know little more than I did when I left.\"<br>\r\nYour father, looking deeply thoughtful, says, \"It could be the work of The Dark King.  He may have discovered you while you were trying to gather information and sent you to that other world to forget about everything to get rid of you, since to kill you outright, as you are of noble birth, he deemed he would have to pay too high a price.\"<br>\r\nLeuki:  \"Then we must prepare to leave now!  It is essential that we know of The Dark Army's intentions!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, we will, my good son.  But for now let us welcome home our daughter who has returned from unrembered dangers and allow her to rest and heal any injuries she may have sustained, including that to her memories.\"<br>\r\nThey all begin talking at once again, this time with less surprise and more compassion in their voices.  You find, too, that even when they are not speaking with their mouths you can still hear their words faintly and feel their strong emotions.  <br>\r\nYour dreams that night are wondrous, filled with the loving faces of your family and friends and the enchanted beauty of the South woods.  Then the images grow dark, even horrific, as you see the faces of your enemies, goblins, orcs, Dark elves and evil humans, and your captor himself, The Dark King, a half-elf, half-human form, beautiful to behold from a distance in all his splendid attire and inherently strong figure, but terrifying up close.  He speaks to you in the dream, but you cannot hear his words.  You can only see him smiling as his face dissolves and your surroundings melt away.  You feel yourself falling, then you awaken with his words in your mind.  You rush out of bed to tell the others.<br>\r\n\"He has found a way to kill us!  The dwarves, the elves, all of us!\"<br>\r\nJemmah:  \"Go on, Daughter, but do try to catch your breath first!\"<br>\r\nAfter a breath, you continue, \"Before banishing me to that other world, The Dark King told me he had found an ancient elven sceptre.  One that enables the bearer to literally capture the soul of any being, and, although it was designed to save lives, it will destroy those souls captured if the sceptre itself is destroyed before those souls that are captured have been returned to the bodies of their owners.\"<br>\r\n\"The Crystal Staff of the Wise Elves!\" blurts Grandfather.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, father?\" says Jemmah.<br>\r\n\"It was a legend told to my as a child.  My mother and father told me later it was just a myth, but it does exist!  And The Dark King must have found a way to retrieve it from its vault!  We must inform The Wise Elves before he can reach it,  Jemmah, you and Leuki must come with me.  My dearest Wife and Daughter, I ask you to stay here to care for little Teakin.  Leuci, I invite you to join us, if you feel up to it.\"<br>\r\nYour heart is filled with an indescribable desire to stay with your mother, grandmother, and sister and spend warm moments reminiscing as the memories of your treasured past come back to you.  Still, your heart burns with the desire to fight alongside your brother and father, probably for the fate of the home you love and the world in which it exists.</span></div></div>",

They'll be fine,\" she says sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope so, but a shadow of fear grows in the back of your mind.  After a warm meal and bathe in the hot springs, you settle into the comforts of your bed, welcoming the sleep that came quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut deep in the night you are awaken by smoke.  Suffocating smoke, intense heat and the screams of your people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn confusion you crawl, yelling for your mother.  You managed to make it out of the burning house just before it collapses.  Fire is everywhere.  Elves are in panic mode, running in all directions.  The forest is ablaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call upon the clouds, as do many other elves.  The clouds force themselves to join together and rain down tears, eventually putting the blazes out.  You sift through the ashes and charred remains of houses, memories and many of the elves you love, including your mother and infant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA longtime friend of yours approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leuci,\" she says compassionately with tears flowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou embrace, grieving together.  \"We must seek revenge,\" you stammer through your tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge for what?  This blaze was an accident.  A mishap.  It was not intentionally set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  It was intentional, I know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leuci, you are just sorrowful.  The grief will eventually pass.  You must remain strong for the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run from your friend, refusing to believe the fire was an accident.  Running to your horse you find she is no where to be found.  The horses ran away when the fire started.  You scream in agony and pain as the extremeness of your grief hits full force.  Running to the hot springs, you immerse yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drown your sorrows in nature, your first love.  You drown yourself.</span></div></div>",

The bird that accompanied you earlier is still flitting at your side, though rather reluctantly. Suddenly, it begins to grow slightly, which, owing to your exceptional eyesight, you spot with ease. The bird begins to turn black and grows to the size of a raven. You feel most puzzled by this, until -<br>\r\nThe bird's beak, now a sharp sword, pierces into your brother's back.

You can only watch as your father revives Leuki and walks on, never noticing for a moment that you cannot follow.

With a quick flash he has struck you down and flies to finish the rest of your family off.

Careful you don't roast the bugger too long!  The last time you did the cooking, we ended up with four burnt elves and later only found two scrawny rabbits to share among us!\"<br>\r\n\"If you think you can do better, Grooler, why don't you shut that foul trap of yours and do it yourself?!\"<br>\r\n\"Arggh!

Anyway, we got 'em good, in the end.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we did, no thanks to you, DROOLER.\"<br>\r\n\"You know I hate it when you call me that!!\"<br>\r\nA fight ensues, and another, somewhat older, deeper voice speaks out.  \"Knock it off, you two.  We've got to save our energy for the road ahead.  We have a lot of travelling to do before we reach Scaarland, and this meal will not sustain us for long.  We must keep as quiet as we can, and stay on the move, always looking for food in the day and shelter before night falls.\"<br>\r\nThe fighting quiets while the voice is speaking, and then starts up again. This time quite severely, like a parently scolding her misbehaving children:   \"I said, 'Knock it off!'\"<br>\r\nThis time the fighting immediately stops, and some unintelligible grumbling between the two begins.<br>\r\n(Scaarland, you think to yourself, where could that be, and what sort of evil is brewing there?)<br>\r\nAs if the other half of your mind is answering, another thought suddenly occurs to you:  (Scaarland is to the Northwest.  The inhabitants there are forming an alliance with all the evil creatures of the forest, and plan eventually to move their growing army into The Dark Castle, from which point they will begin their attack on the forest, furthering their quest to convert all its creatures to their control, along with all of its resources, good and evil.)<br>\r\nThese thoughts do not bring you comforting news to carry with you to the north, where you hoped eventually to go.  Although perhaps this would not be news to the inhabitants of the South at all.  You are, after all, a newcomer to the forest, and what is news to you may be common knowledge to others here.  Still, you can't know anything for sure until you check it out further. <br>\r\nWill you head on to the South, to rally the forces of good to fight the growing army of evil to the Northwest?<br>\r\nOr will you try to find more immediate help, and stop these monsters before they can rally some help of their own against others on your side?</span></div></div>",

The morning light is streaming in through your mini blinds. Looking at the clock you realize it is 7:45am. Rubbing your eyes you arise. <br>\r\nShuffling out your bedroom door, the house is quiet and you are alone. Walking into the kitchen you open the refridgerator and are surprised by a blinding bright light and a burst of hot air. You quickly slam the door shut.<br>\r\nHearing a noise from behind, you spin around. It's the wizard who brought you to the forest!<br>\r\nHe stands there in your kitchen in his white flowing robe holding his magical staff. His beard stark white, eye brows protruding from his narrow face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I wanted was a glass of milk,\" you think outloud, \"but instead I get the wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the end of his wand is a dark glass ball. He lowers it as you look closely. Inside you see a group of people in a circle, arguing. In the middle are large papers with sketches. Upon further inspection, it looks to be battle plans. The scene changes as dark elves, both beautiful and hideous at the same time, slit the throats of the woodland elves. They have ambushed them in the forest. Orcs are destroying the forest to fuel their fires for weapons: horrible, terrbile weapons of steel and granite. Ugly, evil goblins attack dwarves in the mountins, slaughtering entire families. Then a castle, black and twisted in the twilight, appears. A dark cloud looms over it and it shoots a lightning bolt, illuminating the face of a giant red goblin. He grins evily, lusting for blood. <br>\r\nYou pull back and stare at the wizard, who then turns and directs your gaze to the living room. Hearing angry voices, you inch closer to see. It is the voices of your father and mother, and suddenly you are a young child again.<br>\r\nYou look around the corner just in time to see your father lob a punch, hitting your mother directly in the face. Blood spills from her nose and runs down her white blouse. Your mother tries to defend herself, but your father has grabbed something in his coat. His cruel expression is like a knife in your soul. You watch and listen as your mother begs for mercy. There is no mercy in his father's eyes or the cold blue steel. Time freezes as you hear a loud bang...<br>\r\nIn an instant they are gone and you are looking at the wizard again. Tears well up in your eyes as you shake your head in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were young,\" says the wizard softly. \"It was a shame you saw those things. Even now, your only memory is in dreams, because your conscious mind refuses to remember such horrid times. Your father turned the gun on himself, and you were taken by the state, and soon adopted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping a tear you ask, \"Why did he do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard continued, a sorrowful expression on his face. \"Who can say for certain?  But you can rise above all of this, and gain justice.  You will not only help others, you will help yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I told you, you would not understand.

I may have seen the future, although I'm not certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand how they connect?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not really sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding you some herbal tea, Nywinda explains, \"The things you saw in this realm were the past, present, and potential future if we do not win this war. The things you saw in your life are true and the reason you have been chosen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSipping the warm tea you say, \"I don't understand. What does that have to do with me coming here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have not dealt with the tradgedy life has handed you. Things that are not dealt with refuse to be ignored. You harbor an intense desire to see justice served and peace reign. But you will never find peace until you face the turmoil that came to you so early in life. This world, this realm; this is your chance to face the ugliness and hatred and turn it around, serving justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I face these things here, that does nothing for the world I have to return to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary,\" Nywinda continues, \"You will find that things will change if you suceed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't bring my parents back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNywinda's eyes speak to your soul. Not in words, but a feeling deep inside. Somehow you understand that this quest you have been chosen for is worthwhile. If you accomplish it, things in your world will come together. The need to fulfill this mission is now burning in your soul like a blazing fire. You must finish this. It is your destiny and your world. It is your life if you do not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Nywinda breaks the tension, \"A feast has been prepared.  I have set aside some garments for your use.  If you choose, I could escort you down when you are ready.  You may also go alone.  The banquet room is at the end of the hallway.  You won't miss it. </span></div></div>",

You can feel the rise of person's chest holding you, as he breaths deeply.<br>\r\nBut over the \"noise\" of your own heartbeat, you can hear footsteps.  The footsteps of the cloaked riders inside the other room, that sound like sledge hammers pounding in your ears.  Seconds seem like minutes as the tension and anxiety build, awaiting their entrance into the room you are in.<br>\r\nSuddenly the door is shoved open, again scraping loudly against the splintery wooden floor.  What happens next is a blur.  The light from the broken out window is blocked as a figure appears, fires an arrow and disappears as quick as a blink.  The effects of the arrow are longer lasting, as the first cloaked rider falls instantly with a horrific scream that chills you to the bone.  Your body jerks as you cringe in fear and horror at the blood that is now spilling over the floor like a small river.  You manage to hold your scream, not vocalizing it.<br>\r\nThe second rider has his sword drawn, but hardly has time to react as the window again is shadowed by a figure with a bow.  The arrow is fired quickly and sharply, and you are amazed at the incredible marksmanship as the arrow flies straight into the hood of the cloaked one.  This one had no scream, but fell back in deathly silence.<br>\r\nThe arms around you are released as you are nudged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quickly, out the window before more of them appear,\" the voice commands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, you go for the window, not even looking upon the one to whom the voice belongs.  The window is small, but plenty big for your slender and nimble body and you slip through it with ease. <br>\r\nOutside, there are two strong white horses.  Upon one sits an elven rider, clothed much like you with a bow slung across his back.  He is holding the reins of the other horse who is currently without rider.<br>\r\nBefore you realize what is going on, familiar arms are around you again, lifting you up on the second horse.  And again, the arms are around you a third time, as the elf they belong to mounts up behind you.<br>\r\nIn seconds both horses are off, leaving the shack to the dead horsemen, and the future to you.</span></div></div>",

Their intentions were not to kill you, but capture you.

His beard stark white, eye brows protruding from his narrow face.  <br>\r\nAll you wanted was a glass of milk, but instead you get the wizard.  <br>\r\nOn the end of his wand is a dark glass ball.  He lowers it and you look closely.  Inside you see a group of people in a circle, arguing.  In the middle are large papers with sketches.  Upon further inspection, it looks to be battle plans.  The scene changes as you see dark elves, both beautiful and hideous at the same time, slitting the throats of the woodland elves.  They have ambushed them in the forest.  You see orcs destroying the forest to fuel their fires for weapons.  Horrible, terrbile weapons of steel and granite.  You see a castle, black and twisted in the twilight.  A dark cloud looms over it and as it shoots a lightning bolt a face is illuminated.  A giant red goblin evily grins, lusting for blood.  <br>\r\nYou are brought back to stare at the wizard, who then turns and direct your gaze to the living room.  You hear angry voices and inch closer to see.  It is the voices of your parents, and suddenly you are a young child again.<br>\r\nYou look around the corner just in time to see your father lob a punch, hitting your mom directly in the face.  Blood spills from her nose and tears stream down her face.  She turns to run, but grabs her arm, jerking her back to him.  His cruel expression is like a knife in your soul.  Your watch and listen as your mom wails and begs for mercy.  There is no mercy in his eyes and he gets ready to send another blow...<br>\r\nThen they are gone and you are looking at the wizard again.  Tears are flowing down your cheeks like rivers.  You shake your head in disbelief. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You were young.  It was a shame you saw those things.  Even now, your only memory is in dreams, because your conscious mind refuses to remember such horrid times.  That day you were taken by the state and soon adopted to live a normal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping a tear you ask, \"What became of my parents, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard continued, a sorrowful expression on his face.  \"Your father killed your mother and then killed himself.  No one had the courage to tell you the truth about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders shake uncontrollably as you sob.....and awake.</span></div></div>",

You sit up, but here you are, in Dora Moore, in the forest that is who knows where.  The dream was very disturbing, and you wish to think of it no more.<br>\r\nYou find elven garments hanging in the cabinet.  Choosing a long and flowing dress, you press the fine soft material against your face.  It smells of the spring roses.  Slipping it on, you look in a mirror that stands in the corner of the room.  The dress is stunning and flattering; white and blue, with silver laces in the front.  <br>\r\nYour hair is long and straight; a deep auburn,  with strands of blonde, kissed by the sun.  Your eyes are like emeralds that shine brightly.  Your cheeks are flushed, lips full, and ears pointed!  Your skin is fair and smooth, like porcelin.  <br>\r\nWalking to a small table you pick up a brush, running it through your shiny hair.  Using the silver cords on the table, you entertwine them in braids that flow down your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like a princess,\" you gleem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnock. Knock. Knock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sherri, it is I, Deren.  Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Deren is dressed differently, in long flowing garments of blue and gold.  His hair is adorned with braids that entertwine with golden cords.  He is absolutely incredible to behold.  His smile is radiant as he looks upon you.  Bowing slightly he stretches forth his hand.<br>\r\nYou oblige, taking his hand, and he leads you out of the house, down a path through the village and into a courtyard.  There is a huge banquet spread, and many others are there.  <br>\r\nTwo chairs are pulled out for you - one by Deren.  The other is by an elf you have not yet met.  He has dark brown hair and chocolate brown eyes.  He is very handsome and there is a glint of familiararity in his eyes.<br>\r\nYou have a choice of where to sit.</span></div></div>",

No harm done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food is exquisite, exotic fruits and vegetables adorn the finely covered tables.  Flavor burst forth with each scrumptious bite of fruit.  The juice of a tangerine escapes your mouth and trickles down your chin.  Before you can pick up your napkin, Deren has done it for you, gently wiping the juice away.  He smiles and you laugh, as he reaches to fill your glass with wine.  His glance and touch made you tremble inside for a moment.  You hope you did not blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main course arrived, deliciously prepared.  A souffle made of vegetables; one of the best meals you have had the pleasure of tasting.  Desert was better, but you hardly noticed.  Deren refills your glass every time it is emptied, and the elven wine is stronger that what you are accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice at the head of the table does catch your attention, as he welcomes the many newcomers to the village.<br>\r\n\"We have come together tonight to celebrate the dawning of a new age.  Soon two realms will collide and fight together, ultimately saving both.  We will be victorious!  Tonight we  celebrate the presence of our new found friends  who are our honored guests and companions.  Let the celebration begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud cheer arose from the elves as they got up from their seats.  Flutes, drums and strings began to produce a lively melody, from the nimble-fingered elves that played them.  You notice the stranger who had pulled a chair for you earlier.  He is standing close to the edge of the shadows, watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and Deren is standing, offering his hand.</span></div></div>",

This continues through several people until you are back in Deren's arms.  By now you are dizzy and having the time of your life.  Deren is laughing, and the music begins to slow.<br>\r\nLooking around, you notice many of the elves have left.  Some have gone inside to tell stories by the fire.

It's spilling all over the place.And I'm sorry that you have to face this too.\" His tone told you he was genuine and so you followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When you got to the trees he pushed you slightly ahead. Without thinking about where you were going you followed a path you had walked hundreds of times.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  After a couple of minutes you stopped at the edge of a clearing. In front of you were three grave stones.One was much newer than the other two,but it had still been there a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Gently,the wizard pushed you forward. As if it had a will of it's own you raise your hand to touch the first stone. You aren't crying so hard now,but the tears are still flowing freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You go round to the other side of the stones and kneel so that you can see all three of them.\"Why does it still hurt so much?\"Your voice is cracked with emotion and barely above a whisper,but in the stillness he hears you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"These are the people who made you . . .\" He paused,\"No,allowed you to grow into the person you are today.No matter what happens to you they will always hold a place in your heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Not knowing what to say you just nod and quietly cry over the graves of your mother,father and husband.  </span></div></div>",

Please sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you resume your seat unwilling, for you wish to understand what just happened, the King finishes your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The woman hadn't known she was going to die. She had made plans, however, in case something like that happened. She'd arranged in her will, that you would go and live with a friend of hers that she trusted. The court allowed it and you were moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were to young to remember what had happened or so it was thought. They never told you of your 'real' parents, they just let you think the people you live with now are your parents. They felt it would be to traumatic for you to know the true story. And it seemed that what they had assumed was true. You were a normal, healthy, well-adjusted child. Except for the nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether you realize it or not, Sharaya, those nightmares have helped you. They've helped you to grow into a person of strength and courage. They've helped prepare you for the terrible task that you are about to face. They've prepared you for the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The future?

You were so lost and confused, you needed the strength and understanding you knew he would give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must lead the battle, Sharaya. If any but you command it, the cause is lost. You will face dangers and fears just as dark and horrible as your nightmares were and worse. You must have the strength to overcome, or all will perish.\" Mikia's voice was different, deeper. You noticed the change in his eyes. It was almost as if the wizard were... But as soon as it appeared, the look vanished. Mikia's eyes lightened and he smiled. \"I don't know where that came from. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding partly what you were to do and why you were chosen, you said, \"Don't worry about it. Let's go back to the party.\"</span></div></div>",

The scroll - you will be a messenger and confidant to our allies in the North.  Both roles are vital and will gain you great respect and honor.  But they will hold very different endings, of which I cannot say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikia steps away from the pool, looking into the night.

Sit here for a few minutes and I will go get them. I advise you do not tell them you might take one of them on your quest as they will turn it into a competition.\" Deren smiles at you, turns and swiftly moves into the throng of people soon disappearing into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before he reappears. He is accompanied by two people one is a female elf who is tall, blond and willowy. The other is a squat ...person who is the stereotypical, fairytale picture of a dwarf. Broad strong shoulders, red hair and a bushy red beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my sister Deanna.\" Deren began, and the small knot of jealousy that you hadn't even realized was there unraveled. \"This fellow is my very good friend Thatch. We call him Thatch because it's a superstition among the dwarves that it's unlucky to reveal your true name, and when he came to us for sanctuary, he earned his way thatching our roofs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obviously weren't very good at hiding your confusion, for Thatch leaped up to sit next to you on the fountain rim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my homeland there are very few of us who are on your side. The other side pays better.\" He laughed, a rich but gravelly sound. \"When I became too vocal in my views of my neighbors I was..\" he cleared his throat \"..encouraged to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeren picked up the dwarves tale. \"He came here to see if he could help at all and to escape from his disgruntled neighbors.\" He smiled fondly at the dwarf. \"Dwarves live as long as elves so we have known each other for quite a few years now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush brother,\" Deanna interjected, \"you talk too much!\" Her voice was as soft as you had imagined and as smooth as honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already had a good feeling about them both.    </span></div></div>",

Although you have only been an elf for a short while, and have known the people here but a few days, through your connection to nature you feel a close kinship with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and rise to your feet. \"Is there somewhere we could go to eat and talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerren and Deanna exchange a very brief look and both nod. Almost in perfect synchranisation they turn to walk away and beckon for you to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThatch laughs and you look down as he summesaults of the fountain and delicatly lands. He raises an eyebrow at you then winks. \"Let me guess, you thought because I'm short I'd be awkward?\" You nod. He smiles again, \"Lets catch up with the twins shall we!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock registers on your face and he laughs even more heartily. \"Oh my, you are so easy to suprise!\" Then he turns and cartwheels after the two elves leaving you staring after.<br>\r\nWith a shake of your head you run after the small group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stop outside the building Mikial took you to your first night here. \"Lets go in and eat shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThatch starts to laugh again which makes you kind of grumpy, then you realize its you he's laughing at and blush. \"He didn't tell you he was a twin to the beautiful Deanna, and he didn't tell you Mikial was his father either.\" Thatch shook his head and clapped Deren on the back still laughing. \"My friend I think you have a few explanations to make.\" Then he strolled through the front door with Deanna close behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Deren turns to you, you cross your arms across your chest and tilt your chin up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't think of it. Every one here knows so I just..\" He begins, but you cut in. \"You called him \"My King\"! \".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In public he is always my king, at home he is Father. I guess I should've made sure you knew.\" He gently takes your hand and as he looks into your eyes its easy to forgive him. You smile to let him know its alright and he leads you into his family home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were sorting things outside, Deanna and Thatch had prepared some fruits, meats and juices. You all sit and talk in generalities for a while, but your decision niggles at the back of your mind. You can stand it no longer and blurt out your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are your powers?\" Realizing how rude it probably was to just say it like that you look at the table. \"I I I mean, uh, Deren told me you both do fire and light, but he's not very good at telling me the whole story and...\" You trail off in embaressment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly it was Deren who answered, \"Let me begin. I am Deren of the house of Vale, from the elven village of Dora Moore. We are the woodland elves of this region, protectors of the forest. My Father is King of this region, Mikial of the house of Vale. I have a twin sister who is the heir to the throne as the elder of us.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIf his face had not been completly serious you would have laughed at him. Then Deanna rose. \"Welcome Sherri of the house of Waters, welcome. I am Deanna, daughter of the house of the Vale, ruling house here in Dora Moore.\" She sat down and smiled at you. \"As my brother has told you, both Thatch and I have certain skill with fire and light. I also have the gift of sharing. I can, for want of a better word, dredge the minds of people around me for their thoughts, I can also tell truth from lies up to a point. This gift is somewhat inaccurate because if the person who says a thing completly believes what they say it appears as truth even if I know otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeren cleared his throat. \"Whats wrong brother? Are you worried that I might tell tales?\" Deanna smiled fondly at her brother and they shared another look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can also communicate with each other accross long distances, mind to mind.\" Deren takes a breath and then looks sharply at his sister. \"Sometimes I wish we couldn't because it means she can scald me no matter where I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to thatch. \"How about you? What do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sherri that'd be telling.\" He winks at you and then vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..where di ..how did...\" Then you hear him chuckling from the spot he was when he vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReappearing with a cheeky grin on his face he takes a sip of his juice. \"I bend light so that I seem invisible. I can also find things.\" He shrugs. \"If you lose something then come to me. There isn't anything I haven't managed to find yet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is helpful. You have one more day before you must leave but you still feel you must make your party four. \"I was wondering if either of you might be able to suggest any one who might be useful to me on this trip?\" You ask tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeanna answers very quickly, but you aren't suprised. You suspect she has some of her fathers skill in future sight too. <br>\r\n\"I think you will need our friend Thatch with you. I will remain here so that you can keep in touch with Father and I. I also think I know who you should take but I don't think Thatch will like it much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I get on with every one.\" He said indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flora.\" Was all that Deanna said but it was obvious that Thatch was not happy with the suggestion. Once he had finished ranting Deanna continued. \"She has a great skill in healing and can talk to animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thatch and Flora have an unrequited love for each other, but it's very frowned upon for cross people relationships.\" Deren explained. \"She would however be perfect.\" <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

There was an angry noise and the chair that Thatch had just disapeard from shot backwards and you heard Thatch muttering as he walked past you out the door. You looked inquisitively at Deren.<br>\r\n\"Animals aren't fooled by Thatch's gift, they see where his aura is and can see change in the natural flow of light, Flora who can talk to the animals would be notified if Thatch walked in with us. But he wanted to come to see our meeting without her knowing.\" Deren filled you in, and with that You Deren and Deanna set of to the stables in the center of the village. They were huge communal stables that smelt strongly of sweet new hay and apples. They took up the entire centre of the village and everywhere you looked there were groups of Elves taking horses out to ride or hunt, mucking out, or feeding their horse. There must have been a horse for every Elf in Dara Moore stabled here, all peering doefully over the tops of half stable doors. Pleasently interested in all around them. As you walked down the corridor a feeling of comfort fell over you, though you had never riden horses before you seemed to recognise this place..<br>\r\n\"Flora!\" called Deanna. Your head shot up and before you saw an elf, much shorter than Deren and Deanna or indeed any of the elves you had seen in Dara Moore last night. Though she would still tower over Thatch. She looked over her shoulder as she was at present feeding a sugar lump to a horse and grinned.<br>\r\n\"Deanna, Deren, and Sherri. I knew you would be coming.\" Her voice was light, and familiar like a soft breeze of hilltop air calling through spring flowers. She walked over, but float may be a better word, seeming hardly to touch the floor - merely thinking herself before us and arriving she danced across the floorboards as though they were cushions.<br>\r\nShe hugged you, Deanna, and Deren and stared up intently with wide eyes that had no colour that you could grasp, merely depth and merging deep colours of the earth.<br>\r\n\"How did you know my name?\" You ask awkwardly, slightly bemused by the friendliness of the strange elf.<br>\r\n\"Straight from the horses mouth!\" she giggled and winked, tilting her head towards the stable doors. \"There are no secrets from me dear Sherri, I promice, should you chose to take me I will serve you in every way possible. Be it healing or knowing. I can see your heart is pure.\" She bowed slightly, her voice was serious but still the endearing smile did not leave her face, and still her eyes stared intent, as though probing the very depths of your mind. You were completely at a loss for words.<br>\r\n\"You're confusing her Flora, remember she is new to this realm.\" They exchanged a glance and you wished everybody would stop doing that!<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry dear one. I am Flora, of the house of Kalen, I am a wise elf from The Rivers of Dan.\" She bent her head but kept her eyes intently on your own.<br>\r\n\"The horse to your left shall be loyal to you if you would like her.\" she nodded knowingly and added \"Her name is Kai\"<br>\r\nYou look to your left and saw a tall, towering horse. Elf size you realised, also acknowledging how tall you now were in this form. She was mainly brown, but had white hooves and a white stripe down her nose which was leaning over the side of her stable towards you, dark and intelligent eyes waiting for your appraisal.<br>\r\n\"Hello Kai.\" you found yourself saying.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You gently run your fingers through her mane and pet the cute white stripe running down her nose. It gave added a mischievous edge to her endearing brown eyes.<br>\r\n\"I think you're right Flora\", you say while patting Kai on her back. You turn and see Flora give a deep nod of her head with a wide smile on her face, obviously pleased with herself. A thought occurs to you, and secretly smiling on the inside you stare at the ground with you palms facing the dark dirt.<br>\r\n\"Is she trained Flora?\" You don't look up to see but you hear the surprise and slight irritation in her voice as she answers.In the background Kai neighs softly in agitation.<br>\r\n\"I assure you Kai is one of the best horses for any venture you choose-\" The ground looks as if its trembling as grains of dirt pop and shuffle around, you feel a slight strain but push past it and cut Flora's speech off.<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to offend you or Kai Flora, I'm sure she's does very well on the occasional trip through the woods, but this is a very dangerous journey. A lot of lives depend on us and I want to cover all of my bases.\" The pressure you felt building within your body disappears as a tiny, delicate sprout breaks through the earth. There, you think, it's not so bad once you get use to it. And its true, you feel the nagging ache disappear as you mentally relax your mind and focus on the image in your mind. It didn't feel like you were making this happen on your own accord, more like you were a vessel for the magic to flow through you. Kai continued to grumble in the background, louder this time.<br>\r\n\"Sherri-\", Deren begins with an warning lacing the calm he was trying to project. You look up at him, Deanna, and Flora and wink, then you glance at the stalk that's been growing up to your thigh. They all stare at it in awe as the stalk widens and a vine spirals upward ending in a huge and delicate flower.  The colors looked like a mini sunrise exploding at your fingertips. The cool indigo blended in seamlessly with the warm purple and the tips looked like they were dipped in a rosy hue. Each petal had a pale, daffodil yellow stripe, the color of pure sunshine, running up the middle of it.<br>\r\n\"What is th-\", Deanna began still staring at the plant in wonder. You cut her off by clearing your throat, then you pluck the plant and shucking the layers of leaves off.<br>\r\n\"I mean I don't want a dud of a horse is all\", you say turning as Kai loudly neighed with indignation. You present the piece of elven sugar cane to her. She eyes it disdainfully and then nudges you none to gently with her nose, making you take a few steps back. She then turns and starts eating her hay without so much as a glance at you. You look at the other for some help. Deren and Deanna simultaneously shrug, an open look of confusion on their face. It was almost cute. You turn to Flora and she does the same but with a small smirk on her face. You go to Kai trying to pet her neck, she deftly sidesteps the gesture and faces the wall.<br>\r\n\"Aw come on girl, it was just a joke. I was trying to surprise you with a treat-\", you start but Kai interrupts you by quickly grabbing yours sleeve and pulling. You tumble against her unexpectedly, both of you arms wrap around her neck for support. Before you can figure out what's happening, Kai is gently nudging your neck with her wet, warm nose and neighing gently. The group behind you erupt with laughter and Flora finally manages to say \"See, a perfect match\". You giggle a little and then hold out the sugar cane for Kai to eat, she quickly finishes it. You then start braiding the flower through her mane, you hear Deren move closer to you. You can feel the warmth radiating from his hand as he's moments away from touching you. Suddenly Kai whips around, putting you behind her as she pushes Deren back with her nose. He falls to the ground and stares up in amazement as Kai paws the ground and then turns, giving him a full view of her tailend. Deanna and Flora both try to hide their amusement, failing miserably. After wiping the tears from her eyes Flora states, \"Kai is very protective of her lady, and formally requests that you uh, keep your distance.\" <br>\r\n\"Kai!\", you exclaim putting you hands around her neck and rubbing her back gently. She answers by playfully tugging on a tuft of your hair with her teeth. \"Don't try to sweet talk me sugar lips, you should apologize to Deren. He's a very good...friend\", you finish uncertainly. Deren looks up from briskly dusting himself off to shoot you a questioning look, you suddenly become very interested in the subtle highlights in Kai's mane. Kai paws the ground and neighs impatiently.<br>\r\n\"Er, Kai offers her sincerest apologies to, uh that's not a polite thing to call somebody Kai...\", Flora ended weakly. Kai whisked her tail at Deren, obviously brushing him off. Deren's face filled with blood as he raised his eyebrow and opened his mouth to say something.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that Kai just needs time to get used to you, Deren\" you interrupt trying to smooth things over. Deren closed his mouth but didn't look appeased. You turn your attention over to Flora.<br>\r\n\"Flora?\", you began uncertainly. You wanted to ask her about the relationship between her and Thatch, but you're not sure if it's the best thing to do. On one hand it would be better to get everything out in the open, you don't want any problems popping up when you're in a tight bind. On the other hand she's not exactly objective about this situation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In attempts to eavesdrop, you move only a small distance away from the arguing pair, but when Yurlie of Gatherelle and Freshnor of Laminere turn their bows on you once more and demand you stay back, you decide that staying alive is much more important than anything else. Unable to satiate your curiosity, however, you watch the two as the quiet debate unfolds. Nerat seemed quite outraged at Mourvern, and the latter seemed to get more and more on the defensive as it carried on. Well, this wasn't good. If Mourvern didn't win, what were you supposed to do? What was going to <i>happen</i> to you, really? Those bows didn't look friendly; execution on the spot seemed likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'How embarrassing is this?'</i> you ask yourself glumly, eyes shooting to the earth beneath your feet. <i>'That wizard guy must be shaking his head in shame for choosing me for this. I've already blown this whole \"chosen\" thing he had going sky high.'</i> When you look up again, Nerat and Mourvern are finished and walking over. The outcome was plain on their faces: They didn't buy it. Oh, fiddlesticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the darkness in you,\" Nerat accused, his eyes now slits as he took me in. \"I can sense it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you sense darkness when there's nothing there?\" you all but cry out in your defense. \"I'm not your enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's yet to be decided. You'll be coming to the village all right, but not as an honored guest.\" Was that a smile on Nerat's face? Oh, geez. This does not bode well. \"Tie her up. We'll take her to Malazair of Aleanrae; he should be able to find a proper use for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Who's Malazair? Hang on!\" you say in attempts of halting the process, but it is too late: Yurlie and Freshnor have you pinned. Vines snake around your body and bind your ankles, knees, wrists, elbows, and mouth. As Nerat hauls you over his shoulder, you can't help but grimace at how hopeless this has all become. <i>'\"Chosen one\" my foot.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yurlie, come with me. Freshnor, finish gathering food with Mourvern. We'll meet you at the village,\" Nerat orders. Before Mourvern turns away with Freshnor, he looks to you with sadness in his eyes. His voice echoes in your mind, and if it wasn't for the fact that his mouth didn't move and no one else reacted, you could have sworn he had simply said it while standing next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I tried. I'm sorry. I wish you the best.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as he vanished into the trees. Finally, you find a companion, and now he's gone. More importantly, however, your future is looking pretty bleak. This Malazair guy doesn't strike you as someone who will hear your story and heal your wounds... More of the \"bang bang smash smash\" type. It'll be a long walk to the village, so you...</span></div></div>",

Your shoes have been placed beside your bed, and you slip them on.  As you stand, you realize your clothing has changed.  You are now clothed in a long, flowing garment made of soft and smooth material.  You cannot quite place what material it is, but possibly a combination of silk and satin!  It is a beautiful gown of light blue and silver, not fancy, but well made, simplistic and elegant.  Your hair is down and flowing down your back, reaching nearly to your waist.<br>\r\nYou silently walk over to the door, but it is locked firm.  The window is very high, and you can see from the size of it, you would not fit through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the table, you pick up the mirror.  It is the first time you have seen yourself since your transformation.  The image reveals a beautiful woman with skin smooth and fair as porcelin, eyes sparkle and shine the color of emeralds, lips that are soft and full.  Your eyebrows are distinctive, with arches that speak both wisdom and seduction.  You hair is the most shocking transformation, besides the length, it is now a deep auburn, as the color of fall leaves, or in your realm, a copper penny.  Streaks of blonde course through, entertwining with the red.  You now see your pointed ears for the first time and you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise of the releasing lock and opening door jerk your eyes away from the mirror.<br>\r\nYou stand before an elf who's beauty and glory surpass the ones you saw before.  He is tall with long brown hair.  Gold is also in his hair, mingling and mixing in delicate braids.  His robe is dark blue and green, accented with gold.  He wears a dark green cloak also, fastened with a golden clasp in the form of a maple leaf.  His peircing eyes are a beautiful shade of brown and his face radiates both kindness and wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your breath as he speaks, \"I am Mikia, ruler of the elven village of Dora Moore.  You are in the dungeons now.  I would like it if you were not, but that decision is yours.  Will you join me for breakfast?\"</span></div></div>",

The ruler himself has made an appearance at your door.  Maybe your bad attitude earlier was not a mistake, but you feel it would be at this point in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and bow slightly as you reply, \"It would be my honor to join you sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returns the smile, \"I was hoping that would be your reply.  We hate to keep our guest in such unsettling conditions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, your kindness has been overwhelming sir,\" you say, trying to be humble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikia opens the door and lets you pass through.  He leads you down a narrow corridor, up spiraling stairs, and into a large room.  The room is spacious but with only a 9' ceiling.  There is a large fireplace as the focal point, with many cushioned chairs scattered about.  A large, burgundy rug keeps the floor warm.  As Mikia leads you through the room he explains, \"This is a gathering room.  Often in the evenings we will gather here to sing or tell stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The elves are known for their exceptional poetry and musical ability.  I hope I get the chance to experience some of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikia slowed, walking beside you, \"I'm sure you will have that opportunity.\"  He brings you into an airy, bright room.  A small dining table is prepared with a variety of fruits, breads and juices.<br>\r\nYou sit at the table with Mikia and two elven women, who are introduced as Nymitha, Mikia's wife, and Aerial, Mikia's daughter.  They are pleasant and are extraordinary in their beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are finishing your meal, Aerial speaks.  \"Would you like me to show you around the village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your surroundings would be very nice.  Aerial might also have some information on why you are here and where you are going.<br>\r\nMikia, on the other hand, would have more information.  Maybe you should ask to speak with him instead.</span></div></div>",

You search through one of the small pouches the wizard left you and discover some coin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking the elf if you have enough to buy the horse, he nods and hands over the reins.  Having a horse will definitely speed your travels.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you wish to explore the town further?</span></div></div>",

Looking around, you try to find a ledge or crevice to hide in, but there are none to be found. A massive bellow shakes the cavern more, causing stone to come crashing down on the cavern floor. It becomes a struggle to stay alive as you desperately avoid the falling debris, all the while feeling weaker and weaker. Your new-found powers are draining you of energy! Just as you think you can't levitate any longer, you see a promising ledge created by the collapsing cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          As you land on the ledge, safe for the moment, you see the last of the goblins disapear down a small tunnel, the cart in tow. A final roar echoes through the cavern, and then all is silent once again. After a few minutes, nothing has happened and you judge it safe to go down again. As you are floating down, a shiny object catches your eye. Drifting towards it, it looks to be a gold coin. Lying next to the coin is a small leather bag packed full of coins. The goblins must have dropped it in their rush to escape! You scoop up coins that had spilled and placed them in the pouch, then putting the pouch in a pocket you find on the inside of your cloak. This money will certainly help on your trip to the Valley of Zar.<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n          The cavern turns dim, growing darker by the second, even with your improved vision. All of a sudden, that bellow comes back, louder than ever before! A huge creature comes smashing through the floor at the end of the cavern. In the midst of the flying debris, you see an enormous being of flame and shadow come hurtling at you. Confident in your new-found powers, you use your mind to try and bend the will of this foe. However, they are too strong for you and smash your will to pieces, filling your mind with ancient hatred and fear. This fear drives you, and you sprint away. As you run, the being roars at you,\"You cannot escape me, small one. I am Gorakt, the Stealer of Souls!\". Dodging a fireball thrown by the monster, you come to a split path. Two tunnels, one leading up and one leading down, lay before you. You are becoming weaker, hungrier, and more tired. Do you go deeper into these dark caverns where you can feel a connection with the dark within you, or go up and hope it comes out somewhere safe?</span></div></div>",

Can you deny such power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The prospect of an eternal connection to the spirit world is tempting, but potentially dangerous. \"What does this imply spirit?\" She seems to grow a little angry. \"Only that we are each other's catalysts!

Like a shadow cast by moonlight, it seems poised on the razor thin border between life and death.  To your own surprise, you realize the border no longer restrains you.  Life and death have become mere reflections of one another, and each is well within your grasp.  Reaching across that border, you take the hand of the hovering spirit and bring it into the world of the living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark as night, a woman about your own age stands before you.  The blue in her eyes is so dark the color fades into the pupils instead of surrounding them.  Curling waves of blue-black hair float around her face and roll down her back like smoke.  Beneath a strong aquiline nose, her black lips are barely two shades darker than her ebony skin.  Smiling, she reaches up a dark hand to slip her smoky locks aside and reveal one pointed ear.  Her gown is woven from leaves of elm and oak black with winter decay.  Most noticeable of all, you can feel a power pulsing in her that is incalculably greater than your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank-you for calling me,\u201d she whispers.  Her voice is clear as a loon diving in the stillness of a morning bog.  \u201cHow may I serve you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the Wizard\u2019s gift of skills and senses, a moment of confusion flows through you.  It seems unreal to expect such a creature to serve willingly.  Suspicion blooms in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother smile, this one hinting at knowledge you can only dream of possessing.  \u201cI am Fantoccina.  I was once a dryad.  Now I am something more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantoccina?\u201d  The name is familiar, but you cannot recall where you might have heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, Fantoccina, I am new and I need to learn how to master my abilities.  Can you teach me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can teach you nothing.  However, I can help you by summoning others like me.  Among my allies are the warriors of Lugal, the witches of Ningirsil, the wizards of Dumuzi, and the spies of Dagan.  The warriors are all masters of their trade and will gladly fight to the death, but those who survive will demand a night of pillage and plunder for each day of fighting.  The witches will brew potions or mix powders that create sickness, spread disease, and even kill, but for each powder or potion they will require a payment of one young human male.  The wizards will create earthquakes, raise fog, collapse walls of earth or stone, and generate firestorms large enough to engulf a city, but for each act of destruction they will require a payment of one young human female.  Every time you summon me, I gain the right to summon you.  When I call, you will give me the strength of your sword, the flight of your arrow, or the power of your magic and you will direct it as I command.  Everything has a price, and every price must be paid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear rising from your belly makes you swallow convulsively.  Your heart seems determined to pound its way through your breastbone.  Fantocinna can bring you awesome power, but at a terrible price.  \u201cSo have you now gained the right to summon me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, but only once.  When I call, you will serve me as I command, and I will pay the price you require.  Save this: I cannot and will not grant you the power of love.  If you ask, your life will be forfeit.  If you wanted love, you should never have forsaken the light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething tickles at the back of your mind.  Fantocinna is looking straight into your eyes, expectation and even eagerness both plain in the tension of her jaw, the tilt of her head, and the way her upper body drifts toward you.  Danger, palpable as the strength of the surrounding shadows, hangs in the air between you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree.  I have no need for love, only power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfaction rolls over her in waves.  Her smile is the casual cruelty of a hunter cleaning their kill.  With one razor sharp fingernail, she cuts a deep wound through the center of her right palm and holds out her bleeding hand.  Taking an arrow from your quiver and drawing the sharp steel head across your own palm produces a matching wound.  Your heart pounds in fear and what little is left of your natural mind screams in defiance, but you stretch out your hand and the palms touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue sheet lightning flashes around the two of you.  Pain like a million blades of white hot steel slices through your entire body.  Inside, the complete knowledge of how to use the darkest magic, how to fight with any kind of bladed weapon, how to aim an arrow that never misses, how to stalk and destroy an enemy without their ever knowing you are there, and how to travel from shadow to shadow without ever stepping into the light, are all seared into your mind.  If you had a human past, it is gone from your memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFantoccina smiles an icy welcome.  You have found your first ally, but you will never again have a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce you were human,\u201d she says, \u201cnow you are something more.  Every dark elf must have a name.  What will be yours?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fantoccina does not seem to be a force to be reckoned with and you are sure she would be displeased if she saw indecision in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest seems to grow darker, as you follow her in strange directions.

Where others would see only shadows, you see a monochrome landscape of trees, undergrowth, nocturnal animals, and phosphorescent moss.  Sliding down to rest among the roots of the tree, you open your magic to the world around you.  Small, dark birds and squirrels dart among the branches, a silver fox hunts mice a few paces from where you sit, a family of coal black rabbits leave their burrow in search of sweet grasses, and there, just at the edge of your perception, six elf-like figures work their way slowly toward you.  Curious, you study the feel of them.  Their magic is obvious, but plainly they have chosen to be open and could just as easily have hidden their <i>chakara</i> from your enhanced perception.  These, you conclude, must be the spies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still some yards off, five of the figures form a loose circle around you while the sixth approaches.  From five feet away, a woman\u2019s voice calls to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Lethe, daughter of Camphor, daughter of Dagan.  Fantoccina has sent us to seek the new dark-elf Khasma.  I assume you are she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnxiety sends shivers down your spine.  Lethe\u2019s voice is cold as a winter tomb.  Perhaps it would have been better to go to the wizards of Dumuzi.  Clasping your hands together prevents them from shaking as you rise to your feet and turn to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Khasma.  I seek to learn why I have been brought to this world to fight in a war that is none of my concern.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLethe is long in answering and you fear you have offended her.  When you open your eyes, the woman before you is a few years older than you are.  Her only garment is a thin strip of leather worn as a loin cloth.  On one hip hangs a full quiver, on the other a knife long enough to double as a very short sword.  In her left hand is a recurved bow of layered wood and bone.  Her bow is strung and she holds a single arrow knocked but not drawn.  Pale brown hair tied in an elaborate braid hangs down her back.  Most of her skin is exposed to the elements, but covered in a dull sheen of oil to repel insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d you demand again, although you do not expect an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d  She offers a half-smile of genuine concern.  \u201cHowever, if you return with us to our village perhaps the Master Assassin will know.  She has traveled through the land and knows many things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly, you open yourself the magic of the land once again, but you can feel no village anywhere within your limited range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how far is your village?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree days north through the dark forest, two if we take the path through the tree folk, but the cypress lord has declared his loyalty lies with the Wise Elves of the far south and so he will not grant us passage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we not fight our way through?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLethe smiles in humor.  \u201cA joke, newcomer?  Or would you really strip the bark from a tree folk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, foolish of me to even suggest it.  Shall we go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beckons you to follow and heads back the way she came.  As she passes the edge of the circle created by the others, they fall in behind you.  You still are not certain if Lethe is elfin, human, or something else, nor are you convinced you can trust her.  On the other hand, a village will have food, drink, and perhaps a place to sleep.  Tomorrow is soon enough to figure out what comes next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each is equipped with a short sword and heavy wooden shield.  bits of cloth are woven into the chain mail and wrapped in every place likely to cause sound without some cushion.  Opposite the short sword each wears a foot-long dagger of thin steel.  Their shoulders are broad and powerful, their demeanor fierce.  Two of them are in their early twenties, young, powerful, and clearly they are already veterans of several battles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third man is older.  His hair is touched with grey, but the blue in his eyes is clear as a winter morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Danner,\" he announces without fanfare.  He gestures to the younger men.  \"Their names do not matter and each time you call their faces will change.  Regardless of whether you ask for one warrior or a thousand, I will always be present and I will always command the warriors I bring.  I will answer to you and only to you, even if you set someone else in charge of me.  Any bargain you make will be made with me, and only with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" you begin.  \"Today we are going to kill a human scout team who has invaded the forest from the west.  Three days from now we will raid a human village on the edge of the forest in retaliation.  As payment for your fighting, you and your men may loot the village for anything it holds and deal with it's people in any way you see fit.  I hope you do not object to killing your own kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs, the two younger men look bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to array yourself and your men across the northern side of this clearing.  Find or make something to hide yourselves.  When all five scouts have entered the clearing, I will appear before them and sow confusion in their ranks.  At that point, you are to attack without mercy and without waiting for my command.  Am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs the younger men by their arms and shoves them off to the north side of the clearing, whispering instructions to them as they move.  Before long all three have vanished beneath makeshift piles of broken branches and torn grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am done here,\" Fantoccina announces.  \"Your hold on me is broken until I call for you, then the cycle begins anew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice turns hard.  \"Am I clear, Malvagia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, trying as best you can to mimic her predatory grins.  \"Absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she is gone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wears leather armor from head to toe.  He is armed with a crossbow primed and ready, a quiver of crossbow bolts on his right hip, and a dagger on his left hip.  The crossbow is aimed into the clearing as he enters and he swings it from right to left and back again as he looks around.  Seeing nothing, he waves behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour more men enter the clearing one by one.  They are armed with drawn swords in their right hands and drawn daggers in their left hands.

The three warriors of Lugal spring into action between the two arrows, even though their flight is mere seconds apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scouts are not caught entirely off guard.

They quickly realize the other man has escaped and their eyes turn into vicious red slits. They sound like wolves as they howl with anger--which is rather strange because they look more like boars--then three of them race down the hill. You doubt they'll catch that man--of horse. But you decide your own chance of escape has again been heightened. Four against one was pushing it, but one against one? <br>\r\nPiece of cake.<br>\r\nYou watch the boar like creature pace back and forth in front of you, its stubby hairy arms behind its back. It is obviously distraught, fearful, even. You wonder why the loss of a meal would frighten the creature so. It's not like there wasn't anything else to eat in this grassland.<br>\r\nBut as the wind rustles your hair into your face and you shake the itchy strands out of your eyes, you overhear the creature say something.<br>\r\n    \"No! No! He goes! He goes! Master kill us! He KILL us! Stupid human. Foolish Tuk and Jin! We lose him! He goes!\"<br>\r\n You are annoyed enough as it is on having been betrayed, plus, your stomach reminds you that you haven't eaten much since your encounter with that wizard. The boar's whiney voice plays off your ears as you stew over your own problems. Finally, you can take no more of the creature's pathetic babbling.<br>\r\n    \"What's so important about me and that guy, huh?\"<br>\r\nThe creature stops whimpering to glare at you. \"Quiet, filthy Human,\" it hisses. \"Everyone who comes from Mystic Forest is brought to Master.\" It wipes its tears with its dirty fingers, leaving muddy tracks across its beady eyes. \"Master says all Chosen die.\" <br>\r\nYou roll your own eyes. \"What the Hell is a Chosen, anyway?\"<br>\r\nThe creature's tears turns to laughter, a cackling, high pitched laughter that pierces your eardrums and makes you long even more to be free from your bonds. \"Who Chosen?\" it repeats in a sneer. \"You, boy. And horse man, too. All different. All same destiny.\"<br>\r\nYou scoff at the news, though in the back of your mind you are reminded of the wizard's words. He said something about there being others, right? And then he let you choose your form. Well, even though you chose to be yourself, perhaps others chose. . . . You cannot help but wonder where you tie into all this and you find yourself further engaging this creature in conversation. \"So...what are our destinies, then?\"<br>\r\nThe creature looks at you strangely, as if it's seeing you in a different light. \"You no know?\"<br>\r\n    \"Usually, when someone asks a question, it means they don't know the answer.\" You quickly conclude you are speaking to the stupid one of the group. The boar creature frowns, scratching its mud caked hair then goes and puts its finger in its nose. You make a face. You are not surprised, though.<br>\r\n     \"Master kill you then before you find out.\"<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the image of the creature digging for buried treasure in its nostril isn't the only thing making you feel sick as a cold chill falls down your spine.

Still too strong. No chance of cutting them without that knife. \"If your Master wants me dead,\" you continue, \"why don't you save Him the trouble and kill me FOR Him?\" <br>\r\n     This question was a risky one, but you didn't think it would seal your fate so readily. You had realized something, ever since the beasts had captured you. They may have threatened you with death--many times--but despite your defiance, none of their resulting blows to you had been of lethal intent. Odd. <br>\r\n     \"Master need you before he kill you,\" came the curt reply. \"We kill you. He kill us back.\"<br>\r\n     \"Harsh. Well, if your master needs me, then perhaps we can arrange some agreement. You cut me loose, feed me, allow me to take a piss, and I'll promise to follow you to Mr. Master's house.\"<br>\r\n     The creature frowns, wiping its sticky finger on its moldy pants. \"Master say nothing about sewing lips shut.\"<br>\r\n     Meh, was worth a try. \"I can take a hint.\" You nod in submission and retreat into silence. <br>\r\n     You have to think of some way to escape!

You squint through the gloom of night and realize that gleam is the reflection of moonlight off metal. Can it be? Yes! It is your pocket knife! The horsey man must have dropped it when he transformed. Hallelujah!<br>\r\n     You purse your lips and glance back to the boar. The creature lies on a flat rock, a few feet from where you sit. Drool runs down its chin and pools on the flat of its arm. Wow! He went to sleep quick! You look at the knife again, only a couple dozen paces away in the opposite direction. You smile as an idea forms in your head.<br>\r\n     Showtime! <br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

If you truly are still alive, then darn it, you want to live! You feel your mouth being pried open and moist hot air being blown in. You force yourself to remember how to breathe so to make it easier for your rescuer to feed you the air. You're not dead! You can survive this! Mind over matter! <br>\r\n     \"Please, don't die. You can't!\"<br>\r\n     &lt;I won't!&gt; you think, allowing her lilting voice to lure you closer to the light. On the second attempt, her air finally gets through and your lungs force the water up through your mouth. <br>\r\nSputtering, choking, and gasping, you flip over and spit up the water in bucketfulls. You then lay on your back in exhaustion. God, but it feels good to be alive! <br>\r\n     Your vision is as wet as your clothes and skin. But soon the blur of your surroundings come into focus. Clothed in a simple white, grass stained dress, your guardian angel sits over you, watching and waiting for you to regain enough strength to rise. She is beautiful! Soggy long red hair falls past her shoulders. She has concerned green eyes, high cheekbones, and a dashing of freckles on her cheeks. She is everything you had been told an angel was...yet, she doesn't have wings? Or a halo? What a let down. Just a simple girl. <br>\r\n     Hey, but she's pretty.<br>\r\n     \"I'm glad you live,\" she says with a smile. You are speechless as her white teeth nearly blind you. \"That was a nasty fall.\" <br>\r\n     \"You...SAW me?\"<br>\r\n     She makes a face, cocking her head. \"I heard you first.\" She giggles and you fight to calm your fluttering heart. \"Your screams were loud enough to...you know.\"<br>\r\n     You find the strength in you to shrug. \"If waking the dead helps prevent me from joining their ranks, then I'll scream louder next time.\"<br>\r\n     The two of you laugh, then. Your eyes meet hers, and you quickly turn away, clearing your throat before sitting up to study your surroundings. You know you lay on the bank of the river the girl saved you from, but when you look at the river, you find yourself gaping.<br>\r\nThe river is nothing more than a dry bed now!<br>\r\n\"How...?\" You bring your hand to your soggy hair and run your fingers through it in puzzlement. \"I DID nearly drown, didn't I?\"<br>\r\nThe girl nods. \"I saw you on top of that cliff,\" she says. \"You seemed in trouble. I thought you might have need to jump so I gave you something to jump into.\"<br>\r\n\"How?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know, really.\" She frowns. \"I am new to this. I still am confused.\" <br>\r\nYou cannot stop staring at the dusty river. \"So you just summoned a whole bunch of water into this ditch? Just like that?\"<br>\r\nShe nods. \"Strange, huh?\"<br>\r\nYou furrow your brows. \"A little.\" <br>\r\nSilence reigns supreme for a moment as you try to think of what to say next. Your complete and utter confusion of things puts you at a loss for words. That's a first!<br>\r\n     \"I hope he will come back soon.\"<br>\r\n     You look at the girl again and frown. \"Who?\"<br>\r\n     She stares out across the dry riverbed and grassland around you. The wind plays with her hair and you find yourself drawn to her regal posture. \"The man who saved me.\" She turns to look at you, a solemn longing in her eyes. \"We heard the howl of Woarts, the same things that cornered you atop that cliff. He went to investigate things.\" <br>\r\n     \"Woarts?\" Well, at least you now know what those boar-like creatures are called. \"Then what happened?\"<br>\r\n     She lowers her head and shakes it. \"He never returned. That was nearly a day ago.\" <br>\r\n     \"I'm sure he'll turn up,\" you pipe, wishing only to cheer the girl up. Your attempt scores a sad smile from her. Nothing else. <br>\r\n     A rustle from some bushes across the riverbank bring you both to attention. You stare with the girl out at the vegetation, praying that for once, something good might appear from behind those branches.<br>\r\nA snarling, black wolf steps out, fangs barred, nose wrinkled. Blood paints its snout and paws. It just had a nice meal, apparently. <br>\r\nMaybe it is just passing through and really isn't interested in desert? <br>\r\nEyes slit, ears flat against its skull, the black beast stalks across the dry river, its sight set on you!

With a yell, you bring your knife out and plow into the creature. The force upon which you hit sends the knife into your opponent's heart. The creature screams in agony and drops to its knees. You waste no time to watch it in its death throes. You must make it to those rocks before the other boar creatures get here!  <br>\r\nYou pick up speed as their howls of pursuit find you. Feet pummeling the grass, the night squeezing all around you like a vice, you glance down and quickly regret sewing those cool reflectors on your footwear. It was a dare at the time, a harmless joke, devised by your friends to get back at your mom after she'd repeatedly insisted you ride you bike at night with reflectors. You frown and stop running. Perhaps it was harmless at the time, but your sneakers light up like beacons now! Those creature would kill you for sure!<br>\r\nYou sit down and begin yanking your expensive sneakers off, all the while grumbling to yourself about the store's crappy return policy.<br>\r\nThe other three boar creatures reach their dead comrade then turn to glare out into the gloomy grassland. You freeze in the middle of untying your other shoe, but they see you. With roars of fury, they take out their bows and give you a volley. As the shafts flit by, one piercing the empty toe of the sneaker you have just taken off, you scramble to your feet and make a beeline for the rocks. The angry boar creatures' cries grow fiercer. The arrows streak down on you like fatal hail. Still, you grit your teeth in determination and push onward. You will make it through this! <br>\r\nThere! The rocks! Can't you see them? They are materializing out of the gloom some eighty feet away now. They are tall and proud, many mighty sandstone monuments scratching the sky. They were built by nature to honor the moon. Go! Run to them! They summon you! <br>\r\nYour lungs burn in your chest. The arrows are flying closer. Apparently the archers are honing in on your position. It's only a matter of time before....<br>\r\nYour muscles and tendons threaten to quit on you. Not yet. Not now! Almost there!<br>\r\nThe rocks are within forty feet now! Great. Keep it.... <br>\r\nSomething high pitch screams behind you, and the arrow that has honed in on your left shoulder makes contact, throwing you to the ground with the force. White hot pain courses down your left arm as you haul yourself back to your feet and continue running. The cold air beating at you makes the hot stream of blood sliding down your shoulder feel like ice water. Your arm is limp at your side, yet you concentrate on nothing else but getting to those rocks. <br>\r\nTwenty feet! You see a niche in the formation that you plan to hide in the moment you get there. Ten! You raise your good arm to receive the rock as you come on it. Three arrows scream behind you.<br>\r\nYou reach a boulder in the huge rocks and bunt over it with your good arm. The bunt shoots you over that boulder and behind it. You hear the clang of arrowheads against stone as you crouch and fight to steal back the breath stolen from you. Your enemy still howls for you some distance away. You know you cannot cower here forever. They will soon give up flinging shafts at you and hunt you with their blades. Again you find yourself taking out the pathetic pocket knife and studying it. Without a REAL blade to call your own, you'll stand no chance against those creeps! <br>\r\nThe flare of pain in your shoulder reminds you of your injury. You touch the shaft experimentally. That simple touch causes you to scream out and brings you to tears. Geez! And here you thought you could endure pain! Guess you just aren't used to having arrowheads jammed in you. You'll learn.<br>\r\nExhaustion plagues you, but you cannot give in. To sleep now is to die. You look around, considering your next best move. Of course, your mind is not reacting as well as you'd like--what with the agony of your shoulder. You see the mouth of a dark cave behind you and a slight climb up. Apparently these rocks are more than they appear. But that doesn't help you. You cannot hope to climb with your shoulder as it is.<br>\r\nYou hear the boar archers voices again. They are closer now. So they have decided to come after you, have they? <br>\r\nYour smile is ironic. You have to make your choice quickly, else pay the price of your hesitation. For ONCE you'd like to have some good news! Is that too much to ask? <br>\r\n\"I TOLD you not to get them angry.\"<br>\r\nYou gasp in surprise at the familiar voice and search for its master. <br>\r\nA cloaked, hooded figure leans against the rock wall opposite. His arms are folded and his head bowed. When you call out to him, he lifts his head and reveals his face. You are not surprised to see who it is. <br>\r\nYou frown. \"Was betraying me not good enough for you,\" you sneer. \"You have to come and rub your advice back in my face, too?\"<br>\r\nThe man shrugs. His eye is still swollen, his face still littered with cuts. \"If you don't want my help, fine.\" He gestures calmly out across the grassy plain, where you can plainly see the distant shapes of the boar archers scrambling toward you. \"Course, they're your only other alternative.\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His aim is true as he looses, and his target falls to the ground with the mighty shaft lodged between its eyes. You gape at the man in astonishment. \"Good shot! I didn't know you were an archer.\"<br>\r\nThe man cries in exhileration and again loads his bow. \"Neither did I, really.\" He looses, and yet another creature falls. \"Then again, I'm new to this world.\" <br>\r\nYour conversation with that boar floods back to you. And as the man kills the final creature with his exceptional aim, you ask the question. \"Did you happen to come from the Mystic Forest?\"<br>\r\n\"It's called Mystical Forest.\" The man puts away his bow and leans against the wall again. \"And yes, I did.\" He looks at you with his intense green eyes. \"And you did,too.\" You feel as if he could penetrate the center of your soul with such a gaze. Your intimidation of such a skill causes you to turn away.  <br>\r\n\"So then why are we here?\"<br>\r\n\"Haven't the slightest.\"<br>\r\nThe man still is looking at you. You meet his gaze again irritably. \"What's your problem?\"<br>\r\nHe makes a face. \"Why did you choose to stay yourself?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"That's kinda weak, don't you think?\" He cocks his brow. \"To stay Human without any power. What do you hope to accomplish with that?\"<br>\r\nYou narrow your eyes, slightly ruffled by the man's comment. \"So? And what are you, then?\"<br>\r\n\"Me?\" There is a slight chuckle as the man fully pulls his hood back to reveal those telltale ears. \"I'm a dark elf.\"<br>\r\n\"Pssht!\" you scoff, folding your arms. \"Kinda cliche. Why be something you're not in your dreams? Don't you have enough confidence in yourself to remain the same?\"<br>\r\n\"So you've never dreamed of being more than what you are, huh?\" <br>\r\nYou frown. \"Sometimes, but....\"<br>\r\n\"See! It's a natural thing to assume different personas in your dreams.\"<br>\r\nYou continue frowning. \"Yeah, but...who's to say this is really a dream.\" You wince and lock your eyes on that shaft sticking out of you. \"The pain feels real enough.\"<br>\r\nThe man seems to consider this. \"But what else could it be but a dream? I remember going to bed and....boom! I'm talking to that wizard dude.\" He smiles. \"Dream or not. We're bound to find out soon enough.But either way, let's just play it out and see what happens, huh?\"<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"We can't wake up,\" you reply. \"So what other choice do we have?\" <br>\r\nThe elf nods and pushes off the wall. He locks his hands around the arrow. You wince, but hold in your tears. You couldn't cry in front of another guy! You'd never be able to live that down!<br>\r\nWith a snap, the shaft is broke. Only an inch or two sticks from your arm now. <br>\r\nThe man steps back to admire his work then nods. \"Yeah. That should lighten things for you.\" He then gathers his stuff from behind a rock and motions for you to follow him. \"Let's go. We have to get back to her.\"<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n\"The girl I met. She is one of us. She needs our help and she can probably help you with that wound.\" <br>\r\n\"Girl?\" That word didn't sound too bad at the moment. You push off the rock and follow at the man's heels. The two of you make your way past the bodies of those boars and further across the grassland to a wide river. You stop at the river's edge and gaze out at the far shore. You see nothing out of the ordinary. Just a few bare trees and thin vegetation. But the man seems to think otherwise and cups his hands over his mouth. <br>\r\n\"Jenna! I got him!\"<br>\r\nThe bushes part and out jumps a gray wolf. You frown in disappointment. Is this the girl he spoke of? Really funny.<br>\r\nThe wolf pads over to the river's edge and something miraculous happens. The water disappears! Just like that! Almost as if it never was there. You gape in shock. How had....?<br>\r\nThe wolf then crosses the dry riverbed and sits down beside you and your comrade. You watch in added shock as the beautiful beast changes into a girl before your eyes!<br>\r\nRed shoulder length hair. Great, green eyes. She has clothes on, you notice. A simple grass stained white dress. Somehow she was able to transform with it.<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she says with a smile. You find yourself speechless as her white teeth nearly blind you. \"I'm Kala. I'm glad you are okay. Me and Turin were worried about you.\"<br>\r\n\"Me? Worried?\" The dark elf spits on the ground and walks away to sit by himself. <br>\r\nYou make a face as you and Kala stare at his back. \"Is that why he left me to fend for myself? Because he was worried for me?\"<br>\r\nKala shakes her red head. You notice the same pointy ears on her as Turin has. \"My brother was more worried for my wellbeing after he was taken. I assume he raced off to find me before he even thought to save you.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" You dismiss her comment with a wave of the hand and turn away. \"But I don't need anyone to 'save me.'\" <br>\r\n\"But you have no powers to call your own.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't need 'em.\"<br>\r\nThe girl elf laughs. \"I don't doubt your decision. You are different than many. Stronger, I'd assume. For you have chosen to come into an unknown world with nothing but your wits.\" She then sighs. \"You are stronger than my brother and I, even.\"<br>\r\n\"I am?\" Her answer disarms you and you turn around to see her lowering her head. \"But...you're strong too. How else could you have made it past those boar creatures?\"<br>\r\n\"You mean those woarks?\" She shakes her head. \"Turin saved us, not me. He allowed himself to be captured while I fled.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you know what your captors were called?\"<br>\r\nShe looks up at you and winks. \"A little birdie told me.\"<br>\r\nTurin then stalks back to you, a presence more than a substance behind his dark cloak. \"We can't stay here. They'll have this whole place filled with hunters by afternoon.\"<br>\r\nThe three of you glance to the east and shield your eyes from the rising bloodred sun. \"Where do we go then?\"<br>\r\nTurin frowns. \"I doubt we should continue through this grassland. We'll be fair game in such flats. So we either head to that forest over there.\" He gestures across the riverbed to the black wall beyond. \"Or we head back to those rocks you and I just came from. I thought I saw a cave somewhere up there.\"<br>\r\nKala looks to you. \"Your mind is your best weapon, friend. We'll leave this decision up to you.\"     <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

WOndering if it is ethical to ride your friend, you hesitate.  Suddenly, you hear ferocious shouting.  You see the horrible creatures, crossbows raised, eyes blazing red with fury.

As they curse in a strange language, you smile as you and your comrade gallop off into a glorious crimson sunset.  </span></div></div>",

Without regard to the consequences that may stem from your undoubtedly rash actions, you decide to tempt fate and win your freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Quietly and slowly, you take the knot of your rope shackles in your teeth and pull the simple knot apart.  In your right hand, you open the knife--good, stainless steel--and twist the crude rope around your left hand twice to get a good grip. As your captor nears the rock formation, you strike--quickly, brutally, and utterly silently, with a ruthless efficiency that startles the small part of your mind that is only now realizing that perhaps remaining exactly as you were may have granted you nothing--but may have left you with powers that you never knew you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the rope of the leash settles around the short, thick neck of the brute in front of you, it stops in dull-witted surprise.  As you tighten it into a makeshift - but very effective garotte - it tries to bellow a warning to its companions - in vain.  But the monster's trachea is no longer in any condition to allow whispering, let alone bellowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As part of the same motion, you drive the wicked steel point of the knife into the monster's back, where instinct tells you is a vital point.  Even your killer's mind does not expect what comes next, though: instead of bleeding and dying, quietly, the monster shudders in silent but obviously intolerable pain.  The flesh around the knife shrivels, instantly, and sublimates without a sound or smell, into fine gray ash and then, almost instantaneously, into nothing.  The dessication proceeds in a matter of seconds throughout the creature's body.  Bones and tissue alike are reduced to nonexistence.  Not even a smear of blood remains on the knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You have learned a valuable lesson, one you would do well to remember in this world of magic, and of unknown and unknowable peril: iron kills.  Cold iron is, of course, the most feared by fey creatures, but solid iron of any temperature is bane to all creatures of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The three remaining monstrosities move forward unconcernedly--they have no doubt as to their erstwhile comrade's ability to handle a single puny human, and your deadly attack was carried out with such perfect technique that no sound escaped to alert them.  And blood that is sublimated by iron gives off no telltale scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     All of this took but a few heartbeats, and as the kill is concluded, your calm, machinelike deadliness vanishes, to be replaced by amazement, adrenaline--and fear.  You've just killed a monster in cold blood, displaying an inhuman efficiency and an equally monstrous lack of fear or even excitement.  In an instant, you are once again a frightened, isolated boy.  The dark killer that invaded your mind from within is gone without a trace, leaving you with only memories that belong to someone else and a chance to escape.  You are revolted in every part of your being by what you have done, but you are grateful to your killer instinct for saving you from a fate quite possibly worse than an eternity in the terrible, but known and therefore less terrifying hell that humans are familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your emotions overpower you and you flee into the blasted landscape, heedless of everything except your need to flee the place where you did murder for the first--but probably not the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Miles ahead of you, as you come to a panting halt, you see a rippling in the air in the desert that may be a mirage, a heat wave, or something far more terrible yet--another unknown danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Do you attempt to retrace your steps and return to the forest, or do you attempt to forge ahead farther into the desert?  Either way means hours of trudging through broken landscape under the punishing rays of the sun, no water for that long or perhaps longer, and terrors lying in wait under every rock and lurking in every shadow.  What is your choice?</span></div></div>",

The knife is the size of a dagger, and you know you can do some damage if necessary.<br>\r\nYou stand firm and ready for anything.  But to your surprise, the eagle slows it's flight, gliding in.

Before you can react she leaps from her horse, who trots to a stop a few feet away, and comes to a halt before you.  Upon her face is a look of utter confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?!?!\"  She shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a closer look you see that her features are not entirely like anything you've ever seen before.  Her eyes are almond shaped and are the most captivating color of green.  Her hair, tied back in a single braid, is deep black streaked with shimmering strands of the purest silver.  She would be nearly your height if not for her long pointed ears that rise a few inches above the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, during which she waits for your response, you realize that you've been staring at her with your mouth open - entranced by her beauty.  Shutting your mouth you stammer out an incoherent answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?\"  She says, eying you suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, 'I'm not sure what I'm doing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not HERE,\" she says, motioning around this particular area of forest, \"Why aren't you going north?  You were told to journey North, you've gone East!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see she is not happy about this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" you begin to speak, but are suddenly interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't speak!  You're wasting time!  You've chosen to be yourself, and that is admirable, I'm sure they'll think highly of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who'll think highly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" she shouts again. \"You've chosen yourself, but that also means you've chosen to be unarmed and unprotected.  I have been sent to give you this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fumbles quickly with the sheathed sword dangling at her side and, when losened from her belt, she places it in your hands.  It is incredibly light and yet it has a feeling of amazing rigidity.  Its blade, a wickedly curving thing, is engraved with thousands of designs and symbols and it's handle is bound tightly with a dark brown leather which appears to have been worn smooth by countless years of skilled usage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it, I have no doubt you'll find use for it before you reach your goal.  Now, go!  North!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Egella!\" She calls as she turns towards her horse.  The magnificent beast trots over to stand beside her.  Tossing a leg over the horses bare back she mounts with a skill you've never seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" You call before she can go, \"Which way is North?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no time to wait, Check your clothes - you've no doubt been equiped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she is off, leaving only the sounds of hoofbeats heading West.  You search your person and find in your left jacket pocket a lump of some soft sweet bread.  In a pouch attatched to your best is a compass made of gold and inlaid with silver symbols similar to those on the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding North you begin to trudge through the forest.  After a few hours walking you come into a clearing in the center of which sits a small stone hutt.  The smoke issuing from the stone chimney tells you someone is home.</span></div></div>",

Within seconds it escalates into a wildly hysterical roar, and you begin to worry when, without notice, the thatch front door bursts open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly old man appears, half crawling, half stammering, his worn wrinkly face made even more wrinkly by the sheer level of laughter erupting not only out of his mouth by, from what you can tell, his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crazy old kook.<i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if he could read your thoughts, he immediately stops, turns, eyes your sheath, and looks you in the eye and screams, \"WHO RE YOU!?\"<br>\r\n</i></i></span></div></div>",

Thoughts begin playing in your head. <i>What if I don't want to do this? What'll the little pixie-thing do to me, anyway? Well, this is a strange forest. Best to at least follow it, if it won't talk.</i><br>\r\nYou begin to wonder whether the task may be as simple as you first thought. What does it mean to kill a tree, anyway? Cuting it down is the first thing that comes to mind; the elvish sword is, afterall, rather lightweight but feels sharp enough to displace a smaller tree. But it was some kind of riddle, so maybe you won't be cutting down a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What am I even doing</i>here? you ask yourself, only to realize a second later you voiced it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'lokin' creature presses on, floating vibrantly but silently. You begin wondering if its brightness may not serve in your best interests come nightfall...who knows what other strange things might befall you before days end?<br>\r\nFirst there was the pursuit, then the first crazy man, then the elvish girl who at least reaffirmed some of the wizard's words, then the second crazy man, and now--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts come to a halt as the dark forest also does, revealing to you a vast wasteland that stretches as far as you sight can reach into the coming black of night. Something catches your eye and you look harder, and you notice that there is a blackish fog floating far off in the east, slowly pouring down into a dry riverbed that follows a wide valley into the forest further south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the north you see the forest line fade into what appears a wall of rock, but at closer inspection you make out as a large and rugged mountain range, the lofty tips catching the last red rays of the setting sun. They remind you of those fire beacons in that Lord of the Rings movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" You ask the lokin, now paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a quick rustling sound behind you, and before you can blink a red, branch-like appendage descends around your waste and hoists you up. Straining agianst the iron grip you turn and face this menace and are surprised to find that you are being lifted by the branch of a red-wooded tree!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take this quick chance to try your luck with the sword, only to have another of the tree's branches whip out and snatch it. The tree hoists you higher until it sets you down high atop its apex, where, sitting on a branch and to your utter surprise, you find the crazy old kook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome,\" he says, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see my strange friend, the colors, they are no significant matter. What matters is that they told me you would chose this path, and, indeed, so you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare, stunned speechless. The tree branch sets you down atop a branch neighboring his, and then descends back down, rustling noisily as it goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand if you feel powerless, even directionless,\" he says, \"despite all the planning that has gone into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into what?\" you ask, neglecting his first, second, third pecking order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, of bringing you here, to this world, of course!\" he gleefully replies, smoothly spreading his arms out wide, gesturing out across the forest. His change in demeanor from earlier is disarming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, sir,\" you beg, \"can you tell me what exactly is going on, where I am, am I dreaming, where I am even going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, my stranger from a distant land, are neglecting my order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geezer fails to control a rather loud chuckle. \"I am only kidding, <i>kidding</i> you see...and I apologize. I will tell you what I know, and then you must go, for things are growing dimmer by the minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo his tale begins.</span></div></div>",

As you can see, I am not armed, and I have not tried to harm you.  Whether you trust me or not, one thing is certain: if you stay here you will be found.  You must make haste and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back up in the tree and see the bird you had been following was no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bird was leading you astray.

Both of the elves were tall, slightly taller than you. They were slender, but tone. They both had long orange hair and beautiful green eyes, their tan skin had an angelic glow to it.<br>\r\n\"What did you do that for?\" the elf you had thrown said getting back on his feet. He dusted himself off. \"I was just trying to help you.\"<br>\r\n\"You were practically groping me,\" you say defensively but relaxing a little.

You don't know how much you should tell them. \"Where are you two headed?\"<br>\r\n\"The swamp,\" Lad says, if that's where you are headed then you should come with us. This is no place for a woman to be alone.\"<br>\r\nYou see that they both carried bows with arrows in a pouch on their backs. \"I don't know,\" you say, they both seemed friendly enough. <br>\r\n\"Here,\" Val says walking over to a large tree. He breaks off a branch and it changes in his hands. The piece of wood straightens, lengthens, and becomes a long black staff. He holds it out for you and you take it. It's smooth to the touch, and is very sturdy. <br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you say to him.<br>\r\n\"Come along then Dalia,\" Lad says already heading north.<br>\r\nShould you fallow them? They seem nice, and one of them even gave you a new weapon.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All beings began to drift to the far corners of Molgaetha.  The wizards settled in the far far north.  The orcs and the dark elves moved to the far east.  The good elves moved south. Humans inhabited the west.<br>\r\nThe Great Dark Forest was left empty, except for the faeries that took to the trees.  <br>\r\nThe beings of Molgaetha forgot their former peace.  Something happened to them as they left the Forest.  Some say they were faced with a decision...a path of choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoliloquy paused here as if something pained him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nYet, he continued, \"Depending on which path they chose they became either good or evil.  Their memories were erased and they forgot their former friends. The peace of Molgaetha vanished forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember your vision of the three paths, and wonder if that had anything to do with this path of choices Soliloquy was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soliloquy, why are the faeries crying?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is something I have yet to understand,\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you heading now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the northern border of the Great Dark Forest.

You suddenly remember reading a book about the pioneers and thier long journeys.  Inspecting the rock you are sitting on, you see grass on the back of it. From your readings this means that way is north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waste no time in beginning your journey, pleased with yourself for recalling such useful information!  Soon you come upon a well beaten path, following it as it meanders north.  The forest is peaceful and calm and you wonder what could possibly be frightening about this place, except for the fact that you are alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so engrossed in your thoughts, you are startled when you notice a shadow ahead.<br>\r\nCreeping slowly towards it, you begin to make out an unusual form sitting on a rock beside the path.  Upon closer inspection, you see it is a blue-green colored creature, only 3' tall.  He is turned so his side is facing you, but he does not seem hostile.  He is humming a strange little tune that seems to catch on the wind and dance to your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you speak to the creature?  Will you try to pass by, ignoring him?  Maybe you should divert your course altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This chapter was altered, and a combination of several chapters...thank you to \"poodle\" for contributing the creature idea.)</span></div></div>",

Soon, you find yourself at the edge of the forest looking out into a vast array of rocky, cavernous terrain.  You were instructed to go north and wait at the edge of the forest, and at the edge of the forest you were, but were you in the right location since you diverted course?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrill scream pierces the air, causing you to nearly jump out of your skin.  Looking up, a giant bird like creature is approaching.  As it nears, you can hardly believe your eyes.  It looks like a Terradactil!  It is approaching you at an alarming rate and you turn to run back into the forest.  You run for a dense patch of undergrowth, thinking the giant beast won't be able to reach you there.  You ignore the pain of the thorns digging into your skin and force your way inside the mess of vines and thin branches.  The beast follows, his screech so loud it makes your ears ring in pain.  He pecks at the undergrowth, gradually breaking and pulling pieces out to get to you.  He is succeeding faster than you had hoped as you struggle to escape out the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally managing to free yourself, you run farther into the forest, praying the beast does not follow.  However, he sees you and immediately abandons the undergrowth in favor of chasing a tasty meal (you!).  He has is just about to reach for you with his long beak as you duck, covering your head in one last feeble attempt to protect yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of feeling the pain of a sharp beak, you hear the beast screech and stop.  Looking behind you, you see a black cloud, where the beast must be.  No time to think this one through, you take your chance and run, climbing a tree and hiding among the branches and leaves.  You watch as the cloud slowly dissapates, revealing a very confused bird beast.  It shakes its head and turns to go out of the forest.  You sigh in relief, wondering what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a fellow traveler?\" a voice next to you asks, startling you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, an elf is behind you in the tree!  Your jaw drops in surprised, speechless as to what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark elf smiles, a handsome face with piercing green eyes and blue black hair streaming down his back like a river.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..y..yes,\" you stammer.  \"I think I'm okay.  Some nasty scratches perhaps.  Are you a traveler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.  And you are welcome for saving your life.  Do you not have any weapons or abilities to defend yourself with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you begin, still feeling stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you making your way to the Dark Castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was instructed to go north to the edge of the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"North?\" the elf asks with raised eyebrows.  \"I'm afraid you have veered off course, then.  This is east.  I expect you will be in danger here.  Would you like me to lead you north?  I could offer companionship and protection and then be on my own journey to the east.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told to be careful who I trust,\" you reply sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied smiling graciously, \"so was I!  We are in the same boat.  My name is Liam.  What is yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more at ease with the elf you begin to relax.  \"My name is Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we start our journey, Anna?\" the elf says, offering to help you descend down the tree.</span></div></div>",

As you both walk through the forest, he tells you his story of how he came to be here, which is much the same as yours, however he chose to be an elf with the powers of darkness on his side.  He has been experimenting and had only just learned how to do the dark cloud that he surrounded the beast with before he had to use it.  He had not seen any other travelers yet, so it was a comfort to find you.  He had noticed some other creatures in the forest, however, and there seemed to be no end to the surprises here.  You find Liam intriguing and interesting and you love to watch him move so agile over obstacles in his path.  His hooded cloak flowed behind him in waves of dark gray, so gracefully he wore it that it did not get hung up in stray branches or vines.  He moved silently through the forest, careful not to disturb it.  He had a beautiful grace about him that was mesmorizing.  The sun was close to setting as you approached the north edge of the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is the north edge,\" he said.  \"Looks like a lot of swamp.  I can't say I envy your path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say I do, either!  So, I hope whoever I'm supposed to meet shows up soon,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it will be getting dark soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" you ask.  \"You'll never make it back through the forest before nightfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I stay with you?\" he offered.  \"We will make a camp here together - you know, safety in numbers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that,\" you reply with a grin.  \"I feel much safer with you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Liam gather wood and stones for a fire and it isn't long before you both are snuggled together in front of the warm flames.  Liam put his cloak around your shoulders and arm around your waist to help keep you warm.  There was no lack of conversation between the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam, I wish we had chosen the same path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam smiled and his eyes glistened in the firelight, \"Yes, me too.  I like you.  It will be a shame to leave you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any changing our destination?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I do not know,\" he replied.  \"Maybe the wizard could, but I would not know how to summon him.  For now we should probably get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree and you and Liam settle down, snuggled together for warmth.  His warm, protective embrace leaves you feeling both energized and relaxed at the same time.  It takes a while for you to drift off to sleep, but when it comes it is sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning sun shining through the sparse trees awakens you both.  You both gather fruits and berries for breakfast.  Afterwards, you both walk to the edge of the forest.  Swamp as far as you can see to the left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you were told to just wait here?\" Liam asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you respond reluctantly.  \"Not an ideal place to be just hanging around.  So hopefully I'll get some instruction soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could always come with me,\" Liam suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes averted to the ground.  \"I'm not sure.  It's not that I don't want to be with you, it's more of that I don't know what will happen if I go with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither of us knows what will happen no matter what choice we make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could come with me?\" you suggest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam's eyes shine beautifully in the morning sun and you can sense his desire to be with you.  He is toying with the thought of staying with you.  His eyes are entrancing.  His lips, delectible.  And you can't help but switch your view back and forth between them.  You naturally lean in and Liam mirrors your actions, until your lips join in a tender kiss.  You feel a jolt of electricity down your spine as the energy from his kiss floods your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a bright light appears.  It is the wizard you saw initially.  He must be here on your account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have made it this far, young traveler.  Congratulations,\" the wizard spoke.  \"You now need to decide if you would like to join forces with the wizards or the humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they on the same side?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard looks sad, \"unfortunately, no.  You will have to choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Liam and question again, \"And what side is Liam on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you choose the humans, you will be in agreement with Liam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I accompany him?  Or can he accompany me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard thinks for a moment before replying, \"I could arrange this.  However, I cannot guarantee protection from any misunderstandings that may occur.  You would have your difficulties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I don't want to take sides?\" you ask.  \"This is not my war.  I didn't ask to come here or be a part of it.  What if I choose to remain neutral?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard looks somewhat surprised.  \"Do you really not have the heart for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, my heart is somewhere else,\" you say shyly, glancing at Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam smiles and takes your hand in his.  The wizard raises his eyebrows in interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam, what are your thoughts on the matter?\" the wizard inquires thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam pauses, taking it all in, before replying, \"I did not expect any of this, but I cannot deny I have feelings for her.  Can you not find someone else?  Do you really need us for this war?  And what good does it do when you don't even know what side people will choose?  You work for both your cause and the cause of the enemy.  What I would like is to return home to my life, as much as an adventure this is, and is appealing in many ways, I also know my life is at great risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard nodded, \"I will comply with your wishes.  Confirm your wishes and they will be so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It might seem I am being biased, as I am a wizard, however, I must remain neutral.  The humans and dark elves are scarring the land.  This world was once all beautiful and full of life.  The humans have polluted it and the dark elves have stripped it.  Entire river systems run dry in places.  Swamps have taken over large portions, souring the land.  Evil has been left to run unchecked in their territories, as they only care for themselves.  The wizards have always been the general overseers, and the woodland elves the gardeners, if you will.  But we all have to do our part, and there is only so much the woodland elves can do.  This time the humans and dark elves have gone too far and they are gradually expanding their death into the great forest, cutting down trees, burning sections off, damaging the land further for their own selfish gain.  If they are allowed to continue, the entire world will be covered in ruin in a matter of 5 years.  We want, at the very least, for their boundaries to be clear and halted from expanding.  At the most, we want restoration and peace.  The dark elves and humans will say this is all in the name of progress and they are only doing what is lucrative and beneficial to all. The humans develop medicines that help others, however, we already have a healthy system in place.  If they would stop polluting and damaging the place, they would not need medicines.  They won't listen of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam scowls.  \"Why did you not mention this previously.  I might have chose a different path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your inner nature chooses your path for you,\" the wizard replies. \"The path you have chosen suits you, even if you do not realize it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam scowled again, in disbelief.  \"I will prove you wrong, wizard.  I want to fight on the side of the wizards and woodland elves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard raised his eyebrows, \"that is noble.  So be it, but at your own risk.

Almost as soon as it came, it leaves and the light fades from the wizard's staff.  The wizard looks amused by your surprised expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you may journey to the far north to the wizards.  You will learn things on your journey and gain skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard produces a staff and hands it to you.  It looks like a regular walking stick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay safe, my friend,\" says the wizard as in a flash he is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Liam, \"well, that's that then.  I guess we should be going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except I'm hungry,\" he replied \"and we have still got a long way to go.  Let me find something for us to eat.  Why don't you start a fire and I will come back with something to cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good idea,\" you say, even though you are eager to get moving away from the smelly swamp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obligue Liam by starting a fire and constructing a rotissery .  It isn't long before he comes back with a few quail.  To your shock, they have already been plucked and prepared for cooking.  It didn't seem he had been gone long enough to do all of that.  You aren't sure you want to know how he did it so quickly.  You sit and chat while the birds are cooking, the smell of the roast makes your mouth water.  It also attracts a few unexpected guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear rustling in the forest.  Liam silences you with fingers to lips and peers into the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have company,\" he announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before the culprit of the noise makes an appearance.  It is a young woman with long light blond hair and crystal blue eyes.  She has a sweet face and her white clothes are dirty from her journey.  She looks happy to see you, but a little wary of Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I come in peace and all that,\" she says.  \"I'm a traveler.  Are you both travelers as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are,\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you introduce yourselves, the woman, Miranda, is eyeing the food, clearly famished.  Liam doesn't have a friendly look on his face.  However, you see no harm, after all, you gave him a chance, so why not another traveler?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry, Miranda?\" you ask the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very,\" she replies.  \"I haven't eaten since I came here a couple of days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may join us,\" you offer.  \"I'm sure there's enough for us all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam scowled, muttering, \"hardly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smiled feebly, slightly uncomfortable at Liam's passive objection.  The quails were not particularly big, so even though there was a quail each, it didn't quite satisfy the hunger.  It would have to do, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you journeying to, Miranda?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the wizards in the north,\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is where we are going as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looks puzzled, \"Oh?  Liam, you are going north?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he replies flatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you are a dark elf.  Shouldn't you be travelling a different direction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, but I've changed my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we do that?\" Miranda asks wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  Looking to change your course?\" Liam quizzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda shrugged, \"I'm just surprised is all.  I didn't expect that.  So, the wizard left you a dark elf.  Won't that be a complication heading north?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect it will, but if they are as wise as they say they are, they should be able to see my true intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda nodded in acceptance of Liam's theory as they finished up their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you two okay if I travel with you?\" Miranda asks.  \"This swamp doesn't look particularly friendly to cross.  Maybe if we work together we can make it easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember your power of flight, and wonder if you will be able to carry the others across.  Alternatively, there is plenty of wood to build a raft and cross that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The news is on, showing the destruction of ancient rain forests, extreme pollution and smog in cities filled with grey ugly boxes, babies being murdered because they are not the \"right\" gender, people being oppressed and abused, and to top it off taxes are being raised again.  You feel helpless against these things - powerless that you could make a difference.  You wonder if you could have made a difference in that dream world.  You think about Liam and sigh, turning off the television to try to dream again.</span></div></div>",

You run until the darkness consumes the forest and you can no longer see where you are going.  With no choice but to stop, you do.  You climb the nearest tree and secure yourself onto a large branch, figuring it is safer in the trees than on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night brings strange noises of all kinds.  Some sound human, most don't.  You didn't sleep particularly well, and as soon as the morning light came, you were down the tree on your way.  It was afternoon before you reached the edge of the forest and your stomach complains loudly for skipping meals.  You groan as you see a swamp.

Legend has it this was once a great river, but the forest was jealous and dammed it up on two ends, creating a stagnant, dead swampland.  Many disappearances have been attributed to this swamp.  Inhabitants: Unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther North:  The Cascading Mountains.  These snowy mountains are breathtaking, but a dangerous trek.  Inhabitants: Goblins and Dwarves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Further North:  The Empire of Light.  One of the destinations - a real jewel of a city.  Inhabitants:  Wizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorth East:  Ending of the Swamp of the Ghost River and beginning of a dried up river bed. Inhabitants: Unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther North East:  Undergound Caverns and rolling hillsides.  Inhabitants: Goblins in the caverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEast:  Underground Caverns and a dry riverbed.  Inhabitants: Goblins in the caverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther East:  Very rocky terrain that turns into deep valleys.  Inhabitants: Orcs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther East:  The Valley of Zar, one of the destinations.  A place full of shadows - better watch your back.  Inhabitants: Dark Elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouth East:  Forest until it runs out!  Ends in a mess.....Tree Miners.  Inhabitants: Orcs and Dark Elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther South East:  Rocky, dead terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouth:  Lush, dense forest all the way until you reach the village of Dan'ne Dale (or Dora Moore - depending on your story).  Inhabitants:  Woodland (good) Elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther South:  Deep hills and beautiful forest (not dark).  A giant, mighty river (The Great River) that splits 4 different times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther South:  The Rivers of Dan (all the forks in the Great river), one of the destinations.  Inhabitants:  Wise Elves<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouth West:  Forest that eventually ends in sharp, drastic cliffs.  A river is at the bottom of the cliffs (part of the Great river).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest:  Dry river bed with increasingly rocky terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther West:  Drastic cliffs and more rocky terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Further West:  The Dark Castle, one of the destinations.  Inhabitants: Humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorth West:  One end of the Swamp of the Ghost River and the beginning of a dry riverbed.  Inhabitants: Unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther North West:  Mines.  Inhabitants: Goblins and Dwarves.</td>",
