His cold fingers tremble a little unsteadily as they search the corpse, prying into the places most likely to hide treasures. Finally he stood up again with a grunt, his hands clutching his booty. The sky was getting light- he had to be at the soup kitchen soon for breakfast. Quickly, he stuffed his spoils away in the layers of greyed clothing he wore, and once more the body was left alone.</span></div></div>",

Despite the relative coolness of the morning, Beatrice Blakely\u2019s clothes were damp with the effects of exertion. Over the final few meters of approach, the professor could hear her labored breathing and, lastly, a startled gasp coming with the recognition of the dead body before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d She cried, shielding her face with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBea, I think he was murdered,\u201d Raynard said solemnly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe typically jolly woman began to cry and tremble uncontrollably. Having never laid eyes on the dead, Beatrice was unprepared to deal with seeing one of her own beloved colleagues\u2019 lifeless bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, heavens! Sweet Jehosaphat!\u201d She cried, \u201cI thought that was just another one of those coffins of yours, but it\u2019s Peter! It\u2019s PETER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t recognize him at first, either,\u201d Raynard said softly, as he knelt down to sweep the light covering of sand away from the corpse, \u201cWhat\u2019s Peter doing in Egypt? He\u2019s supposed to be back home meeting with the curator this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Peter Riley usually accompanied them on digs; his enthusiastic personality made what was normally laborious work exhilarating. After the discovery of what could possibly be the most significant find of the century, Peter had returned to London to meet with the curator of England\u2019s most prestigious museum, The British Museum. Their collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts was second to none, and Sir Henry Goldsworthy had been eager to see the veritable treasure trove they\u2019d recently unearthed. Now, Peter was dead, gravely overshadowing any triumph they\u2019d shared for their discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Professor Raynard revealed the last of Peter\u2019s rigid body, his eyes focused on a piece of fabric poking out of the ground a meter away. The small green fragment had been obscured by sand and well camouflaged by the surrounding vegetation. As he plucked it from the grainy soil, he noticed the dark, crimson stain smearing its frayed edges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this, Bea,\u201d He said, holding the torn fabric up to the rising light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice looked horrified to see the bloodied material. Peter\u2019s body, although lifeless, had no apparent wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould it.. could it be his blood?\u201d She asked with fresh tears welling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but the fabric certainly isn\u2019t from Peter\u2019s clothing. He\u2019s wearing a blue shirt and white trousers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaynard again knelt down at his friend\u2019s cadaver and slowly rolled it on its side. That\u2019s when he saw the cause of Peter\u2019s demise. A gaping gash sliced across the back of his balding skull, revealing the cranial bone it had once clung to. At the head of the trench below, the sand was sodden with Peter's blood.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Peter might still be alive\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor, as you can see, it was sent to Ismailia. That\u2019s over 100 kilometers up the Suez Canal. Look here,\u201d Tommy pointed to the address on the paper the professor was now waving in his face. \u201cThe messenger told me he went to that site yesterday, but Bridget\u2026 I mean Miss Adams\u2026 told him to find you here. He was real angry, too. Said this mistake cost him a day\u2019s wages\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Reynard said cutting him off. \u201cWhy on earth would Peter send it to the Ismailia excavation?\u201d Shaking his head, he extracted a handkerchief and wiped his damp brow. \u201cTommy, listen carefully. I need you to alert the authorities. Tell them there\u2019s been a murder.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d the boy said obediently. Then, delaying only a moment to steal one last hesitant glance at Peter\u2019s body, he hurried back toward the city of Suez. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReynard considered whether he should send Bea back with Tommy, but decided she\u2019d only slow the boy down. On foot, the trip from camp to Suez would take two hours, at least. He hoped Tommy would go straight there, and not get sidetracked. He\u2019d often thought the young man suffered from a short attention span, especially when the girls of Suez were around. He also prayed the police arrived swiftly. They were notorious for slacking off; spending their days playing cards and drinking stale, bitter coffee in the cafes on the main strip. At least they\u2019ll be easy to find, he thought dryly. Reynard looked uneasily at Peter\u2019s body, painfully aware that every minute that ticked over the sun\u2019s elevation continued to climb. In the heat of the day, in the middle of an Egyptian summer, the corpse would quickly decompose. He shuddered at the thought of seeing his friend\u2019s body decaying before his eyes and wondered how long it would be before the first vulture began circling overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts turned back to Peter\u2019s telegram and Sir Henry Goldsworthy. If he was in Egypt, where was he now? Did he wait at the train station with Peter? Was he the last to see him alive? And what was meant by the words \u2018Don\u2019t do anything for heaven\u2019s sakes\u2019? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of it makes sense, he thought, what am I missing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor, look!\u201d Bea said suddenly, pointing to the spot where she was standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small piece of metal protruding from the sand had met the morning sun with a glint of light. Reynard took a pen from his pocket and used it to pick up the gleaming metal object, revealing what looked to be a silver and gold Rolex watch. On closer inspection, though, he realized it was a fake - like those sold by many of the dubious looking vendors who littered the streets of Cairo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t Peter\u2019s, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d the professor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a knockoff. He was such a fan of good craftsmanship; I can\u2019t imagine him ever wearing an inferior timepiece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it belonged to whoever killed poor Peter,\u201d Bea offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally he would tease her playfully for such a silly response, something like \u2018Well done, Sherlock, nothing gets by you.\u2019, but he let the opportunity pass without a word; not even a raised eyebrow or knowing smirk passed through his somber demeanor. Bea was still visibly shaken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the clasp is broken. Perhaps you\u2019re right. Peter could have struggled with his killer before he died.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the preservation of fingerprints in mind, Reynard opened his leather tool case and grabbed a plastic envelope from the inside pocket. Using the pen, he gently inserted the watch and sealed the bag. Taking another sterile bag, he preserved the bloodied, green fabric within. As soon as the police arrived, he intended to hand them over for evidence. In the meantime, Reynard decided to comb the area for anything else that could help in the investigation. The Suez police force will need all the help they can get, he thought. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only problem with the crime scene being in the middle of the desert is that of all the sand, sand had a nasty habit of preserving any likely clues underneath itself. \"The perfect crime scene.\" He whispered to himself. <br>\r\nReynard turned to Beatrice who had now taken up residence on a stone quite a way from the body, she was taking a sip from her water bottle and wiping the tears from her eyes. He felt sorry for his PA, she was an innocent when it came to the horrors of the world and Reynard had a sneaky suspicion Bea had a soft spot for dear Peter. It must be hard for her to deal with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his suitcase Reynard extracted a brush, he had decided to treat this like he would his work. That was the only way he was going to find anything of value, and he had some time to kill before the Suez police would be here. Careful not to disturb the body, he didn't want to ruin any DNA evidence, Reynard knelt down in the sand and began brushing away the golden grit from around Peter that had obviously gathered up over him in the harsh winds of the desert overnight. He moved efficiently and conscientiously around the body, digging a little deeper with his hands if anything seemed amiss. He was about to finish when his fingers felt something hard beneath Peter's right leg. Reynard chucked his brush to one side and shifted the dead weight of Peter's leg away from the area. Pushing the sand away his fingers wrapped themselves around something cold, it felt like cardboard. Pulling the offending piece of evidence from it's hiding place Reynard sat back on his bottom to examine it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a matchbox from a hotel in Suez. The White Hall. He recognised the name, he was sure he must have stayed there on a previous dig. It was quite the swanky joint, it was quite popular with the tourists. The matchbox though wasn't just an ordinary freebie though, in gold leaf the letters V.I.P shimmered in the sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you found anything professor?\" The shadow of Beatrice poured over him blocking out the distinctive letters he had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we have a lead.\" Reynard smirked!</span></div></div>",

She must have been very poor as she lay in woolen garments, sodden and mouldy, instead of the new cotton dresses which didn't itch and infect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was beyond feeling now.  She was stone cold dead.

When he saw the lifeless shape of a woman, lying on the floor, he stopped running but he did not scream or cry.  At first he thought she was a drunkard, but sidling past cautiously, he saw the blank eyes and greying skin.  Even then, though he froze, he did not cry or scream.  He was only nine but this was not the first body he had seen.  He had watched in horror, just the other day, as the lady that collected up the thread from the floor with him got her dress caught in the terrifying machine.  She had been pulled up with the swing of it and the blood had dripped onto his little hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stared at her for a moment.  She had dirty blond hair like his mother but she was much prettier and her face was less angular.  He checked her for coins but she had none with her.  There was a necklace about her skinny neck though- odd as she looked like such a poor woman.  Uneasily touching her cold skin, the boy removed the neclace and studied its value.  <br>\r\nThe boy gasped.  Could it be real gold?  No, that is not possible- the woolen dress, the ill-fed thinness of her wrists- yet it shon like a tear in the sunlight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the tiny locket with his cleanest fingers and what he saw inside made him gasp once more.  It was a carving in some white material of a door.  The boy knew which door it was as many poor factory boys did.  It was the door of the orphanage with its cruel lion-head knocker.  </span></div></div>",

Hartship had a black top-hat and a long black cane in one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long way to the police-station, my boy...\" said Hartship, who had by now, calmed down enough to talk more like an uncle than a mean old businessman, \"what say you and I take a cab...come on...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out into the street, the man waved his cane at a passing cabby and blew his whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Cabbie!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black hansom cab pulled up at the curb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessuh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and the boy to the nearest police-station!\" Hartship said. He pressed some money into the cabdriver's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right sah!\" said the cabbie, \"hop in!...Come on now Beatrice...Yah!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTugging on the reins, the cabbie made his horse and cab do a jerky U-turn, and they took off to the nearest precinct...</span></div></div>",

Magick and Sorcery, recently reawakened by a fluctuation in the energies of Planet Earth, had been sabotaged. Outwitted, outsmarted! The year was 2015. The Place was in the former European Union. The crime was unsolved, warded against spiritual investigation by someone mighty enough to enforce his or her will upon even the best of us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was ticking, to abuse that proverb. Three ranking adepts were willed into investigating this murder before the Police would even be informed of it. Yet none of their powers could just breach the ward by which the killer or culprit was protected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adepts, as independent of each other they would like to work, would not be able to prevent a onetime personal meeting in this line of duty. Two Forces had high priority relevance in their investigation from the start. One was the Culprit or Killer, including the true motive, not just what police would be satisfied with. Second was finding out, what overtly powerful will-worker had made it inevitable to each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cast (choice of Protagonists) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian Pauper. Faction: Ashen Warlocks. Major Adept, 38 years old. Citizenship: German. Criminal Record: Clear. Favored Martial Art: Wing Shun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValeria Galsworthy. Faction: Witches of the Isles. Extraordinaire Minor Adept, 22 years old. Citizenship: British. Criminal Record: Cleared. Favored Martial Art: Muay Thai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis Monaural. Faction: Technocrats. Major Adept, 34 years old. Citizenship: French. Criminal Record: Cleared. Favored Martial Art: Savate-French Boxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the adepts acknowledge their presence to each other, each of them summons the memories and lore about the persons perceived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ashen Warlocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBound into the semi-criminal underbelly of society, the ashen warlocks have risen to a form of notoriety due besting members of most other factions and styles on occasion. Officially noticed only since 1910, they are considered a young faction. Pledging Loyalty to the Occult Lodge of Ur has reinforced the estimation, that all ashen warlocks are actually former criminals. Give the admiring undertone most of them have for assassins and assassination, that part was no real surprise. The Sorcery of the Ashen Warlocks is usually intuitively-quick, sometimes dirty or desperate and varies from specialists to versatile loners or covens. Ashen Warlocks are empirical, not too fond of theories or academic databases. Even though raised from criminals, they are fierce in upholding and enforcing their traditions. They are as well notorious for their intolerance towards anybody who did not earn an achievement. Ashen Warlocks believe, that proper initiation means to unlock the true potential a person has. They do not believe in: Anything which is craved just must be possible. Warlocks use Sorcery, even when they know Magick by book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWitches of the Isles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an ancient order they are wrapped in folklore and superstition. Celtic, that myth alone camouflaging plenty of truth. The Witches stem from a matriarchal society which was destroyed before modern civilization even noted its own history. They, as a faction, are actually as old as the islands they hail from. Many modern witches prefer academic backgrounds or corporate careers, though there is no duty to chose. The stereotype of the old village herbal woman is still fully accepted in their ranks. Witches tend to be overtly concerned with female rights, which is blessing as curse to them occasionally. Where Ashen Warlocks believe in 'culling failures' the Witches instead prefer tolerance. Though that has been blissful here and baleful there as well. As women are socialites by tendency there are supportive networks and subcultures spread all over the Planet. Witches are known to put the cause over mortal roles and morals on occasion. Witchcraft is a form of synthesis from Magick and Sorcery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnocrats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their primary focus on the use of modern technology this faction became the most famous since 1980. Often members do not even consider their magick to be magick it all. From that and similar stems the criticism of the Ashen Warlocks, that the genius of their ilk was corrupted by serving the same old masters for monetary comforts' sake, even where that results in abuse, elitism and stagnation. Traditionally Technocrats shun the Warlocks and view the Witches with contempt. High ideals, large-scale goals and comfortable positions in society have truly been proverbial blessing and curse to many Technocrats. While some conflicts with the Warlocks is historically noted, it remains a truism, that great Technocrats are felled by other great Technocrats. Technocrats use Magick as exclusively, as Warlocks do with Sorcery. Technocrat Magick is often known as Technomancy. The stain of fraud and computer hackers was countered by their own ilk; with a fluctuating degree of success, some would add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExemplified <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian allowed his senses to assess the environment. As soon as he sensed no threat from the other two persons in the vicinity. Clearly no suicide, yet no visible wound either. The thought that an unknown form of assassin had struck the woman down was not as wrong as he first suspected. Death by System-Shock. Whatever was done to the former living body was so forceful that it had made the body stop giving vital signs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValeria chanted a pledge of faith to Hecate, Lilith and others. Her right hand gestured, as if she would draw invisible symbols into the air around the corpse. Suddenly she took the cellular phone from her pocket and photographed the corpse from several different angles. The Killer IS male! The woman had died due brutal violation of an unknown sort. Even worth, the fiend had rejoiced in her death. Valeria struggled versus the nausea caused by her empathetic feedback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis frowned. The other two in their non-scientific approaches reminded too much of grandpa and grandma trying to keep up with progress. While he copied the data from the witches' cellular phone he focused repeatedly on the impressions of the crime scene and the corpse itself. A lethal shock seemed weird, yet possible. With all necessary data collected for later analysis he attuned his mind to the building itself. Cheap trick, the building as such was warded against divination to avoid that kind of prying eyes just as well, as technical surveillance.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Where will this story go next?
