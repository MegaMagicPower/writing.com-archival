His kitty says.<br>\r\n- Until tomorrow, my love. <br>\r\n- Yeah :)<br>\r\nHank leaves the room and see her parents at their room's door. They didnt liked Hank, he was a wolf, a canine and Tori was a feline. They hated canines, but Tori loved Hank no matter what.<br>\r\n- I am going, dont worry.<br>\r\nHe goes downstairs and leave the house. He gets in his car and leaves. Hank drives around the city a little, and drinks a little. After some drinking, he gets a little drunk and start to drive in the around of the city. <br>\r\n- Hehhe....argh...<br>\r\nHe drives at the train-line, where a train was parked on the way. It was just stopped there. Hank had no time to pull the break.<br>\r\n- AHHHHH!!<br>\r\nHe hits the train at full speed. The car is smashed but Hank manages to jump out of the car. The train falls on the car, crushing everything that hadnt been crushed.<br>\r\n- My car....argh...<br>\r\nBut when the train fell...something fell along with it. It was a big, around metal ball. It was green and it was the size of the car. <br>\r\nGiving a look better, Hank sees what it was.<br>\r\n- O_O OH MY GOD.<br>\r\nIt was a nuclear bomb, a missile. It was going at his direction. The frighted wolf get up and tries to run, but the when the bomb stopped....The whole hell broke free...<br>\r\nKA-BLAM !!!!!<br>\r\nHank felt his fur burning as his eyes and skin melted by the heat. <br>\r\n-AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!<br>\r\nIt was almost painless...almost. <br>\r\nHe fell and just closed his eyes for death...</span></div></div>",

Her eyes shine in hope of both food and water. <br>\r\nShe runs quickly to it and slowly opens the door. She check for any trap or raider, but nothing, soo she put her gun down.<br>\r\nTori start to search for some sort of water, but she finds only one bottle of dirty water and a can of backed beans.<br>\r\n- .......Fuck my life...<br>\r\nShe fix her clothes a little and start to eat the can of beans, maybe there was more but she was already tasting now. The taste of both water and beans start to give her hope for another day...<br>\r\nBOOM....BOOM....BOOM.<br>\r\nThe land shaken softly and Tori jumps under the table and starts to get ready for a fight...what was that ? Explosions ??<br>\r\nSuddenly, all the light disappears and she notice 2 big colones standing at side of the market. She was starting to feel afraid. <br>\r\nAnd the ceiling start to crack and Tori feel more exposed, wondering what the fuck is that.<br>\r\n- AH ! <br>\r\nAnd the floor start to float away, but as Tori see better, it was being dragged away ! <br>\r\nTo increase more of her surprise, the 2 big colones twist and she saw that it was a gigantic legs getting over the knees ! She suddenly see a big creature wandering around the stone, but...it was nothing more or less than a giant hand ! Tori tries to hide more but the hand suddenly hits the table by accident, making it fall and show her.<br>\r\nTori scream and cover her head with her arms, she knew that the creature would kill her or do horrible things with her.<br>\r\nBut she waits and waits and nothing. She feels the touch of a big and hard thing at her arms.<br>\r\n- Hey ! Hey, little one !<br>\r\nShe slowly put them down and look up.<br>\r\n- Why you are covering yourself with your arms ?<br>\r\nNow she see the giant's look...<br>\r\nHe was huge, very huge, around the 70 to 100, she couldnt really tell at that distance. She saw that its him by the look and he was a wolf, his eyes were brown-green. He wasnt wearing almost nothing, except for a leather holding a long and giant spear at his back and a lech-cloth that reached half-way to his knees, made of both animal's skin and some vegetation. He didnt had a scary look, not at all. He just seemed confused.<br>\r\n- I...I...You wont hurt me ?<br>\r\nHis voice was strong as a thunder.<br>\r\n- No...you are no threat to me at all. <br>\r\n- But...well...<br>\r\n- Afraid by my height ?<br>\r\n- Yeah....&gt;_&lt;'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am doing my work, as always, exploring the deeps of galaxy...Well...nothing new, The Centaurus is in peace and my mission is over.

The Lauros. <br>\r\n- Man...I can wait to get into Earth and rest, these space travels are driving me insane.<br>\r\nThe Lauros started to go at the same way that it took to come. <br>\r\n- ......<br>\r\nTori slowly closes her eyes and start to get into a fast sleep.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nTori awakes with the emergency alarm at her ear.<br>\r\n\" DANGER ! GRAVITY OF PLANET PULLING THE SHIP!\"<br>\r\n- O_O WHAT ?!<br>\r\nShe runs to the control and see that she was being dragged into a orange red planet...<br>\r\nThat planet was Purgus, the forgotten planet. <br>\r\nThis planet is nothing but a \"waste\". There it used to have a big and great civilization, but a giant asteroid came and destroyed every single life on the planet. Its almost completely desert.<br>\r\n- No !!<br>\r\nShe was trying everything but it wasnt working, the ship was being dragged more and more. <br>\r\n...There was no escape.<br>\r\nKA-BLAM !!<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n- Argh......<br>\r\nShe was alive...<br>\r\nTori see that she was on her chair, but turned over...in fact, the whole ship was turned down. The up was down and the down was up.<br>\r\nShe was ok, just a little pain here and there...but what about the ship ?<br>\r\nTori cuts her  seat belt and get out of the control room. She walks around her ship and sights...if she didnt had slept.<br>\r\n- What now...?!<br>\r\nShe could just call help. She returns to the control room and see that the radio had 2 troubles, no sight and was slightly broken.<br>\r\nTori sigh...now she couldnt go home anymore...unless she fix the radio. She had tools but she needed to find a source of energy. A diamond, a special one, would be enough to fill the energy meter and make the radio work and she could only pray to get a sight.<br>\r\nBut for that...she needs to go out. <br>\r\n-...I have no choice.<br>\r\nShe gets her laser gun and opens the external door slowly. <br>\r\nPurgus was indeed a strange place (just to not say \"horrible\"), there was only desert in miles and miles away. There was some ruins some miles away, some big rocks miles away, some craters. Tori was in the middle of a big  net of trouble...<br>\r\n- What I am going to do...? &gt;_&lt;...<br>\r\nShe walks around a little and uses one of her gadget and start scanning the area. There was nothing around beyond one thing, and it was coming at her direction !<br>\r\n- oh god !<br>\r\nShe knew that her ship wouldnt provide too much protection, soo she runs to behind a very big rock, close of her.<br>\r\nAs she stays there, behind the rock, the ground start to shake. <br>\r\n- O_O A earthquake ?<br>\r\nBut it came one by one. It wasnt a normal earthquake, it was something massive walking around.<br>\r\nTori spy out of the rock and what she see...its enormous.<br>\r\nAt side of her ship, there were one pair of feet and legs, as Tori looked up, she saw a gigantic wolf !<br>\r\n- What is this ?<br>\r\nThe wolf was around 100 ft tall. Her ship looked like a toy compared to him. He was wearing nothing beyond a big and long white blanket around his wast</span></div></div>",

He may sometimes be over protector, but that never bothers anyone.<br>\r\nTori Rose Moon is a average size persian cat, she have brown eyes and she loves her bf as well. She always felt safe with him. He is her \"hero\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both have 16 years and live peacefully with their lives...at least Hank start to grow for some reason. Now they have to deal with it, find a cure, talk about their relationship (lol) and stuff.<br>\r\nI love a good story. Soo much that I promise reward those who add a chapter (a good one). 300 GPs (it can get even higher if this gets far).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow rules...<br>\r\nI like giant/giantess stuff (more giantess but I am trying something new), but not in a sexual way. Soo, if you REALLY needs to put something \"down below\", do it soft. ( if it gets very hard, I will delete/edit)<br>\r\nNo gay/bisexual stuff. I hate that.<br>\r\nHank can both live forever as a giant, shrink back (both forever, ending the story, or temporary).<br>\r\nTori can grow as well but there have to be a good reason.<br>\r\nNo dead ends.<br>\r\nNo very short chapters ( the ones like \"male or female\" are ok, but only these kind)<br>\r\nHank can grow in any method possible (you can go cliche on that).<br>\r\nI really like a good story :)<br>\r\nThis is for everyone's enjoyment, soo dont do like these jerks that make those dump ass chapters like \" THEN HE DID THAT GROSS THING ! THE END\"...XP Its VERY annoying. I will delete right away.<br>\r\nOH AND PLEASE, RATE AND REVIEW ! <br>\r\nADD FOR THIS STORY, PLEASE. WE SHALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS BIG !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:D Enjoy, that is the reason of WHY you here ^^</td>",
