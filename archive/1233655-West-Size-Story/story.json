But you can beat yourself up over it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, priority one is avoiding being stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot of the until-right-now not scary paperboy crashes down nearby, and you throw yourself into the thick grass of your front garden (now you're glad you didn't bother mowing it yesterday) to shelter from his careless path of destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must be the size of an insect, and yet the device is still regular-sized, rendering it completely inoperable by you at your present scale.  Looking back, wincing inwardly at every one of the young giant's thunderous footfalls, you notice that the device is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?  But how -  No, it doesn't matter.  There'll be time enough to find it later.  For now, you'e going to have to try and find a regular-sized person to help you out of this predicament.  And for that you have several options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obvious one is the paper boy.  You've had issues with him in the past, with him breaking the window once with a carelessly tossed Local Times, but there's no one nearer that you can think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being in your own front garden you could endeavour to find someway back into the house, where you're comfortable and familiar, and try to make use of your own telephone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the house is so formidable now, and you did close your door behind you (again, in your head: Stupid!).  Perhaps now would be a good time to go and re-acquaint yourself with the next-door neighbours?  They seem like friendly sorts, and even if they did refuse to invite you to their last barbecue they couldn't possibly turn their backs on someone so vulnerable, could they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, you could cast your gaze further, across the street.  There's that young woman who recently moved in, living alone, who you've had your eye on for some time.  She's so beautiful, but you've never worked up the courage to ask her out.  This may be strange, but it's certainly a good opening line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final option would be to march out into the street and see what random people the day brings you while you try and find out where the gun went all on your tiny lonersome.  Yeah, good luck with that if you try it.</span></div></div>",

Well, you are owed some good luck after being shrunk to the size of a beetle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You could run over there and climb up Gina and shout for help in her ear. As you began to go a bit closer in, her sheer size sinks in. She's a vast goddess high above you. Everything about her is magnified. You can smell her sweat, her breathing is loud and deep and seems to fill the world. Her hand is so much bigger than your entire body and you can see the pores of her skin and and the whorls and indentations of her fingertips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She moans in her sleep and shifts like a thunderstorm in the heavens and the sound of her huge moan terrifies and thrills you. Her hand sails past you and her foot falls down to the floor some way off. Your heart is racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Oh shit! You need the toilet! <br>\r\n No, you don't, you tell yourself, it's nerves.

She maybe tiny, but you can still clearly make out her features, she's only twelve years old and a pretty kid. She has long brunette hair, blue eyes, and a slim figure. Because of the way she is dressed, you figure she was headed out to meet her friends before the accident happened. She is currently wearing some kind of hot pink mini skirt, and a nice white dress shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she lies there in the palm of your hand, you start to feel a sense of power, power that you have never felt before. You then hear a noble voice in your head saying, knock it off, she's just a little girl. A little girl becoming a woman, a pretty, and tiny woman, who would know. Seriously, who would know? Nobody saw her shrink, and even if they did, the cops would never believe them, a dark, lustful voice in your head screams out.

However, try as he might he could not increase the pencils size, only shrink it. He also found two similar buttons that do not seem to do anything. Until he zapped a nearby bonsai tree on another desk. That is when this dastardly duo soon discovers the other two buttons are shrink and restore also, but those buttons only work on living organic matter. Nothing inorganic like clothes will shrink or be restored with those buttons. \u201cStrange, two sets of buttons that perform the same task, but one set works on clothes and cars, while the other set only works on living creatures,\u201d Vince tells you as he scratches his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You watch Vince points the gun at the ant size white girl and presses a button. You watch as the girl is engulfed by light and slowly begins to get bigger. The girl seems dizzy as she stumbles around, but you notice something else too. You both see all of her clothes vanishing from her lovely tween body. A few seconds later, she is a little over two inches tall, and naked as the day she was born when Vince stops firing. The girl is still dizzy as she stands there completely naked before you and you can now see every part of the tiny brunette girls exposed body. You can see a very small patch of black hair in-between her lovely legs. You can also see she has perky, budding breasts, and slightly curvy hips. She is nearly irresistible, you think to yourself, and judging by the bulge in Vince\u2019s pants, he is thinking the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tiny girl is still dizzy but without delay realizes she is buck-naked. She also sees two giant men looking her over with lust in their eyes. Naturally, the girl kneels down and attempts to hide her developing breasts from your view by wrapping her arms over her chest. As the action figure size girl hides her privates from your view, Vince seems to be making a play for her. A small argument ensues but reason prevails, and you two decide to put Clara away for now as you two go out to hunt down some more toys. You safely place the 2-inch or 5.1 cm tall girl inside an empty hamster cage for now. The two of you grab an empty book bag, some empty specimen jars, a butterfly net, and leave the college. It would be stupid for you two to obtain specimens here; there are too many security cameras around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After they leave the campus, these two mighty hunters go where?</span></div></div>",

The door is open and next to it are a pair of large worn ladies trainers, obviously belonging to Maria Purdey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria is a single mother of three. A large lady of about forty with a mediterranian look about her. An evil thought occurs to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously move aside the broken fence panel and sneak into her garden up to her shoes. Your heart is racing, out of fear of getting caught and guilt over what you're doing, but you feel sickly excited with the power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainers have been recently worn and are warm. They are dirty and old and smell of Mrs Purdey's feet. They are big too, looking inside at the dirty insole you can just make out almost worn away the number '10'. Too big even for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny shrunken girl (Clara a quiet voice whispers to you in your mind) is still, knocked out by the rapid acceleration of being lifted and carried about. She stirs restlessly with what sounds like a tiny tweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling dirty and heart thumping you tip her into the big right shoe, and she rolls a little way inside where she can't be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you rush back through the fence and replace the panel, suddenly terrified of being caught! You barely have time to finish before Maria Purdey returns to her garden!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou duck down and peer under the fence, heart jack-hammering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this low angle on a slope leading up to the floor of the Purdey garden you have an ant's (Clara's?) eye view of Maria Purdey and you can't help but be impressed by her, though she's no model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a hot sunny day, and she is dressed for it wearing only a blue bikini which her voluptuous body spills out of, glistening with sweat, large sunglasses jewelry, a wide brimmed straw hat. She carries a large green watering can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look at her suddenly very big, very dangerous and suddenly frightening bare feet as she steps down next to her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start, as you think of Clara in one of them, and how fragile she is next to that massive sweaty foot. You feel guilt stab up at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you doing??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Purdey sits on the back step, only a few feet away from you putting the can down next to her. She reaches for her shoes... </span></div></div>",

She looks up at you; leaving the right shoe laying on the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello young man. I wasn't expecting company as you can see.

You aren't quite sure whether to laugh, or freak out.

It is Clara! God knows how many times she has made that attempt since you put her in there! This  time ends in failure like her previous attempts, and you see her fall down on her ass, and try once more. She tries to jump, but the wall of the shoe is too high.

You aren't sure whether Clara was still in it, or if she had been knocked out during the struggle and was lost somewhere within the long blades of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, your best bet is that she is still inside the shoe and getting that is still your priority. However, there is one tiny problem... You are still on your knees and look up to see the enormous bikini clad woman standing before you with her hands on her hips. You crane your neck even higher and see that her face has a very pissed off look on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had better explain yourself, young man.\" she says with piercing dark eyes that seem to penetrate your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stutter as you try to explain your actions: \"I... uh...

Tell me!\" She commands with her powerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to tell her you seen something, but if she finds out it is a tiny girl there will be hell to pay.

She may just think you are nuts, or she may be intrigued and take a look. At less than a half inch tall, Clara may even be too small to explain her situation (and your responsibility for it) to the giant woman. Maybe she doesn't even remember anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet on the other hand, you aren't even sure she is still inside the shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving made your decision, you look up to the tall voluptuous and slightly scary woman and say: \"When I looked inside your shoe I noticed what appeared to be...\"</span></div></div>",

All the other adults are in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it is difficult to make out from the baggy clothes and makeup, you can kinda tell that the more diminuitive blue-haired clown is a woman. She is standing there not doing much at the moment. The other clown is larger and has a wig of bright green hair. His face and costume are made up in a style that is typical of clowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as he crafts long inflated balloons into various animal shapes. One child (who you presume to be the birthday boy) does not appear to be amused by this, as indicated by the bitter expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing this, the large clown bends down in the face of the kid and says in an obnoxious sounding voice that clowns have, \"Aw, what is the matter William? I think you need to cool off.\" As he said this, he squirted the kid in the eye with his flower lapel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the kids laughed at this, but William did not look amused. The green haired clown tried a different tactic, and recited a joke in his obnoxious voice, \"Does anyone here know what you always get on your birthday?\" There was a moment of silence, as no one knew the answer. The clown then said, \"Another year older!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the younger children laughed, but most were not amused by this and some began to leave. So the slightly smaller evidently female clown with the blue wig produced a miniature unicycle from her oversized pants pocket and began pedaling it around. This kept most of the kids from getting bored and leaving, but their antics were still pretty dull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh to yourself as you think of a way you can add some hilarity to young William's birthday party.

The tiny 10-year-old is scared to death as she shivers in the palm of your enormous hand. At her size, you can still see some of her features. She has long strawberry blonde hair, fair skin, and an athletic, well-defined body for her age. Feeling a bit sorry for her but at the same time not wanting to be caught, you use the shrink gun and increase her size to nearly 3 inches or 7.6 cm tall. However, you pressed a new button that makes her nearly 3 inches tall, but unfortunately, it also vaporizes all of her clothes. The tiny scared girl naturally squeals in embarrassment and attempts to hide her privates from your lustful gaze. Curiosity however gets the better of you, and you naturally check her out, thinking she has a nice ass. Then it hits you, not only did you shrink the little girl, but also she is completely naked now. Great, they will send me away to prison for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lust is replaced by panic, and some stupidity. You place the scared naked girl in your shirt pocket and look for a place to safely put her. You could eat her but decide against it for now. You see a nearby fence that surrounds the local university and you decide to get rid of her there. There is also a pet store next door. You are about to leave her there, when for some strange reason you want her to have some company. You quickly look around and see an 11-year-old white boy that looks a lot like her walking around. The boy has blonde hair too, and he has a lean, well-defined body. Maybe he is the girl\u2019s older brother or just a local kid he did not recognize. You still do not know everybody in the neighborhood. You also see the girl\u2019s mom, a gorgeous 32-year-old white woman walking around looking for her. The girl\u2019s mom is named Amber, and she has blonde hair and a healthy body too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the boy walks around the area, you see Amber walking over to the young boy and a teenage couple also. The couple is in their early teens you think, and they are out for a walk. The young couple is white and attractive. As the four people stand around looking over at you, you panic, point the gun at them, and fire. A second later, they all vanish. You run over to them, and look down to see four tiny 3-inch tall people staggering around. They are still clothed, so you point the gun at them again, press the new button and all of their clothes vanish from sight, but they are still around 3 inches tall. As the four tiny naked people panic, you gently grab them and release them near the fence. You release Clara too and she joins the group. You watch as all five of the nearly 3 inch tall humans run through the grass together in their birthday suites towards an uncertain fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n At this point, we follow whom?</span></div></div>",

Her husband, Jim, and her other children were in the house watching tv and none of them noticed the nearby flash. Except for Cindy. Cindy was the eldest of April's children, at 20, but she was born mentally handicapped. To all who looked at her, she was a normal looking woman, but she had the limited mind of a small child and was unable to speak and required a diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collins' yard was fenced in, and it was normally impossible for Cindy to wander out onto the road, but today something strange happened and half the yard (including the house and all inside it) mysteriously disappeared. Cindy took this opportunity to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed before anyone noticed. It wasn't until her slightly younger sister Amy, who was lounging in the pool, had tried changing the radio to the local station and noticed it didn't come in that she looked over and seen that the entire town, including their house and half their yard, was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Our house disappeared! The entire town is gone!\", Amy cried out and jumped out of the pool. Her body was dripping chlorinated water, and visibly trembling from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril was getting the cleaning the grill out for the BBQ when she heard her daughter shouting. Her jaw dropped from the shock of what she seen when she turned around. Most of their backyard was intact, but not far from their house, and for nearly as far as the eye could see, everything was missing. The roads, houses, businesses, everything. But she could see that her mentally handicapped daughter had wandered off near the center of the circle of nothing. \"Cindy!\", she screamed in fear. Dropping what she was doing, she ran off towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy followed close behind; her long blonde hair and green two-piece bathing suit created a trail of chlorinated pool water in her wake as it cascaded down from her running body. As she and her mother got within about 50 ft of Cindy they could see what happened to the town. It didn't disappear; it had shrunk! Most homes weren't much larger than a pack of cigarettes, and the miniature people were no bigger than ants! The two looked on in horror as Cindy reached for something that caught her attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim Collins and his kids had been indoors watching a sitcom as his wife and two daughters got things in order for the BBQ Jim was preparing to host. The show they were viewing whoever was interrupted by a flash that Jim noticed out the window with the corner of his eye. At that same moment, the tv and all electrical appliances in the house went dead as if the power went out. He went to the basement to check the fuse box, but seen that to be in order and was heading back upstairs when the whole house started to shake. He got upstairs and looked out the window and nearly fainted at what he seen. It was his daughter, Cindy, but she was huge! Big, or maybe even bigger than the largest mountain! Jim's kids, who were also in the house, screamed in terror at the sight of their enormous older sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal girl looked around with curiousity at the spectacle of a miniature town in front of her, thinking it was nothing more than a toy for her amusement. One of the tiny houses in particular soon caught her attention. It kinda reminded her of her own home, and with a smile she reached for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim added his voice to the chorus of screams as his daughter's green eyes locked directly onto him, and her enormous hand reached down. The house shook and made various sounds as it was uprooted from its foundation and lifted hundreds of feet into the sky before the smiling face of Cindy. She looked it over for a moment, but not knowing what else to do with it she opened her mouth and shoved the house inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Cindy! Put us down, our home is not a toy!\" Jim screamed, as he and his home were shoved into her cavernous maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's mouth began to involuntarily salivate as her pallate experienced the unfamiliar taste of the shrunken structure. Unlike wood or siding in their normal state, the shrunken materials dissolved easily in the powerful acids of her saliva. Jim and his children could see some of Cindy's and her gums with the small amount of light that poured in from outside. Adding to their fear, they noted that each molar was larger than a car, and there were ropes of spittle that could hold up a suspension bridge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do, the giant girl began to bite down on her toy. The house began to buckle and split apart, and Jim and his kids huddled together in the center of the room as debris fell around them from the collapsing ceiling, and saliva began to ooze in from the crushed walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy didn't like the bitter taste of the house, so she rid her mouth of it by...</span></div></div>",
