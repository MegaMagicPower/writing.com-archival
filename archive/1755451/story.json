Just a normal day of their blissful lives that gone haywire. One after another, they opened their eyes. They found themselves trapped inside separate jars. They looked up to see the limited air they were given. Each try to understand what has happened to them. Some panicked, some fainted, and just some didn't even care. They were shrunk to the sizes of ants. They couldn't put all the clues together, but they did find out something unusual. They look around the room, noticing the awkward presence of being there before.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Michael?\" Asked Otto.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. I know. We all been here before. But could it possibly be her room?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course! Just look around. The walls are pink. The posters resemble her favorite things. There are even pictures of her!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cool it, Otto.\" Yelled Jose. \"If you lose your cool, then problems would keep coming. So whatever the reason, keep your cool. You understand?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, bro.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good. How's Chris and Connor doing over there, Michael?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They're still unconscious, but I think they'll get out of it sooner or later. Right now we need to think of what going on and how we're going to get out of this.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What they didn't expect was the door unlocking. Michael, Otto, and Jose watched as the door opened. They stared at the people like they were alien fugitives.They couldn't believe it was actually real. The truth busted through the door, and all five of their best girl friends were part of this. They we humongous, and looking mighty sexy for their eyes only. Rebecca was the first to come in, since this was apparently her room to begin with. None of the guys never thought this would happen to them. Did they do anything wrong? it was too soon to tell.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WELL, WELL, WELL. LOOK WHAT WE GOT HERE, GIRLS. A COUPLE OF FOOLS TRAPPED IN JARS.\" Rebecca teased. \"I'M REAL SORRY WE HAD TO DO THIS, BUT YOU GUYS WERE JUST PERFECT FOR THE JOB.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you going to do with us?\" Jose screamed. Donna stepped up, and shook his jar uncontrollably, scaring him and making him fall to his butt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"CALM DOWN, DONNA. YOU'LL SOON BE ABLE TO COMMAND HIM LATER.\" Rebecca then walked over to Michael's jar. \"HI, MIKEY. HOW ARE YOU FEELING TONIGHT?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh. I'm alright. Just bored.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OKAY. MARIAN, SHAKE THOSE JARS TO WAKE THE LAST TWO GUYS UP.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"ALL RIGHT.\" Marian stepped out of line, and shook the jars in a fast swirling motion. She picked them up and pummeled them back down. In a matter of seconds, Connor and Chris were getting up from their panic attack to see their friends in tiny form, and their girl friends in mega form.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's going on?!\" Connor screamed. He was never used to surprises such as these. \"Why are we so small?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry about it, Connor. Just play along, and everything will be fine.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure, Jose?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ANYWAYS,\" Rebecca interrupted, \"IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT, AND MY GIRLS NEED TO GET HOME. SO NOW WE DECIDE WHO GETS TO GO WITH WHO TONIGHT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each girl grabbed a jar of each guy and placed them on the ground. Then they saw Rebecca go through her closet, pulling out an empty bottle of coke. It was set in the middle, and the girls all formed a mini-circle around it. Then Rebecca started with the announcement.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"THESE RULES ARE ONLY GOING TO BE SAID ONCE, SO LISTEN UP. THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE A BACHELOR GAME, WHERE I PULL A JAR UP, AND US GIRLS HAVE TO DECIDE IF WE WANT HIM OR NOT. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE CHOOSERS, THEN WE PLACE THE LITTLE GUY IN THE BOTTLE, AND SPIN HIM UNTIL IT CHOOSES AT RANDOM. ANY QUESTIONS?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do.\" Otto raised his hand, thinking he'd actually get a say in this. \"Do we get any say in this?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OF COURSE NOT! SLAVES DON'T GET ANY SAY IN ANYTHING. NOW BE QUIET, AND LET THE GAMES BEGIN!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grabbed Michael, who was the first in line. He couldn't help but look a little satisfied. He's been wanting a little bit of excitement all his life, but was this the kind he wanted? He wiped his smile once he was fully raised.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"NOW, DOES ANYBODY WANT HIM?\" None of the girls raised their hand. They looked at him with a disgusted face. It was too embarrassing for him to see nobody wanted him. \"WELL THEN, IT'S OFF TO-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'LL TAKE HIM!\" They all turned to Marian, who quickly rose her hand up high. This was surprise to everyone, but the feeling slipped away quickly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"AND NOW MICHAEL OFFICIALLY BELONGS TO MARIAN!\" She gave Marian Michael's jar, and she looked at it all astounded and such.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"ALL RIGHT. NEXT WE HAVE...\" She pulls out the next one, which was Otto. \"OTTO!\" The only one who rose her hand was Kelly. It wasn't much of a surprise. They were always together even when he was big.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"NEXT UP IS JOSE!\" This was the one who doubled the other captives's votes. Rebecca and Donna rose their hand high.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"REBECCA, YOU SAID I WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL HIM.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"YOU WOULD. AS LONG AS YOU WIN THE BOTTLE CHALLENGE.\" She opened Jose's lid, and poured him into the coke bottle, tightening the cap to conceal him. She then twisted the bottle with great strength. Jose couldn't keep his balance within, and just collapsed by the velocity. Eventually, it stopped, and the bottle pointed to Donna.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"YES! I WIN! WHICH MEANS HE'S ALL MINE!\" She grabbed his jar, and poured him out back to his jail cell. She looked at him with a devilish grin, but Jose tried not to look so frightened.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"MOVING ON, WE HAVE CONNER OVER HERE.\" Then Selphie raised her hand. She hasn't said a word all night. Also, she was too difficult to get along with. How was Connor going to put up with that?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"AND THE LAST JAR, CHRIS, GOES TO ME.\" She didn't seem very enthusiastic about it. She lost Jose to Donna, but at least she didn't go empty-handed. Four honks were outside the house, and the rest of the girls had to leave.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"LOOK LIKE IT'S TIME FOR YOU GUYS TO LEAVE. REMEMBER ONE THING: THESE GUYS ARE SHRUNKEN FOR SLAVE PURPOSES. IF THEY DON'T COOPERATE, THEN JUST TEACH THEM A LESSON. SOONER OR LATER, THEY WILL BREAK AND BEGIN TO SEE US AS MASTERS. SO GOOD LUCK, AND WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER SOME OTHER TIME. GOODNIGHT.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"SEE YA, REBECCA!\" They all said in unison. Then they all left to their homes, and thus began each guy's torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Michael couldn't help but feel excited for what has happened to him. He's never felt this much excitement in his entire life. His routine of getting up, going to school, harassed by bullies, given tons of boring lectures and homework, leaving school to do those homework, then going to sleep to restart the day was ultimate boredom. Each day, he would get more and more depressed about how much his life sucks and that there was no adventures like the ones he saw on t.v. He was ready to finish off his life in a matter or days because he thought that heaven would be more funner. He couldn't go back to living his old life because that would increase his boredom. This all changed when he was shrunken down to an inch. When he noticed his predicament, he didn't worry or cowered in fear. Instead, he embraced this opportunity of having that sense of excitement in his life. Being a captive to one of his girl friends, exploring her home in a new perspective; Michael couldn't be anymore excited. All he could think about was how his new life was going to bring him in the future. What kinds of people and areas he might see and explore. The limitless thoughts were just too much for him to take in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marian entered the car with Michael in her hand. She never agreed to this kind of thing. She's Rebecca's best friend, but didn't have anything in common. This thought of shrinking down men for slave purposes was preposterous. She tried to talk Rebecca out of it, but her head was too filled up about Michael. Even since they met, she has grown to like Michael, despite his negativity. She would try to spend as much time with him as possible, but he would always turn his back on her. Now with this whole shrinking deal, Michael is in trouble. Michael could've been tortured and misused by any of the other girls. Marian had no choice but to choose Michael, only to protect him. She thought that Michael didn't deserve any of the trouble to Rebecca has caused. Once she got home, she would tell Michael that he was to be let go and live freely, thinking that it would please him and become more friendly with her. She was determined to help Michael any way possible, starting by figuring out how to turn him back to normal. Back into the tall guy he used to be.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The car ride was very bumpy, and Marian's was a ten-minute drive. There was silence in the car, being that it was midnight and everyone was beginning to feel sleepy and groggy. Michael was resting his head on the cold jar as Marian stared. The night was young, and the full moon was glowing brightly. Michael tried to sleep, but couldn't help wonder about what's going to happen to his friends. He knows that they don't like the taste of adventure, so they might disapprove the situation. He couldn't imagine how they would react if he told them that he liked being like this. All tiny and becoming someone's owner. They would probably laugh or get frustrated. He didn't care. Until that moment comes when they all reunite again, he'll make the most of it and try to enjoy as much as he can.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The car finally made a immediate pause. They were finally home, as both driver and passenger got out. Even from within the jar, Michael could feel the chill of the winter's breeze. He tried to find some warmth, but there was nothing in the jar except himself. When he entered her home, he was surprised by the decors. This was the first time he was even in Marian's home, and resembled it to his. The walls were a fusion of pick and green, followed by painting and fine china hanging of many style's of Puerto Rican art. The living room was organized with three sofas and a t.v against the wall. It has two floors, a pool and hot tub on the outside, and a green house nearby. This became a perfect place to explore and create massive stories to tell.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marian went up to her room, and inside, it was all fluffy and soft. It was more like a 6-year-old's dream room. The bed and carpet were all cottony and soft, while the walls were sturdy and hard. She lifted the jar up high. He could see through her outside window, pointing out to her backyard. In was seconds before Michael realized that he was hovering over an empty hamster cage. She tipped the jar over, and he pummeled into her hand. She gently places him down into his new home. There was a slide, and the ground was already filled with pellets for comfort. The water can was dripping with apple juice, and the bowl was filled with trail mix. This looked like a fun place to be.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"DO YOU LIKE IT? IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FINISH IT, BUT I THOUGHT THAT YOU DESERVED THE BEST.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you kidding? Marian, this is, like, the best thing you've ever given me. This is really awesome. Thank you!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"YOUR WELCOME. NOW THAT'S ONLY YOUR TEMPORARY HOME. I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING YOU BACK TO NORMAL SIZE.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That's when Michael began to feel his feelings sink. He didn't want to go back to the normal, dull life he used to live. Instead, he was actually ready to make a fresh start and finally do what he has failed to do before: Enjoy life as it is. He didn't know how Marian would react if he refused to get help, but if  he didn't say anything, then he would have  something to regret for the rest of his life. He finally spoke up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, but no.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I mean that I don't want to go back to normal.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WAIT A MINUTE. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO BE LIKE THIS?\" Marian couldn't help but laugh. She thought it was a joke at first, but once she saw that he made no attempts to chuckle alongside her, she noticed that he was serious. \"YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS! DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG A SMALL, LIVING THING LIKE YOU LAST? NOT VERY LONG, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME RISKS AS A TINY ANT.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't care.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"BUT WHY? WHY WOULD YOU WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Marian, this is what I've been craving for my whole life. I always wanted to get a taste of adventure and exploration. I hated my old life. It was always the same everyday, and nothing ever got better. Until this whole shrinking happened, I haven't felt depressed or anything. Please let me have this.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marian just looked at Michael like he was nuts. She still couldn't believe that what he was saying was true, and she didn't really want to take care of him. She was feeling hot-headed and stressed. \"YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME DECIDE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH YOU. I'LL BE IN THE SHOWER TAKING A BATH. I'LL TRY TO CONSIDER YOUR OFFER AND SEE IF I LIKE IT. IN THE MEANTIME, STAY IN HERE AND WAIT UNTIL I COME BACK.\" She dug into her closet to grab a towel, and closed the door as she walked out. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Five minutes already passed, and Michael was feeling bored already...</span></div></div>",

Why should he waiting for Marian, who really wants him to change back into the guy he used to be? She might even decline his offer and just turn him back to normal by force. He was happy being tiny, and didn't want anyone to stop him. He needed to get out. He didn't know where he was going, nor what he was going to do, but at least he would be happy doing it. He tried to look for a way out, and the lid had a small opening on the right corner. Marian could walk in any minute, so he tried his best to get out. He climbed up the sliding tube, making it to the second floor. The opening was too far, and there was no way to get across. He kept looking, and finally found a ledge just narrow enough for him to slip his hands in and side climb. He stuck his fingers inside, and picked himself off his feet. He began to climb, but without any notice, he could already feel his fingers cramping. They were getting sweaty, thus making it less easy to get any farther. He picked up the pace, and was finally underneath the opening. He climbed up, and jumped out landing on the table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once he hit the table surface, his adrenaline boosted. He couldn't stop feeling so excited from being on his own. He smelled the fresh scent of Marian, and made new observations to her room. He jumped around in glee, hoping the fun would never end. He found line of yarn hanging from the table and used that as an escape attempt. He climbed down as if it were a mountain. He landed on the ground, and bringing down the rest of the yarn with him. With a thud, it smacked down on the ground and started to chase and squish him flat. Eventually it stopped, and Michael ended up in the middle of the room. He's never felt so alive and free. Even if his friends were here, it wouldn't have changed his mind from taking an adventure. He look in front of him where the door stood. He that once he left that door, there would be nothing but risky choices. He would probably screw up into situations that would require logic thinking. He's will probably meet many kinds of people, who can either help him or kill him. With the world becoming larger, nothing's the same anymore.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He ran up to the door, ready to leave Marian's room. After a few more steps, the doorknob was twisting. Michael his alongside the wall as Marian entered again. She was wet, with a towel wrapped around her body. Water droplets were dropping around Michael, as he tried to avoid being hit. He got soaked a few times, but it didn't blow his cover. She close the door behind her and walked over to the hamster cage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"LISTEN, MICHAEL. I'VE BEEN THINKING, AND I THINK THAT...\" She stopped her words and started to search through the cage. This was the signal for Michael to escape before she checks the floor. \"DAMN IT, MICHAEL. I'M TOO TIRED TO LOOK.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is going to be fun!\" He left the room, and ended up in the hallway. He had a unlimited amount of opportunities of places to go, people to see, and thing to do. He didn't know where to begin, so he just made a random decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

This whole new life of being tiny and serving a giant was too much to handle for him. It would've been less scary if Michael was there with him. They've been best friend for so long, and now they were finally split. Otto never had trouble making friends. He would make a good first impression every single time. His moral belief was that everyone should join together and become friends. Now at his height, it was hard for him to keep believing in that. He was glad that Kelly choose him. He thought that she might go easy on him, and probably find a way to change him back. She was always so nice, and she always wanted to be around him. They became real good friends in a matter or minutes. He remembered when they met on the bus, and she asked to sit with him. They would keep on talking all the way to the bus ramp, and even got on their cell phones to talk. Now that he was tiny, he could only rely on her to take care of him until he's back to normal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kelly was so excited that she made a tiny squeal only a mouse could hear. This had become one of her favorite nights of all time. When she was told that she was given the chance to keep Otto for the rest of her life, she couldn't help but feel happy. Ever since she entered high school, the kids were picking on her because of how short she looked and the kind of obsessions she possessed. She was to clingy to everything she could love, like a dog or a hamster. She had a couple of boyfriends in the past, but they broke up with her because she wouldn't give them much space. She thought there was something wrong with her, until she met Otto. Otto's talking made her feel special again, and somewhat needed. Since that day, she kept close to Otto, making sure that they would never lose that connection of friendship with each other. She followed him to class, hanged with him during lunch, and even after school activities, she would call him to chat. Nothing would make her more happy than to keep Otto in her arms forever.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kelly and her mom were getting closer to home. She couldn't shake the feeling of having Otto in her house, which made her worry. What if she lost him? The house was small, but the family was big. Kelly's aunt was staying over, partly due to the wreckage of her house from a tornado. She had three other siblings that would probably torture and abuse Otto. Rachel, Olivia, and Felicia. And lastly, Her mother was not too fond of small pets. They were barely noticeable to her and could easily be squished. The house was a caution to her plan of taking care of another human being. She would just have to keep a closer eye on him, never letting him out of her sight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The car stopped, and Kelly and her mom were getting out of the car. Otto could feel the cold air, even though he was inside a jar. Kelly breathed heavily, trying to keep him warm under her breath. When the door opened, Otto observed the house a little. It was a small space to live, with the living room a kitchen combined. The walls were forest green, and the couch was placed near a corner alongside the t.v.. They had a barbecue setup outside in the patio, and even a little playground for entertainment. Kelly took one more step into the house,and a little kid came charging at her. That must've been her youngest sister.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WHAT'S IN THE JAR, KELLY? CAN I PLAY WITH IT?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"SORRY, BUT THIS IS A SPECIAL JAR. THIS IS NOT TO BE PLAYED WITH.\" She scooted out of the child's way and try to make it into her room. She had a special key so no one would enter. When she opened the door, she noticed her Aunt was sleeping, curled up in her bed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.\" Her mother said from the back. \"YOUR AUNT ACCIDENTLY FELL ASLEEP ON YOUR BED. WOULD YOU MIND SLEEPING IN THE GUEST ROOM FOR THE NIGHT?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"NO PROBLEM, MOM.\" She kept Otto close to her chest as she made her way to the guest room. It was not as stylish as her own room, but it was supplied with a bed, window, and personal bathroom. She poured Otto out on top of the bed. He felt dizzy from moving around much, but finally sat down and rested his head. Kelly tried to sweet-talk him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"YOU OKAY, OTTO?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I'm fine. But that was such a bumpy ride. Listen, I just wanted to thank you for picking me. Who knows what would've happened if one of those other girls chose me? I couldn't survive with them. It's nice to know that I have a friend like you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"YOUR WELCOME. AT LEAST YOU KNOW YOUR  IN GOOD HANDS NOW.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sweet. So how are we going to change me back?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WHAT? CHANGE YOU BACK? WHY WOULD I DO THAT?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kelly. Come on. You know that I can't live like this. It's too hard. Let's just think this over and-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"NO!\" Her No sent Otto tumbling back a few times. He was beginning to feel frightened. \"I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THIS DAY FOR A WHILE NOW. I LOVE YOU, OTTO. PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kelly, please don't make me say it again. i just can't live like this.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"REBECCA WAS RIGHT. YOU WON'T COOPERATE WITH MY DECISION. NOW YOUR GOING TO BE PUNISHED. YOUR STAYING WITH ME FOREVER AND EVER. NO EXCEPTIONS.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grabs his shrunken body, ready to begin her torturous deeds. She didn't want to result to this, but knowing that her dream of keeping Otto with her forever wasn't working out for him, she needed to show him that he didn't have a say in it. \"I'M GOING TO SLEEP NOW. MAYBE TOMORROW YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND. NOW WHERE AM I GOING TO PUT YOU...?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can't keep me like this!\" Jose tried recklessly to break open the jar, but all he was doing was causing more pain. Donna just laughed at his attempts. She roared at him once more, causing him to fall and tumble.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"SHUT UP! YOUR NOT IN A GOOD POSITION TO BE YELLING AT ME NOW! FOR ALL THE PAIN AND CHEATING YOU CAUSED ME, YOU'LL BE WISHING THAT YOU WOULD'VE BEEN A LITTLE NICER TO ME. NOW SIT QUIETLY, OR I WILL THROW YOU OUT THE WINDOW DURING THE DRIVE!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jose shut his mouth and sat, as they enter's Donna's grandmother's old truck. He never felt this controlled before, not as mush as when he was normal and they were dating. They shared the love that many other couples try to find. She put all faith and trust in him, as he promised the same. They always spent minutes cuddling each other and making out. Each day, the intimacy between them got more and more passionate. They couldn't stand to be separated for even a day. This was how they felt during their freshmen year. In their sophomore year, things got complicated. With a stylish fohawk and some new muscles, Jose became an eye prize for other girls. Constantly, random girls would go up to him and try to ask him out. He gave the same rejection every time, knowing that Donna was the only girl for him. That was until the new exchange student arrived. Her name was Violet, and she was French, with a humongous ass and juicy boobs. He couldn't resist and asked her out. They did less talking during their date, and he too her back into his house for sex. He considered it the wildest night he's ever had. The next day, Violet's friend squealed on him and told Donna, which ruined her trust in boys. Now that he's small, she had the power to bring him hell.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Donna was feeling bored in the car, so she shook Jose a few times. He almost screamed, but he knew what was coming to him if he did. All she wanted was someone to love. Jose looked like the right guy to show her that. Bringing her flowers, taking her out on dates. She thought she met her high school sweetheart. She felt all happy to know that she was loved. Then Sophomore year came up, where things got complicated. She saw many girls coming over to him, trying to ask him out. The more girls that tried to score with him, the more she worried. She was scared that he might break up with her, thus leaving her heartless. The last boyfriends she had always cheated on her with some other girl. This was her last attempt to have trust in guys. Then the day the new exchange student showed up, she knew something was up. The way he looked at her showed that he was interested in her. The day after that was their two year anniversary. What made it special was finding out that her boyfriend cheated on her. That's when she finally became cruel to him, never wanting to see him ever again. She would always believe that she would get a chance for payback. Boy, was she right.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her grandma drove into the trailer park, and parked right in front on their mobile home. She got out of the truck, and held Jose high, making sure he could feel the cold sensation of the air. They entered the room, and Jose couldn't find any words to describe the place. With tiny, living space, there was only a living room and two bedrooms. The kitchen was just combined, which made the living room more complex to live in. They had an antenna t.v. near a couch with broken springs. The smell of rotten food filled the atmosphere, but the family were somehow use to it. Outside, there was nothing but clothes hanging to dry and a barbecue setup. It was now clear why Jose was never invited to Donna's house. She lived in a dump, but it would've been dangerous for him to say it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Donna didn't hesitate any longer and brought him inside her room. She had nothing but a mattress and a window. She jumped into her bed, probably breaking more springs. She opened up Jose's jar, and clutched his tiny body in her hands. She just devilishly smiled at him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WELL. NOW WE'RE HERE. WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR YOUR TORTURE TO BEGIN.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Donna, can we just talk about this? Sure, I'll admit it. I cheated on you. And I feel real bad about it. But I did want to talk about it, but you just kept ignoring me, and even told me you didn't want to see me again.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OF COURSE I DIDN'T! DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY BOYFRIENDS I HAD? AND DID YOU KNOW THAT EACH ONE OF THEM CHEATED ON ME? THE SAME WAY YOU DID? IT PISSES ME OFF! I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE FOR ME, BUT INSTEAD YOU TURNED OUT TO BE JUST LIKE MY EXES. I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm telling you I'm freaking sorry! Just take the damn apology!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"DON'T YOU DARE YELL AT ME LIKE THAT! I AM YOUR NEW MASTER NOW. YOU LOST CONTROL OF YOUR BODY. ALL YOUR GOOD FOR NOW IS TO BE A TOY FOR ME. AND NOT JUST ME, GIRLS TOO. YOU'LL SEE THE MISTAKE OF CHEATING ON ME. I SWEAR IT! NOW I'M TIRED, SO I NEED TO FIND A PLACE FOR YOU TO SLEEP IN.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why not back in the jar?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO SUFFER EVERY SECOND!\" She then decided to keep you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Connor was scared out of his mind, and Selphie just wanted to get home as possible. She had her mother call up a limousine to pick her up. She never even imagined her mother trying to pick her up, with all the busy time she has trying to get more rich. As she got in the car, she looked at Connor, shaking and scared out of his mind. She didn't care, and then rested herself on the extended seat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Connor saw himself being placed on the floor. He never thought any of this would happen to him. He's always been so cool with everyone. Why would he be shrunken all of a sudden? He never did anything wrong. He's lived a good life so far. He came from a poor family, so family values are deeply important to him. Just when he entered high school, his family's been struggling with paying off the school. Connor was the top priority to get more money for his family. He's been working a night shift at McDonald's and is trying to become a talented salesman. Now the he was small and taken away, all he can think about was how his family was going to survive. He looked at the top of his jar at Selphie's face. Why would she choose him, he wondered. They never talked before, nor even hanged out. She even told him once that she didn't like him. He didn't take it  harshly because he didn't like anything about her either. She was cruel and bossy with her friends. She always bragged about her fortune, and threw money in the air to gain affection. Connor always thought of her as a spoiled bitch, and his thought didn't change, even now.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Selphie looked out the window, knowing that it was still a long way to get to the mansion. The huge mansion that she inhabits in alone. She can't remember the last time her and her mom hanged out. She is the daughter of a family in charge of a famous clothing line, Fabvo. Her mother would always choose work over her daughter, and would never see her until nighttime. That just left Selphie with her servants. She made a relationship with each one, especially her favorite nanny, Sophia. She raised her and taught her well, but couldn't do anything about the gene Selphie got from her mother. She was addicted to money and spending it on the latest trends. Ipods, Makeup bags, and shoes; she would buy it all, but then would get bored with them quickly. She looked down at Conner, which disgusted her. She hated how he had family close-by him and that he felt happy living in poverty. She was glad to keep him as a toy. Then once she was done, she would just save him as a souvenir. He would end up as nothing but a toy to her until she got bored of him. She was that evil, especially  to living beings.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The limousine pulled into a long path, with a glorious mansion at the end. A hedge maze was created on one side of the path, as a enormous lake filled with exotic sea creatures were placed on the other side. The mansion looked old, and it had to capacity to fill up 1,000 people. The driver opened up the garage, where 50 other cars resided. He parallel park next to a Lamborghini and a Ferrari. Selphie grabbed her new pet and went inside. Connor couldn't believe how huge it was. The kitchen was fit for a five-star hotel. The game room looked more like an amusement. And the main room was elegant and classy. A chandelier hanged from above, and a mountain of stairs were direct to two wings. Selphie thought it would be best to use the elevator. She went inside, and choose for the second floor, possibly where her room was. As the gates open, a narrow, but long hallway was presented. She walked until the end of the hall, and entered the door on the left.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her room was as large as a circus tent. Stuffed animals were placed on shelfs in a orderly fashion. Her bed hanged from four pink ropes, allowing her bed to float gently in the air. Part of the roof was replaced with glass, so she can see the moon better. And finally, her personal bathroom, with all the appliances made out of pure gold. This was too much for a girl like her, but she didn't mind. She sat in the middle of the room, letting Connor out of the jar. He started to freak out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok, Selphie. Can you explain to me why the hell am I small? Why is my other friends small, too? And why did you pick me to torture? We have never even socialized before.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"SHUT UP, SLAVE. I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU.

She could see all the faces of Michael, Otto, Jose, and Connor. She merely laughed at them. She couldn't imagine what kinds of torture they would be put through by her friends. She returned her attention to her slave. Chris was just sitting there, waiting for something to happen. She got into action and laughed at him. \"ARE YOU SCARED NOW? DO YOU WISH YOU WERE DEAD INSTEAD OF BEING A SLAVE TO ME?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No. I really don't care.

THEN WHY DON'T YOU STARE AT BOOBS JIGGLE, AND TELL ME YOUR NOT SATISFIED AT ALL.\" She began to bounce her mammoth boobs around. Chris looked at it with no expressions in his face, nor his pants.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They're fake.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM?!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not an idiot like other guys.

He picked himself up, but was to slow to react to her giant foot beginning to collapse on him. He got stuck under her sole, having to smell that musky scent. She Applied more pressure on his body, until he started to whine. \"HAD ENOUGH?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This...this is nothing. You pretty weak for a giant.\" That pissed off Rebecca even more, making her apply more pressure. Chris's head was beginning to turn red, and his breaths of air were shortening. He had no choice but to tap out, which signaled Rebecca to get her foot off of him. She then rubbed her freshly-pedicured toes in front of his face. He tried to shoo them away, but instead they crushed him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"HAD ENOUGH?\"  Chris didn't speak. He had nothing to say to this demon girl. \"I WANT TO LICK MY TOES UNTIL I'M SATISFIED.

NOW START LICKING.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chris got down on his knees and began to worship this horrible girl's beautiful feet. They were perfectly cleansed, and with a design of a flower on the big toe. Just one lick, and the stale taste of her foot was already predicted. Chris knew this was nothing to how his life already is. His family is already messed up, with abusive, drunk parents. He could deal with them anytime. He was surprised to be put into a high school after years of being home schooled. He never felt so happy to meet some new friends and experience a life outside of his own. Because of his raising, he's never been able to accept anything so easily. He's a hard head, so it was not possible for him to accept anything without an argument. Every time he was convinced by something, there was always a debate between it. He never did like Rebecca, because she always tried to control men with her body. He saw what kinds of stupid things guys did for. It pissed him off. Now that he was hers, it wasn't going to be an easy relationship.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca couldn't help but laugh at Chris licking the dirt between her sexy toes. She was always an evil hypocrite, getting whatever she wanted without lifting a finger. She always thought guys were stupid, and would do anything for a pretty face. Her boobs were huge, her butt was something to awe at, and everything else hooked the prize. She wanted to be stuck with her crush Jose. He was hot, and she was sexy. That would've been a perfect match. But instead, she got stuck with a loser that nobody has yet to know or even wants to know. He was stubborn, too, so that made the fun boring. She needed to crack Chris into a mindless drone, so then he'll be any to serve her without any complaints or whining.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca has thought about shrinking them for a long time. She never really thought about it until it seemed like a great opportunity. She became close friends with Selphie just to get a hold of her money. With that money, she bought the serum, and was really to take her idea into reality. She called in some close friends and enemies of the guys and hosted this little get together. The difficult part was locating the guys, sneaking into their windows, and dropping a sip of the serum into their throats. And that's how it came to me. Beside the girls, no one knows that she had the antidote hidden inside the house. Now that her idea finally came true, she couldn't wait to figure out how well she will keep her pet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"THAT'S ENOUGH. YOUR DONE. AND IT'S GETTING LATE.\" Chris backed up, spitting out all the toe jam he collected in his mouth. All the sweat he absorbed from her was soon to become vomit. He looked up to her glorious face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll find a way out to this. I swear it. Me and others will get back to normal. Then we'll report you to the police.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"HA! SURE. WE'LL SEE THE DAY WHEN THAT HAPPENS. FOR NOW, I NEED TO PUT YOU IN YOUR NEW SLEEPING PLACE.\" She then grabs Chris and places him...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
