She was no stranger to this sort of thing anymore, but she that didn't make this any easier, and it also didn't help her in this new situation. However, the book in her hands was an excellent way of keeping her mind off her situation and hope her heart would relax on its own once she started breathing normally. She hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hot, restless night during last month's heat wave, Mackenzie found herself too uncomfortable to sleep. Her sleepwear changed several times that night, starting from a full set of light summer pajamas before making its way into a a light, well worn T-shirt she used almost exclusively for the gym, and even that was soon discarded for her birthday suit. When sleeping naked atop the covers still proved extremely hot, the red head came to the conclusion she'd have to open a window. Even in the face of flashing her 35C breasts to any perverts out on a late night stroll, the six foot tall red head wouldn't dress in even the light shirt, believing she'd still flash her little red landing strip and the pink treasure beneath it. She didn't like this choice either, but decided that openly flashing her boobs would distract from the less visible lips in the junction of her legs. Plus, it was just too hot to dress again, so hot it was likely no one was out anyway, a conclusion she verified when she didn't hear a hush or spy a soul after opening the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the window open, the room remained too stuffy for her to redress, though she did climb under the thinnest sheet of her bed. Still uncomfortable, Mackenzie decided to play with the window again, but this time wouldn't adjust it. Instead, she decided to see how long she could keep herself in front of the window before some noise scared her back into bed. She sat in front of that quiet window for what felt like hours, even though the moon in the sky made it clear it was only fifteen minutes. The rush of adrenaline banished her exhaustion, and the game took her mind off the unbearable room temperature. It wasn't until nature called and broke her game did she fall from her high and into bed sleeping. While all that happened that night was a little flashing and an indoor streak in an otherwise empty house, it started Mackenzie's exhibitionism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the month that followed, Mackenzie's restless nights were spent meandering around her backyard, walking around her house \"checking\" all the windows that faced the street at some angle, or even cleaning her walkway and the sidewalk in front of her house. She hadn't been caught yet, and her run of good luck had numbed her to the possibility of getting caught, making it seem as though it was only possible in her mind for the sole purpose of exciting her. This attitude accounted for today's actions and the dropkick she took to the head for performing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more adventurous, Mackenzie decided to bring her game into the light of day for the first time on this Saturday. Carrying only a book, the nubile red head elected to spend the morning lying in the grass reading and blasting away the tan lines left by her bikini. The month of experimenting revealed that some jewelry gave her the illusion of cover, and she hated it. It felt better when she wasn't wearing anything besides a pearly white smile. She added in a coat of insect repellent, but only because she figured that would be better than having a bite or sting somewhere sensitive. The stiffness of her skin didn't break her fantasy, but it did make her a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of motors running was becoming more apparent, an alarm of sorts for Mackenzie, telling her that it's time to go inside and wash. Her skin hadn't shown much improvement, but her tan lines were a bit fainter and there weren't any signs of a burn. Regardless, she picked herself up and walked the five steps to her back door. As a reflex, Mackenzie always locked a door after she closed it unless she consciously sent out the command \"Stop!\" Her back door was locked, but Mackenzie wasn't too worried about it. One of her emergency keys was kept in one of the small plastic rocks various companies make and sell, and she made sure to move the rock right next to her door before she went out. She'd done that every night she went out to let herself back in, and this morning was no different, except for one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Oh no! No! NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a while to remember, but it finally came back to the red head. On her last night out, Mackenzie returned drowsy enough to out sleep Rip Van Winkle, and instead of replacing the key, she placed it on a table and decided to put it back after she got to sleep. However, Mackenzie had forgotten about this deviation when she awoke, leaving the key on the wrong side of the locked door. Only now did Mackenzie realize she could actually be seen stark naked, and she'd have to if she wanted to get back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie had two spare emergency keys, but neither was placed in a very favorable location. One was with Marianne, her very best friend in the world since college. If Mackenzie was ever in trouble, she could always count on Marianne to help. Unfortunately, Marianne lived with her boyfriend. In a crowded apartment building. Located on a busy street. About two miles away. And there's no guarantee they'd be home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other key was much closer, 23 steps, or so say Mackenzie's nightly walks. She kept it with her neighbor, Rachel. It seemed like a good idea at the time. The two of them quickly built a solid friendship, they could do things together when they didn't have plans, and talk about real things. Rachel almost turned Marianne and Mackenzie's Dynamic Duo into Three Musketeers, and both Rachel and Marianne seemed receptive to Mackenzie's description of the other. However, this went south when the three of them got together last week. As luck would have it, Marianne and Rachel knew each other very well from high school. Rachel cheated Marianne out of a slot on the cheer squad, and Marianne retaliated by stealing her boyfriend. Evidently the story was of significantly greater girth, but Rachel stormed off afterwards and Marianne chose to put Rachel out of her mind to have a nice lunch with her best friend. While not really Mackenzie's problem, she's been too afraid to approach Rachel since then and has no clue how Rachel feels about her anymore. This could be like poking a hornets nest naked, and the feeling in Mackenzie's stomach didn't subside once she realized she was already half way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a different approach?\" Mackenzie mumbled, musing other possibilities.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Mackenzie hated to admit it, her best bet was with Marianne. She's the one person guaranteed to help, and while she couldn't be certain Marianne was home, she wouldn't be at work on a Saturday and would hopefully only be gone for a quick errand at most. Now, the only question that remained was what route to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking carefully, Mackenzie figured that she had three possible courses. One was safe, but extended the length of her trip substantially, another was quickest but incredibly risky, and the third was a tossup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was willing to add a good mile or two to her trek, Mackenzie could try to make a break for the nearby park. The park was quite large, and the patches of dense trees and other plant life offered ample hiding places and discreet paths. However, there was always the chance that Mackenzie could get turned around, or lost, or accidentally stumble upon people, but that was equally true with the other options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most direct route was simple. If Mackenzie stuck to the roads, she could retrace the usual route she takes when she drives to Marianne's place. However, once she was out of suburbia and into the busier part of town where Marianne's apartment complex was located, there would be little to no hiding places. If she was quick, clever, and lucky, she just might be able to make her way to the apartment unseen... however, luck clearly wasn't on her side this morning, so this thought did little to settle her rapid heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was the route that could either be perfect, or total disaster. Mackenzie lived in a college town, and the campus happened to be between her home and Marianne's apartment. Mackenzie could sneak through the suburbs until she reached the campus, then cut through the open area and cut down the distance of her trip quite nicely, and avoid the city streets. Unfortunately, she knew the campus layout and realized that there would be essentially zero cover. For all intents and purposes, she'd be streaking the college. Since it was Saturday, the campus could be largely dead since nobody would have classes to attend. However, the nice weather might mean the campus is flooded with students enjoying the day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie thought carefully about her options, shivering slightly in the occasional breeze that served only to remind her how bare she truly was. Finally, she took a deep breath and began walking, her path decided.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While effectively doubling the distance she'd have to cover wasn't an appealing idea, Mackenzie couldn't deny that the park was the safest route. She could at least try to hide if she came across any people, and the trees would make for good cover from the sun or rain if the weather took a turn for the worse. Of course, being as nice of a day as it was, there was the very real possibility that there would be plenty of people at the park...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I have a whole lot of options.\" Mackenzie said to herself. \"I've got to get my spare key from Marianne if I want to get out of this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Mackenzie made her way to the gate that separated her back yard from the alley. Turning the handle and slowly cracking the gate open, she carefully peeked her head out, looking all around for any signs of life. Seeing nobody, Mackenzie slowly stepped out of the safety of her back yard and into the alley, her bare feet protesting against the transition from soft grass to rough gravel. As the gate to her back yard closed behind her, the click of the lock made it clear that there was no turning back from here. The only way back to her property now would be from the street, and the only way she was going there was with clothes and her spare key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Mackenzie, it seemed that none of her neighbors had any business that brought them into the alley, and she was able to make her way towards the park with little trouble. Of course, that didn't stop the naked redhead from jumping at every small rustle of leaves and holding her breath at the sound of a passing car. Still, her luck managed to hold out, and Mackenzie was soon at the edge of the alleyway. From here, the nervous young woman could see the edge of the park, just at the end of the road, about half a block away. Looking around again, Mackenzie was relieved to see that none of the houses showed signs of activity on their front porches. If anybody was home, they must have been indoors. Hoping that none of them were glancing outside, Mackenzie took a deep breath and ran like her life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mackenzie had never been a star athlete, she had always kept in shape through dancing and light exercise, but it was sheer adrenaline that helped her achieve her speed at the moment. Mackenzie had never run so fast in her life, and if the idea of streaking down the street of her neighborhood wasn't absolutely terrifying, she'd have been impressed with herself. Of course, terrified as she was, Mackenzie had no time to take pride in her feat of athletic prowess, and simply bolted down the street for the cover of the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredibly, Mackenzie's gamble paid off! The unpleasant burn of sun-baked pavement on her feet gave way to cool grass once more, and the bright sunlight that showcased her naked body brilliantly was replaced with cooling shade that gave her (admittedly minimal) concealment. Once she was a few meters past the treeline, Mackenzie took a moment to bend over, leaning against a tree as she caught her breath. As scary as it had been, she had made it through undetected. Now there was just the matter of... making the now four mile journey to Marianne's apartment complex...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... this is the worst day of my life.\" Mackenzie muttered to herself as she panted. \"But hey... at least it can't get much worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie should have known better than to jinx herself like that. In a situation like hers, there were plenty of ways things could get worse, and indeed, for the unfortunate redhead. The next problem presented itself as-</span></div></div>",

In front of her was two areas, a baseball field, and a children's playground. Why couldn't her luck finally give her a break?! Was she just doomed to be the naked girl in public forever by some whim of a creature she didn't know? Shaking the gloom from her thoughts, Mackenzie looked over both areas carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, the ball field was completely empty and seemed devoid of any life. Yet she knew that just like the park she had tried earlier, that it could swiftly change to her disfavor. On the other hand, she saw plenty of parents, mostly mothers, and their children cavorting through the playground. They were all laughing and enjoying themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to risk fate in case it screwed her over again, Mackenzie looked back and forth, judging her options, then decided to skirt the edges of both. Hopefully this way, she could both avoid being seen by the people on the grounds, and quickly navigate the deserted area to find her way back towards home. It would be a long stretch though but she had no choice. Sighing, she made her way down, looking fearfully this way and that, but so far so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as her luck would have it, this changed in the worst possible way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of nowhere, a ball came sailing over and gently whacked her on the head, before dropping to the ground. It was a foam ball, and Mackenzie paled at seeing it, remembering that kids were playing with it at the playground. Before she could find a place to hide, footsteps ran up behind her and a little girl bent down to retrieve the ball. When she made to run back, she spotted the naked red-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why are you nakey?!\" she screeched, obviously used to her outside voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh! Please!\" Mackenzie whispered. \"I just ran into a bit of bad luck and need some help is all.\" if there was one thing Mackenzie <i>didn't</i> want, it was attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl ignored her distress, more curious than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad luck? Help? I can help!\" she cried, then ran off before Mackenzie could refute her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to where she ran Mackenzie paled further as she could clearly see the girl talking to a few other kids and adults, then pointing right at her. She needed to get out of here! But that wasn't possible, as the people, first with looks of shock at seeing a naked girl in public, then headed toward her with clear intent. Trapped like a dear, Mackenzie could only stand there as she was quickly surrounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you naked young lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's nakey! She's nakey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were only a few of the questions she heard as she tried to explain herself, but they decided to talk over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long...</span></div></div>",

Mackenzie could make out at least three voices, but there could easily have been more than three people, and they were heading her way! If Mackenzie didn't do something quickly, there's no question that she'd be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her heart began to race once more, fear rising to the front of her emotions, Mackenzie frantically looked around for a place to hide. This was the reason Mackenzie had elected to take the park route, after all, and she quickly identified a couple potential hiding spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first option was the very tree she was leaning against. It wouldn't be too difficult to climb up the tree and try to hide in the branches. Of course, if Mackenzie wasn't hidden well enough and somebody decided to look up, then she'd be spotted with little problem. Even worse, if the group heading her way decided to stop here, well, she'd be stuck in that tree until they moved on again. The idea of being huddled up in a tree for an unknown length of time wasn't exactly appealing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next option wouldn't exactly hide Mackenzie, but it would at least hide the fact that she was completely naked. A few meters away from her current spot was a stream that flowed through the park. The water wasn't exactly crystal clear, and would obscure her body from view. Of course, there was the fact that taking a dip in the cold, somewhat dirty stream wasn't exactly the most pleasant idea in the world. Also something to consider was the fact that Mackenzie wasn't the strongest swimmer in the world, and if the steam's current was too strong it could end up carrying her far off course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie had to decide, and quickly if the volume of the voices was any indication. Tree or stream? Her modesty depended on it!</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll make it through this okay.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hasty check caused her to miss another morning walk enthusiast.

She was considering stopping to grab something like a newspaper to give her a hint of cover when she heard a ringtone.  She froze for a moment with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\" Dennis mouthed as he quickly silenced his phone.  <i>Did you really have to call right now, Jose?  I don't call you when you're ogling a beautiful, naked lady.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's cheeks were almost as red as her hair.  She felt fight-or-flight kicking with full force.

Sprinting across the streets, staying low to the ground as she crept through lawns and backyards, the freshly cut grass and soft flower petals of people's gardens lightly tickling at her flawless skin. If there was one thing Mackenzie could be grateful for, it was that her neighborhood wasn't terribly active in the mornings. At last, Mackenzie was at the last block before she reached the campus. Carefully stepping into the alleyway to cut through the block, Mackenzie saw something that made her blood run cold: the Greek alphabet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, Mackenzie saw Greek lettering on every house on this last street. She was on Greek Row! How did she get here?! Greek Row was supposed to be on another end of the campus entirely! At least, it had been when she was a student... Apparently things had changed. What Mackenzie didn't know was that the old Greek Row had been torn down to expand the campus, adding several new administrative buildings. The houses along the street she was currently on were bought up by the college and re-purposed as the new Greek Row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mackenzie found herself in a much more intense situation. Frats and Sororities weren't exactly the most kind and understanding groups, especially some of the ones at Mackenzie's old college. A few were notorious as \"Party Houses\", their members more preoccupied with having a good time than earning a good education. Mackenzie had never joined a sorority, though a few had tried to recruit her. Right now, the naked redhead wished she had joined up with one, if only so she could try asking for help. As it was, she just needed to make sure none of the sororities spotted her, or even worse, one of the frats...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heartbeat could be confused for a fully automatic machine gun at this point, but Mackenzie had to press onward. She'd already committed to her path, and turning around to try a new route would only waste time at this point. Taking a deep breath, Mackenzie did her best to cover her privates with her hands and arms, and ran for her life (as best as she could with one arm across her chest and a hand between her legs, at least)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her feet slapping on the pavement of the sidewalk, Mackenzie could see the edge of the main campus at the end of the street. Just a little further and she'd be on to the next leg of her arduous journey...</span></div></div>",

Forcing herself to control her breathing, Mackenzie carefully crept along the side of her house. Keeping low to the ground in a vain attempt at stealth, she timidly peered up and down the street, keeping a lookout for cars or pedestrians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the street thankfully empty and not wanting to waste time lest that change, Mackenzie darted out from her hiding spot, the sound of her feet slapping on the pavement seeming to her louder than a thunderstorm. After a short but frantic sprint, Mackenzie found herself on the front porch of Rachel's house and began to feel a renewed sense of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel wasn't the type to merely get angry. She was a force of vengeance when she felt slighted, and made it clear she reveled in the misfortune of those she disliked. If she still held bitter feelings about her association with Marianne, appealing to her for help could put Mackenzie in a very bad spot. But, if Rachel had calmed down, she might be willing to help... though she might need convincing nonetheless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling her nerves, and holding her book over her exposed rear end lest someone on the street see her, Mackenzie tentatively knocked on Rachel's door. The wait felt agonizingly long, and Mackenzie began to worry that Rachel might not even be home, making her risk detection all for nothing.</span></div></div>",

Before she could regroup and voice her shock, Mackenzie began speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rachel, it's a really long story, but the thing is I'm kinda locked out of my house and really need to get back inside so I can get dressed. Could you give me that spare key I gave you so I can get back inside? I'd really owe you one!\" Mackenzie blurted out at light speed, her heart racing faster with every word. Anxiously, she looked Rachel in the eyes, putting on her best pleading look in hopes that it would sway her once-friend's sympathies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel simply stared at Mackenzie for a long moment, apparently processing what she had said.

Such power she felt over this young woman. In the back of her mind Rachel had somehow distorted the unfortunate events that occurred between her former best friend Marianne, blaming Mackenzie for the rift that developed between them. After all, things were fine until Mackenzie started hanging around the two of them. Over time, Rachel had convinced herself that Mackenzie had been trying to drive a wedge between them.  Having her neighbor show up naked on her doorstep was pure providence. After eyeing her captive for a few moments Rachel replied, \u201cWhat . . .? I\u2019m just hungry, that\u2019s all. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cPlease Rachel . . . You\u2019ve had your fun now let\u2019s go home and get me something to wear, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her pleas Rachel continued, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you suggested Fred\u2019s. I\u2019m really craving his Cheeseburger platter. Nobody makes a cheeseburger like Fred.\u201d Just then she turned the vehicle into the restaurant and pulled into a parking place along the long main sidewalk that led to the restaurant, choosing a place a few spots away from the nearest cars and shut off the engine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred\u2019s Drive-in was a popular hangout for most of the high school kids because you could eat in your car. It was trendy and nostalgic and the food was not only good but cheap. Each parking place had a menu board with a built in speaker located next to the driver\u2019s window. The driver could order right from the car and a cheerful employee wearing roller skates would bring your order out to your car on a tray and hang it on the side of the car\u2019s open window.  Mackenzie loved working there not only because it was popular but the tips were generally good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie quickly covered herself with her hands and slid as low as possible into her seat. \u201cSIT UP and don\u2019t cover yourself. You do realize how foolish you look and that you are only drawing attention to yourself by doing that. No one can tell you\u2019re naked if you just act natural and not like some criminal doing something they shouldn\u2019t be doing. All people can see is your head and shoulders. The car covers the rest. Besides, I like how you look naked and you don\u2019t want to get me angry. Now let\u2019s just enjoy a good meal and then we\u2019ll be on our way. \u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Mackenzie almost died! She was naked at the very place she worked!! What if people saw her like this? She could never go back to work again. She would never live it down! Perhaps Rachel was just messing with her. After all she hadn\u2019t yet pressed the call button for service. Still, just sitting there naked was so nerve wracking she could hardly stand it. She saw people eating in their cars across the way and she knew that at any minute someone she knew from school could drive up and park next to them and spot her. She looked over at Rachel who seemed to be content with just looking at her friend squirm in her seat.  She thought that surely her friend was just trying to psych her out and it was working too! Mackenzie just knew that at any minute now Rachel was going to pull out and leave. Mackenzie had to hand it to her though. Rachel sure knew how to take advantage of the situation inflicting the greatest amount of stress. As Mackenzie sat there nervously looking around . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thank you for eating at Fred\u2019s,\u201d the friendly, matter-of-fact voice replied.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMackenzie was stranded naked miles from home without anything to use as cover.

Is that you in that car, Mackenzie?\u201d It was Mackenzie\u2019s boss, Tracy! She was a college student only a year or two older than Mackenzie and usually ran the day shift during the week. From her vantage point in the passenger\u2019s seat, Mackenzie couldn\u2019t see her boss but she could see people milling about in the main building preparing the food and the servers receiving their orders at the outside window. She wondered just how much her boss could see into the car. Did she know that she was naked?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mackenzie is here,\u201d Rachel quickly answered. \u201cGo ahead, she can hear you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that was you. Listen we are short-handed this afternoon as Katelyn called in sick. I know it is short notice but could you possibly come in now and help us for an hour or two.  I\u2019d be eternally grateful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was shocked! She had never let her boss down before and she didn\u2019t want to do it now, but there was no way she could leave the car and go into work. She was about to have a panic attack! Before she could answer her boss, however, she saw Susie, a classmate and coworker heading right for the car carrying their order. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cHold on, Mackenzie,\u201d the boss said through the crackling speaker. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back with you in a minute. I\u2019ve got to get this order out. Think about it. We could really use your help. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Susie reached the driver\u2019s side window and began setting up the tray. \u201cThat\u2019ll be $6.95, please,\u201d she said as she fumbled with the tray. Maybe she won\u2019t notice me, Mackenzie thought hopefully as she tried to act invisible by not moving a muscle.  \u201cWhat the hell . . . MACKENZIE . . . YOU\u2019RE NAKED!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was laughing hysterically as she looked over her classmate. \u201cYou\u2019re weird, Mac.  What on earth are you doing? If the boss catches you, you\u2019re dead. You know that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE don\u2019t say anything, Susie. I beg you. It\u2019s not what it looks like . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is,\u201d Rachel interjected. \u201cI caught her streaking my neighborhood this morning and she ended up on my doorstep just like she is now. She even masturbated for me on my porch!! Can you believe it? Shy little Mackenzie fingered her wet little self as bold as brass right out in the open. I\u2019ve got pictures too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMACKENZIE!! Did you really?? \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnswer her,\u201d Rachel demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie lowered her head and simply mumbled. \u201cYes . . . but . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOohhh, how naughty!\u201d Susie said excitedly.  \u201cDo it for me now and I won\u2019t say anything to anyone here about you being naked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!!\u201d Mackenzie gasped. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We\u2019re short-handed this afternoon.\u201d Susie said firmly. She may have sounded forceful but her face was all smiles as if she couldn\u2019t wait to make Mackenzie do such a humiliating thing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMackenzie\u2019s face turned beat red. There was no way she could do such an embarrassing and personal act like that in front of yet another classmate. Susie was also a friend of Marianne so she was sure that the story that Susie actually made her do this in Rachel\u2019s car at the drive-in would be spread immediately around campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the speaker crackled to life again. \u201cMackenzie, can you help us out? We could really, really use your help. I have so much paperwork to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie started to sweat. Before she could answer Susie spoke up, \u201cHey boss, Mackenzie can\u2019t work right now, she isn\u2019t DRESSED FOR IT,\u201d she said playfully with emphasis on \u201cDRESSED.\u201d Both Rachel and Susie began laughing hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d the voice in the speaker answered obviously disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could lend her my apron if you think that would be okay. She\u2019d at least look like she was part of the staff even if she IS out of uniform. Would that be okay?\u201d Susie volunteered helpfully into the speaker. \u201cI\u2019ve even got an extra pair of skates in my car that she can borrow. I\u2019m sure that they will fit her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be GREAT!\u201d the boss replied excitedly. \u201cSee you in a few minutes Mackenzie.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie turned to Mackenzie and quipped, \u201cYou REALLY should have just done as I asked. It would have saved you from a whole lot of embarrassment. Now you are really in for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t work naked!\u201d Mackenzie protested as Susie took off her black apron and tossed it through the open car window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be naked. You\u2019ll be wearing my apron,\u201d Susie said giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrateful for the covering Mackenzie seized the apron and pulled the loop around her neck. Susie, wasting no time, opened the passenger door just as the apron fell down Mackenzie\u2019s front. Susie yanked poor Mackenzie out of the car before she even had time to tie the apron behind her back.  Mackenzie panicked as she knew her naked backside was totally exposed to anyone who would happen to drive by behind their parking spot.  \u201cWait a minute,\u201d Mackenzie protested as desperately tried tying the apron as Susie began dragging her towards the small restaurant building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as Susie was much shorter than Mackenzie, the apron hung very low on her chest \u2013 so low that most of the tops of her boobs were exposed \u2013 only her nipples and pelvis were covered and her pelvis just barely hidden from view at that. From the side, her boobs were totally visible and the material wrapped around her back only so far leaving most of her butt uncovered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie dragged her to the pick-up window as Mackenzie used her hands to cover her bare backside and . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once in the office, Tracy is all smiles as her employee cowers in front of her. \u201cSo . . . is this some sort of high school club initiation thing? Is THAT why you were sitting naked in that car at my restaurant?\u201d Mackenzie wanted to crawl under a rock and die! As she stood there waiting for the boss to call the police, she was surprised to hear her boss say, \u201cHow sweet is that? This just rocks! I did something like that when I was initiated into my sorority at college. I\u2019ll be glad to help. Is there someone out there that is keeping track of you to be sure you follow through with everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she hated to give Rachel any more control over her, Mackenzie didn\u2019t dare say that there wasn\u2019t anyone for fear of getting into even more trouble. \u201cUm . . . I guess so. My friend, Rachel, I suppose . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSUSIE!\u201d her boss called out from her office at the top of her lungs, \u201cGo get Mackenzie\u2019s friend, Rachel, and bring her in to me.\u201d Susie was only too glad to help and in no time Rachel was standing next to her half-naked pal.  \u201cSo, Rachel, I understand you are watching over Mackenzie here is that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel could see the evil smile on Tracy\u2019s face and instinctively knew everything was going to be okay. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will be fun! I want to help with this initiation thing so what does Mackenzie have to do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much everything I say and she\u2019s violating my rules by wearing that apron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment\u2019s hesitation Tracy removed the apron leaving Mackenzie standing naked in her office. To make matter worse the boss\u2019s office door was wide open! \u201cIs that better,\u201d she asked with a huge grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a boy came rounding the corner and stopped dead in his tracks when he saw the naked girl. \u201cMackenzie! Nice ass!!\u201d He said with emotion, making Rachel and Tracy laugh out loud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt IS rather cute isn\u2019t it?\u201d Rachel said giggling. \u201cIf you think that her butt is cute, you should see the other side. Mackenzie, turn around and let this nice gentleman admire the front view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Mackenzie said pleading half under her breath. \u201cDon\u2019t make me do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now her boss, Tracy, was fully enjoying the situation and was only too happy to help. \u201cNow don\u2019t be that way. I expect you to listen to your friend here; otherwise you\u2019ll ruin your initiation and get in even more trouble with me. Is that what you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d Mackenzie answered and very reluctantly turned around. The boy\u2019s mouth just about hit the floor as he looked over his coworker. \u201cWOW!\u201d was all he could muster in an excited whisper.  The boy eventually handed the boss some papers for her to sign and left laughing all the way down the corridor. Mackenzie knew that before long everyone that she worked with would know that she was naked in the boss\u2019s office. She could only imagine the rumors that were flying about why she was there like that. Her face grew redder by the minute.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMeanwhile Susie was busy calling everyone she knew from school telling them about Mackenzie\u2019s situation. Before long the parking lot began to fill up with students all placing orders for food as they awaited an opportunity to see their naked classmate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon another boy came barging into the office, \u201cExcuse me boss . . . WHOA! Hello Mackenzie! Damn your body is the bomb!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you need something, John?\u201d Tracy interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, um, the parking lot is full and orders are coming through like crazy. I\u2019ve never seen a weekday like this so long after lunchtime. We need help.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her boss, Tracy, pushed herself away from her desk and stood up as if to leave. \u201cI guess it\u2019s all hands on deck time. Mackenzie . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh NO, I\u2019m not working naked. You can just forget about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boss looked at Mackenzie with a scowl on her face. \u201cI thought you liked working here. It would be a shame to see you go. But, if that\u2019s the way you want it . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was shocked.  She couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. She loved her job. She NEEDED her job.  Surely her boss couldn\u2019t be serious.  \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! You can\u2019t fire me because I won\u2019t work naked?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not. You did agree to help us out did you not? The way I see it, you are at work and you are refusing to follow a legitimate order from your boss, namely to do your normal job at a time when we are super busy.  Sounds to me like you are either being insubordinate, which is a perfectly legal reason to fire you OR you are resigning.  The fact that you came to work naked and still agreed to help out is not my concern. I am only concerned with keeping our customers satisfied. Now, are you going to work or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut . . . but my job is a being a carhop! I can\u2019t go outside naked!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSURE you can. It\u2019s okay with me,\u201d her boss said with an evil grin. \u201cI\u2019m sure the customers won\u2019t mind. They are mostly school kids anyway and they\u2019d LOVE to see something crazy like this happening at their favorite hangout. It will keep them coming back for months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie just had to think of a way out of this. \u201cBut what about Fred the owner; he\u2019s so old fashioned he\u2019ll call the cops for sure!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFred isn\u2019t here. He\u2019s on vacation this week. Besides he only cares about money and profits. The way I see it, you\u2019re good for business, which in turn is good for my bonus.  This should be fun. I think you\u2019re making a much bigger deal out of this than it needs to be. Just think about it. The restaurant is set back from the road and all the menu signs next to the cars block much of the view from the street. Only the customers are going to see you.  If anyone complains just let me know and I\u2019ll deal with it. Besides, you want to pass your initiation don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSURE SHE DOES!\u201d Rachel said encouragingly. \u201cShe\u2019s no quitter \u2013 either for the club OR her job. She\u2019ll be GLAD to work like she is. Just tell her what she has to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie shot Rachel a dirty look. She knew that probably the only reason she wasn\u2019t in real trouble by now was the fact that the boss thought she was being initiated into a club at school. If she didn\u2019t play along the whole reason for her nudity would fall apart and she\u2019d be labeled some kind of weirdo-pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boss grabbed Mackenzie by the arm. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose. You put on your \u2018Fred\u2019s\u2019 cap and start delivering the trays to the cars and I\u2019ll help with the cooking.\u201d With that she escorted a very nervous and very naked Mackenzie out into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have heard a pin drop as Mackenzie entered the main work area. Only the sizzling sound of the burgers on the grill broke the eerie silence. Every single employee immediately stopped what they were doing to look at the naked girl.  Most had huge grins on their faces while a few others clearly felt bad for her, but no one said a word.  Mackenzie just stood there blushing not quite knowing what to do.  These were her coworkers \u2013 people she had to work with every day and they were now seeing all of her bodily secrets \u2013 things she never thought that they would ever see.  From now on every time she showed up at work in her uniform she knew that her coworkers would be thinking, \u201cI know what you look like naked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel came to her defense. \u201cIt\u2019s an initiation sort of thing! Don\u2019t worry about Mackenzie. She actually LIKES this. Don\u2019t you Mackenzie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nudged her friend in the side prompting her to reply meekly, \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay every one let\u2019s get a move on. We\u2019ve got customers to serve.\u201d The boss said taking control. \u201cSusie, you keep working outside with Mackenzie. I can see several orders at the window ready to go.

She could only hope that the customers that were here this late after lunch weren\u2019t regulars and that they wouldn\u2019t be anyone she knew. Perhaps a convention in town had just let out or something. She could only hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a tray with her nude butt facing the cars, she looked at the parking space on the ticket to which the tray was to be delivered. It was spot #6 on the right side of the sidewalk. She swallowed hard, reluctantly turned around, looked up and stopped dead in her tracks after taking only one step. The car in that spot was filled with two boys from her class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d she muttered under her breath as her legs grew weak beneath her.  She then looked nervously around the drive-in and noticed that ALL the cars seemed to be filled with students from her school!!  \u201cWhat are they all doing here at this time of day?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d Susie quipped with a giggle. \u201cI called them all after you showed up naked and suggested they get down here right away if they wanted to see you exposing yourself. I guess most of our friends really DID want to see if what I texted was true because here they are!! Isn\u2019t this fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that!! How COULD you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was Rachel\u2019s idea. She said you\u2019d like it. I still think you should have just fingered yourself for me when I asked you to and all this could have been avoided,\u201d Susie said giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie wanted to slap the heck out of her coworker for her remark as well as do a few choice things to Rachel as well but the sound of her boss barking at the two girls to get going made her jump.  Just act as if this is perfectly normal she told herself. She could hear that little voice in her head saying, \u201cWhatever you do Mackenzie, don\u2019t show fear. It will only make things worse.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Rachel showed up outside and was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cShow \u2018em how it\u2019s done, Mackenzie, show \u2018em what you\u2019re made of . . . oh wait, you are already showing them everything aren\u2019t you - my bad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie knew it was hopeless to resist now.  She wasn\u2019t sure how she did it but she suddenly found herself walking towards the car indicated on the ticket. She had barely walked a few steps away from the pick-up window however when car horns began honking and shouts of excitement \u2013 whooping and hollering filled the air. Whatever hope she had of doing this with a little dignity were now history. She was totally embarrassed by the juvenile behavior being displayed by the teenage patrons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the car the driver shouted, \u201cNice Tits, Mackenzie. Could I have a little extra milk in my coffee?\u201d Remarks like that were being shouted from all over the parking lot. \u201cShake it, babe. Work it like you mean it,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019d like my burger with some of your special sauce, please.\u201d The comments from the guys were all basically complimentary albeit suggestive and filled with sexual innuendo, but girls in the crowd were the worst. Their comments were all degrading things about her personally as well as her body like, \u201cWhat a little whore, can you believe she had the nerve to show off like that,\u201d and \u201cIs that a tampon string between her legs \u2013 oh gross!\u201d It didn\u2019t matter that Mackenzie had a body to die for, the girls were not going to be outdone in front of their boyfriends and it seemed like it was imperative to them to put Mackenzie in her place before she became an icon around campus. They were quick to point out every imperfection real or imagined just to put the poor girl down. It was all too humiliating but Mackenzie dared not show that it bothered her. If she let on that any of this was getting to her the girls would make her life a living hell at school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie attached the food tray to the car\u2019s window, smiled politely and without saying a word returned to the pick-up window to get another tray.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few trips the comments didn\u2019t seem to sting as much as they had at first and she began to enjoy her new found popularity \u2013 at least she acted like she did anyway. She was beginning to appear much more confident, that is until she saw all the camera phones recording everything either in photo or video form. It was then she almost lost it and it took some encouraging words from both Rachel and her boss about how good she was doing just to keep from fainting. Her boss\u2019s comment about wishing it was her out there instead of Mackenzie really seemed to bolster her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie eventually found herself posing for photographs with some of the cute and popular boys figuring that if pictures were going to be floating around they might as well have her posing with all the popular guys at school. That way at least, her image around campus wouldn\u2019t be totally ruined. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Mackenzie returned to pick up yet another tray and started back on her journey to deliver it she spotted a car pulling into the drive-in. Her heart stopped and she froze dead in her tracks. It was . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had they just stopped by to get something to eat or had somebody called them to report Mackenzie running around naked? In either case, things just became a lot more dire for Mackenzie. If they saw her, there's no doubt they'd arrest her on the spot, and then the sight of her being cuffed and put into a squad car would be filling the cameras and phones aimed at her body. Beyond that, the cops would call her parents, and then she'd have to explain everything to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Mackenzie made a beeline for the bathroom, hoping to hide in there. As she ran through the interior of the building (to more cheers and catcalls) she quickly shouted at her boss to please get rid of the police. Without waiting for a response, Mackenzie ran through the door into the bathroom and promptly locked herself in a stall. Curling up into the fetal position on the seat of the toilet, Mackenzie waited with anticipation, hoping that her boss would come through the door soon to assure her that the cops were gone and everything had been explained away. Maybe the scare would even convince her boss to let her get dressed, or at least go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie wasn't sure how long she'd been waiting in that bathroom stall, but she had resolved not to move until she heard the door open and knew what the situation outside was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy looked up as the two officers entered the building, making eye contact with her almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello officers, how can I help you?\" Tracy asked, keeping a calm and aloof demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've received a call that one of your employees was running around naked.

What few people hadn't yet noticed her did as soon as Tracy announced their presence with a loud shout of \"It's party time, bitches!\" Soon enough the conversations filling the area died down, the dead air filled only by the booming music pounding out of the speakers all around. Yet again, Mackenzie found herself as the center of attention, and yet again she was absolutely mortified, even moreso by the familiar tingle creeping up in her loins. Could she honestly be enjoying this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Mackenzie got an idea of just what kind of a party this was. Looking through the entryway into what appeared to be the kitchen showed a large table covered with cups arranged for beer pong. A slight haze of smoke filled the house, clouding both Mackenzie's vision and her thoughts. Almost everyone present was holding some kind of bottle or cup, and they were all clearly college age or slightly older. On the one hand, Mackenzie didn't recognize anybody there, on the other hand, the idea of such a large number of older people openly ogling her put her on edge. They didn't know her, they had no reason to care about her reputation, and they'd likely feel no regret sharing any pictures or video they felt like taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was snapped out of her thoughts when she felt two hands wrap around her and grasp her ample chest, bouncing and squeezing her breasts in front of everybody pleasant. Mackenzie didn't need to look to know who the culprit was, hearing Tracy's voice right by her head as her boss addressed the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone, please give a warm welcome to Mackenzie, one of my employees!\" Tracy shouted over the din of the music, prompting an enthusiastic reaction from the crowd. \"Mackenzie here is a bold girl. So bold, in fact, that she came into work today just as you see her now: totally bare-ass nude! And lucky for us, she agreed to attend tonight's party!\" The crowd cheered at this while Mackenzie desperately wanted to dispute Tracy's version of events, but she knew that arguing would get her nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're gonna have fun with Mackenzie tonight, right everyone?\" Tracy asked, the crowd responding in the affirmative. \"Great! So, for our first event with the pretty little redhead, let's...\"</span></div></div>",

With Tracy's hands firmly gripping her shoulders, Mackenzie was marched forward to a large table and hoisted up onto the tabletop. Now towering above the rest of the people present, Mackenzie was the main attraction and felt everyone's eyes on her nude form. From their lower vantage point they could see everything, and unless she clamped her legs tightly together, the view must have been obscene. Not that the crowd had a problem with this, their cheering growing louder as the music switched to a tune fit for a night club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that there wasn't any real choice in the matter, Mackenzie slowly began dancing, rocking her body back and forth. Closing her eyes, Mackenzie hoped to forget her audience and pretend she was simply dancing in her own bedroom. This was no easy feat with the sound of the crowd competing with the music in terms of volume, but it did help offset some of the humiliation. Eventually Mackenzie managed to get lost in the music and her dancing became more fluid, her hips gyrating and arms waving about as she danced to the rhythm. Of course, if Mackenzie were to open her eyes she'd be treated to the sight of countless phones recording her performance, but that was yet another thing she was trying her hardest to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the ground, Tracy and Rachel watched Mackenzie's dance with cruel appreciation. For Tracy, this performance would be an incredible thing to hang over Mackenzie's head at work if she ever needed a particularly unpleasant job done. For Rachel, she simply saw this as fitting payback for being friends with Marianne. Turning to Tracy, Rachel gave the older woman a prod to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her eyes away from Mackenzie's pleasing performance, Tracy turned to Rachel with a raised eyebrow. \"Hm? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having Mackenzie dance like this is great fun and all.\" Rachel said. \"But don't you think it's time we turn things up a notch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy's eyes lit up, and Rachel felt a surge of excitement as the older woman scratched her chin in thought. After a few moments, Tracy eyed Rachel carefully and responded. \"Yeah, you're right. And I've got just the idea! How about-\"</span></div></div>",

Looking over her shoulder, Rachel saw her escape route cut off by two of Tracy's friends, both of whom quickly took firm hold of Rachel's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you get it.\" Tracy said, closing the distance between the two of them once again. \"You don't get a say in this. This is my party, my house, my call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy snapper her fingers and her friends immediately got to work, their hands quickly pulling at Rachel's clothing. Try as she might, Rachel couldn't pull herself free of the grasping hands, and Mackenzie's tormentor soon found herself just as naked as her redheaded victim. Rachel's cheeks immediately flushed crimson, the embarrassment of both being stripped naked and falling from a dominant position to one as lowly as Mackenzie's being the most humiliating experience she'd ever had. It didn't help things when Tracy whistled and gave one of Rachel's nipples a playful tweak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like Mackenzie has nothing to be jealous of compared to you!\" Tracy teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel simply blushed in response. So what if she wasn't as well-endowed as Mackenzie? So what if Mackenzie got more attention without trying? Rachel wasn't jealous! No. Not one bit... Maybe just a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel didn't get to linger on these thoughts for too long as she found herself roughly pushed up to Mackenzie's impromptu dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, Rachel! Show us what you're made of!\" Tracy cheered, earning a round of applause and agreement from the assembled crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie, meanwhile, was grateful that there was someone else there to take the attention off of her. At least with Rachel being naked too, there were at least a few eyes no longer on her. The satisfaction of karmic retribution helped things as well. Of course, Mackenzie should have known these small blessings wouldn't be of great comfort for too long.</span></div></div>",

And now, to make matters worse, her own father had pulled into the fast food place and was looking around at all the other customers, mostly boys and looking as if he was wondering why. Finally, deciding he would get to the bottom of this, her father finally faced forward, and locked eyes with Mackenzie, his mouth dropping open in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie still stood frozen, her body not moving an inch as she held the trays of food in her hands, ready to be served. Finally, from a sudden call from one of the boys, she shook herself and gave him his food, though her mind still wondered what her father was doing where she worked. It didn't take long however, as she heard her name called, and this time, by the very male she worried about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenzie? What on earth are you doing, parading yourself around like that?!\" he demanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie turned to face him, thoughts rolling in her mind over and over again on how to explain herself. As she stood there in the driveway, naked, she finally broke down and told him everything. She told him how she had gotten locked out of the house after her shower, how she had asked Rachel for help which turned out to be her mistake. That mistake compounded when Rachel took a picture of her nakedness threatening police for a streaker, then made her masturbate on her porch to orgasm which led to another blackmail of recorded video. She continued to vent, uncaring if Rachel made good on her threats now, as she told her father how Rachel had forced her to ride to her own workplace, then made up a story of hazing initiation to her coworker and boss who were all agreeable to make her work like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her explanation, her father stood silent for a few moments. Then, taking her arm in his hand, led her into the restaurant and to the back in the manager's office. Mackenzie stood silently as her boss stood from her desk wondering what was going on, to which her father told her what he had just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking shocked herself, her boss turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really true Mackenzie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie nodded, looking at the floor, too mortified to speak right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boss then picked up her phone, and dialed a number. After waiting a little bit, Susie's voice was easily heard and after hearing her boss' angry voice, was concerned. After a bit more time, she came into the office, and seeing Mackenzie, standing naked beside her father, grew even more concerned, and started to fidget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie.\" her boss snapped<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes Ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true what I just heard from Mackenzie's father here, that Rachel blackmailed her not only to masturbate on her front porch, but completely made up the initiation story that <i>you</i> agreed to to keep her naked here and humiliate her in public? Answer honestly girl, because I don't like being lied to and doing so might mean your job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling, Susie admitted to it, including that she had agreed to it after Mackenzie had refused to masturbate in Rachel's car for her to see, adding that she had invited the boys from school to see their naked waitress as part of the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss lady looked mad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only did you and Rachel blackmail an innocent girl into debasing herself in public, but you had the nerve to invite people she knew from school, to which I don't have to tell you her reputation there might be shot to the point of expulsion. The cherry on top was convincing me to make her go in public naked, to which she was ogled, called names, and debased further. What do you have to say for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie couldn't talk at the moment, as the full ramifications of what she had joined entered her mind. Sure it was fun humiliating Mackenzie, but actually causing her schooling to end abruptly if this got out? That wasn't fun, as she had known others ruined this way. Thinking for once to better act, she opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest I do then Ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss looks at Mackenzie, then her father, then thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally one of the adults speak up...</span></div></div>",

As her left hand reached up to her chest and began gently squeezing her generous chest, her left hand drifted down between her legs and slowly began stroking at her lower lips. Trying to shut out her very public surroundings, Mackenzie tried to imagine that she was sitting at her computer rather than Rachel's car, the browser window open to one of those sites her friends didn't know she visited. It wasn't long before moisture started to build up between Mackenzie's legs, and her fingers easily slipped into her soft entrance, slowly pumping back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and Susie could hardly believe Mackenzie had been talked into doing this, but they certainly weren't going to complain. Rachel took the opportunity to pull out her phone again, making sure to get shots of Mackenzie's body from multiple angles. Rachel noticed that Susie had a similar idea, her own phone in her hands and focused on Mackenzie, though it looked as if Susie was going with a video recording rather than mere photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You know, I like your style.\" Rachel said, giving Susie a little nod of respect. \"You don't care that this is your friend you're taping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend? Mackenzie's not my friend.\" Susie said, flashing Rachel a devious grin. \"We're coworkers, sure, and we get along well enough. But this is some prime blackmail material. If I ever want someone to cover a shift or do one of the crappier jobs, I've guaranteed Mackenzie will work for me. And maybe I want this for some more personal reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, nice!\" Rachel said, commenting both on Susie's rationale and Mackenzie's lewd performance. By this point, Mackenzie was lost in pleasure, her hips thrusting out to meet her fingers as her other hand upgraded from soft groping to pinching and twisting her erect nipples. A minute or two later and Mackenzie was at her peak, pulling her hand away from her chest so she could bite on her finger to keep from screaming as she climaxed. Juices leaked from between her legs, coating her other hand and soaking into the fabric of the car seat. Slowly, Mackenzie's eyes opened and her face reddened as she returned to reality, realizing just what she had done and where she had done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Susie. I did what you wanted. You won't tell the boss about any of this, right?\" Mackenzie pleaded, hoping her coworker was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the boss won't find out. For now. Now, I have a question for your friend.\" Susie said, turning her focus to Rachel. \"My shift is over in an hour or so. Would you mind waiting for me? I've got a ton of ideas for stuff Mackenzie could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was intrigued at this. She certainly wouldn't mind having another cruel mind helping her humiliate Mackenzie. But on the other hand, sitting around waiting for her shift to end would be boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can't wait that long, well, I could go on break right now. I'd be fine with, oh, let's say ten minutes in the back seat with Mackenzie here.\" Susie said, offering a compromise. Suddenly, Rachel was looking at a win-win. Now Rachel had to figure out which sounded more fun, wait an hour for a partner in humiliating Mackenzie, or subject Mackenzie to Susie's whims for ten minutes?</span></div></div>",

Through the haze of the sexual ecstasy, Mackenzie could hear the other girls talking. All she heard, it was all the same, degrading descriptions of her and her supposedly promiscuous nature. When the conversation finally shifted, it wasn't for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, looking at the chat has given me some interesting ideas. I went ahead and asked them for some thoughts on a change of venue, and I for one believe they've got some good ideas.\" Rachel said, eyeing her captive with cold amusement. \"You girls up for a little road trip?\" Rachel asked, and was met with enthusiastic response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie found herself being led back outside the house and into the back seat of one of the girls' cars. She didn't know where she was going, but she knew it couldn't be good. </span></div></div>",

You might end up showing more than just some T&amp;A!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie saw the Lady Amazon the announcer spoke of; an impressive specimen of a 6-foot tall woman who had more muscles than half the men in the audience, yet she still seemed to have a feminine charm to her, Mackenzie knew she had no chance if she was matched up against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For all you newbies in the crowd tonight, the rules are as follow!\" The announcer bellowed the rules to the contest:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two contestants would be given a bikini to wear, for each time a contestant is pinned, they would have to lose a piece of the outfit, and if by some chance a naked contestant lose a third time (or more), the audience will be getting an \"extra show\", as the announcer put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a 30-minute limit on the match, so if the two contestants managed to hold out until the end, some dignity might be spared, either way the amateur would get a consolation prize of $1000, her dignity was what was really at stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, eyes were gathering around Mackenzie, who'd entered this establishment completely nude, gathering more attention than the beautiful Lady Amazon herself at that point, She felt the gaze of everyone looking at her, fantasizing about her losing a third round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a waiver was thrust into her hands by Rachel, Mackenzie was forced to sign it and was given her bikini, a bright red affair that, while offering a touch of modesty, still found a way to accentuate her curves in the sleaziest of manners, not to mention that Mackenzie had a feeling she wouldn't have it for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the ring now, Mackenzie had no disillusions about beating Lady Amazon, but she thought she might be able to weather the storm, so to speak and get out of this with something other than total and utter humiliation in front of a full crowd of people.</span></div></div>",

The first pin came quickly, and Mackenzie found herself forced to relinquish her bikini top before the match was even five minutes in. Now torn between a desire to cover her exposed breasts and a desire to preserve what was left of her modesty, Mackenzie's defense was even worse. The only reason her second pin didn't come as quickly as the first was because her opponent seemed to be toying with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the Lady Amazon seemed to be avoiding pins in favor of locks and holds that put Mackenzie on greater display for the cheering crowd. Nevertheless, Mackenzie found herself pinned and relieved of her bikini bottoms before the match had hit the ten minute mark. Hoping against hope, Mackenzie tried to convince herself that her opponent might try putting off the final pin until near the end of the match; maybe if she was smart and lucky she could avoid the final assault and finish the match without having to put on whatever the \"extra show\" entailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie should have known her luck wouldn't work out like that. Unlike last time, her opponent went straight for a pin, pressing Mackenzie into the floor and yanking her legs further apart than strictly necessary for the pin. As the final count seemed to take an eternity, Mackenzie tried to ignore the fact that she was being put on full display by the pin and the fact that this was merely the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, we have winner! The still undefeated champion, Lady Amazon!\" the announcer bellowed, greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding to greet her audience, the Lady Amazon bowed deeply, blowing kisses to the crowd. Taking the mic from the announcer, she addressed the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, my opponent here just got her third pin. This means she's going to be giving everyone a special show!\" the crowd roared in response to this. \"Now, what exactly is that show? Well, that's a surprise. For now, we have one last part of the match, assuming the audience agrees. You see, we still have a good twenty minutes of match time left, and I'd feel bad if I deprived you fine folks of a full performance. So, how about I sweeten the deal? We'll let the match run its full length, and every time my opponent gets pinned, her performance gets modified! This could mean we add more time to her performance, or add more sweet bonuses for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea that the crowd would disagree with this offer was ludicrous, and in fact the exuberant cheers before the Lady Amazon was finished speaking made the answer obvious. Mackenzie knew she had to do whatever it took to keep herself from getting pinned again. She hadn't done well in the first ten minutes, but maybe her new resolve would help her hold her ground this time?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the Lady Amazon handed the microphone back to the announcer, whispering something in his ear as she did so, Mackenzie did her best to steel herself for the rest of the match. She had already lost her bikini and was going to have to put on the \"special performance\" afterwards, but that was the least of her worries if she couldn't withstand her opponent for the final twenty minutes of the match. Sadly, Mackenzie couldn't see any way to do this; the Lady Amazon was bigger, stronger, and clearly far more skilled than Mackenzie, and she had already proven that she was capable of pinning the redhead with no major effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rang and the round began, Mackenzie had only a few seconds to react as Lady Amazon dashed forward, wrapping her arms around Mackenzie's waist and slamming her into the ground. Winded and stunned by the speed and ferocity of the attack, Mackenzie could do little more than stare at the ceiling as the countdown for her pin passed by. Mere seconds in and Mackenzie had already been defeated again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulled roughly to her feet, Mackenzie was taken back to her corner of the ring as the announcer addressed the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible! A pin in under thirty seconds!\" the announcer boomed, his voice ringing out above the din of the crowd. \"And for the first addition to her defeat, the loser will be working the remainder of the night as a member of the service staff after her show! And, please do keep in mind that as our challenger is not under the same contract as our regular employees, the 'No Touching' rule does not apply!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's heart sank as the announcer spoke. She had hoped that she'd be able to just leave after her humiliation was done, but now she was expected to stay here for hours on end? And more than that, she wasn't protected by the same no touching rule as the other girls? Mackenzie wanted to protest right then and there, but held back as she remembered the consent form Rachel had made her sign. There was little doubt that the form covered all the legal bases for what Mackenzie was being put through. In essence, Mackenzie was powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the match began again, Mackenzie redoubled her efforts to resist the Lady Amazon and actually felt like she might have had some success. When her opponent attempted to hook her arms around Mackenzie's shoulders, Mackenzie actually managed to slip out of the hold and knock her opponent off balance! Hoping to press the advantage, Mackenzie jumped at her opponent for a pin. This was short-lived, however, as Mackenzie found herself reversed, her back on the ground as she stared up into her opponent's eyes. Maybe, just maybe, her opponent might listen to reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, please just let me get a pin.\" Mackenzie whispered, making sure to talk too quietly for the crowd to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on, we've gotta put on a good show for the crowd.\" The Lady Amazon cooed, the tone of her voice catching Mackenzie by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about the crowd! Just give me a break, you invincible bimbo!\" Mackenzie snapped back, growing rapidly uncomfortable under her opponent. This was clearly a mistake, as Mackenzie realized as soon as the word \"bimbo\" left her mouth. The Lady Amazon's eyes narrowed, and her grip on Mackenzie got tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bimbo? What, just because I work at a strip club?!\" Lady Amazon hissed. \"I'll have you know I graduated at the top of my class. I just realized that I can make good money with skills and a body like mine. And unlike you, I didn't show up here completely naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't my-\" Mackenzie started to protest, being cut off as Lady Amazon flipped Mackenzie from her back to her stomach and pulling back on her shoulders, facing Mackenzie towards to cheering crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stow it.\" Lady Amazon whispered. \"Take a good long look at the crowd, Red. I was gonna go easy on you, but now I've decided that they should be allowed to get... very familiar with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pin was counted down, and Mackenzie was once more helped to her feet and put back in her corner. Listening in fear, Mackenzie heard the announcer tell the crowd that this latest pin had put Mackenzie on the list for lap dances, $30 each. Each subsequent pin would knock five dollars off the price until they were free. Then the loss penalties would continue to escalate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took seven minutes for the lap dances to become free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I must admit, this is quite unexpected.\" the announcer said. \"Never before has the Lady Amazon destroyed an opponent so quickly! As we did not actually have any further penalties planned, we have concluded that the Lady Amazon herself gets to decide what happens with the next pin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding the microphone to the Lady Amazon once more, the buxom blonde addressed the crow with a flourish. \"I hope you all have fun with our fabulous volunteer later tonight!\" this was answered with enthusiastic cheers. \"Now, I suppose you all deserve to know what her special performance is supposed to be! Tonight's big loser will be putting on a duo performance, with yours truly as the second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie could hardly believe what she'd just heard. She was supposed to put on a show with this woman? The same woman that Mackenzie had accidentally turned into a sworn enemy? There was no way that could be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given the, well let's just say 'extreme' nature of the performance, I think we might make this pin the last.\" the Lady Amazon said, her announcement met with some disappointment by the crowd. \"Awww, now don't worry, everyone! I guarantee that this will be absolutely worth it! You see, if I can pin her just one last time, her last penalty will be-\"</span></div></div>",

To her temporary relief, she wasn't pushed into the main floor, but along the wall towards what seemed to be the changing rooms.

Her fate sealed, she was roughly pushed by Rachel into the next room.

Gotta hand it to ya, most ladies don't have the guts to go through with it; the amateurs usually end up being the main attraction, you know.\" The woman said, oblivious to Mackenzie's obvious discomfort. \"But with a body like yours, you must be used to the attention, right? Well, I'm Candace, and I'm in charge of getting you ready for the big show. Let me go grab your outfit for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, and without giving Mackenzie a chance to talk, Candace turned around and began searching through a nearby locker.

This is just a can of whipped cream.\" Mackenzie said, trying to figure out if Candace had made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back around with a look of exasperation, Candace walked up to Mackenzie and took the can from the confused redhead. She began to shake the can as she explained the situation. \"Really, newbie? Come on, it should be pretty obvious; you spray some of this on your goods and that's your outfit. People love that kinda thing, in fact... I know a few little tricks that'll make this even more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReadying the can, Candace quickly began to apply the sweet dessert topping to Mackenzie's body. Two generous globs went to Mackenzie's nipples, and her crotch was covered by a small triangle that covered everything important while leaving nothing to the imagination. However, rather than calling it a job well done, Candace went further; she applied some small shots of cream to the small of Mackenzie's back, her inner thighs, the undersides of her breasts, and a few other areas that Candace assured Mackenzie were sweet spots she'd likely never paid attention to. By the time she was done, Mackenzie looked like a dessert any man, and some women, would kill for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn, am I an artist or what?\" Candace asked herself, looking over her handiwork on Mackenzie. \"Alright, you're good to go. Word of advice, keep your legs spread a bit so you don't spread the whipped cream around too much. Now, you're gonna go ahead and stand on this little rolling platform, behind the curtain. You just keep still and wait for your cue. You'll know it when it happens, trust me. Now, relax and enjoy your fifteen minutes of fame.\" With a light swat to Mackenzie's backside, Candace ushered her onto her special platform before running off to join the other regular performers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was glad that she at least had the cover of the curtain on the small platform, though she also knew it was setting her up as the main attraction to be unveiled. What worried the redhead more was what Candace had said about some of the spots she had covered. If they were supposed to be sweet spots, what would that mean about how Mackenzie was going to lose the covering? She had hoped she'd be able to control the rate at which she \"disrobed\" as it were, and the only hands on her body would be her own. But Candace's words implied otherwise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sounds of club music grew louder, and the cheering of the crowd became clearer, Mackenzie knew she'd been wheeled out onto the stage. Feeling her heart thumping in her chest, Mackenzie did her best to calm herself, knowing that there was no helping what was about to befall her. As she tried (and largely failed) to come to terms with her predicament, she heard Candace's voice ring out above the rest of the noise, amplified by a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone, are you having a good time tonight?\" Candace asked, answered by the excited roar of the audience. \"Well you're about to have an even better time! As you know, it's amateur night, and that means fresh faces for the stage! Or rather, one fresh face, the only girl brave enough to bare it all. And as a reward for her bravery, she's been given a place of honor in tonight's show! Everyone say hello to Mackenzie~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the curtain was drawn back and Mackenzie's eyes were immediately assaulted by the bright lights of the club. Adjusting to the light, Mackenzie saw just how large the crowd was- the building was nothing short of packed! Mackenzie couldn't even begin to guess how many people were starting straight at her at that moment, but it was far too many. Then again, one was far too many for her right now. Doing her best to control her nerves and keep from shaking, Mackenzie stood as Candace began to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, Mackenzie has a very special outfit on. Looks delicious, doesn't it?\" Candace asked the crowd, met by enthusiastic agreement. \"Such a sweet dish needs to be savored, and that's why, for tonight's lucky crowd...\"</span></div></div>",

Forgetting about her audience and their cameras, Mackenzie began to massage her lower lips with one hand, her other tweaking and rubbing her stiff nipples. Slipping in one finger, then another, Mackenzie began to slowly pump back and forth, lewdly masturbating in front of the other women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her hand began to increase its pumping speed, Mackenzie became more lost in the pleasure. Before long, her deep breaths evolved into panting, which then slowly became moans. Soon enough, her moans were louder than the sound of the water or the comments of her audience. Mackenzie had no idea how long she stood there, fingers pumping furiously in and out of her pussy, other hand enthusiastically playing with her breasts. Finally, with a strangled scream, Mackenzie came, slowly descending into a sitting position on the shower floor, legs still spread wide open. In the afterglow, Mackenzie slowly became a bit more aware of her surroundings. As her mind cleared a bit, Mackenzie realized something: she was still horny. She needed something more. Looking around the shower, her eyes fell upon an assortment of bottles, and... what could possibly be Rachel's own \"toy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching toward the bottles hesitantly, Mackenzie might not have heard Stephanie's comment. \"Guys, I think we could make some good money here.\"</span></div></div>",

Mackenzie closed her eyes as she leaned in to take him into her mouth, but before she could she felt his hot load splattering her face.  She was no stranger to facials but having it done to her this way, by a stranger, in public, in front of a crowd, was only fueling her newfound wantonness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d she asked in a sultry tone as she looked around at the other guys to see that all of them already had their cocks out and were stroking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie moved over to the next guy and quickly devoured his cock with her moist mouth.  As she circled his head and shaft with her tongue she reached out blindly until she was able to grab a hold of a cock with each hand.  As she continued to fellate the guy in front of her she began stroking the other two guys furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a slut,\u201d she heard one of the guys remark which brought a bit of a blush to her cheeks but did not deter her from working the three cocks simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began bobbing her head back and forth sliding the cock in her mouth deep inside and then just up to the tip of her lips.  She continued doing this for a few moments until she heard him begin to moan out and knew she was about to cum.  When she felt the first spurt coat her tongue she quickly pulled her head back and accepted another load on her face and tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGonna paint you white,\u201d she heard one of the guys next to her that she was jerking off say and before she could turn she felt his warm load hit her in the cheek.  The next few spurts hit her in the shoulder and again on her tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention to the other guy she was jerking off and the sight of the beautiful redhead on her knees and covered in cum was too much for him to bear.  Mackenzie was hit with another load of cum in the face.  She licked her lips seductively as some of the cum began to slide down her face and towards her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill kneeling she approached one of the other guys that was jerking off.  She cupped her breasts as if presenting them to her and he let go of his cock and slid them between her luscious globes.  She pressed them together tightly around his cock as she bounced up and down.  She could feel his cock swell between her breasts and begin to throb as she gave him the best tittyfuck he could have ever imagined.  When she felt that he was about to cum she loosed up around his cock slightly and the first rope of his cum shot up and hit her under the chin.  The next couple that followed she caught between her breasts and used them like she would lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy front is a mess, maybe you guys would like to cover me from behind,\u201d she said to the last two guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie then spread her knees apart and bent forward so that she was in a doggystyle position.  She could feel the cool night air on both of her holes as she waited for the two guys to make a cum deposit on her.  She didn\u2019t have to wait long because only a few minutes after letting the two guys see everything she had to offer she felt a few spurts hit her in the ass which were quickly followed by a few more from the other guy which went most of the way up her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d she heard Rachel say from in front of the house.  Mackenzie had been so caught up her act she had forgotten that she was ever there, and she suddenly felt very embarrassed about the show she had just put on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I come in and get cleaned up?\u201d Mackenzie asked while getting to her feet and covering her breasts with her arm and her pussy with her other hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She laid them all out on the living room coffee table and delighted in describing each item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" The Ben Wa balls rotate freely on the connecting string and each of the six orbs moves and stimulates as the wearer moves whether by walking or by perverse hip gyration. \"  Rachel raised her eyebrows and smirked as she went on. \" They fit any size and are suitable to many sighs.\" she quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The butt plug has a similar purpose although to a perhaps more erotic region.  Shall we see how these toys fit Mackenzie's .. umm... needs?\"  And with that,  the other cheer squad members grabbed their naked prey by her limbs and bent her into a 'receptive' position.

Rachel went into the kitchen and returned immediately with a pair of scissor which she now used to snip her soiled and mustily moist panties in twain.  One half she used as a gag after ordering Mackenzie to open wide.  With the naked girl now stuffed in all three holes, Rachel used the other half torn panties to tie Mackenzie's wrists as the girl's hands were forced behind her back..  Clearly, all three items would remain in place until someone, other than Mackenzie, took them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet, who was herself becoming moist, smiled and asked, \" What this girl needs is....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She loved the feeling, but she hated herself for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her orgasm built, Mackenzie threw caution to the wind. She grabbed Janet's head, and writhed in ecstasy. Her moans turned into screams. \"Oh fuck! Please don't stop, Janet! Keep going!\" she begged. The audience watched intently as Janet brought the gorgeous naked girl to an explosive orgasm. \"Oh fuck! I'm cumming!\" Mackenzie screamed. Her whole body shuddered as the orgasm washed over her. After what seemed like an eternity, she finally collapsed in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls cheered for the show. Janet had a cheeky smile on her face as she lifted her head.

As Janet whipped her shirt off and deftly unhooked her bra, Mackenzie couldn't help but notice how nice Janet's body truly was. Her breasts were firm and perky, tipped with coral pink nipples and sitting above a tight, slim tummy. When Janet shimmied down her pants and panties in one fell swoop, Mackenzie and the others were treated to a view of Janet's wonderfully curvy backside and toned thighs. Also evident was the fact that Janet was a natural blonde, her trimmed bush matching the color of her hair perfectly. A small part of Mackenzie's mind wondered what had caused her breakup; who would call it off with somebody that looks like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now-naked Janet returned to Mackenzie, pulling the redhead into a sitting position. Once she was on her knees, Mackenzie felt Janet's hands guide her own to the blonde's bountiful breasts. Janet didn't need to tell Mackenzie what to do as the redhead began to eagerly squeeze and stroke Janet's chest. Mackenzie had never touched another woman like this before, and she wasn't sure how to feel about it. On the one hand, this was absolutely humiliating: she was being used as a toy and spectacle for a group of women that clearly had no friendly intentions toward her, there was no telling what else they might make her do, and she wasn't sure she could trust them to ever get around to helping her. On the other hand, Mackenzie found the sensation of Janet's breasts in her hands to be very pleasant. Mackenzie had never considered herself a lesbian, or even entertained the idea, but the way this was making her feel was making her begin to wonder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quite some time of hungrily groping Janet's chest, Mackenzie was startled as she felt Janet's hands grab her by the hair, roughly yanking her head forward and into Janet's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to it.\" Janet said, rocking her hips into Mackenzie's face. \"And you'd better do a good job, or else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that ominous threat hanging in the air, Mackenzie took a deep breath to steady herself and went to work.</span></div></div>",

As soon as she makes it through the tight gap, Mackenzie feels a poke of cold metal at the small of her back, and a little boy\u2019s voice says, \u201cStick `em up!  I mean it, lady!  I\u2019ll shoot you point blank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Mackenzie raises her hands. \u201cHigher.\u201d, the boy tells her.

What are you going to tell our Mom and Dad?  That you creeped into our yard naked and acting crazy?\u201d, grins the other of the two rotten little twerps who live next to Mackenzie.

What with the two boys forcing her back to their tall basketball post in the middle of their garden she felt the cold pole touch her bare back making her shiver. Marcus held his B.B gun straight toward her telling her not to move as he tells his brother to find something to tie her up with. It was clear to Mackenzie who the brains was behind this little game as nodding like a toy dog to his brothers commands,Tayshaun quickly disappears into their garden shed a bit further down the garden leaving his brother and their prisoner to stare at each other with two very different looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Mackenzie, she give her captor a very angry almost scary stare trying to hide her face  red as a tomato from embarrassment her current situation of having been lead naked into their garden. Meanwhile Marcus had the look of amazed child who just clever found a way to have that toy they always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, when I get out of her you both are going to get in real trouble.\" Mackenzie threats again. The twerps may have her outwitted over the whole naked thing but nothing would stop her making up another story that would get the boys in trouble when their parents got home. Sadly Marcus wasn't buying her threats. He just repeats himself saying to his prisoner that if she really thought their parents would believe a women who snuck into their backyard naked she not only lost her clothes but lost her mind as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Mackenzie had no way to come back at this and she didn't get the chance before the other Adam brother comes back with some hot pink skipping ropes in his hands. He proudly presented them to his brother who sighed asking him if that's really the best they have? Tayshaun nods saying its the nearest thing in the shed to rope leaving the boys no choice but to tie their prisoner up with a pair of hot pink skipping ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus quickly tells his brother he has the honour of trying up their prisoner leaving Mackenzie to shout and try to wiggle free as the brother quickly ties the rope around her stomach and arms leaving her legs free and her 35C breasts to the two boys. The only thing Mackenzie thought to do now was begin to call for help. But did she really want someone else to see her naked? The whole point of her going out was to find a way to not be naked. However as the beautiful red head considered her options the two boys staring at their prisoner with all sort of fantasies going on in their head over the matter lead to Tayshaun asking his brother what where they going to do now they had a prisoner? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his brothers question Marcus with a smug grin answers him...  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

This must be the day you said I'd be grateful for them,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie brought her feet against the house.  She gradually pulled herself out by pushing with her athletic legs.  Her perky boobs obstructed her as she withdrew, but it was more a momentary embarrassment than a real problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA real problem, that she hadn't noticed, was she had attracted an admirer.  A college boy named Michael had been walking back to his apartment after some early morning shopping when he glanced Mackenzie just as she made her last attempt to get into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most young men in the situation would, Michael snapped in action--he set down the sundries and got his smartphone out to record the nude redhead wiggle out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad I went with the new model,\" he whispered to himself as the camera centered in on Mackenzie's bare, callipygian form's movements.  Michael softly bit his lower lip and glanced upward.  <i>Thank you!</i> he told an indulgent god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Screw you!</i> Mackenzie told a cruel god.  The sun was rising higher and more people would be out and about soon.  But what could she do now?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scratched through her ruby hair as she mused.  <i>Go down the chimney? Kung fu kick down the door?  Imitate the Kool-Aid Man?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought, Michael felt confident he knew what had happened.  Since she had come out of the window gloriously naked and seemed to be looking on going into the house and since she wasn't screaming or running for help, she wasn't a sex offender or political protester or religious nudist or sexual assault victim.  The pretty naked young ginger was either locked out of her before doing some morning sunbathing or she was a sorority pledge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the stakes weren't so high that Michael felt obligated to stop recording.  Indeed, maybe he could help her.  Among other things from the grocery store, there were energy drinks, olive oil, and sunscreen.  He could also use his phone to do more than capture her delightful backside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is her front side better or worse?</i>, Michael wondered and decided how to contact Mackenzie.</span></div></div>",

She seemed haggard and frightened: bags were under her emerald eyes; her pale cheeks were ruby.  Also, she was buck naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie looked around with caution before she advanced.  Macckenzie stopped in front of a bush that she hoped would obscure a passerby's view.  \"Isabel, I'm over here,\" she called in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel jumped in panic when she heard her name.  Her firm rack and lovely rump jiggled as she did and when she turned around to see her big sister.  Her already large eyes became almost anime girl level as she saw that not only was Mackenzie behind her, but she was also in the buff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mac, what are you doing outside?  Naked?\" she asked.  Isabel moved her arms over her sex and across her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie turned away a little and her face flushed more.  \"That's my line, Bel.  Anyway, come over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel nodded and quickly complied.

I was locked out of my house,\" Mackenzie confessed while looking at her cute feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but while you were naked,\" Isabel asked rhetorically while head-gesturing at the redhead's nude form.  \"I told you those walks you take would bite you on your exposed butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie brought a hand to her burning cheek.  \"Well at least this is a first for me.  You've been undressed at work, the park, the beach, the gym...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel grimaced.  \"Don't make it sound like I'm a exhibitionist!  I'm just prone to those situations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Mackenzie said with a nod.  \"Anyway, I assume you were coming to me for help.  I could use your help trying to get through a window.  Unless you had a backup plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel opened her mouth and then closed it.  Her foot moved the dirt around until she finally spoke her mind.  \"Hardy isn't too far.  Based on his posts, he's almost always home this early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie blinked.  \"Hardy?  You think two naked twenty-something sisters should appear on Handsy Hardy's doorsteps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel finally looked at her big sister.  \"That's not fair.

Creeping toward her backyard fence slowly, fearful despite the high fence walls making peeping toms all but impossible, Mackenzie weighed her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer house was between the Max and Janet Henderson, to the left, and Diane Chen to the right. The Hendersons were a young married couple, just a few years older than Mackenzie. They were little more than acquaintances, waving to each other whenever they'd cross paths in the morning. As far as Mackenzie knew, the Hendersons didn't have any kids or pets to worry about, but they also didn't use their backyard for much. Mackenzie assumed as much at least, as she never heard much noise from their yard whenever she was outside. Having never seen it before, she had no way of knowing if it was empty or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane Chen was not Mackenzie's favorite person in the world. She was the type of person to phone in complaints over the smallest thing, and had earned a reputation in the neighborhood as an irritation as a result. She had butted heads with Mackenzie in the past over some trivial matter about her fence violating city ordinance or some other such nonsense. But, Mackenzie knew Diane liked to hang her laundry out to dry, rather than use a machine. Something about saving electricity. If today was laundry day, Mackenzie might be able to snag herself a complete outfit from Diane's clothesline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem with either plan was that once she went over the fence, there was no turning back. Mackenzie would be able to scale the fence from her yard with the aid of a small chair she kept on her back porch, but without any such aid on the other side, she'd be stuck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically, there was a way to check out other yards, but it required going out into the open. If Mackenzie went into the alleyway behind her house, she could try peeking into other yards on her block. Of course, if anybody chose to drive down the alley, or there were people in any of those backyards, Mackenzie would have precious few ways to hide...</span></div></div>",

They have a sliding glass patio door, and a window further down the wall she can try to access.

Terrified that one of the Hendersons saw the door open and came to investigate, Mackenzie whirled around and looked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news was that nobody was entering the tool shed. The bad news, the <i>very</i> bad news, was that the door was being pushed closed! Within seconds, Mackenzie was in near total darkness as the door shut completely, blocking out the generous amount of light it had let in. Shortly after closing, Mackenzie heard the tell-tale click of a lock being set. Whoever was out there just locked Mackenzie in the shed! Suddenly, being locked out wasn't quite so bad as being locked in. At least outside Mackenzie had room to maneuver and places to run to should she risk being found. In this shed, however, Mackenzie couldn't even move comfortably in the near total darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumbling through the shed, Mackenzie peered through a gap in the corrugated roof to try and get an idea of who was out there. Sure enough, Mackenzie saw the retreating backside of Mr. Henderson as he told his wife that the door must have just been blown open by the wind or something after he forgot to lock it. Writing it off as no big deal, the Hendersons went back inside, leaving Mackenzie isolated once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no no! This can't be happening!\" Mackenzie said, panic beginning to set in. \"I've gotta get out of this shed. I can't just stay in here forever! I gotta break the lock or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being essentially blind, Mackenzie began to grope around in the darkness, hoping to find some kind of tool she could use to force the shed door open. What choice did she have? So far as Mackenzie could see, the only options available were to break her way out or just sit there and wait for someone to come unlock the shed again. And if someone was unlocking the shed, they'd probably be coming in, and then Mackenzie would have a very bad scenario on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroping blindly through the darkness, Mackenzie eventually-</span></div></div>",

No, the box of beach supplies would at least potentially have some legitimate clothing in it. Pulling the box out from its hiding place, Mackenzie tore it open and began to scour its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe initial results weren't promising. All Mackenzie found were some broken sandals, an empty tube of sunblock, and a dirty cooler. Beyond that, the box seemed to be empty. However, being desperate and feeling lucky, Mackenzie popped open the old cooler and peered inside. In a way, Mackenzie had lucked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNestled inside the cooler, under a few empty beer cans, were two things Mackenzie might be able to use to cover herself. The most readily apparent was the old bikini, white with yellow polka dots, probably belonging to Mrs. Henderson. Underneath the old bikini was an equally neglected beach towel. Mackenzie felt almost ready to cry at finally seeing some legitimate cover after her very rocky start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Mackenzie removed the items from the cooler and looked them over. The bikini was old and not well cared for, that much was obvious at a glance. The ties were frayed and the fabric seemed worn, but it was still technically clothing. Of course, Mackenzie also had to consider the size difference. Mrs. Henderson wasn't as blessed as Mackenzie when it came to physical assets, and the bikini would likely be a tight fit. That would be issue enough, but with the weakened material of the bikini, was that a risk Mackenzie was willing to take? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelving the thought for the moment, Mackenzie examined the towel. It wasn't faring much better than the bikini. It was old and worn, and looked like it might have even fallen victim to moths at some point. Some parts of the towel were so worn and frayed that they were essentially holes in the fabric. She'd have to make sure she kept a good grip on it and hope to everything that the material held together, but it just might work. So long as she didn't have to tug on it too hard or take her hands away from it for more than a few second, Mackenzie might be able to use it to regain her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing her options, Mackenzie made up her mind and grabbed-</span></div></div>",

She figured that the toolshed was more than likely locked, and if the sliding door was unlocked then the Hendersons were probably inside. The last thing Mackenzie wanted was for any more people to see her in this state than already had, especially not people she had to live next to and see almost every day. So, with her arms doing their best to shield her goods from the telescope's view, Mackenzie scrambled to the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankful for the ladder leading to the treehouse, making the climb that much easier, Mackenzie quickly ascended the tree and pushed open the trapdoor in the floor. Hoisting herself in, the first thing Mackenzie realized was that it was very cramped. It made sense, as the treehouse had been designed for children to play in, not for a grown woman to hide her nudity in. Finding it impossible to stand, Mackenzie had to settle for sitting on the floor with her knees slightly pulled up. Thankful to at least be under a roof again, Mackenzie took stock of her surroundings. The treehouse had only one way in- the trapdoor in the floor that Mackenzie had used, and two small windows gave Mackenzie a limited view of the outdoors.

All at once Mackenzie was overcome with a combination of terror and relief. She was relieved that she had stowed away in the tree house before the group arrived, but she was terrified at how many people were now so close to her. Before she had just thought she was avoiding the Hendersons, now she was avoiding this mob! Worse yet, Mackenzie recognized a lot of them! She didn't know most of them personally, but she recognized their faces from around the neighborhood. There must have been at least half the neighborhood back here! Mackenzie recognized the Hendersons, of course, as well as Diane and Rachel, and at least a dozen other faces. Mackenzie's heart must have been beating a mile a minute; what were they all doing back here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit her- she had received a notice in her mail a few days ago advertising a block party. Remembering the sheet, Mackenzie realized that it was being hosted by the Hendersons, and the date was today! Mackenzie had completely forgotten about it in her panic, and now she was crouching in a decrepit old tree house above them with nothing on her body but the tanning oil that made her skin gleam. If her cover was blown now, she'd be absolutely humiliated! She'd never be able to look anyone in the neighborhood in the eye! And that's assuming she only ended up flashing her body to everyone; with Diane and potentially Rachel, well... Mackenzie would rather not think of what those two might do to her in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to calm her rapid breathing and heartbeat, Mackenzie sat back down, losing her view out the window. If she couldn't see the swarm of people mere feet away then she could try to ignore them. This was hard, of course, due to the dull roar of conversation and the eventual addition of music. Mackenzie hadn't planned to attend the block party, but now she found herself an unwilling attendant, and potentially the main attraction if something were to go wrong. While the situation was horrifying, Mackenzie also noticed that it was slightly... exciting. A familiar tingling sensation was burning between her legs, the same sensation that had tempted her to try these ridiculous nude stunts of hers in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Mackenzie considered taking care of the rising sensation. On the one hand, she'd be pleasuring herself with pretty much the entire neighborhood in earshot, and there was the pervert with the telescope to consider. On the other hand, the ambient sounds of the party and the muffling effect of the tree house would likely drown her out, and if she took care of herself she might be able to think a bit more clearly...</span></div></div>",

Slowly, carefully, Mackenzie spread her legs as her right hand drifted down her body, her fingers finding her already wet and ready to go. Was she really so aroused by this? The answer was obvious as two of her slender fingers easily slipped in, her already sensitive entrance tingling at the feeling. This was simultaneously the most incredible and most terrifying thing Mackenzie had ever experienced. The idea that, mere feet away, a huge crowd of people Mackenzie had to face every day were having a party, completely unaware of her, was incredible. If she were to be discovered now... Mackenzie couldn't even begin to think about the implications. She'd want to crawl into a hole and die if such a humiliating thing were to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, it was the fear of such humiliation that seemed to turn Mackenzie on so much. The more Mackenzie thought about the very real and present danger, the hornier she seemed to become. Eventually the rhythmic pumping of her fingers included a third digit, lewd squelching sounds seeming to echo in the small room of the tree house. Even worse, Mackenzie knew she had at least one spectator for all this. The pervert at the telescope, whoever he or she may be, was getting an absolute eyeful. Mackenzie's positioning in the tree house meant that her spread legs were pointed directly at the window the Peeping Tom could see in, and Mackenzie found this fact equal parts humiliating and exciting. What if they took pictures? Or worse yet, what if they recorded it on video? They could blackmail her with that, and there wasn't a whole lot Mackenzie could even hope to do to counter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand's attention to her dripping sex wasn't enough, and Mackenzie soon found her left hand occupied with her luscious breasts. Alternating between each breast, Mackenzie frantically groped and caressed herself, occasionally giving her stiffened nipples a sharp pinch or light tug. This extra bit of attention was exactly what Mackenzie needed, and before long she was lost in the throes of passion. Her hips bucked up to meet the thrusts of her hand, her toes curled in pleasure, and she could no longer contain the erotic moans that escaped her lips. Mackenzie was building to the biggest orgasm of her life, and all it took was the potential for absolute embarrassment and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like hours of playing with herself, Mackenzie came to a shuddering climax. Her vision swam and she became lightheaded as she felt her entrance contract around her fingers, her juices leaking out between them. Finally, completely spent, Mackenzie collapsed in exhaustion. That session had taken quite a toll on her, and she needed to rest a bit before she tried to do anything else. As she lay sprawled out on the tree house floor, Mackenzie simply listened to her surroundings. It was during this listening that Mackenzie noticed something wrong: what she heard was-</span></div></div>",

It was in that moment, when the photos themselves were winding down that she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a crazy idea, and if it backfired, she might very well be seen as a wrongful molester and outed from other social gatherings she might want to attend.

Not only would Mackenzie be truly humiliated, but if she was right and the girl's exposure was sort of a turn on to her, then she just might make her lose control another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up, she walked over to Mackenzie, who stiffened in embarrassed nervousness at her approach. The girl wasn't sure what Rachel planned, but she knew instinctively that it could not be good and prepared for it. However, nothing could prepare her, or those gathered around the nude girl, for what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mackie.\" Rachel called out sweetly as she approached Mackenzie. \"This entire ordeal has been tough right? You need a way to let go of all this and put it behind you, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie wasn't sure what Rachel was getting at, but she had to admit she made sense. She wanted to get out of here, to get home, safe. And more importantly, get some relief. She wouldn't say it to anyone, but this ordeal had started another arousal to build inside her. If anyone found out, she'd be utterly humiliated. Still, Rachel needed and answer, so she gave a hesitant nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so!\" Rachel sing-songed as she stopped in front of the nude girl. \"Then let me help you ease some of those trussed up and tied nerves hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you me--EEE!\" squeaked Mackenzie as she felt something she obviously never expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking down, she saw that Rachel had blatantly slipped her hand between her thighs and was at this moment slowly stroking her clit. Mackenzie looked up in shock, then looked around, fearing the worst only to see she wasn't the only one.

Isn't that right Debra?\" Rachel looked aside at her friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure looks that way to me.\" Debra nodded grinning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie for her part had mostly lost her voice, as Rachel's agile fingers found her sensitive spots inside her pusy and attacked them mercilessly with quick strokes. She couldn't take it much longer, and opening her eyes, she saw the blushing and sometimes aroused faces of everyone in her neighborhood watching the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why aren't you helping?!' she thought frantically, before a particularly powerful surge of pleasure swept through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Mackenzie, if I didn't know better, I'd say you enjoyed getting fingered in public.\" Rachel taunted her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to torment her further, the harsh words sent another thrill through her body, and her pussy lips grew fuller and wetter, now dripping in small rivulets down her thighs. Rachels noticed this and grinned, then upped the tempo. She was going to have so much fun with this! As she curled her fingers, her nails hit a particularly rare spot, and Mackenzie screamed as her pussy gushed out onto the patio deck. Panting, then girl collapsed to the ground and shivered slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I'd say that was a party and a half huh?\" crowed Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the guests were dumbstruck, before a few started clapping, then a rousing cheer went through them all, despite a nude red head trying to hide herself again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was mortified beyond words, realizing most people in her town had not only seen her naked, but witnessed her getting fingered to orgasm in public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly for our red head...</span></div></div>",

Deep inside there was a wilder part of Diane, which was unkown to anyone in the neighbourhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead flinched when she felt a hand on her bare feet. But she could not even raise her head to see what Diane might be doing. Over the noise of the party Diane explained calmly that she was just fixing Mackenzie's ankles to the firm beams to make sure that if the wood was to break she would not crash. The redhead was almost thankful for this. Maybe Diane was not as bad and dull as she seemed to be. When both ankles were made immobile Diane pushed her head out of the entrance door, looked down, smiled, gave a thumbs up sign and whispered \"careful\". Mackenzie spotted someone with a bucket making his way to the base of the ladder. Whatever they had in mind, this was not good. \"Hey, leave that. I don't need a cold drink. I need some clothes to cover. Get them.\" \"Please\", she added without meaning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one of the younger men boarded the ladder, Diane shook her head and whispered \"they will break. Get a kid\".

Previous experience told them that they were mostly right, although neighbours complained of havoc.

Of course. All had seen the boy climing up with a bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohaaaaa not on my buttt\" she screamed when first one, then another ice cube was populating her back butt. Little rivers of icy cold water were flowing down along her body through the hole in the floor. Her despair was met with louder cheering. \"Icy butt, icy butt\" the crowd sang. Chad enjoyed the teasing of the girl. He had seen real girls nude and had already pestered some neighbourhood kids to show them what they had or not yet had. But being able to roam over the lower body of a helpless girl, and being encouraged, was just what his day was about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane decided that there was more to explore.

Turning her head toward the source of the sound, the nubile redhead was greeted by an incredibly strange sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn RC helicopter, of all things, was makings its way towards her. More unusual than the sudden appearance of a remote toy was what it had with it: dangling from its landing gear was a pair of panties! Granted, the panties were far from modest, appearing to be a lacy red thong, but it was clothing nonetheless. Her heart beating in anxious anticipation, Mackenzie waited for the helicopter to get close and then made a wild leap towards it, her hands clawing at the lacy undergarment it offered. Just as Mackenzie's hands seemed in range, however, the helicopter gained altitude and left Mackenzie grasping at empty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis little exchange continued for several minutes as Mackenzie frantically tried to grab the thong. Mackenzie was so focused that she didn't even consider the incredible show she must have been giving her unknown viewer, her ample chest bouncing freely with every futile jump, her hands too occupied with trying to grab the underwear to bother covering her privates. While it wasn't as if she was on a trampoline, Mackenzie's jumping exercise was certainly a sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of Mackenzie's brain was focused on grabbing the thong, there was a small section of her mind questioning what was happening. Who was piloting this helicopter? Who's panties were dangling from its landing gear? Is this another ploy of the person at the telescope, or someone else? Were those panties meant for her, or was this an errant device meant for another woman in a similar situation? There were a whole lot of questions, but no real answers readily apparent. In any case, Mackenzie wasn't bothered about any of that at present, all that mattered was getting at least something to wear, no matter how minuscule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was exactly what the helicopter's pilot wanted. With Mackenzie's undivided attention on the thong she had no chance of grabbing, the pilot-</span></div></div>",

But like some cruel joke, the helicopter stayed out of reach.  What Mackenzie didn't realize, is that it was leading her further from the Henderson's house.  It flew over the gate, which made the nude red head pause.  The helicopter landed, briefly revving it's little gears, as if to taunt her.  It was out in the open on the street behind the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mackenzie went for it, she would be totally exposed in the back ally lot.  But this was her only chance at some kind of cover!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laser pointer danced over her little body and then moved towards the thong stuck to the landing gear of the helicopter.  The red head was a little annoyed.  Someone for sure had seen her.  The blades on the toy helicopter began to spin up again.  Mackenzie's eyes widened.  Was that helicopter going to move again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it was now or never, Mackenzie made her move.  She looked around past the gate to make sure the coast was clear, and ran for the helicopter.  The helicopter began to fly up, quickly rising in attempt to escape Mackenzie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"  Mackenzie shouted flailing helplessly to get the thong.  But again, it was just out of reach.  She chased it, making many grab attempts at the thong before running directly into a fence.  It was a fairly tall fence, and she quickly realized it was her own.  \"Great,\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a trash can nearby.  It was a cheap plastic one.  It didn't appear sturdy enough to use for climbing.  However, Mackenzie <i>could</i> briefly use it as a boost to see what was going on.  So, she set the can on its side, and stepped up, just barely able to look into her yard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter had landed near the chair Mackenzie was tanning on.  It started to take flight again, this time the thong dropped from the landing gear.  But something was still attacked to it.  It was a piece of paper.  The helicopter flew towards Mackenzie, and landed on the ground beside her.  The laser pointer moved from her breasts to the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie cautiously stepped down from the unsteady can and plucked the note from the copter.  As she unfolded it to read it, the helicopter flew away, back towards the house with the telescope.  Frustrated, she began to read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hot and brave.  And you're in trouble.  If you want more clothes, follow the instructions.  When you finish them, you'll get something.  Fail them, and you'll get no more help!  First task, wait in the alley until the helicopter comes back.  Do NOT cover yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie felt embarrassed and furious at the same time.  How was this help?  The thong was in her back yard where she couldn't get it.  Her gate was locked, as was her front door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could play along with these perverts from afar.  Maybe that helicopter would bring her a bra or a shirt.  But who knows how invested into the prank those perverts are.  They could just drop off the clothes where she couldn't get them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, she might be able to find a lawn chair in one of her neighbor's back yards she could use.  Then she could at least climb her fence and get that thong right now.  </span></div></div>",

She had to wait in that alley without covering herself until the helicopter came back.

If someone saw her, waiting for this helicopter will have been meaningless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pleasant breeze caressed her smooth body.  While normally refreshing, it sent a shiver up her spine.  There was a tingle between her legs, reminding Mackenzie how she got herself into this.  It was warm, and a bit moist around her little treasure, as she kept looking to the sky for the helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie began to count, while waiting for the pranksters to show a little mercy.  \"One... two... three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at herself, now noticing her erect nipples.

A tiny droplet of moister from between her legs dripped onto the rough pavement below her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a passing car broke her from her trance, making her squeak.

Rachel didn't have one, same goes for Diane, and the Hendersons didn't have one either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could start wondering about other neighbors, the buzzing noise of the helicopter returned.  The nude red head looked to the RC toy and saw a note.  In large letters in simply said \"Follow Me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie placed one hand between her legs and one arm on her breasts.  Since all the clothing she had been provided with so far was behind her fence, she had no other choice, and cautiously followed the helicopter down the alleyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter did not slow it's flight, prompting Mackenzie to do a slight jog to keep up with it.  The increased pace made quiet the site out of her bouncing assets.  Along with that, her efforts to cover her lips, combined with her running, was causing quiet a bit of rubbing.  Her experience from waiting before had also left her with a bit of a tingle, but she had to press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jogged through the alley's, getting further and further from the safety of her home, until finally the helicopter was hovering over a gate.   It was a very tall fence, so she couldn't see into the yard.  Mackenzie peeked around the gate, as it was open ajar, and sure enough, there was an above ground pool.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Mackenzie couldn't be sure nobody was home.  She was entering the back yard from the alley.  How would they react to a naked woman in their pool?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gone this far, she tip toed in, feeling softer grass on her feet instead of rough pavement for a change.  The gate shut behind her with a clicking noise, as the red head turned around, and her eyes widened.  There was a lock on the gate!  She tried to open the gate, but it only clacked uselessly.  This gate needed a key.  Now she was trapped in a different backyard!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noticed a red dot on the lock.  It was the laser pointer!  She looked up towards the three story garret where the voyeurs had been watching, with a really angry look on her face.  Looking back to the light from the laser, it circled the lock, and then moved towards the pool.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beauty gave an annoyed sigh, forgetting her shyness for a moment, and walked towards the pool and looked over the edge.  If nothing else, the pool water was crystal clear to the bottom.  And that's when she noticed a bronze object under the water.  It was a key!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only seemed logical that the key was meant to open the fence.  She'd need that key to get out of this yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked towards the pool ladder, remembering her instructions to take a dip.  Mackenzie sighed, cautiously looked around and climbed the latter, slowly elevating her exposed body to the world around her.  She really hoped that nobody was home.</span></div></div>",

It felt nice on a warm summer day.  This little dip would have been wonderful under other circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cool pool water provided a slight shock to Mackenzie's warm car.  She shuddered as she lowered herself in.  She thought maybe the water would help her body calm down, but instead she had goose bumps and very hard nipples.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she was shoulder deep with her feet touching the bottom.  Her face was obviously red, but tried to remain focused on her mission.  She was going to need that key.  So the red head carefully waded in the water and tried to reach for the brass object with her toes.

It looked like an ordinary metal key.  Was it supposed to break?  Or get stuck in the locks?  She couldn't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she also wasn't sure of was if there was anybody home at this house.  She didn't want to spend a lot of time there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waded in the water, she looked around the back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the back, was the gate she entered from.  It was the sensible thing to get out of this stranger's yard as quickly as possible.  Getting caught naked here would be more than embarrassing, she was trespassing.  Getting to the gate would mean she'd have a little more privacy back in the alley while she waited for the helicopter to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the path around to the front yard where the lock box supposedly was.  If she could get to it, then maybe, just maybe, there would be something she could wear inside.  However, this would mean exposing herself to the street.  The reward might be better, but she was far more likely to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie took a deep breath, knowing she couldn't stay in the pool forever.  The naked beauty climbed the latter, droplets of water running down her bared skin as she ascended.  Her nipples were still hard, and her breasts had a slight jiggle as she climbed up.  Once her bare butt was above water, it bounced in a similar way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, and even shivered slightly as a cool breeze blew over her wet body.  She turned and climbed down the latter and was outside of the pool.  Her feet felt the grass, now feeling rough to her as she stepped down.

If that key really did break, she would have to run all the way around the block to get back to the alley.  But it was a high risk move, that had to mean something useful was in that lock box!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head cradled her breasts in her arms as she tip toed towards the front yard.  There were no bushes, not even a car in the driveway.  So nobody was home, but the privacy fence eventually ended.  If someone came, she could only retreat to the backyard.  There wasn't even a tree for her to hide behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neighborhood seemed very quiet as Mackenzie double backed around the house.  In front of the front porch, there was the lock box.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite far from the path to the back yard, there'd be no hiding if she did this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she bit her lip, and decided to do this as quickly as she could.

Wiping her eyes frantically, Mackenzie saw a pie tin on the ground in front of her, its contents now splattered across her face and chest. Mackenzie's front was a mess of whipped cream and cherry filling, a cold runny mess. In light of this, all the flustered redhead could manage to say was an exasperated \"...Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that promise and all those hoops she jumped through for a juvenile prank? And now the quickest way back to the alley was cut off! Whoever was putting Mackenzie through this seemed dedicated to making the experience as drawn out and debasing as possible.

A quick look up and down the street gave Mackenzie a quick idea of her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closest way back to the alley would require running down the sidewalk of a busier street, with more than a few cars at any given time. There were things to hide behind, but Mackenzie would have to time her sprints from hiding spot to hiding spot right, or else she was certain to be seen. The other path was longer, but continued through the suburbs, which were less likely to have traffic. Of course, there was the unpredictable issue of people looking out their front windows or enjoying the fresh air on their porches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it might not be a bad idea to clean this mess off. It would just take another dip in the backyard pool, and leaving the mess unattended would result in a dried sticky mess that Mackenzie could honestly do without.

They weren't much, but they were big enough to block the view of her.  She simply had to be quick and make her move back to the alley.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it sounded simple, as a car drove by.  And another.  And another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quick path to the alley was also a couple of turns away from a main road.  Aside from a couple of voyeurs, her mishaps were currently unknown to the neighborhood, and she wanted to keep it that way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a few steps towards a blue metal mailbox on the corner, looking cautious.  The red head could feel her heart thumping as she crouched down behind it.  A breeze ran by, reminding her of her lack of coverage, as she looked toward a tree she needed to get to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mackenzie was about to sprint to the tree, she hid back behind it again.  A car had rolled up for the stop sign.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie closed her eyes tight, hearing the rumble of the engine.  Currently it was to her left, and then it moved to her right.  Then a little further, and then stopped.  Mackenzie opened her eyes, and saw a car in the driveway of the house she was just at!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing caution to the wind, Mackenzie got up and ran for the next tree, not caring who had just gotten home.  The red head reached the tree and stopped, and panted for a moment.  She had just narrowly dodged another car coming to the intersection, this one booming loud music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's back was to the tree, facing away from the street.  There she could see a window, and a reflection of herself.  Aside from a mess of whipped cream and cherry filling, there was nothing covering her.  But that's when she got an idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mess on her face made it harder to recognize her.  Her identity was concealed by the messy mask.  And with some careful placement, it may be able to do more than just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie swiped some of the desert off of her face, and wiped it on one of her breasts.  The cool feeling made her shudder, as her nipples were still very hard and sensitive.  There was only enough whipped cream to cover her nipples for the time being.  Her currently moist crotch would have to simple rely on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the more noisy car had rolled into the distance, Mackenzie made her move and sprinted to the next tree.  She got lucky with a small break in traffic, and pushed herself once more running back to the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran as fast as she could, her round bottom and breasts bouncing freely.  Now she was about halfway back to her home.  Mackenzie wasn't sure what she was going to do when she got there, she couldn't even get back into her back yard from the alley.  But at the very least it was more secluded than the sidewalk.</span></div></div>",

This time the landing gear was holding a bra.  It had kept it's hover above Mackenzie's reach, much to her dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head had already thought against trusting notes.  With all the risk she took only to fall for a prank, there wasn't much reason <i>to</i> trust it.  The helicopter was flying towards Mackenzie's house, which she assumed meant it was going to leave the bra there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her luck had briefly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA breeze rolled by, disrupting the helicopter's flight.  It lost control and crashed in the ally, upside down.  While it looked mostly undamaged, it wouldn't be able to take off sitting that way.  Thanks to this, Mackenzie had her first access to clothing since locking her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hands covering herself as best she could, she scampered towards the toy and snatched the bra from it.  Something was finally going right!  She noticed a note on the landing gear, but before playing into their games any further, she had something to put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mackenzie put the bra on, she felt happy to have some kind of fabric press against her skin.  She was also satisfied to find that the bra had fit her very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit too well actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer inspection of the bra, she found it was exactly her size, preferred material, brand and color.  Mackenzie remembered it not being easy for her to find one just perfect for her.  She also remembered losing one but wasn't quite sure how.  This bra, looked exactly like the missing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what did this mean?  Whoever the master RC helicopter pilot was, <i>knew</i> her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis realization made her blush deeply and close her eyes.  She put her hands tightly over her treasure, knowing her problem just got a little worse.  Someone she knew, was plotting all these pranks.  Someone she knew, knew she got some pleasure out of being naked in her back yard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who had access to her clothes?  She could only think of three that may have ever been near her laundry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n First was Marianne, who she couldn't imagine her best friend doing something like this to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Willow, who was her roommate in college.  Mackenzie always thought Willow may have wanted to be more than friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly there was Rachel, and Mackenzie wasn't quite sure how she felt about her at the moment.  The red head couldn't say she'd be above a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, she wasn't sure any of them would have had the patience to fly a helicopter that well.  She looked towards the helicopter, which still had a note in it's landing gear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she going to try another order?  Not likely, but maybe she could try looking at the handwriting a little closer...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And while several of them were of her running around the neighborhood during the day, there were several where she appeared more carefree at night.  Some where she was cooling off over her bedroom window, and another where she was on her lawn chair, completely nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie looked around with a blush, to make sure nobody was coming.  First, she decided to read the note that came with the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're bold!  You earned something!  Does it feel familiar?</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it said.

There was a thong and some ankle socks.  With her bra, she could be... legally decent.  Perhaps she could pass it off as a swimsuit, though she was quite far from the local beach, and didn't have a pool.  Could she get anything more than this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could think of trying to reach a friend wearing only underwear, the bottomless girl had to wonder about the notes proposal.

All she knew was that it involved being in her own front yard. Was the challenge the same, just with a different setting?

That curvacious body was always something Willow enjoyed being near, and for the moment she wanted to be a little closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the water raining down and the curtain pulled, Willow had the cover she needed to do what she wanted.  She gripped the hemline of her dress and pulled upwards, sliding it over her head.  The dress was dropped into a laundry basket, as Willow proceeded to push her panties down until they no longer gripped her body.  A short while later, an unhooked bra dropped into said laundry basket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was now as naked as Mackenzie was.  She had a wide grin, planning on a little fun with her friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was trying to wash her backside, when the curtain was pulled.  The red head looked and saw Willow standing there, naked as she was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-willow?  What are you doing?  Why are you naked?\"  Mackenzie said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow smiled and stepped into the shower.  \"I thought I'd join you...\"</span></div></div>",

Mackenzie attempted to cover herself with her hands, but found covering her boobs quite difficult on account of being made slippery by the soap. She eventually was able to properly cover herself, but not before Willow got to see pretty much everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow shrugged. \"Why not? After you said you were going to take a shower, I thought that sounded pretty nice myself. Figured it wouldn't be a big deal, given that you did come to my house naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie opened her mouth to object, but couldn't find the words. Willow took this as a sign that Mackenzie didn't mind, and casually started washing herself next to her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's not that big of a deal\" Mackenzie told herself, and continued on with her shower. Figuring that Willow was naked herself and had seen nearly everything anyway, Mackenzie uncovered herself so that she could continue her own shower without the awkwardness of having to cover up. Willow didn't seem too bothered with her own nudity, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mack, what on Earth kind of sequence of events lead to you showing up at my door butt naked?\" Willow inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie had no idea that the day would lead to her having a conversation while sharing a shower with her former college roommate, but alas here she is. Figuring that Willow was owed an explanation as to why she showed up naked,  Mackenzie she told her nearly everything that happened that lead to this moment. Even the part about being blackmailed by an unknown person with an RC camera! Willow's eyes went wide as she listened intently to the story, while also shampooing her hair at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mackenzie decided to leave out the reason why she was naked in the first place, not wanting Willow to get the wrong idea. She hoped Willow wouldn't press further, but unfortunately Willow doesn't let much get by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that's ridiculous, Mack. I almost wouldn't believe you, but I don't think anyone could really make up a story like that. Though I have to ask... why were you naked in the first place?\" Willow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, nothing gets past this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... well you see... that's because...\" Mackenzie began to stammer. Should she tell Willow the truth, and let her know that she likes being naked sometimes? Or make something up, like it was an accident? Knowing Willow's sometimes a little over-the-top playfulness, that might not be a good thing to tell her, but she also might be able to see through her lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould Mackenzie tell her the truth or not? </span></div></div>",

I always suspected you were a secret exhibitionist!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not what it sounds like! I don't like people seeing me, I just did it out of comfort!\" Mackenzie groaned. This was what she was afraid of happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, Mack.\" Willow said with a wink, washing the shampoo out of her hair. Mackenzie hoped that Willow wouldn't use this information against her, but unfortunately she is unable to guarantee that fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued their shower, switching the conversation to general girl talk. Feeling less uncomfortable with the situation, Mackenzie eventually stopped worrying about her nudity and focused on getting clean and talking with her friend. Though it felt weird to admit, Mackenzie was kind of enjoying her shower with Willow, though that's likely because it's the least stressed she's felt all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the day was about to become stressful yet again. Willow had earlier that day opened all the windows so that she could get some cool air in the house on this warm day, while saving money on AC costs. However, Mackenzie never noticed and Willow didn't think much of leaving a window open, especially on a day like today. In almost any other circumstance, an open window would hardly be anything to be concerned about. But this was no ordinary situation, as neither girl considered the possibility that the mysterious voyeur had followed the naked redhead to Willow's house. Somehow, it never occurred to either girl that the toy helicopter that tormented Mackenzie could be the same one that told Willow to wait for someone. One could expect this lack of critical thinking from Mackenzie, but usually Willow was on top of stuff like this. Regardless, nobody could predict what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bathroom window open and both girls naked,the mystery voyeur took this as a perfect opportunity to strike. Carefully, the RC helicopter was piloted through the open window. Neither Willow nor Mackenzie could hear the buzz of the helicopter over the sounds of the shower and their own conversation, meaning neither girl was aware of the flying intruder. Skillfully, the RC toy was guided to Willow's pile of clothes. Ironically using the same hook that was previously used to give Mackenzie a piece clothing, the pilot deviously hooks Willow's dress onto his helicopter. The pilot repeats this process a few more times, stealing both towels and more of Willow's clothing. Just as the girl's shower was winding down to an end, the RC quietly flies out the window, with Willow's clothes. After turning off the water, Mackenzie thought she could hear just the slightest buzz of helicopter rotors, but figured it was just her brain playing tricks on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon exiting the shower it was quickly revealed to her that this was more than a figment of imagination, as her and Willow step out to find...</span></div></div>",

With a small squeak of embarrassment and dismay, Mackenzie hastily threw her arms across her body to deny the boy any more of a free show than he'd already received. The kid seemed at least half Asian, probably related to Diane, maybe a nephew or little brother, perhaps a cousin. The exact relationship wasn't important to Mackenzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...

She had put her laundry out to dry, as usual, and waited for it to dry. Taking a shower to kill time, Diane decided to forgo getting dressed before heading into her back yard, instead planning to just dress of the clothesline. Unfortunately for her, somebody had swiped her laundry off the line. This would have just been an annoyance, had the door not slammed shut and locked behind her after stepping outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither woman particularly cared for the other, but they were in a similar predicament. Two heads are better than one, and perhaps they could figure out a solution that wasn't entirely humiliating.

She was right, as the street was far from empty at the moment. A few houses down was a landscaping van with several workers milling about. While they were mainly focused on their work, the street would be in their peripheral vision and it wouldn't be impossible for the to notice the two streakers. A bit down the block in the other direction were some college age kids lounging on a front lawn, though whether they were sleeping in their seats or not was impossible to tell from this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the run across the street would be risky.

Maybe it'd be best to lie, make up some big sob story to score some pity from these people.

She remembered going to the local carnival and stripping naked in the ferriss wheel when it had broken down with her at the highest point, she hadn't noticed when it started again so was greeted to many smiling faces once she came and was so surprised she ran off, leaving her clothes behind. There was of course also the sybian incident with Rachel, the time she got stuck naked in a hole in a concrete wall and ended up getting fucked multiple times, after they asked her of course, which was very lucky if her. There was also the time she got stuck in an elevator with an electrical engineer which went exactly how you'd expect.

A lithe girl with a runner's body and shot auburn hair, the two had met in their freshmen year when they'd been assigned as roommates. While Marianne was Mackenzie's closest friend, the redhead considered Willow to be high up on the list as well. They'd become close during their year as roommates, and had consoled each other in the wake of breakups and the stresses of college life. There had also been that one night they never talked about, when they had both been drinking and got into a heavy make out session. They agreed that it had just been the alcohol lowering their inhibitions, but Mackenzie had never been able to shake the feeling that Willow felt a bit more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Mackenzie was torn between humiliation and relief that it was Willow who found her on display. On the one hand, Willow was a friend she felt she could count on. On the other hand, she was giving the bisexual girl a shamelessly graphic show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow?!\" Mackenzie gasped. \"I'm so glad you found me! I'm stuck and need some help! Please, you've gotta help pull me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mackenzie?!\" Willow asked in disbelief. \"Wh-why are you naked? Did someone attack you?! Are you hurt!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. it's... it's a long story.\" Mackenzie muttered. \"I'm fine, but I won't be for long if you don't get me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence on the other side of the fence, and for a moment Mackenzie was worried that Willow had left. That fear was driven away in spectacular fashion when the gorgeous redhead felt something warm and wet slide against her exposed sex. Blushing crimson, Mackenzie tried in vain to close her legs as she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing?!\" Mackenzie asked. \"Did... did you just lick me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always wanted you, Mackenzie.\" Willow admitted. \"I... I'll never get an opportunity like this again. Please, don't take this away from me! Just let me do this and I swear I'll help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was torn. She wanted help, and she'd rather get it sooner and from someone she knew than a stranger that might arrive after an unknown amount of time. Then again, was she really willing to let Willow do this to her? Sure, Willow was cute and funny, and maybe Mackenzie thought about that drunk make out session every now and then, and perhaps sometimes it was when she was touching herself, but that didn't mean she was attracted to women! Though this objection felt weak even to her...</span></div></div>",

You can... do it.\" Mackenzie choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead could practically feel her friend's smile. Mackenzie felt Willow's soft hands grasp her thighs, holding them steady and parting them to fully expose her pink treasure. The feeling of Willow's warm breath at the junction of her legs had Mackenzie biting her lip in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna regret this, Mackenzie. Promise.\" Willow whispered huskily before planting her face into Mackenzie's moist flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie couldn't stop her head from arching back and the cry of shocked ecstasy that erupted from her lips when she felt Willow's tongue slide across her lower lips and tease its way inside her. The other girl's tongue was nimble, and strong, and so delightfully talented that Mackenzie's legs began trembling within moments. None of Mackenzie's past romantic partners had ever displayed this kind of talent at oral stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah! Willow, oh god, Willow that feels- ooooh fuck!\" Mackenzie wailed, her words tumbling out of her mouth in a stream of consciousness. Her nipples were stiff and aching, and Mackenzie's hands were quick to oblige them and satisfy their desire to be teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow, meanwhile, redoubled her efforts, her lips moving from Mackenzie's opening and up to her exposed clit. Gently taking the small nub in her mouth, Willow gently poked with her tongue while one hand teased over to Mackenzie's folds and slid in two slender digits. The result was instantaneous. Mackenzie's vision swam, the redhead saw stars, and her hips bucked in the strongest orgasm she could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie wasn't sure when she'd wrapper her legs around Willow's head, or how long she'd been riding the other woman's face, but she knew that Willow had just given her an unforgettable experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow... uh...\" Mackenzie began, searching for the right words between labored breaths. \"That was... I mean... wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Mackenzie.\" was Willow's reply. \"But really, it was my pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, now you're gonna help me out, right?\" Mackenzie asked sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course!\" Willow cheerfully answered.</span></div></div>",

If there was any good way out of this, it wasn't here. Instead... she'd have to take a huge risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe street the alleyway led to was quiet. The front yards seemed abandoned, and the only sounds came from birds in the trees and cars on other streets. Running across the street would be a quick ordeal, and there wasn't anybody around that Mackenzie was aware of that would see her. She'd just have to expose herself to a quiet neighborhood for a few agonizing moments before ducking into the next alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust run, completely naked, through a suburban neighborhood. Near enough to her house that people might recognize her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was awful, but there was no choice. Taking a deep breath, Mackenzie tried (and largely failed) to calm herself down. Forcing her knees to stop shaking, the buxom, naked redhead grit her teeth and ran like her life depended on it. With her arms pumping at her sides to help with her run, there was nothing to stop Mackenzie's bountiful chest from bouncing all over with every step she took, breasts jiggling and pink nipples dancing in the sun. Mackenzie's display was a delightful show to behold from any angle, every inch of her toned and slightly tanned body on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie tried to push this fact from her mind, embarrassed enough to be doing this with nobody around to see. She'd be incredibly relieved once she ducked into the next alleyway to continue her search.</span></div></div>",

The redheaded beauty was fairly intelligent, her predicament notwithstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie turned to face the street and leaned against her front door; she took a couple of deep cleansing breathes.  She moved her left hand to cover her womanhood and her red landing strip while her right forearm covered her pretty pink nipples, but still left most of her lovely knockers visible to any passersby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her blue eyes for a few moments; by the time she reopened them she had four other ideas.  One was to simply hail a driver for help.  Two was heading over to her sister's place.  Three was try to make it to her ex-boyfriends.  And four was to travel to a locksmith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile getting a driver's attention was not ideal, it might be best to proactively solicit aid.  Mackenzie was typically positive and believed most people would help a pleading naked young woman versus just seeing some ginger bimbo streaking around.  A driver could likely make a phone call to Marianne, a locksmith, family, or whomever.  She might even be allowed in the driver\u2019s vehicle to obscure her shapely naked body, but that would be a pretty big risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's younger sister, Isabel, was a lot like her.  The newly-turned 23-year-old blonde had a callipygian form, a gregarious disposition, and nudity penchant.  While Isabel was more modest than Mackenzie, she had the unfortunate tendency of ending up disrobed in public.  She would be sympathetic to her big sister's problem.  Isabel lived two blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Pedro, was an outdoorsman who she had seen climb up the side of a house twice to get into locked houses--for benign reasons.  Like Isabel, Pedro was no stranger to seeing Mackenzie in her birthday suit, and she imagined he would be willing to help.  He was an honorable guy and while he had ended their relationship to be with a bustier-than-Mackenzie coworker named Kida, he had been honest about it and had not cheat on her.  However, he lived four blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie didn\u2019t know much about the closest locksmith, other than it was called \u201cKeydom\u201d and where it was located.  Willow had her partner use them when she got herself handcuffed to a bed; according to her, the young lady that came over was friendly and fast.  \u201cAnd then,\u201d Willow added, \u201cshe got me out of the handcuffs.\u201d  However, \u201cKeydom\u201d was on semi-busy street and was three blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie\u2019s calculus was interrupted by the sound of a truck driving by.  Presumably the driver did not notice her and her nudity as the vehicle continued down the road, but Mackenzie realized she should decide quick.  Or, maybe go to the large bush in the front, conceal herself there for now, and continue pondering her choices.</span></div></div>",

She half-turned to walk away, but then kicked herself remembering she was barely covering her breasts and sex, while her shapely ass was bare.  Her quick turn back only caused her booty to jiggle, which was happily captured by the blond voyeur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond put on a broad, naughty smile as the tattooed driver cleared his throat for the blond to join them in their huddle.  Mackenzie felt the knot in her smooth stomach tighten some as she back away a couple of steps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't get a malevolent vibe from the group.  She could see three of them had dilated eyes and that were at least partly tumescent, but that didn't mean much.

She had a guess for how they wanted to be payed and wondered if saying exactly how she wanted help should be said before hearing the propositions.  She decided on asking for help first and told them about forcing a window, the locksmith, or her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJi looked at his associates and they had a brief huddle again before responding.  \"To be direct: forcing a window is worth a job of your choice; a ride to the locksmith or your sister is worth a dry hump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was stunned.  She had been trying mentally prepared herself for having to expose her body fully or maybe get fondled.  For her, this was beyond the pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was momentarily froze, Damien shrugged.  \"Or we could just take off now, Mack.  Maybe let some of our friends know there's a beautiful naked girl here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOak lightly shoved Damien.  \"Hey, we agreed--no threats!  It's an agreement, not an extortion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or a sextortion,\" Spike added with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie tried to clear her head.  Firm but polite refusal was available.

Well, there was the station-wagon, but they were just throwing newspapers to the few houses that still had subscriptions in her neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mackenzie decides to hide behind some low decorative shrubs right along the edge of the sidewalk outside her house.  They form a slight \u2018V\u2019-shape that is ideal for her to peek out from under, and she surveys the neighborhood beyond her yard, pondering how she can get back inside her own house; preferably with the barest minimum of total humiliation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peeking through the bushes at houses across the street from hers, it becomes even more apparent to Mackenzie that more early-risers are starting their days.  This inevitability is terrifying to her, as hope of getting back inside her own house without anyone seeing her dwindles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peering out toward her next-door neighbor to the left of her driveway, Mackenzie notices the flag that the owner, Mr. Hoffman, flies by his mail box. Both Hoffman and his wife are big, crude people, and they always seemed to erupt into shouting matches whenever she would cross paths with them.  That flag, though!  She hated to think what her neighbor would do to her if he caught her running around naked, stealing his stupid flag.  But it would give her SOME small amount of coverage than trying to hide her dainty bits with only her arms.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Squicked-out at the idea of Hoffman seeing her buck naked, Mackenzie frantically gazes through the bushes at the property to the right of her driveway.  She doesn\u2019t see or hear anyone doing anything over there yet, which sort of comforts Mackenzie.  She\u2019d feel like a trapped deer if she had to try to keep peering out at both neighbors houses for fear of being seen!   Then, she sees it!  One of those passing cars was throwing newspapers up the driveways of subscribers.  And apparently, her neighbors the Greene's to the right still read the paper!  \u201cWell, they\u2019ll just have to miss today\u2019s edition.  If I can get to that newspaper, I\u2019ll try to fashion some quick coverage from the pages so I won\u2019t feel so totally exposed.\u201d, Mackenzie considered to herself, naked and kneeling with the sun coming up and people's days starting.<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Plus it was a bit out of the way, so being seen as she ran for her sister's was the more safe choice to her. Mackenzie with her mind made up, jogged as if her life depended upon it towards her sister's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~A little bit about her sister: While Isabel was indeed when her sister knew her best, a few changes had come over her in the past year they had lived apart. Isabel had been the brunt of so many nudity happenings, that she slowly came to like them secretly, and wanted others to share in her newfound excitement. Of course, on the surface she still acted like a shut-in mostly.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mackenzie ran the two blocks to her sister's place, she was frantically looking around to make sure no one saw her. Then racing up the steps of the complex, she was almost out of breath when she finally reached her destination, though she knew she couldn't just barge in. Calming herself as much as she could in the semi-open space of the hallway, Mackenzie tried to slow her breathing, and finally knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit before the latch was thrown and it opened, showing Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenzie?! What on earth? Why are you standing there in the buff?!\" she was incredulous<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault, honest!\" Mackenzie blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...?\" Isabel prompted her to go on, ironically standing in the doorway and keeping Mackenzie outside, though not on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had just gotten out of the shower, was headed to get dressed, when someone or something on the door knocked a lot. So when I went to check it, I tripped and fell outside with my towel catching on the inside of the door and pulling it closed on me! And we both know we have auto-locking doors!\" ranted Mackenzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel stood a moment silent. While she understood Mackenzie's plight, and desperately wanted to help her, there was also this chance to share her hidden experiences with the one family member she loved so much. She was at an impasse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally...</span></div></div>",

This is a very long day Mackenzie is sure to never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral rules: While Mackenzie can find something to cover herself up with, it shouldn't last more than a chapter or two before it is sacrificed or lost. Mackenzie absolutely does NOT want to be discovered, but her luck in this regard falls to you, the contributor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note: Mackenzie is normally age 25, but due to this information not being clearly present, one story path has her as an 18 year old high school senior. Since this age specification wasn't clear at the time of the path being made (and due to quality of the chapters added) they are being left in. However, all other story paths should treat Mackenzie as her 25 year old self.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRestrictions: The usual restrictions apply- NO rape, gore, vore, scat, shrinking/growing, or diaper related content.
