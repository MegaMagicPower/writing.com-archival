The Baby. The Metroid that had bonded with Samus Aran on the planet sr388 and it had just been struck down by Mother Brain. Samus knelt down next to the dying Metroid as the glow that eminated from it slowly left. Samus began to silently weap next to the now dead creature before she looked at her arm canon which was now glowing in a rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother!\" Samus shouted before turning to the organic computer with hate filled eyes behind her visor. \"Time to go.\" She said coldly before launching out the very same attack that Mother Brain had use to wound her earlier causing the AI to let out crys of agonizing pain with every single hit. After a few mear minutes of continued fire from the colorful rape beam, Mother Brain finaly fell to the ground before turning to dust and blowing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus then heard a loud alarm going off. Said alarm was the sound of self destruct the trigger of which was most likely triggered by the destruction of the AI. Samus then prepared to make a run for it to escape. However just before taking her first step, she heard crying coming from behind her. She then turned around and activated her echo visor to see where it was coming from and upon doing so, saw the sound waves of the crying coming the carcas of the Baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus then ran over to the Metroid just before the outer shell broke open to reveal a small female child that looked to be about 3 years old with pale green skin, short dark green hair blood red eye and if not for those features, looked like Samus when she was 3. The child was still crying while holding her arm which was clearly burned by a laser blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy. It hurts.\" The girl whispered as she looked up at Samus as the realization struck her like a truck to the face. Somehow the Baby Metroid had evloved in to a humanoid form. Just like when Metroid Prime had evolved in to Dark Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took a moment to compose her self before picking up the girl and wrapping her in a Space Pirate flag she ripped from a nearby wall. \"Shh. It's okay. I'm here.\" She whipered as her helmet flashed off before she kissed the wound on the Human Metroid's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Self destruct in 3:00 minutes.\" A voice said on the speekers promting Samus reactivate her helmate and star running throught the coridors as fast as she could as the girl held on to her neck. After Samus rescued the animals from the cell they were in. It was smooth sailing back to the ship with 1:15 minutes to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon getting a safe distance from Zebes, Samus looked back to see her childhood home expode along with what ever remained of Mother Brain and Ridley. Samus then looked down to the Human Metroid toddler that was now sleeping in her lap before a smile graced her lips. Just then the com on her ship chimed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus Aron, come in. This is the star ship Dragoon. Please respond.\" The GF captain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus here.\" She said in to the comunicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to here from you, ms. Aron\" The Captain said. \"What's your status.\" He asked while atempting to get a debrief of the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Planet Zebes has been completly destroyed along with the Space Pirates and Mother Brain.\" Samus explained to the Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the Metroid? The higher ups need to know what happened.\" The captain said as Samus looked down at the little girl in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Metroid was destroyed.\" She lyed knowing what awated the Metroid girl if the Federation knew about her. The experiments, the pain, and the strait up torture they would put her through in order for them to make her in to a weapon or worse. Make an entire army of Metroids and there was absolutely no way in the 7 Hells that Samus would ever let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood. Do you require any medical assistence?\" The Captain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be necassery. Samus out.\" Our favorite Bounty Hunter said before she turned off the com. She then looked back to the child as yet another gentle graced her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Scene change: Undisclosed Planet. Population: 2)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours of flight through space. Samus finaly reached her secret compound. (With all her enimies, she seems the type to have 1.) After letting out the animals she saved on Zebes in to the field on the east end of the compound, she carried the little girl inside and in to her bed room before lying down with the Metroid girl still in her arms. She then started to run her hand across the childs head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, I will always be there to protect you... Virginia.\" She whipered in a soothing voice as she gave the girl a name. The name of her own mother. The woman who sacraficed her own life to protect Samus (Fitting considering how the Metroid had mere hours ago, almost done the same thing.) and the bounty hunter was more than certain that given the chance, she would do the very same for the girl in her arm. Her daughter.</span></div></div>",

The bounty hunter sat up, rubbing her eyes.  She stopped however, for something was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virginia!!\" Samus shrieks.  She jumps out of the bed, running around her hideout, hastily looking for the little Metroid girl.  Shit, where could she have gone?  The bounty hunter had already almost lost her once, she couldn't bare the thought off..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounty hunter stops where she is.  And sighs in relief.  There in front of her was the little Metroid girl, safe and sound, nawing at piece of equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are young lady, you had me scared\" Samus remarks as she gently takes the delicate piece of machinery away from her Metroid daughter.  Virginia immediately tries to reach for the equipment her mother had taken from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, I was eating that\" Virigina cries<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the equipment up, Samus picks up the little Metroid girl.  \"That's not for eating I'm afraid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... sorry Mommy\" Virginia replies.  She is now picking at her teeth.  That was when Samus noticed her daughter had little fangs.  Kind of made since considering that her daughter's original form had used fangs for consuming energy.  \"My teeth aren't working right\" Virginia says.  Clearly the Metroid girl had lost her ability to consume energy - seemingly that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you something to eat sweety\" Samus says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirginia looks up at her mother, the bounty hunter.  \"Are you mad at me for running off Mommy?\" She asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle smile graced Samus's lips.  \"Mommy's not mad at you princess,  Just worried\" she places a soft kiss on her daughter's forehead.  \"I want you within my sight from now on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mommy\" the Metroid girl agreed, \"now can we eat\" she smiles wide to show off her little fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the living quarters, Samus readies the instant lunch for her daughter, he was already sitting at the table.  Luckily there was a booster seat included in some of the emergency stock for Virginia to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounty hunter finally sits at the table, about to eat her meal.  Her daughter on the other hand eyes the strange food in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food sweety\" Samus explains, \"you put it in your mouth like this\" Samus takes a bite out of the instantly made beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirginia, eager to imitate her mother, takes a bite of her own food.  And one bite swallowed was all it took for her face to light up.  \"My mouth felt funny Mommy... but also good\" she points at her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means its yummy and delicious\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Virginia takes another bite.  \"Yummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good meal, Samus helps her daughter out of the table seat.  The latter holds her mother's hand and follows her to a porch area, cleerly meant for a breathtaking view of the outisde environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirginia, wanting a good look, jumps up... but falls down on her knees.  Tears form from the Metroid girl's eyes, and her mother is quick to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hurt sweety?\" The concerned bounty hunter mom asks her Metroid daughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I fly Mommy?\" Virginia cries \"my body isn't floating like it should\".  Virginia then takes a good look at herself \"my body looks funny too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will get used to it Virginia.  But let me help you with that\" Samus says before lifting up her daughter.  She was carrying the human Metroid daughter in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Mommy look, I'm flying again!\" Virginia exclaims.  Her mother lets out a giggle, and bounces the Metroid tot in her arms.  \"More Mommy!  More!\" Virginia says, wanting her mommy to bounce her some more.  Samus of course bounces the little girl in her arms some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever they are soon interrupted by a noise.  A noise Samus recognizes but which Virginia is curious about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus answers...</span></div></div>",

grew to a gigantic size, but a young man named Adam also grew to a gigantic size as well in this updated remake of King Size Canary as there'll be plenty of surprises in store as there'll be plenty of sight gags visual gags classic cartoon humor slapstick comedy surprises and lots of 4th wall breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story started on a beautiful sunny summer day as yours truly Harold Cat a bright scholarly cat who happens to be nice charitable gifted athletic noble brave and heroic happened to be taking a stroll through our little neighborhood as Arthur a bulldog with a heart of gold and a big heart greeted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Harold how's it going?\" Arthur asked as he greeted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Arthur things are going quite well.\" I kindly answered Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great to hear uh listen I found this bottle of Jumbo Grow in my backyard and for the life of me I don't know where it came from.\" Arthur said as he showed me a bottle of Jumbo Grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Casey Canary arrived as he greeted us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys what's up?\" Casey Canary a wise canary and voice of reason asked as he kindly greeted us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Casey my fellow animal neighbor.\" I said as I kindly greeted Casey Canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little guy how's it going?\" Arthur asked Casey Canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing all right.\" Casey Canary kindly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment Mike Mouse the neighborhood animals own resident disc jockey and master of ceremonies showed up as he greeted us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\" Mike Mouse said as he greeted us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Mike.\" I said as I greeted Mike Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Mike.\" Arthur said as he greeted Arthur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mike\" Casey Canary said as he greeted Mike Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we were done greeting each other I addressed my fellow animal neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fellow animal neighbors as of sometime ago Arthur found a bottle of Jumbo Grow in his backyard and as for the life of him he doesn't even know how it ended up in his backyard ergo we're going to do a taste test and find out if this Jumbo Grow liquid should be consumed by animals as I'll go first then Arthur will go second Casey will go third and Mike Mouse will go last.\" I said as the taste test itself started as Arthur handed over the bottle of Jumbo Grow to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Arthur now then it's one small step for animals one giant leap for yours truly.\" I said as I took a few sips of Jumbo Grow which tasted like Snapple's lemon iced tea as I ballooned to a gigantic size as I was now a gigantic fat cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur my fellow neighbor it's your turn.\" I said as my voice now sounded deeper and baritone like as I handed over the bottle of Jumbo Grow to Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here goes nothing ergo bottoms up.\" Arthur said as he took a few sips as he too ballooned to a gigantic size as he was now a gigantic fat bulldog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right little guy you're up next.\" Arthur said as his voice also sounded deeper as well, as he handed the bottle of Jumbo Grow over to Casey Canary himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For duty and humanity!\" Casey boldly said as he took a few sips and ballooned to a gigantic size as Casey Canary was now a gigantic fat canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Mike it's showtime!\" Casey Canary proudly said as he handed over the bottle of Jumbo Grow to Mike Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll be good for a laugh or two.\" Mike Mouse said as he took a few sips and instantly ballooned to a gigantic size as Mike Mouse was now gigantic and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then since we're gigantic and fat I'll drop off this bottle of Jumbo Grow at a nearby house.\" I said as I stomped on over to a nearby house as I carefully and gently put the bottle of Jumbo Grow into a nearby house's living room as  the boys and I proudly stomped off into the distance as a little 1 year old boy named Adam was walking on his family's living room floor as he got his little hands on a bottle of Jumbo Grow and started drinking out of the Jumbo Grow bottle itself as he instantly grew to a gigantic size as he outgrew his family's home which was now reduced to rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment we noticed that house I was at earlier on was now reduced to rubble as the gigantic fat baby boy started to stomp over to where we were currently at as we now had company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fellow animals it seems we have company and he doesn't appear to be all that friendly it seems.\" I said as I addressed my fellow animal neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh it seems that cute little human boy must've gotten his hands on that bottle of Jumbo Grow.\" Arthur said as he was standing in front of a gigantic fat baby boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy this isn't good ergo we're in trouble now.\" Casey Canary said as he realized we were now in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll we do now oh fearless leader for this kid's the same size as we are?\" Mike asked me as he knew this wasn't going to end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fellow animal neighbors I've got it ergo we're going to do something right now.\" I said as I addressed my fellow animal neighbors as we were going to try to.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only trouble with that was it was the only life she'd known and as a result really didn't know what to do next or where to go. She had wandered aimlessly, for how long she really didn't know. Then she had stumbled upon Him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous creature was laying on his back looking at the clouds as they passed over. It was a bear. Felicia knew these creatures well. There was one in the circus. For Felicia it meant shelter from the cold nights, and food. In an instant she was leaping and landed somewhere on the creature's chest. The warmth all around here felt good. She sighed happily. But her moment of contentment would be short lived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Bear! Time to come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Little Bear. That was his name.' Felicia thought. Suddenly her world shifted as Little Bear stood up. She leaped again and landed on top  of the Bear's head. That's where she stayed, just by his left ear, until the Bear's movements woke her the next morning. You get an interesting view of the world from the top of someone's head. From there Felicia got a view of the inside of the Bear's dwelling as it moved passed. It was all very exciting for her. She hadn't seen anything like this living as a circus flea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear stopped before another Bear, this one he addressed as Mother Bear. After wishing her good morning Mother Bear raised a hand to rub the Top of Little bear's head. Felicia cowered into the fur as the ceiling of brown padded flesh fell over her for a brief moment; turning the world dark.When it lifted away, Little Bear was moving again. Where he was   going the Flea could only guess. </span></div></div>",

She prepped her hair, put on a nice long dress, and made sure she was drop dead gorgeous. This was fine. Everything would be great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as the elixir in her hand demonstrated, the paranoia was still real. A love potion would just... make things easier. Right? Definitely. No more complications added by doing this, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Cassie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked in surprise. She hadn't even realized the door had opened, much less revealing Jason of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helping my cousin get ready for her date. Hey, can I have that soda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cassie could even object, the blonde had grabbed the can of love potion and was heading up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait just a min-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hi Cassie! Wow, you look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere stood Robin, smiling nervously in his t-shirt. \"I, uh, feel a little underdressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie allowed a small grin to take over her features. Aw hell. Why was she so worried? He liked her fine. And there was no need to worry about the potion. Without a strand of hair as the final ingredient, Jason might as well be drinking fruit brunch.<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, now transformed into the stunning redhead Sonja, glared at her co-conspirator. Annie shrugged defensively, failing to hide her smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You told me you were going on a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonja stomped over to the table, decked out in a light blue dress and slammed down the drink. \"I wanted something simple. Sloppy even. I want to scare the guy off, not bring in more months of stupid phone calls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started rummaging through her closet, looking for something that showed off much less than this abomination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you hate wearing dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the point Annie.\" She tossed a shirt over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world works in mysterious ways. Perhaps it was just a coincidence that the same shirt Sonja had thrown was the shirt she had worn months back. To make a long story short, she had fallen from a portal onto her current date, Larry. Perhaps it was a coincidence that a single strand of hair had fallen from Larry's head onto the shirt. Perhaps it was coincidence that Jason's mother missed the shirt when gathering laundry. And perhaps it was coincidence that the shirt would be thrown over Sonja's soda can and that strand of Larry hair would fall into the elixir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether coincidence, fate, or something else, the potion glowed briefly as the hair vanished into the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you and Robin are in a wager or something right? This could help prove that you have total control over the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonja stopped her search with a sigh. Nothing here would work. She casually reached for the drink and took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA subtle change in mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right Anne. I can handle Larry no sweat.\" She flipped her hair back casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne grinned. \"Then get out there and show him your stuff, hot stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonja snorted before casually grabbing her magicked up purse and heading downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis night was going to go great.</span></div></div>",

It was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonja was first at the door when it rang again, ready to spoil Larry's dreams of romance. She swung it open wide, ready to unleash pure derision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead her mouth dropped open. She couldn't find a single complaint. Larry had worn a nice suit, combed his hair appropriately... he even brought flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a beauty!\" Larry joked warmly. \"Uh, these are for you. It's great to finally meet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recovered quickly, tossing the flowers over her shoulder.. \"Dead flowers? Save your money next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished she could take it back immediately. He looked devastated.

Surely he was getting frustrated by now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he took it all in stride, happy to help where he could. He was kind of a sweetheart, actually. Lending a hand, keeping cheerful. It was admirable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to drown out these thoughts. Before long, the movie was starting and the plot she'd been looking forward to kicked off. She tried to focus on the details, but every now and then her mind wandered. How was Larry doing? Was he enjoying himself? Did he still like her, after all that? Her eyes drifted to his hand on the seat rest. Maybe... it would be alright to indulge him. He did spend all that money on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly reached over and places her hand on his, trying not to look too obvious. From the corner of her eye, she could see Larry look in surprise... before smiling. It was a cute smile. So genuine and sincere, like everything about Larry. It'd be alright to give him this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie dragged on, they both got bolder. Larry laced their fingers together, a small touch of joy. Sonja lifted up the arm rest, on the pretense of putting the popcorn between them. Just to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eventually, during a tender moment between the characters, Larry removed his hand. Sonja felt a tinge of fear: did she do something wrong? But Larry just yawned and slowly put his arm around Sonja's shoulder. Oh god. A classic move. The cheesiest, most obvious of moves. If she hadn't tensed up at the increase of touching, she might've laughed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles relaxed. There was something comforting about being in Larry's arms. Like she was safe. Loved. She eased into the movie maneuver, leaning against him, and let herself enjoy the comfort of his body.</span></div></div>",

A little too normal for South Park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was the first to speak.  \"Hey Stan, can I ask you something.  In private\" Kyle had bumped his arm against Stan's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, are you two gonna make out or something?\" snickered Cartman.  But neither Kyle nor Stan had paid the fatass any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good distance away from Cartman and Kenny, Kyle says \"Dude do you feel weird about the new kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Canadian refugees?\"  Stan was confused, surely his best friend who had an adopted Canadian brother wouldn't have anything negative to say about the Canadian refugees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not the Canadians, I mean the Asian girls\" Kyle corrected Stan \"I don't know about you but everywhere I go I can't help but get the feeling they've been stalking me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan's eyes widened.  \"Dude, I've been getting that feeling too\".  Kyle's eyes widened too.  \"What exactly was it that they draw again?\" asks Stan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me dude.  I was just thinking they were trying to stare at my ass or something like Bebe\" replies Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas the bus arrived, and the two boys rejoined their other friends to enter the bus.  As Stan and Kyle took their seats, they both realized that the Asian girls were at the very back.  And they were all eyeing over the two of them, even though they had both taken separate seats this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan was just gathering some things from his locker when Wendy approached him from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I a joke to you\" said Wendy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan turned.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna know, is that all I am, a big joke?\" Wendy was very blunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan stood there stupidly confused for several seconds.  \"Ummm.  No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on queue, Wendy pulled out a picture, shoving it into Stan's face with the force of an elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to explain STANELY!\" Wendy looked pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea\" Stan said.  He didn't bother to look at the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me.  How long have you been going behind me back with him?\" Wendy accuses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know exactly what I am talking about\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you're talking about\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy came in closer, she was furious.  \"Playing dumb?  Well FUCK YOU!!!!\"  Wendy shoved a middle finger in Stan's face before storming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan looked at the picture- and what he saw horrified him.  In his hands was a picture, no a drawing of him and Kyle - kissing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/nxKmFhzaq2gnj17DA\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/nxKmFhzaq2gnj1...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?\" screamed Stan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Butters came up to Stan.  \"Stan, Stan!  Why didn't you tell me you and Kyle were gay now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!?\" shouted Stan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, all that art the Asian girls have been selling around town.  They've been drawing you and Kyle together\" Butters pulls out a picture in his hand.  Stan gagged in his mouth, for the picture was of him and Kyle in a sexually suggestive position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/299630181435520612/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/299630...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude what the fuck is this!\" shouted Stan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Stan, there ain't no shame in coming out\" Butters says stupidly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not gay.  Kyle and I aren't gay!  I have a girlfriend!\" Stan says.  Suddenly he remembered the confrontation from Wendy just before.  \"Ah crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan runs off from Butters.  As he runs he starts finding all sorts of gay art depicting him and Kyle together plastered all over the school walls and lockers.  Stan could not bear the horror he was witnessing, this was a living nightmare.  He kept running and running to -</span></div></div>",
