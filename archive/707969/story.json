Another exercise in futility, where your own ignorance is proven to you, showing you just how futile all of that revision had been last night.  Why do you even bother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin filing slowly into the examination hall with your fellow victims, noting the stern looks on the face of the invigilators scattered around by the few windows.  Despondently, you dump your bag along with the others in the untidy heap beside the entrance, remembering just in time to put your mobile 'phone inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around blearily, wondering where your designated seat is, while everyone else seems to know exactly where they are stationed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to wander, your thoughts drift.  It's a perfect summer day outside, and all of the other university students who've finished their exams will be enjoying it, basking in the sunlight and having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got another few hours before you can do the same, and even when you're done you won't be comforted.  Your girlfriend is visiting her parents at the moment, and you'll be all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, all alone in the summer sun is still preferable to this stinking exam hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, by luck rather than judgement, you find your place.  A weighty looking paper is waiting for you, and you take a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat just happened?  This isn't the exam hall.  There are all these incredibly high pillars, and the ground is rumbling in time with the sound of distant thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaitaminute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis IS the exam hall, only now it's a lot bigger.  Those rumblings are the footsteps of your fellow university students, and the pillars are the legs of the tables and chairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea how it happened, but somehow you've been shrunk, just like in one of those strange GTS stories that you've read on the web.  You're an inch high, and surrounded by people who are very stressed indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

The aisle is host to many giants walking back and forth, much larger and faster than you.  They could crush you at any moment were you to head out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut could they not also provide a ride?  If you jumped onto the foot of one of them, you could get to where you want to go a lot quicker and safer.  Unless something were to go wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could avoid the whole sticky situation by using the desks themselves as cover.  Fewer people are walking between the desks at ninety degrees to the aisle, so the main problem there would be the feet of those already seated, swinging about in a bored manner.  For example, the ones right behind you are the sandalled feet of some young woman, who is experimenting with sliding her feet in and out of her shoes.  It would be death for you if you got in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, if you could panic her somehow, by making her think that there's an animal of some sort crawling on the floor, you could cause a distraction that should enable you to get to your bag unmolested.  Risky, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're going to have to make a decision soon, one way or another. </span></div></div>",

It's just so... daunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, after this next giant passes, then you're DEFINITELY going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crunching footsteps pass by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing for it, then.  Away you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would normally stick your head down and pump your arms and legs for all they're worth, for a little extra speed.  Now, however, you really need to be able to see where you're going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foot landing just inches from your left throws you off balance, knocks you down.  You curl into a ball, arms protecting your head for all the good it will do, and mutter a hurried prayer to any god that may be listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck (or divine whimsy?) save you from a messy end this time, but now you'll have to be more careful, no more underestimating the speed of these behemoths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrage of feet is avoided with care and grace this time, but when you finally reach the safety point of the bag drop zone, you collapse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to your feet, you quickly locate your bag, its off blue form looming above you like a slightly ill hillock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA matter of a few moments to get in, get your 'phone and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps.  Instinctively, you run for the nearest cover, diving underneath a swaying bagstrap, swathing yourself in its shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bag is deposited.  It belongs to a girl, you guess, judging by the skirt that the owner is wearing.  Nothing to worry about, in moments she'll be gone and you can be on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, not so simple.  Moments pass and she's still there.  You watch her, seeing her rummage around inside her cavernous hold-all (which, at this scale, really could hold all to your eyes).  It finally clicks in your head what she's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than take her pens and other stationary out before entering the room to save time, she's looking for them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't mind so much, but she can clearly see your bag from her position, and might spot you if you moved to it.  On the other hand, if you wait for her to leave, there's a chance that some other person may drop their own bag on top of yours, and make your task all the harder.</span></div></div>",

It seems your nerve endings aren't accepting commands at the moment due to the immense sense of terror your brain had chosen to send them beforehand.  You instead opt to sit tight and hope your mystery classmate isn't too rough and tumble with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of padded phalanges close in around your sides; one tall and slender, the other thick and fat.  The feelers pinch tightly, squeezing your insignificant body painfully.  Your arms are pinned by their pits in a raised pose.  Kicking, yet not dare screaming, you are plucked from your vertical positioning and carried skyward.  You hover in a painful state before a vibrant nebula of verdigris.  Your arms are sore and stiff.  Your calves are burning from useless flailing.  You can feel bruises expanding on either of your sides, and your insides are searching for the nearest orifice from which to seep.  At this point, you really regret not evading these crushing fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face must have given an accurate depiction of your agony, for the pressure compressing you subsides slightly.  Make no mistake, your torment is still quite great, but it no longer feels life threatening.  As your view begins to zoom out from the ambiguously gorgeous iris, you take advantage of your newfound leeway and lower your arms.  Once you've traversed a fair distance, the features of a face start to become recognizable on the inconceivably (really, you tried!) large oval of tan in front of you.  A petite, bottled nose points directly at you.  Delicately cared for eyebrows climb up a small sloped forehead questioningly, while thick purplish-black lashes guide carefully-painted-pink eyelids to and from their merging points.  Below, red-doused soft lips move to create many indefinite expressions, altering ever so slightly the naturally carved formations hidden under blushed cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage the courage to speak first, \"Do you think you could help me?  Please?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountless unified charcoal filaments, originating from the top of your captor's head and flowing just past her dainty shoulders, jolt in your general direction as their base moves backward in shocked fashion.  Apparently you weren't expected to speak.  You seem to have driven the point that you are real home to this giantess, but that slick smile crossing her thin lips gives you little cause for celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'll help you\", your classmate whispers snidely, \"If\", you should have known there was going to be an if, \"you get me through this exam.  I have no clue what I'm doing, and I know you're here for the exam, too\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if she is only guessing since you happen to be in the exam hall before realizing that you actually have a name to tie to this monolithic figure.  Maggie.  You don't know her very well, but the two of you were in the same group for that ridiculous mid-term presentation Professor Bradford assigned.  Maggie seems to recognize you as well, and she must be pretty desperate to be turning to you for help in this class!  In any case, you don't really have much choice here, do you?</span></div></div>",

I kinda coasted through this class\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know more than I do\", Maggie quietly assures, \"Trust me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie effortlessly tosses her aircraft carrier-sized back pack atop the pile, sending a deafening thud through the air.  Motion sickness begins to overtake your stomach as Maggie journeys back to her seat with you still clenched between the triturating thumb and forefinger of her whimsically undulating left hand.  Luckily for you, she is sitting near the back, so the trip is quite short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are set inconsiderately onto a cold gray terrace stretching from the aisle to the brown carpeted wall.  Despite the carelessness of your landing, you are grateful to be rid of the clutching digits and their torturous ways.  Looking around, you see only one other student is assigned to this row, and he is stationed as far away as possible.  You turn your attention to the stack of stapled papers standing beside you, feeling no need to study the scantron sheet on your other side.  Stepping onto the exam sheet, the first thing you notice is that it is impossible for you to decipher the large, thick markings of your floor from so close.  You shout as much up to the megalithic girl as you struggle to take your eyes off of her ample bosoms concealed by bright yellow fabric.  Maggie doesn't seem capable of hearing you tiny voice from the new separation of elevation between the two of you, as is evidenced by the awkward look written into her face.  Your punishing chariot swoops down upon you once again, this time carrying you on an agonizing venture to her right ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't read the questions from so close\", you repeat yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Maggie's free hand moves behind the ear in which you face.  Prodigious fingers pull a locket of pitch black hair from a tucked stash behind its top.  The great appendages bring the dark strands to you, clearly insinuating for you to take hold.  You do so, and not a moment to soon!  Maggie's grip on you releases without warning, an action that would have surely plummeted you to your death had you not grabbed onto the provided strands.  You shrug off the shivers sent down your spine at such thoughts, and hang in rappelling fashion from Maggie's hair, your puny sneakers standing on the back end of her jaw bone.  She tilt you closer to the paper, and you start to examine the exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn't you have shrank after the exam?!  For the first time in your collegiate career, you actually had all the answers!  With brisk confidence, you explain to the dark cave-like ear about the specifics of vectors, advanced calculations of things like force and velocity, and even how wavelengths are generated.  You can't help but add the occasional criticism or comment regarding the wordings of certain questions and the additions of certain last minute material by the stingy professor to your lecturing.  Maggie doesn't seem to mind, sometimes even nodding in agreement (much to your dismay).  A particular crack about Dr. Bradford's questionable sexual orientation, made for no reason in particular, actually generates a quickly muzzled cackle from the enormous girl.  After a brief apology, she refocuses on her test, ignoring the cold stares from classmates and invigilators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie finishes bubbling in your last answer, and rises from her seat.  She doesn't think to place you in a safer place as she walks to the front of the lecture hall to turn in her exam.  You aren't about to complain as you sway with the gentle wind her motion makes, though.  Anything is better than those fingers again!  Nevertheless, this new experience isn't very pleasant either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie slams the bulky sheets of white wrapped around the marked paper triumphantly onto the desk in front of Dr. Bradford.  She returns to the back of the room, you swinging by several threads of black all the while.  You receive a small fright as she slips the wide straps of her back pack over her shoulders.  The flattening material lands several feet from you, the weight from the contents of the attached bag straining it, but you still consider that a tad too close for comfort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon find yourself outside in the open Summer air.  After moving along a little more, Maggie finds a place where she seems comfortable addressing you.  You are yet again squeezed by her massive thumb and index finger.  You let go of your black supports, and grind out the ride back to Maggie's face.  A face that looks...</span></div></div>",

You run your hand along the shallow fissure stretching across the bouncy whitish ground.  As the warm flab wets your palm a backlash of air strikes your back.  You're moving, and rather swiftly at that.  Thankfully your seated position spares you the embarrassment of falling over yourself in feeble efforts to maintain your balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ride comes to a stop, facing you with a familiar, yet amazingly different sight.  The beautifully green campus of your respective university takes on a whole new life through your tiny eyes!  The old cedar tree outside Birch Hall, a popular study site (or so you're told), climbs the cloudless soft blue sky with menacing claws of willow.  Lines of lilac bushes appear as bustling metropolises of bright pink with pedal laden apartments occupied by car-sized bees.  Below, countless spikes of dark green lay in wait with impaling desires.  And over there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\", your hands cover your ears as you shake violently at the earth shattering voice emanating from behind, \"Over here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to your feet and turn around.  Prissily overlapping lips meet your gaze.  Uniquely blue-green eyes sink to the bottom of their sockets for a better look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta speak up about things like that\", Maggie is obviously referencing your previous complaint, \"Unless you wanna go squish on accident\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the thought as Maggie's hot breath flows over you, stifling briefly your own oxygen supply.  The volume of her voice is lowered significantly, but it still serves as an unpleasant experience to be addressed so near her up-curled mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah\", Maggie continues, \"I can take you to McAllister.  You wanna go see some scientists, right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\", you shout back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they don't dissect you or something\", Maggie implants a horrible thought in your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon your lack of a response, Maggie chimes in cheerily, \"Kidding!  Man, some people can't take a joke\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour unamused stare gets a rise out of Maggie as she begins her transport of you to the campus science building.  The two of you chat a bit along the way, though nothing important comes up.  You eventually arrive at the famed McAllister Hall, a three story gray-bricked building housed by a triangular roof.  Maggie approaches the glass double doored entrance and reaches for the cylindrical silver handle.</span></div></div>",

Instinctively, you suppose, Maggie slips her right hand behind her back, giving you another unpleasant ride.  This time you do tumble onto your stomach while your flesh elevator sinks as well as maneuvers around Maggie's trim, yet majestic abdomen.  You feel her dewy palm drench your front side immediately upon your collision.  The nervous sweat has always been one of the many reasons you despise exams, but now it has moved to the top of the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that, since you're here, you might as well get up and have a look-see at Maggie's posterior.  Wrapped in tight cutoff jean shorts, each bun of the massive buttocks stands as a sideways domed coliseum of denim from your crack-aligned viewpoint.  Moving your eyes downward, past the jagged end to the cerulean material, you admire Maggie's golden tanned legs.  Man, those things just keep going!  A rush of dizziness rushes over you at the very late realization of just how high up you really are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain clarity in your head, and figure you've had enough of the appealing and mortifying view.  Instead, you choose to eavesdrop on the conversation taking place high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it!\", you recognize Maggie's irked tone, \"Wait a minute.  I know you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice for you\", a clearly foreign voice insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie ignores the rude comment, \"Yeah, you're that famous professor from Denmark who just moved here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", the clearly annoyed man answers, \"And you must be that idiotic student holding me up and wasting my time!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasting your time?!\", Maggie doesn't sound too pleased, \"Is this wasting your time?!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've caught on to how these things work, and you crouch in preparation of what's coming.  Sure enough, your transport flies upward with great velocity.  Able to keep your feet, you stand back up as you are proudly presented to the know-it-all snob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what is this?\", the Nordic-skinned man asks shockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the need to introduce yourself, \"Hello, Dr. Gadsby.  I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It talks?!\", the world famous professor cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the doctor's rough face, you are overcome with a new level in horror.  At least your female companion's stunning good looks provided a mild distraction from your predicament.  This hopefully knowledgeable stranger just looks as though he is going to crush you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he talks!\", you can't tell if Maggie is legitimately offended on your behalf or if she simply wants to stick it to the obnoxious man, \"Can you help him or not?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must give it to me\", Dr. Gadsby says with creepy excitement, \"The proper research must be conducted on it as soon as possible\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was his tone, or perhaps the fact that he can only call you it, but you don't feel very comfortable in the presence of the good doctor.  In fact, the only thought in your brain is a remembrance of Maggie's crack about you being dissected.  You glance up at your titanic benefactor's face, and see an alien expression showing.  Concern.  She must be thinking the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Gadsby seems to be loosing his patience, \"I don't have all day, child!  Hand it over now!\".</span></div></div>",

You don't have long to think on it though, as fingers close around you - far too quickly to guarantee comfort - and their owner takes off at speed, running away from Gadsby and the science building.  It is muffled by the pulsing mass around you, but you can still hear his screech:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back here!  It must be mine, foolish girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think people talked like that in real life.  Maybe it sounds better in Danish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure from the woman's hand is almost too much for you to take, and your body mercifully allows you to pass out before it gets too intense.  Your eyes open again, flickering, to Maggie's concerned visage in the sky.  \"Sorry... that  I didn't... speak up about that one...\" you manage, and the tears on her face are splashed aside as she gives a bark of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God,\" she says, \"I don't know what I would have done if...

I hope that you don't want to go back to the science building any time soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worry writ large (like, really, really large) on Maggie's face does not pass without effect on you.

No, Maggie didn't ask if you minded being handled in such a way.  And no, those pressuring fingers, while covered in warm, flexible armor, aren't exactly massaging your body.  You don't mind, though.  You know where Maggie's loyalty lies, and in a predicament where that's the only thing that really matters, she's the only person you can truly say such a thing about.  You'll endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, you are once again exposed to open air.  Your lungs greedily suck in unrecycled oxygen, a welcome change from your aphotic holding place.  Your eyes wander the area, providing your brain with the proper information to place your location.  You're indoors, obvious from the four walls of white concrete brick and the even whiter ceiling which they are supporting.  The floor consists of ever-cloning ceramic tiles.  There are two cheaply made dressers paired next to two formerly bunked beds in symmetrical fashion, the rooms lone window serving as the dividing line.  But it is those infamously shelf-less, uncovered closets that give you the answer you seek.  You must be in one of the on-campus dormitories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this...Carter Hall?\", you ask in semi-disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie seems slightly annoyed at your question, \"So what if it is?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are quick to explain yourself, \"Well, it's just sort of odd that a senior would still live in the dorms, you know?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only a third year\", Maggie corrects, \"And besides, I like living on-campus.  You don't have a problem with that, do you?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie's face deliberately moves closer, her nose hovering inches from you, almost daring you to register a complaint.  You refuse to oblige, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\", you play off the intimidation factor Maggie's pose presents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\", Maggie states definitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tilt of her hand, Maggie sends you tumbling from her palm.  You fall only a few feet before landing on a uniquely feeling surface.  The lavender ground directly beneath you is of a fluffy substance, yet there is a rock-hard stiffness lingering underneath.  The mammoth hill of matching purple to your back tells you that you are on a standard dorm bed.  As you figure this out, Maggie's unannounced arrival onto the sleeping apparatus throws your lightweight body from its position on the soft terrain.  You come down a fair distance closer to the pillow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie's extraordinarily large face stands directly in front of you, beaming, from a perched position on overlapping hands.  Black hairs scatter about on either side of her, creating still life streams of sable against the amethyst land.  In the distant overhead, you can see Maggie's calves carelessly kicking up and down, her sandal-clad feet catching against the rugged wall before her legs can straighten.  It is truly a breath taking sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\", Maggie seems a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you've been laying flat lined against the smooth landscape for several minutes now, limbs outstretched.  It may look as though you are in need of help, but nothing could be further from the truth.  For the first time since you shrank, you are truly in a state of complete and total comfort.  The intense soreness consuming your body melts away as your muscles finally allow themselves to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour response conveys your feelings well, \"Never been better\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\", as Maggie says this, you find it amazing how words can take on whole new meanings based solely on tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", Maggie brings about a subject change, \"what's the new game plan?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you forgot about something.</span></div></div>",

Safer? She's going to take that as a bullshit excuse to snuggle up, you surmise, waiting for her answer. The giantess returns with a coy smile, and her previous dam of separation deteriorates. Her head bobs in agreement, and strands of hair you never would have noticed at your regular size drift down rom her head. Regular hair loss, like any human being. Actually, you recall reading somewhere that the average human loses a hundred to two hundred strands of hairs a day, naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but have your thoughts drift back to Maggie again, but you do your best to push them aside as she shifts to a more comfortable position on the bed, inadverdantly revealing her bouncing cleavage from the movement. So absorbed were you that you didn't notice the aftershocks going through the bed until they toppled you over, sending you flat on your back. Your cheeks flashed red from embarassment, and you see your new friend trying to suppress a chuckle playing on her lips. After a few seconds of sifting through whwther or not you can laugh at yourself at this point, you oblige to your vocal chords. Maggie follows suite, and then pats a place on the pillow near her neck, showing you where to go. You emit one more yell of thanks and tramp through the bumpy bedspread toward the spot, then lay down to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look back at her with shock and disbelief: \"What kind of morning fun?\" you ask nobody in particular - as it is obvious she cannot even notice the fact you are speaking, let alone make out the words. Weighing your options you look at her in a different light: face of this gigantic monument of feminine beauty fills your entire view, like a hundred IMAX screens put together - and the rest of her body stretches back as far as you can see in the background. Escape is obviously impossible - it would have taken you ten minutes to traverse her night stand and what then? Her slightly mischievous smile makes you wonder what her real intentions of bringing you here were - maybe she simply wanted to have you all for herself? She always treated you rather roughly, was she actually enjoyed the power she had over you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the chain of thought, she adds \"Maybe we can figure something out\" and raises her free arm towards you. Left with no choice, you just wait as she lays her hand on the other side of the penny next to you - the resulting quake almost makes you fall back. You look around to see the side of the little finger towering above your tiny form, even while standing on the platform-like coin (which was big only to you, you realise). She looks a bit puzzled: \"Right... you're too small to climb up, lets try a nail...\", she mutters and rearranges her hand to allow you to climb the underneath of her nails. At least she did not try to pick you up, you notice with relief. Even though she put her fingers just next to the penny, considering your size, it was still a sizeable distance - including the walk across the coin, on which one could easily build a house.. complete with a large garden, if it was possible to grow anything on brass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk slowly, hoping that she notices how puny and fragile you are now. Just before boarding her nail you look back and think what can she possibly have in store for you. Maggie waits for you to settle on her nail, which basically consists of moving deeper and sitting down just where the skin was joining the underside - \"God how huge she is\", you take note of the fact again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then slowly brings you close to her eye - so now her iris is taking up almost entire horizon - and continues to study with her penetrating gaze. Hoping that even though she will not be able to hear you, but maybe at least she will notice that you want to speak to her, you put your hands to your mouth in a shouting kind-of position and move your mouth as wide open as you can. \"I can't hear you\", she whispers - obviously, as you were not trying to reach her with your minuscule voice. \"Wait\", she adds and rearranges herself so she can put you next to her ear. The sudden movement almost causes you to fall down from her nail, but fortunately she cups it upwards in a more secure position. You notice the world rotating and falling down, which suggests she is probably sitting up in her bed - but you cannot see anything below her finger and you dare not to peek out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this monumental movement is complete, Maggie uses her newly freed hand to push her hair aside and brings you to her ear. It was huge during the exam, but now... \"Good God, it is a true cavern now\", you think, unable to comprehend the immense scale of things. You have almost given up all hope - if she wants to use you, then she will and there is nothing you can even remotely do against it. Hell, she could kill you without even noticing it - actually, you may be alive only because she remembered about the previous day's adventures. Resigned you just shout: \"Please don't hurt me.\". She jolts immediately - which tells you she must have heard it - and after a while, speaks \"What do you.. mean? How... why would I want to... hurt you...\" and pauses - obviously confused and waiting for your answer. On one hand you are relieved that her intentions are not that bad, it seems, on the other you feel incredibly stupid after accusing Maggie of scary things - a simple plead you shouted must have been shocking to her, after all - she was only trying to help you so far and the fear was clearly a result of your delusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to calm her and explain, shouting \"I... I'm sorry, it's just that you are so big now.. and I was scared of what that.. morning fun was about...\", you babble unsure what to say really, hoping she will not want to investigate it any further. After that she moves you back in front of her face, only not too close - so you can see most of it - and with firm and serious stare at you, she says definitely \"I would never hurt you, &lt;your name here&gt;.\" followed by a long silence, contemplating you. Thoughts race through your head, most notably: \"What does she mean by that?\" - without an answer, \"Have I told her my name? Why would she remember my name?\" you think that you only remembered hers, because she was elected a leader for that mid-term project (as the only girl in the team, if you can recall correctly), while you couldn't possibly have done anything to bring enough attention, so again.. what did she mean?</span></div></div>",

You and Emma occasionally used to hook up with eachother until you both found yourself a significant other. She was a green eyed, dirty blonde haired beauty. Clothed in a navy blue zip up hoodie with sky blue accents on the midsection. She also wore black capris leggings and a pink scrunchie on her wrist. Along with the brown birkenstocks you were currently sprawled out on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Emma was taking her next step, which meant it was about to get alot steeper.

The shoes lie discraded underneath her chair, allowing her feet to breathe beneath the tights that she wears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is pretty bereft of furniture - or at least, of furniture at your height.  There may well be stuff on the desk, or mounted on shelves on the walls, but that is high up, way to high for you notice.  So, as far as you know, the only feature of the room besides the goddess' chair and desk is another chair, hugely tall on its four sturdy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do here?  Judging by the woman's relaxed posture, she's not expecting visitors any time soon, so you should be safe to approach her without risk of her being distracted.  The only question is which method of approach to use.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair in the centre of the room, unoccupied at the moment, could be a method of approach.  Climbing it would be easier than the giantess' own -hers is a swivel chair, with no easy access.  Sure, it's be quite a task to get all the way to the top, but it'll be worth it when the woman sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you could take advantage of the many cables trailing on the floor under the desk.

Maybe her guts are backed up somehow. You leap off the tortilla chip and begin to slog through the jumbled food and thick liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a place where it's just objects--a shaft leads down. There's no liquid here, so you dive down that dim shaft of undigested chicken and beef chunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca lets loose another small burp.

Suddenly the belly walls move around it, squeezing it, and the ball quivers, and all the mush around you shifts around, blocking off your escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then you realize...A wad of chewing gum has blocked her swollen stomach's exit...blocked the sphincter leading to fat Becca's intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take care of this,\" you say to yourself in your little chamber. You first loosen the gum's grip on her belly walls with your hands, and once it's free, you begin to punch and kick at the rubbery ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt begins to give. Little by little, your kicks accelerate its being shoved into Becky's small intestine, where it'll pass easily. More and more...Then, finally, --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's eyes shoot open. There is a loud, embarassing gurgling sound erupting from her belly that everyone sitting around her at the table can hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stare bemused at her for a second, while she just clutches her bloated belly, embarassed.

Full-body includes, of course, your privates...You shudder and shake helplessly at the miraculously smooth, slipperly, squeezing massage that is peristalsis as you let off a few orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' body shakes at these, but you can't really help it anyway.

Becky had ad this strange dream that she was eating more burritos, and that one suddenly got up on legs and jumped down her throat, sounding a loud *gulp*. She could feel him squirming around in her, and it was the most pleasurable thing ever she had ever felt. Kelly, her friend, came over and started massaging her belly (as well as her nether regions). It was euphoric, to be touched and massaged both inside and out, but she woke up just before the dream reached its climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously feeling rather unclean after waking up in a small puddle of her... well, anyway, Rebbecca felt a bath was in order. She had started running the water, but couldn't help rubbing her slight potbelly absentmindedly, wishing that the dream were real. Becky could have sworn she felt something move for a second, but she was still a bit numb and groggy, so ti was probably just her mind playing tricks on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting the water with her toe, she submerged herself, lying down with her eyes closed, half hoping to fall again into that dream. \"I love the weekends right after a exam,\" Becky thought out loud. \"Nothing to worry about, so I can just relax...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*inside Rebbecca*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleshy prison was moving again, and evening out. What luck! She was lying down again. The sound of moving water outside was even louder now, and it sounded like it was hitting her. Only one logical conclusion then, she's in water, mostly likely in a bath. You start to feel yourself get hard as you imagine the water lapping at her magnificent breasts and her well rounded features glistening in the water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*slap!* Now wasn't the time for those thoughts. You needed t get out of this girl's belly.

You will join their tomb soon enough, but my tummy shall become your grave and resting place for your soul!\" she giggled as she said this and the remains of her lunch were completely released and flushed shortly afterwards.<br>\r\n-You calm down with the sound of the flushing, and the thumping as her beautiful body heads back into the bath. Rebecca lays back down and says, \"Now that that's taken care of, how about we continue from where we left off, my belly lover?\" You gladly comply, at you punch and kick on the floor (which is a wall in your point of view) of her gut. You feel an arousing tingling sensation on your body. You realize: the acids got all over you on her bathroom break from the sliding when she got out to go! But it doesn't hurt at all, it actually feels quite good, you member shoots a few times under the tingling, but fortunately, she didn't feel it. You decide to role play with more feeling, as your punches and kicks begin to get stronger. You then let out a fake scream of pain (which was actually excitement), and Rebecca releases a belly laugh. \"And so it begins, my little morsel. But don't worry, it will be over soon. And we will be together forever! Mostly any way.\" she laughs through her nose, as you scream \"It burns! It burns! Don't kill me! Please! I'm sorry I denied you! Forgive me! I want to live and serve you!\" Rebecca continued her role as your goddess, saying in fake disgust \"How dare you deny the very one who brought you your life! And you said that you wished to serve me eternally! How can I be sure you will not deny me again and flee my presence for another? I cannot take that chance! I shall make you part of me, so I KNOW that you will never leave, faithless and foolish food! Now silence and embrace your fate as my snack!\"<br>\r\n-You fight for another half hour in her beautiful tummy before her pyloric sphincter opens up to take you in. Your struggles cease for the time being, only speaking, \"Oh no, not in there! Please I beg you! Free me from this torment!\" You suddenly hear your new girlfriend humming a soothing melody, before she speaks softly. \"Hush, my morsel. It's almost over, just sleep and enjoy my warmth. You will soon be mine alone, forever. That's how things should be for us.\" she said it with a smile, and you realize the truth in the last two sentences. You have made a relationship with this beautiful young woman. You admit to yourself that you have had a crush on her for a while. While you admit it, the sphincter engulfs your feet, and your game mode turns back on. You start to thrash violently from side to side, trying to make it feel like you wanted to get out. You scream at the top of your lungs as part of the game. \"Please, my goddess! Don't do this to me! Don't kill me! I want to live for you alone and praise your mercy! I vow these words, and I beg you to show your love for your worshippers!\" You hear a giggle and gentle speaking from your girlfriend. \"You will live on little one. As part of my body and spirit, you will become my soul mate, and nothing bad will happen to you. I will make sure of it. Now relax and feel my tummy's embrace and warmth take you into paradise eternal.\" you then hear Rebecca humming a beautiful melody, almost like a lullaby, and she starts to rock her tummy back and forth like a fleshy cradle for your game. The music and motions cause you to feel extremely tired. You close your eyes and the pyloric sphincter takes your head into her intestines.<br>\r\n-Rebecca feels your body slowly but surely slithering through her gut, arousing her greatly. Her right hand continues to massage her belly while her left reaches for her womanhood, rubbing and prodding it gently. These rhythmic sensations caused her to moan in ecstasy, while giving a warm feeling to you as you are pushed further through her gut. Surprisingly, you do not suffocate in your new girlfriend's tummy, as if it knows it's you in there and is keeping you alive. You awake as the villi brush against your face, halfway through the ileum. The feeling of a villic massage is arousing, as they are also rubbing your member with a warm, wet, squishy and tingling feeling, causing you to climax on multiple occasions (even more of them came when you were asleep in her duodenum and early ileum). The only problem in there is it's a little tight and slightly uncomfortable, so you try to find a better position, squirming in the process. Rebecca recognizes these movements, and speaks in her role playing again. \"I'm surprised you're still alive, my little snack! Don't worry, we'll be together forever soon enough. Just relax and let my belly have it's way with you.\" You hear her giggle again, so you 'panic,' squirming more violently, screaming, \"how long have I been in here? Please let me out! I want to live free and praise you for my remaining life, not die in your stomach like common food!\"<br>\r\n-The villi continue to rub against your body, arousing you and eventually, relaxing you. You then say your 'acceptance of your fate,' saying \"Maybe this is what I was meant to do all along, to feed myself to the one I worshipped. If only I could know that it would feel like this in the end, I would have accepted this sooner. My goddess! Take me in! Make me your meal and a part of you forever!\"<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you are no longer in the ileum, but the jejunum; the last part of the small intestine before the colon. Rebecca realized the remnants of her last meal were still lining her colon, and proceeded to wash it out thoroughly. She took a massager from the shower, placed it in her anus, and turned it on. Water surged into her colon, cleaning and removing the remaining matter inside her. She headed for the toilet again, and pushed out the last bits of yesterday's lunch once and for all. Her colon was clean as a whistle now, and the immersed herself in the still warm water, massaging her belly again, the slithering feeling almost at the passage to her large intestine. You feel a surge of fluid around your head, and the valve to your girlfriend's colon blasts open to take you in. The final part of your journey through the belly of your love has begun.<br>\r\n-You gain the energy to stand up, as you feel an arid environment in your girlfriend, you are in her colon now. You expect a horrendous stench inside her, but you smell something...sweet! You try to walk, but trip on the tubes, and are being pushed forward by peristaltic movement. You gain your footing again, and journey onward to the transverse colon, the air getting drier and drier with every step. You finally reach your goal, seeing the tube rising. You begin climbing up the tube, and your girlfriend-still feeling you moving, pats her belly, letting out a little burp, and an innocent giggle. \"Almost time to come out now, belly boyfriend!\" You reach the top of the \"hill,\" and slide down, reaching the descending colon. You walk further down the tube, and make a right turn for the sigmoid.<br>\r\n-You finally reach it, when your body is squeezed by the walls and pushed further in. \"This is it!\" You think to yourself. Your body reaches the rectum, and Rebecca gives a gentle push in the bath, to get you out slowly, but enjoyably. You feel yourself moving forward, until you stop at the anal sphincter. The anus opens up slowly and your legs come out, then your hips, torso, and finally, your head. Rebecca grabs you, wipes you off, and speaks. \"How was it my tummy buddy?\" You cannot lie, saying, \"it gelt spectacular! I would like to do it again soon! Just not now.\" she opens her hand and raises it to her mouth. You give her a big kiss for the fun, and she hugs you in between her bosom. A new day begins, with an incredible journey, and a beautiful lover. Your relationship, and your happiness, open up like a pi\u00f1ata, and your new life awaits you.</span></div></div>",

She swills you around for a while, incapable of resisting your taste, and then opens up her mouth with her hand waiting at her lips.

The idea of going straight to fooling around with this massive girl was driving you wild, but you guess it could still be fun to keep playing with her before jumping straight into bed. Besides taking things slowly definitely made sense considering your diminutive size. You didn't want to get accidentally squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" You say back to her, trying to mask the disappointment in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww did I get your hopes up there?\" She says apologetically. You mustn't have done a very good job pretending not to be let down by her sudden change of heart. \"I'm sorry, cutie. I'll make it up to you later. You can still ride around between these though.\" She adds as she brings up her hands and gives her huge breasts a few gentle squeezes, causing you to almost lose your balance. When you do manage to stabilize yourself from her sudden movements she notices your visible approval of that idea, causing her to giggle loudly and you to quickly cover yourself as you just remember that you were completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Covering up? I thought you were my little boyfriend?\" Becca teases you as she makes a pouty face. \"If you're so scared to be naked around me then maybe I was right to hold off on the sexy stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh to yourself. Giving in to her teasing you move your hands and let her examine your boner.

Do you mind if I have something to eat before we continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, go ahead.\" You tell her. Now that she mentioned it you realize that you're absolutely starving. You haven't eaten since before the exam and that was yesterday morning. \"Hey, uh, Becky?\" You begin to ask. \"I've been this small for almost 24 hours now and I just realized that I haven't eaten once since I was shrank. Would you be okay sharing some of your breakfast with me? Don't worry, I won't take much. At this size I could probably make a thimble full of food last a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, cutie.\" She says with a reassuring smile. \"You didn't think I was going to let my little boyfriend starve did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a half-hearted laugh. You weren't the type of guy to judge people, but looking at her up and down she seemed like the type of person who wasn't a big fan of the whole 'sharing food' concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing else then? Great! Let's go already.\" She says with clear impatience in her voice. She put you to one side before quickly slipping into a t-shirt and pants. Once she was clothed in her casual weekend-wear she scooped you back up and hurried downstairs to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen Becky wasted no time getting started. At breakneck speeds to someone of your size she had prepared and began cooking a generous amount of bacon and eggs. You wanted to remind her that she didn't need to treat you like a full-size person when it came to portions, but something told you this was what she considered a meal for one. Being perched on her shoulder and watching it slowly cook after not eating in over a day was torture, but at least you would be able to dig in to your heart's content once it finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the longest 10 minutes of your life Rebecca transferred the large meal to a plate and carried it over to the table. Like with the cooking she was in no mood to take her time and quickly began to demolish everything in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky?\" You speak up. She must have completely forgotten you were even there. You take a panicked look at what was supposed to be breakfast for the two of you and noticed she had already devoured a good chunk of it. \"Becky!\" You raise you voice this time.

Sorry about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I'll help you down.\" She says as she lifts you up off her shoulder and lowers you down to her plate. You assume that she's going to place you down beside the plate where you can reach over and take what you want, but you are completely taken by surprise when she suddenly drops you square in the middle of the plate right on top of a pile of eggs. The hot food stings slightly as it makes contact with your naked body, but you soon get used to it as you pull yourself up to your feet and brush the excess chunks of it out of your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Rebecca grinning at you mischievously. \"Go on and help yourself, little guy. There's more than enough here for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need to be told twice.

Helping yourself to handfuls of eggs and bacon and yet still not even putting a dent in the total amount of food accumulated on the plate.

Becky went back to eating as well and you could often see huge piles of your surroundings being scooped up to disappear down her throat as you ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rebecca doing the brunt of the damage the two of you made pretty quick work out of the large meal.

Maybe this level of trust was a sign that true love was blooming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise instead of opening up to allow you access to the inside of Becky's mouth, her lips pucker up at your approach and she gently presses your tiny body against them to embrace you in a soft kiss. You feel at ease in her tender grasp like this and despite being way too small for her to feel anything, you reciprocate her gesture by pressing your own lips against the damp fleshy wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning her mouth opens slightly and her massive tongue slides out to hit you square in the chest. As it makes its way out of Rebecca's mouth you feel it gradually covering your entire body and replacing the greasy egg and bacon residue with her saliva. What happens next takes you by even greater surprise: the huge writhing organ slides down your midsection and since you were currently completely naked you can feel it rubbing against your exposed nethers, causing you to loudly moan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Becky watch where you're...\" You try to speak between intense gasps, but you fail to inform the huge girl that she was unknowingly getting you off as she cleaned off the mess from breakfast. \"Becky... I'm going to... Hng!\" You couldn't hold it in any longer. A mix of shame and pleasure washes over you as you shoot your load all over the cute blonde's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly Rebecca feels something that wasn't there a few seconds ago.

I'll have breakfast in your stomach...\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca jumped a little, excited that she would get to swallow you again. \"Yay! Having my boyfriend with breakfast will feel amazing!\" With that, Becky gently picked you up and placed you gently on her tongue. The tongue swished around in Rebecca's mouth, both drenching you in saliva as well as probing everywhere on your body. While it did feel arousing, your hunger pains wanted Rebecca to get it done quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Becky? Could you skip the mouthplay and just swallow me? I'm still hungry here...\" You called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca giggled slightly. \"Sorry, I'll get right to it.\" You felt her tilt her head back, and once again, you found yourself going down the slimy tunnel that was Becky's throat, and you wiggled slightly, because it felt better that way. Now that you were going down for the second time while she was aware of you, it wasn't so intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as quickly as you were swallowed, you fall into a huge mass of partly digested eggs and bacon. Becky's stomach was almost full, but nowhere near as full as it was when she first ate you by accident. You scooped up a mass of the eggs and you put it in your mouth. It wasn't as gross as you thought it was, but Rebecca's saliva and digestive juices did a number on the taste. You found some bacon bits that were still relatively solid. It was surprisingly tasty! It proves, once and for all, that even in someone else's belly, bacon is delicious. \"How's the food in there?\" You hear Becky call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than I thought it would be!\" You reply. \"And I won't starve any time soon! I've got enough food to last me weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky giggled at your joke. \"Don't be greedy! All that food is mine! It'll all be digested in a few hours, anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but laugh. \"You're one to talk about being greedy. You forgot all about me when you were eating all this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca made some flustered noises outside. \"W-Well, what if I ate all the food on purpose?\" She said defensively. \"What if I did all that just so I could get you in my tummy once again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Becky was teasing you at this point. \"Aw, man! You tricked me!\" You said, a bit dramatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky giggled again. \"That's right, I did! Since you were so rude, I should just leave you in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but chuckle. \"I don't think I would mind that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?

Just that thought gets you completely aroused, and you are suddenly tempted to crawl down, fascinated by the yet-unexplored deeper regions of her gut\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the well-developed female stomach you\u2019re in begins to quiver and groan. With a new wash of fluid, the rippling pink muscles begin to pull you downward, towards he puckered sphincter that leads\u2014you know\u2014to her intestines, no doubt packed full of loads and loads of digested beans &amp; beef by now\u2026Her sphincter squirms open for just a moment and you get a glimpse of how densely stuffed this girl\u2019s bowels actually are\u2026not to mention the smell. There\u2019s no room for you to explore down there, you\u2019ll just suffocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the sounds and movement increase, your mind moves to more practical matters. You\u2019re incredibly lucky to have survived this far, and still aren\u2019t sure what saved your from the pot-bellied girl\u2019s stomach acids\u2014the dilution caused by her massive meal, or some unknown property of being shrunk\u2026In any case, you begin to feel a sharp pain on your skin, and in a panic, your erotic thoughts dissolve.

After ten or so seconds of increasingly frantic pummeling, and much protestant wailing and moaning from the girl\u2019s body, the stomach squeezes hard in the other direction. You slip greasily up her slick esophagus, back into her mouth (with a splash of stomach juices) . . . accompanied by a wet spray and an echoing, guttural BUURP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHuge teeth and that monstrous tongue now surround you. You move quickly to the pocket of flesh by her back teeth and cheek. That was a wise decision\u2014unconsciously, her toungue sweeps around inside her teeth and washes back down all the excess fluids in her mouth. Whew! You now feel able to imagine how people swallow spiders in their sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs gently as you can, you climb out by the crook of the girl\u2019s cheek and, after a bit of frantic scrabbling, come to rest on the skin of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt is quiet now. All you can hear are the sounds of the girl\u2019s breathing, a constant, deep, rasping sound. At your tiny size, you look up at her sleeping face and are shocked by how different the girl\u2019s skin looks up close. From afar, her face was pretty and dainty-looking. But here, every hair, mole, and sweaty wrinkle is clearly apparent.<br>\r\nShe\u2019s no longer just pretty\u2026up close, this girl's huge, powerful body is pungently fragrant and overpoweringly erotic. You resist the urge to grind yourself against the girl\u2019s skin right there, because\u2026her bedclothes have fallen off and it\u2019s blindingly, beautifully clear that she sleeps in the /nude/.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You make a beeline for the valley between her mountainous round breasts which jiggle gently with each breath\u2014each breast, you compare, looking backward, is bigger than her head! Each of her large, if distant, nipples sits grandly atop a mound of pink areola that graces each peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You stop a few steps past her collarbone as some kind of dark movement from above catches your eye. But then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMmmf\u2026\u201d the girl mumbles in her sleep, and shifts her body around, still lying on her back. Your entie world shakes, and you throw yourself against her body, clinging to her few blonde chest hairs, forgetting the descending thing above you until it\u2019s safe to stand back up again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, you begin your walk over to there side of the table and you can't help to think that since this is collage you find it rather strange that there are girls who are still in the goth phase. It's not like your against people choosing to be goth. But you just haven't seen people act goth since high school. But then you assume that they all must be freshmen. Or maybe that the goth phase is not just a high school thing and you just haven't noticed. And with that you continue walking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, you get a look around at all the gigantic students waking and conversating. And you start to think about how you wish that you could be doing the same right now. But trying to stay positive you let that thought go and focus back onto your goal at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you have reached a medium distance from the goth girls and they of course don't even notice you. Looking at them you notice that there is three of them. the closet one to you is wearing a yellow tank-top, ripped black jeans, and has short pink and yellow dyed hair. The next closet goth girl to you has long black hair, sleeve's black and white blouse, ripped black jeans, and a tattoo on her bicep. And then the last girl is wearing a white shirt with the sleeves clearly cut off, ripped black jeans, and has short blue dyed hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to try to sneak up on them to see if you can get all of their attention, but you find that this is a task that is made difficult by your miniscule size. So, you then decide to try and focus in on getting one of the goth girls attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(But the question is which one do you try to get help from?)</span></div></div>",

So, with that decision you begin making your way over to her. And as you approach her you think that maybe since she is a goth she will see you as some sort of devil conjured up by something... and then hopefully see you as something that's not here to hurt her or any of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way over to the girl with the black shirt and ripped jeans. You are now right next to her gigantic arm. And being so close you can smell her musk that smells as if she hasn't showered in a couple of days. You notice that she has black hairs going from her wrist to the end her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look up at the giantess goth you of course notice right away that she doesn't seem to notice you at all. You hear her as she speaks to the other goth girl's saying things like \"Hey Camila, you won't believe....\" and \"...What's you doing tonight?...\". Which just leads to all three of them continuing to conversate. And through there conversation you actually learn the name of the black haired goth girl that is front of you, her name is Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit that you are a bit intimated by her Gigantic size... which is not welcoming to you in any way. But of course thoughts like that aren't going to stop you from trying to get this gigantic goth's attention. So, you think through your options with your first thought being a way to cause her pain so she would look at you. But then you think that you don't really have anything that can hurt a person of her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you try and think of something else. Maybe you could try to climb up to Sam's ear. That would cause her head to turn and look at you. Then she would for certain notice you. It's certainly dangerous and a long shot, but it's your only option at this point. You resolve not to fail in getting her to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to climb up her arm until and you manage to somehow end up right under her armpit. The smell itself is just awful you think as you then slowly progress upwards toward Sam's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you draw close to her shoulder, you hear the blue haired girl that you learned is named Camila, say that she thinks the cafeteria food is crap and she is going off to get a corn dog from Wendy's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with Camila gone, it seems to allow Sam to feel you climbing on her shoulder. You haven't even gotten a chance to say anything yet as you see Sam's face looking directly at you. You freeze as you realize that she has seen you.... and her first reaction that you see is...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What is her reaction like?)</span></div></div>",

Here let me get it?\" the girl with pink and yellow hair says to Sam as she reaches her hand out to pluck you off her Sam's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour not given enough time to make any kinds of movement as your only movement ends up being turning around to see the goth girl's gigantic finger and thumb come at you to pluck you up into her grasp. This feeling is quite weird you think as you are now right by her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! This bug is so small!... And you know what, it kind of looks like a man.\". You hear the gigantic goth say this as you are brought closer to her gigantic face. The whole time, you are just struggling your tiny body between her thumb and fore-finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your position, you see that her eyes are so blue! They are just like the blue in the sky. Then as she starts to move her head toward you so that she can get a better look at you, you see that her nose is a bit pointed out. And while the pink and yellow hair girl was observing you hear Sam say \"What do you mean?,,,, It's a bug Lauren, just flick it away... or crush it.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a bit scared when you heard the goth girl Sam say that. And this causes you to try to struggle some more so that maybe the girl can see that you really are a man and not some bug. This is all you can do as the goth girl who you now know is named Lauren, holds you up to her and hesitates for a good minute as she holds you between her two fingers with out saying anything back to Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you finally hear Lauren say \"...\"</font></span></div></div>",

There's no way that you're holding some tiny little man between your fingers.. Come on Lauren, just throw it away already...\" Sam says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lauren is a bit more persistent as she says \"I mean yea he's the tiniest little thing... But really though..... Dude just look right here at him. I'm really sure it's a man... Please just look.\" Lauren pleads this to Sam with a puppy dog look. Which you watch then watch from between Lauren's thumb and fore-finger as Sam rolls her eye's and then starts to bring her gigantic face closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam just honestly wants to get whatever prank that Lauren is trying to pull here over with. As she bends over and looks closely at you in Lauren's grasp. She expected Lauren to just push the bug into her face but instead she is surprised as she backs her face up away from you. \"Y...You see...?\" Lauren starts to say in excitement as she realizes that Sam noticed that you look like a tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! It really is an inch tall man...\" Sam says this and then take another closer look at you, then she repeats her process again by backing away from you and saying \"What the hell??...\" that is all you hear before Lauren in her excitement traps you in her fist as she says \"I know it's crazy... I wonder if he can talk.\". Sam notices that Lauren enclose you in her fist and says with a smirk \"...Yea I wonder if he can breath...\". Which this comment made Lauren re-open up her hand and then finally speak to you by saying \"Opps... Sorry little man...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while that happened an alarm went off on Sam's phone that indicated it was time for her next class. And she grabbed her stuff she told Lauren to stash you away some place. So, they can deal with this after class. Which Lauren nods excitedly as you are swung around in the air and placed into Lauren's jean pocket. \"So you won't get lost in there...\". She giggles as she shuts you inside the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then spend the next couple of hours inside of Laurens pocket as she goes through her class. Which is pretty unusual experience at the moment. Like whenever she moves in her chair, you move in the pocket and when she leans forward, you do the same. It is really annoying, but you just try to deal with it. Hoping that the two goths will help you after all this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class finally comes to an end and after about a 10 to 15 minute walk, you are finally taken out of Laurens pocket and are now being held in the palm of her hand as she walks. You take a quick look around at your surroundings and you see that your in one of the parking garages at the school. You also notice that Sam is walking right next to Lauren.  You were waiting for one of them to say something to you. But instead the whole time you were waiting, they were talking quietly to each other. In till they got to a blue PT cruiser. Which Lauren is the first to get inside of as she enters the drivers side and you see Sam getting into the passenger seat. Then Lauren is the first to talk to you. \"Oh my gosh!... Isn't he kind of cute the way he looks up at me Sam?\" Which that comment made Sam roll her eyes as Lauren looks at you and says \"So, can you speak little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, some progress being made, you take your first words to say \"Y...Yes...\" kind of embarrassed to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which Lauren starts to excited as she replies \"I knew it! I knew you weren't a bug!\". To which Sam replies in a annoyed tone \"Okay, I guess he is real. Here hand him over..\". And with that comment, you are once again are in darkness inside of Laurens large palm as she closes hand around you to form a fist and then pulls her hands as far away from Sam as possible to say \"No way, I found him. I want to hold him.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn which Sam says again in a annoyed tone \"Listen you can hold him all you want later. But you're about to drive remember.\". In which Lauren does open her hand up while she says \"Oh Yea!\" To which you are dropped from Lauren's hand into Sam's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are now looking down at you. And you can't help to notice that Lauren had a very sweet smell to her and now that you're in Sam's palm you can smell her stinky musk. As you stand on Sam's palm you hear \"Well let's get going then...\", Lauren sounds out as she starts the car and pulls it out of the parking spot.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens during the car ride?)</span></div></div>",

Your current position wasn't that uncomfortable for you, in fact other then Sam having a sweaty palm, she did have very soft skin to lay on. But it would have been kind if Sam to at least let you be a part of there conversation instead of just having to sit and wait in the darkness of her gigantic fist. But atlas that is the place that you stayed for the whole car ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ride goes on, you have a hard time listening to anything of what the two of them are talking about so, you just tune them out as you look at Sam's gigantic fingers that are in front of you and encase you in her palm. Her fingers alone are so much bigger and stronger then you at your current tiny form. You can't help to think about how if this girl wanted to, she could easily just her fist a tight squeeze and your life would be over with. But you know that she wouldn't do that or more like you hope she wouldn't do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the car ride finally comes to an end. Which this becomes clear to you as you hear the sound of the car engine turn off and then you can feel Sam's movement from inside her gigantic palm as she begins to exit the vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer movement actually gives you an opportunity to see where you are at.

This is followed by a woman's voice saying \"Who is it?...\". In which you then hear Sam's voice yell \"Mom its just me and Lauren. Were going upstairs to my room... Okay!\". Hearing this you can confirm that this must be Sam's house that these two are at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the confirmation from Sam's mother, Sam and Lauren whip there shoe's off at the door and head up a flight of stairs. They both then went down a hallway and into Sam's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in the darkness of Sam's palm thinking about what you should do. The truth is you are a little scared of what these two might plan on doing to you. But you try to keep hope that they will just help you in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of Sam's movement has finally stopped and this is followed by you seeing light. And then you hear Laurens excited voice saying things like \"Come on already.... I want to see the little guy already.... Come on...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis leads you then being quickly dumped on top of a wooden table that is sitting in the middle of Sam's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room and can see the beige walls are covered with posters of various metal bands. You can also see scattered clothing across her flooring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you are taking in your surroundings you see a gigantic hand pop up in front of you and then it swiftly picks you up. From the scent alone you know it's Lauren who just picked you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then blurts out \"HEY WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?\" as she watches Lauren hop backwards into a sitting position and lands on Sam's computer chair. Lauren then begins to spin around in her chair looking at you in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren ignores Sam as she says \"Wow you know what?, I didn't really notice before, that you maybe tiny but you also look built and have a good looking face...\". Lauren was about to say something else but she is cut off as Sam stops her spinning and snatches you from Laurens palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself instantly being sucked into the palm of Sam's hand. You then feel the motion of Sam swing her hand over the table as she dumps you onto the table. You lay there for a moment as you hear the voices of the two in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Lauren, come on we don't even know anything about him... And what was that comment about him looking good, he looks like an ant.\". Sam says this while looking at Lauren while she gives a playful tongue stick out face at her before responding with \"Just look at him closer, you can see for yourself.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then watch as Sam turns to look at you and without saying anything to you she held you in place on the table with her single finger while bringing her gigantic face very close to you. And in a matter of seconds she releases her finger off of you and her gigantic face becomes a bit surprised as she quickly backs away and looks at Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes Lauren give Sam a smirk as she waits for what she will say next. In which Sam just says \"Okay I guess for a little guy, he has the right looks...\". She giggles while laughing off that clear compliant that she just gave you behind your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take this moment to stand up as you look directly at the two of them as they just ignore you for the moment and talk to one another. You think about how there is still no mention of help. So, you decide to take initiative by saying out loud while looking at the two goth girls \"Ummm... hey ummm.... thanks for the complaint.... But... can we get to my size situation here... I mean I was kind of hoping that maybe somebody here could help me...\". But after saying this it seems that either they didn't hear you or you are being ignored. And this realization comes to you as you stare at the two gigantic girls as they chat amongst them selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then think about taking a seat and waiting for them to finish. But then your finally given a conversation as Sam turns to you and smiles at you as she says \"So, little guy we didn't catch how you become so tiny?...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this your excited to get on track here with saying \"Well It just sort of happened when I just sat down to take an exam.... I really don't have any idea what caused it or what can reverse it. So, I guess it's good that I can get help from...\". You are cut off by Laurens strange excited squeal as she says sort of calmly \"...So, what your saying is your basically stuck tiny and in need of being with us...\". In which after you hear this you don't really understand what she means by that but you try to answer the best you can by saying \"I mean I am in need of your help...\". You are again cut off by Lauren and Sam once again ignoring you as they go back to there giggling and conversating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for a moment and listening to the two them whisper to one another while giggling. You and the other two suddenly hear a knocking sound on Sam's door. This causes Sam to spring into action as she picks you up and holds you in her gigantic palm behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sound of Sam's bedroom door open followed by the familiar sound of Sam's mother voice saying \"Hey you two, sorry to ruin the fun but Lauren your mother called and asked if you could please head home.\". This is followed by Lauren saying \"Okay... just need to finish an assignment and I will head off.\". This response makes Sam's mother leave as you are once again placed onto the wooden table and stared down at by the two giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren is the first to talk as she says \"Well I guess me and the little guy should get going... We can continue are talks later...\". Hearing this Sam responds with saying \"Wait a second! It's probably better if he stays here...\". In which Lauren gives a smirk while saying \"Oh come on I found him so, it's only right if I take responsibility... \". Sam then argues back with \"Yeah but you found him on me... So, I don't mind him staying here.\". Lauren retorts with saying \"Oh come on you said you didn't even want him when we were in the cafeteria.\". This leads to both going back forth with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd listening to this you feel like you the last of slice of pizza that they are fighting over. I mean your a human being, shouldn't you get to decide who you with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Do they let you decide? Or do they play rock, paper scissor's to see who wins you for the night?)</span></div></div>",

Again, you hadn't really considered it, but since Lauren is so petite (normally, anyway - right now she's a gargantuan!) Sam's hand seems so much expansive to a person of your limited scale.  The fingers are especially impressive, massive extensions of her self that alone vastly engulf you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are snapped out of your reverie by Sam's words, and look directly up into her looming face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it hadn't been for Lauren, I'd just have crushed you like a bug.  I'm so unobservant, sometimes!  But you have to admit, it's not every day you get an inch-tall man crawling around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see where this gentle probing is leading.  \"I don't know how it happened,\" you admit.  \"One minute I'm sitting down to an exam, the next I'm this big.  I managed to hitch a ride out of that room to the cafeteria, and you know the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shrugs.  \"Simple enough.  Makes it a bit difficult to find out who or what did this to you, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to break it up guys,\" Lauren interjects, \"but I want to check I'm not crazy.  Do you reckon that black SUV is following us, Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour host cranes her neck around to look over her shoulder as the drive continues, nodding when she brings it back.  \"No doubt about it.  Now there's no other traffic, it's definitely weird that they'd follow us down this street.  This is all scenic route.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who could they be?\" Lauren wondered, seconds before the world changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you, tiny in the palm of a goth girl's hand and with consequently limited view, you don't notice much.  Your companions within the car certainly react with more shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" Sam shrieks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I don't know.  What happened to the road?  It's like we're driving over gravel here, and what are those skyscrapers doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what happened,\" you say, but the girls can't hear you over their panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that the car pursuing must be responsible for your shrinking, and they're tracking you somehow.  They've shrunk the car you're in, reducing the girls to an inch tall and making the normally smooth road a fractured desert.  Poor you, you've shrunk proportionately, and don't want to even think about how horrificly big everything outside is to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does your team do now?</span></div></div>",

Which to you is obviously the black SUV's tire that has now been parked right behind the tiny car you all are currently inside of. And as the girls continue there little panic situation you think about how you don't like anything about this situation. And you feel as though you have to do something, and your only really given one option. As you are currently being clenched tightly in Sam's grasp as she freaks out about what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drive!\" you yell, loud enough for them to hear. \"We got to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich this actually makes Lauren react as she pushes hard down on the gas pedal and begins maneuvering around grains of dirt and specks of gravel. You have no idea what is really happening as Sam and Lauren freak out and you are just given the view of Sam's gigantic fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as your given a moment to stick your head out of Sam's grasp, you hear Sam say \"...Lauren do you feel earthquakes?...\". Which this is then followed up by screaming as your given a view of the windshield. All you can see is a black glossy wall that has seem to fallen out of the sky, in front of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren is given little time to react as she brakes as hard as she can. But her brakes end up slipping slightly and the car smashes into the glossy black wall at about 20 Mph. Which lucky wasn't enough speed to allow someone in the car to get hurt, but unfortunately was enough to total the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car begins to make some noises and doesn't really move much. This causes Lauren to freak out a bit as she tries to turn the car off and on repeatedly. But each time she gets the same result with the car not responding anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis again leads the girls to begin to panic and you become enclosed in Sam's grasp as she holds her fist that has you in it near her chest. You think that in her panic she probably isn't even thinking about you in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery loud voices that seem to echo begin to be heard by all three of you. This makes you just cover your tiny ears as the girls seem to try to calm themselves down. You then hear Lauren say \"...I'm going to get out to check out the situation you stay here...\" In which you then hear the car door being opened followed by screaming, which leads to the car door being slammed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam who finally opens her hand that you in,... to try to relax herself, but is still in her panic says \"..What?...What?... What... what did you see see?...\". She then looks over at Lauren as she tries to come up with something to say about what she just saw and then she finally says in a nervous tone \"...\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What did Lauren see?)</span></div></div>",

What... what did you see see?...\". She then looks over at Lauren as tries to come up with something to say about what she saw and then says \"...There's.... GIANT'S.....\". She is then cut off and looking over at the driver side and then over at the passenger side windows, you three see slabs of metal lock onto the car tightly. Then the car is being lifted up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam screams loudly as you are once again clenched in her grasp, as a very scared and panicked looking Lauren just tries to look up through the shattered windshield to see where the car is being lifted off to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then after the moment of being lifted through the air. All three of shake violently as the car gets dropped onto what felt like a squishy surface. At this point you are really scared and confused. But you try to keep yourself strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there becomes a very serious amount of silence as Sam starts quickly unbuckles her belt so she can try to get out of the car. In the process of unbuckling she unknowingly drop's you out of her hand but luckily for you Lauren see's this and reacts fast with catching you in her grasp. You then look at her as she tries her best to give you a smile as she begins to hold you close to her in her grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after a second you hear \"We can't just sit here. let's get out and see if we can run somewhere.\" Sam says as she manages to get her seat belt off. In which Lauren nod's her head yes and then unbuckles her seat belt. In which then the two girls exit the car, with you in Lauren's hand. You of course can't really see much except Laurens massive fingers. As Lauren unknowingly keep's your entire body in her fist. The two of them seem to walk a few feet forward away from the car. Lauren has now opened her hand up to allow you to view things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd confusion sets in for all of you, in till Sam being the first one to look up scream's as she see's a gigantic woman's face above her. You and Lauren then look up, but with you being so tiny now, the woman's face is identifiable to you as a persons face but it is also a bit blurry to your tiny vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky then begins to get dark, as the gigantic woman's shadow begins to drench over you three as she begins looking down at all three of you. And while you and Lauren were watching this giant woman just stare down at all three of you. Sam had turn her attention to looking around some more and... as she notices something... you and Lauren hear Sam say in a panic tone \"...Oh my god! Lauren look there's three more giant people... just standing over by that now gigantic black SUV chatting. And I think I recognize them...\" She says this and then begins point to each one, going from left to right starting with the only man there she says \"...isn't that guy our dean... and that shorter young lady looks like someone from one our health classes... and ...WOA... that Asian woman looks like the universities head nurse... Am I Right?...\" After saying that Sam just continues to look at three giant people in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lauren who was listening to Sam has now turn to see the people who she was talking about. And as she looks at them, you look up at Lauren as her panic look went to shock as she nod's her head to confirm that each one of the giant people was who Sam was saying they were. You then heard Lauren say \"..Oh my gosh!.. That is our dean from the university and that one is a student from our health class... and wow,.. that is our nurse from the university.\". With being as tiny as you are you can't confirm if they are telling the truth or not. Since the giants in the distance just look like blurs. But you just decide to take there word for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you can't believe how strange it is and ask yourself why are they there, what is going on? But your not really able to get anything out as your surroundings get a bit darker as the giant woman who is who holding you three gets her face closer to her palm. Which this actually gives you a good look at her... and.... once you see her... you instantly recognize her as...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Now the question is who is the person that is holding you three?)</span></div></div>",

You are in complete confusion as you think ...why is she here?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her name is Dr. Lily Sly, She has been your regular doctor for quite some time now about 4 and half years. She has always been sweet to you. And the last time you two saw each other was a day or two before your exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when you remember that the last time you saw her was a day or so before the exam, you instantly think is she the reason why you are so small? But you really have no clue what to think at the moment. As the giant Dr. Lily begins talking to you three \" I can't believe it, the device and serum were a complete success.\" She wasn't really talking to you three as she said that and then turned her attention toward the other three giant people in the distance saying \"..We can do so much here...\". She then goes into talking science stuff to the other 3 giant people as she walks over to them while carrying you three and the destroyed tiny car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam seems to have calmed down at this point as her attitude is now gone from panic to angry as you hear her yell out at your giant doctor who is holding you three \"HEY!.. Don't you ignore us... Who are you?.. What the hell is going on here?... Why are we tiny?..\". This yelling actually seems to catch Dr. Lillie's attention as she reaches the other three giant people and then looks down at you three in her gigantic palm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles as she says \"Well that's a bit of a courageous tone coming from someone so tiny.\". She laughs for a moment before continuing to talk to Sam \"But if you must know, you can call me Dr. Lilly and I am the doctor of the smallest of you three. And I assume your already familiar with Mr. Murphy who is one of your universities dean, then there's the head nurse Dr. Violet Light, and our intern here who is a fellow student at your university is named Lola. There now were all introduced, I'll get back to talking to regular sized people.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then laughs as Sam gets angry at that comment and yells \"..What the heck, you didn't even answer all my question's. And don't talk to me as if I am lesser then you.\". Which this comment sort of makes Dr. Lilly laugh a bit more as she says \"Well your a feisty one. But alas there's no real reason for me to tell you anything about why or what we are doing...\". This just strings up into a argument between Sam and Dr. Lily who is just laughing through the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sit there in the palm of Lauren's hand as you and her hear more arguing going on between Sam and the giantess. But it gets broken up as Mr. Murphy interrupts the two of them with saying \"..Okay enough... now as entertaining as this is Dr. Lily. We should probably get moving to a more private location.\". Which Dr. lily agrees to Mr. Murphy by nodding her head and then sticking her tongue out at Sam before dumping you three into her lab coat pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Dr. Lily just casually dumps you three into her pocket you hear someone say in almost a whisper \"Wait a second?... I thought you said we were only doing tests on the boy. What are we going to do with the two girl's.\". The person who asked this was Lola the intern. In which you then hear a voice say \"...\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What do they do with the two goth girls?)</span></div></div>",

Mr. Murphy is the one who ends up saying this and then the rest nod in agreement as they begin to walk over to the SUV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen from Laurens grasp and hear a zipping sound as Dr. Lily has closed up her pocket and enters the black SUV with the rest of the people. They then drive off to there lab destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes go by with Lauren and Sam talking among themselves. And when that 10 minute mark hit you suddenly hear the sound of the zipper again. You assume that they all arrived at there destination but your sure that you can still hear the car engine. But without saying anything to either of you three. She plucks Lauren up with two fingers and then takes her out. Since you are in Laurens grasp you are being lifted up as well and when she has Lauren fully out of her pocket she instantly zip's it back up to not have to listen to Sam's frustrated yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren is placed onto Dr. Lily's palm and the she instantly starts talking \"Well you seem like the rational one of the two of you, so tell me which one of you has the tiny guy?\". Dr. Lily askes this in the sweetest way she could muster up as Lauren holds you in her grasp she contemplates giving you to her. But right Lauren is about to refuse to give you up, Dr. Lily sighs and says \"Listen if you don't tell me I will throw your little friend Sam.. was it?.. Out this moving cars window. And let me tell you that a normal sized person wouldn't survive falling out at 70 mph so, for sure your tiny friend wouldn't...\" This statement makes Lauren give you up right away without a second thought. And with you placed on her gigantic palm. Dr. Lily smiles as she re-inserts Lauren back into her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lily then squint's as she looks at you and then hovers what looks like a eye dropper above your tiny head. You look up and see it as an ocean of a drop, goes onto you and disappears quickly. And in a matter of a second you return to 1 inch tall. And before you say anything Dr. Lily says \"...There now your a proper tiny size..\" And without saying anything else your dropped back into the pocket with the two girls and listen as the zipper is zipped back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you have grow several times in 5 minutes. And now being the pocket with the 2 goths you are the same size as them. Which Sam notices right away as she says \"Woa... she grew you...\". Her attitude goes from surprised to anger real quick as you then hear her say \"Great now I won't feel bad when I beat you up.\". Sam then charges at you and given no place to really run to inside a pocket. She easily jumps on you and starts wailing saying things like \"..This is all your fault...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Lauren tries her best to break the fight up saying \"..Come on Sam get off of him. He is pretty much in the same boat as us... Beating him will get no where.\". This does actually make Sam stop as she is still angry with you and blames you for this. But she realizes that trying to kill you won't get her anywhere. And with that thought you all here the zipper above open again. As you hear Dr. Lily's voice say \"Ugh!, do I have to parent you three now. I feel your tiny movements. Now I have to separate one of you.\". She announces this while reaching in just to grab one of you to put in a different pocket of hers.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Which one of you three does Dr. Lily pick up?)</span></div></div>",

She then zip's up the pocket you and Lauren are in. Then she puts Sam into a separate zipped up pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend about 20 more minutes in that pocket just talking to Lauren the whole time. It was nice finally getting know her. And it was much better being on the same level as her you thought as you suddenly felt shaking as Dr. Lily and the others in the car had now made it to there destination and were now in there lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two then looked up as the zipper is being opened again and Dr. Lily plucks both of you out and dumps you two on a metal tray. You instantly see Sam on the same tray and then see Lauren go in to hug her. And as Sam see's you she gives you a dirty look that makes you just look away and take in your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that you are in some kind of warehouse that these people have transformed into a lab. The place looks big and with the room your in, you can tell that there are plenty of other rooms around this building. Another thing you notice is that there seems to be a few other people around this lab working and coming in and out of this room. All them are giants and giantesses to you though and don't even acknowledge your three presence. Instead they all just continue there work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back towards Dr. Lily, you only see her and Lola standing there. And you now get to see what Lola really looks like. She has long brunette hair, skinny, and have to say that she look's very stunning even standing next to the tall, brunette beauty that is Dr. Lily, she compared very well in looks to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a little distracted by that thought as you tune back into what is happening around you, listening to Sam showing her attitude again by yelling up a storm at Dr. Lily asking her things like what is going on here. But Dr. Lily ignore her as she slams her hand down, which silences Sam. Dr. Lily then smiled as she began talking \"So, Mr. Murphy and Dr. Violet had to go to the school for some kind of emergency and I promised them that I wouldn't hurt any of you...\". She takes a second to give a look at Sam before continuing to talk to us \"..So, this is your guys new home. Get use to it. In due time I might let you know what we are doing here. But that is on how each of you act. Which leads me to what is going to happen next...\" She pauses as she looks around the room at the people who are working. And after making a look at two people she says \"Nick,... Sarah get over here..\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn to see two giant people walking towards the table. One is a girl who you assume is Sarah. She is skinny and looks very pretty with her long blonde hair in a ponytail. You also notice that she's wearing a lab coat, but then also is wearing sneakers and workout gear such as tight stretchy pants and a black sports bra with a white crop-top on top of it. And then turning to see the other person you see a skinny guy who you assume is Nick. He is tall with dark brown hair and is wearing a lab coat with a button up underneath and tan pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Sarah don't even look at you three on the table as it seems that Sam has now turned her attention towards them and begins yelling up a storm with them. They both only look at Dr. Lily and say \"What do you need?\". In which Dr. Lily says \"Well it seam's we have shrunk more then one person so I need each of you to take one and go run the intro tests. Which ever one you don't pick Lola over here will take to do the same.\". At this point Sam is outraged as she goes off on a storm of a rant.

While Sarah approaches the table and looks down at you three. You could only just stare up at her, as she contemplates who she is going to pick to run tests on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam rants on, Sarah can't help but laugh a little bit at Sam while she thinks about her decision. She looks at you, and then at the other two. You know that doing what Sam is doing will just get you in trouble so you decide to play along and hopefully when your alone with one of the intern's you can get some answer's. And after that thought it seems that Sarah had finally made a decision and she replies while pointing at you \"Well I suppose,... that I'll pick you, he can be my guinea pig for today\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that, you watch as Sarah's giantess arm extends out and then her gigantic hand takes up your whole field of view as you get picked up into her grasp. And as she walks away with you in her grasp, you hear Nick say \"Well, I guess then I'll take the feisty one.\". Which leads you to hear Sam argue at that as Nick picks her up and takes her to a separate room as you are being carried by Sarah into a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah enters a room while holding you in her grasp, you take in your surroundings and notice that the room your in is rather big and looks like some kind of gym with workout equipment and a basketball court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah takes you over to a bench and sets you down on it. She stands over you and looks down at you with a smile as she say's \"Okay so, I haven't gotten a chance to do my workout today. And now that I have to run tests on you, I think it's best if we kill two birds with one stone.\". At this point, she brings her face in close to yours. \"Living tiny and a beautiful girl, too close for comfort\". You think as you blush and try not to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she does something that catches you off guard. She lifts her foot up, which lets you see the tennis shoes that she is wearing. Then with a quick motion she charges her foot at you. Which when you see her gigantic sneaker coming at you, you do your best to jump out of the way. But instead she catches you with a open foot to your chest. \"Ouch\" is all you utter as she repeats the process again and again. You try to run out of the way but you can't get anywhere as she just chase's you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Sarah finally stops and says \"Okay, I think I've gotten a good enough thought on your score.\" Hearing her say this and then walking over to a clipboard which she uses to jot down something all confuses you. As you hear her say \"..I'm giving you a 33 on agility and 65 on reflexes...\". She keeps talking as if to herself as you sit there a bit confused on what is going on. But then you finally interrupt her \"What does my score mean?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you as she says \"Your reflexes is only average, and your agility pretty terrible.\". She laughs while continuing to write. As you think in your head about what she just said. But you don't think on it to long as Sarah then begins speaking again with saying \"...Okay... hmmm... what to do for attention to detail.... Oh I know!...\" This is all you hear as Sarah once again picks you up and carries you over to where you see a gigantic treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sets you down on a bench that is right in front of the treadmill. She then walks onto the treadmill and begins to get it ready by turning it on. While watching her do that you inspect the treadmill and you see that for the most part it looks like an average treadmill except it has a screen on the side that is facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at the screen Sarah seems to finish setting up the treadmill and then says to you \"Okay so, I see that your looking at this screen right here. Once I start running, this screen will turn on and show things like my miles I ran and other running stuff. So, all you have to do for this test is just watch me run for 20 minutes, Okay!\". You slowly nod thinking that for her request of just watching her run, this might be a little too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit there, you watch as Sarah begins putting headphones in her ears and then she begins to run. Her speed looks incredible. And after she was running for about 7 minutes she begins sweating and then trying turn up the speed. It's insane to see. And you can't help to think that she has such a toned body and look's absolutely stunning even when covered in her sweat. You just watch her for the whole time wondering how she can run like that. After she finished and the screen said she ran for 20:05 minutes she slowed down then came to a complete halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then instantly turned off the machine and watch as the screen goes dark. Sarah then takes off earphones as she walked over towards you. Her eyes looking at you the whole time. And when reaches you she grabs the gigantic water bottle that has been next to you the whole time. And when finishes gulping the water down, she looks down at you and asks \"...So, tell me how many miles did I run at the 11 minute mark.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second as you didn't expect her to say something like that. And you just ended up answering with \"...Uh at least 5, I think!\" She just smiles at your estimate and starts walking back to the machine. She then begins jotting something down as she asks you more random questions that you fumble through. And then you here her say \"..Okay attention to detail 36.3... Look's like someone was not paying attention very well...\" She giggles after making that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit embarrassed, but tried to let it go as she finishes jotting something down and then proceeds back over to you. She then says \"Okay last test little guy. And thank you being so comparative today... I think I'll let you choose how we do the pain tolerance... pick A.., B..., or C..\" Sarah smiles after saying this with giving you no other information other then the three letter's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich this leads you to say \"..Wait what does each letter mean?\".

Looking at her after you say that you see a a smile forum on her face as she says \"...B really? Well it's your choice I guess.\". Sarah then without saying what you picked. She takes off one of her sneakers and then reaches over to grab you quickly. She still doesn't say anything as she then hovers your body over her sneaker that emits a bad smell of feet and sweat. She then drops you inside and says \"...Okay so, I'm saying this twice so, listen. Your pain tolerance test will be to endure being in my sneaker while I run on the treadmill some more.\". She this and then you try to interrupt her with no way but she doesn't let you speak as she says \"...Your probably going to want to run over to the toe section now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without saying anything else to you Sarah begins to put the sneaker on the ground to proceed to then put it back on. Seeing this you instantly run to the toe section as her gigantic foot enter the sneaker you are inside of. You are then currently underneath her toes as she fully puts it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she is now walking on the sneaker to proceed to walk over to the treadmill. Every step she takes, makes your whole body start to vibrate with that force and feel a bit of pain. Also there's the noise from her sneaker hitting the concrete ground, which makes your ears hurt. And then the you also have to endure that awful smell which get's when she begins her run on the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been like 5 minutes now since she started her run on the treadmill and her feet are bouncing up and down so fast that it almost looks as if they are going to leave the sneaker. You try to close your eyes to not see this but but you find hard as her foot sweat drop's on you like rain. By now her run is getting even worse for you to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole experience is just a mess for you and ends up lasting 45 minutes before you see light as she takes off her sneaker. You are to tired to really move at this point as you watch Sarah's gigantic hand grab you and take you out of her shoe. She looks you over and then laughs as she says \"Opp's... I wasn't really suppose to go that long. I guess time just got away from me there. Uhhh.... are you okay?\". She asks looking you over. Which you try to respond but only really give a movement that indicated to her that you were still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard her say \"Well given the time length you had to endure I think I'll just put down a 71.2...\". She giggles as she holds you and writes down the number. Hearing this you wonder why she didn't just give you a 100, but then you think that your to tired to even care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then began to take the hand that was holding your tiny body, and brought it closer to her face. Watching this happen as you just laid on her palm tired. You couldn't help to think for a moment while her gigantic face got closer to you that she really looked gorgeous and that she had an overall beauty about her that made you think that if you weren't tiny, you might of tried to flirt her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your vision of her beautiful face went away as she instantly pulls her hand that is holding you away from her face while giving you a disgusted look and then you hear her say \"Wow you really stink...\". After that you then hear her say \"You really need a shower...\". Which she then looks around the room and smiles as she see's something and then while carrying you she quickly heads over to a near by water fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a flash you are being drench in water while she holds your tiny body under it. She stops after 5 or so minutes saying \"Okay I guess that will do...\". And then she takes a napkin that was in her pocket and use's it to dry you off. Now while all this was happening your senses were coming back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your energy return as Sarah finishes and says \"Okay lets get you back to the Doc. She will handle where you go next...\". And with that said Sarah carries you back into the room you were in earlier. She then hands you to Dr. Lily while they do a quick talk to one another that you only barley hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then smiles at you and says \"Well I guess I'll see you later little guy...\" And with that Sarah leaves. You then look up to see Dr. Lily looking down at you in her palm. You can't help to think that now that you two are alone that maybe you can get some answer's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after She observes you for a moment, she then begins talking before you can ask anything and she says \"...hmmm I expected more out of you. But I guess your results could of been Sarah not taking the test's to seriously. I guess tomorrow I'll have you redo them with a different intern.\" She smiles after saying that. And your still a bit confused by all this, and want to yell at her to tell you everything about the shrinking stuff. But then you think that you should try to not be like Sam and just say \"...Uhhh.. okay... so, are you going to tell me what is going on?\". In which she giggles a moment before replying to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looks down at you and says \"Well... no I will not be telling you anything just yet. But Sarah did inform me that you didn't try to argue with her like your little goth friends. So, I will give you some information. So, listen up and don't ask any questions. So, I guess I'll start with,... Our company has motives that can only be explained at the right time and place. And with that said I will tell you that we shrink about a dozen people each year. Now we chose that number because it was enough people to where it wouldn't cause to much of a commotion if they disappeared. Which eventually it seems that the tiny people always end up disappearing for different reasons whether its being lost or an accident happened.... But nevertheless once all of a batch has disappeared we need to find a new batch of people. This is where you and eleven other people come in.\". Dr. Lily pauses for a moment as she see's you just focus on hearing her next few words. \"So, this lead to eleven people being shrunk about a month ago. Which you were suppose to be the 12th member of that batch. But for some reason you ended up shrinking much later on then expected. it was like something we haven't seen before.\". She paused for a moment thinking about how much she should tell you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what she said you wanted to say why did you shrink me but Dr. Lily saw that you were going to say something and said \"...Listen like I said before no questions.\". She this in a tone that scares you enough to stay quiet as she explains \"...Now where was I getting to... Oh Yea! So, with that information,... let's get into your sleeping arrangement.\". She this with now holding you in her grasp as she begins walking to somewhere while continuing to speak \"... So, you will now be meeting those eleven people or maybe just a few of them. As I will be handing you to our nightly caretaker who will watch all you tines while you sleep.\". That statement weirds you out and everything she says just keep leading you to more and more questions. But your not able to say anything as Dr. Lily ender's a room that looks like a doctor's waiting office with a secretary and everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lily then stops speaking to you as she approaches the sectary and while they both just ignore your presence you hear Dr. Lily say \"...Well I'm here to drop off number 12... And for those other two that were dropped off. If you could just give them number 13 and 14...\" She says this and then reaches out the hand you are to be handed to a beautiful woman that has short red ginger hair and looks to be in her late 20's. And right before Dr. Lily drops you in this girl's hand you hear her whisper to you \"...Oh by the way, Those eleven people have already been through multiple tests and we still have all of them. So, have fun meeting them..\". And with that you got dropped into the secretary ladies grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman who is now holding you doesn't even look at you as takes the hand the is holding you and rests her chin on it casually. All you can really do is just be in her grip and stare up at her gigantic face that is above you. Her and Dr. Lily then begin talking to one another as if you weren't even there. And this lasted 10 more minutes in till, Dr. Lily just said bye and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who was holding you looked at you her hand for a moment \"...Oh stop staring at my face and just chill out\" She says in a lazy voice as she starts to slowly stroll through the building. You try to take a good look at the surroundings but can't see much since your only an inch tall and have your view blinded by the girl's gigantic fingers. You think for a moment and can only assume that this lady is the one that takes care of you eleven while the doctor does all the experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are finally able to see though as the woman tosses you some kind of cube in the wall. And then she closes the clear glass in front of you. Which she then locks, and then you watch as she bends down and looks at you. And with a bored expression on her face she then walks away from you, still without saying anything to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really know what to think and as you turn around you see...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(How many people are in there with you?)</span></div></div>",

The first one is sitting down at a table with her back to you. She is staring at a laptop while tapping on the table with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the second one is sitting down at a desk as she spins around in her chair and then faces you with a big grin. She has long brunette hair that covers most of her body and you see she is wearing a tan tank-top. Her top half leaves nothing to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the space that you are in you see that your in side a single cube with cement walls on 3 sides and of course the clear plastic door that locks from the outside. There's little pieces of doll furniture spread out with about four beds in the space. You can see the end of a desk and chair and two little dressers and a counter all the way to the far wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You just gave a shrug as you looked around at it. And you hear foot steps the girl with brunette hair who was looking at you comes running over to you with a big grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, are you real? It's so exciting to meet a new person!\". She says all this in a excited tone as she then looks over at the girl on the laptop and says \"Melony look look it's new person...\". She then turns her attention back to you saying \"...I thought they said no one else would be shrinking. But wow I guess they decided one more....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour a little put off by the hyper activity of this girl \" Umm... Hey,... So, are you going to introduce me to the...\" you ask before you are cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry I'm Alice and that's Melony\" she points to the laptop girl. After a moment of silence she asks \"So what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..., Uh....\", you stammer as you give her your name. Alice then smiles as she says \"Well, nice to meet you!\". Alice then turns towards Melony. \"Right Melony you don't have to be rude just say something...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I've already met everyone else.\" Replies Melony \"And I don't have an interest in meeting anyone else in this terrible place.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melony!\" Alice pouts \"You never want to talk to new people, that's why you're such a grumpy grump!\" Melony only then responds with \"Whatever...\" as she gets back to whatever she was doing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice then sticks her tongue out playfully as she turns to you and says \"Oh well just ignore her. She is a nice person once you get to know her... So, how long have been here? Is this your first day?\". You respond with a nod yes to both as Alice gets excited again by saying \"Oh goodie! I get to be the person who fills you in. You see were in our sleeping cube and there are like 6 others across this wall with the other's who got shrunk. We usually have 2 or 3 caretaker's who watch out throughout the night. And tonight as you saw already Megan who was that secretary who brought you here. Then there's two other care taker's who are Gwen and Cassidy. Also there's a man named Mack but he usually always stays away from us tines. \". As she goes on about the people she points out each of them as she names them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who are the people that are tiny like us...\". You say and then get a surprising response from Melony who says \"...Ugh... Alice don't explain everyone. Listen man there are 9 girls here and 3 including you boys here that are tiny... Now will you two keep it down.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that she isn't including the two goths, and to keep Alice from shooting off into another excited rant of questions. You decide not to mention them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then suddenly you hear a loud knock coming at the door to the giant room that your cube is in. Then you watch as the gigantic door opens and you see a girl about your age with short brown hair enter with a smile as she talks to Megan and the one that Alice said was Cassidy. But you can't hear anything that they say as Alice is ranting on about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you do hear a moment of silence followed by Alice giggles as she comes up next to you and then as she glances to where you are looking she says \"...Oh no! it's Gwen, ....\". And this is the first time you see Alice's face go from a big smile to a bit of fear as she backs away and heads over to where Melony is. Both of them try to be hidden behind some of the doll furniture as you stand there in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut turning your attention back towards the giants you can actually hear what they are saying as the one called Gwen says to Megan \"....Oh! I can't believe I was late today. Did the tines miss me.\" Which Megan just gives her a bored look while saying \"... Ugh! why would you even care?\" Which is a rhetorical question but Gwen responds anyway with \"Because they are just so cute and adorable. I love being around them and holding them....\" She goes on as Megan finally then stops her by saying \"Oh come on, there not that cute. You realize we deal with these tiny people on a daily basis....\". Gwen just looks at Megan she says back \"Oh your just not playing with them enough. Each one is cute and fun to play with.\". Which Megan just rolls her eyes and says \" Yea whatever...\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen then just smiles and heads over to the cubes that hold all you tiny people...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Does Gwen go for the cube your in?\"</span></div></div>",

But then you watch as her eyes lock on you. She walks over, stares at you for a second. Her face goes from a smile to an excited one as you watch her dig through her pockets. Which she seems to find what she is looking for as she pulls out a pair of keys. You then watch as she unlocks the cube your and takes you out. Gwen then immediately closes the cube shut and re-locks it while having you in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds you up in front of her smiling face as she looks at you. \"Isn't he just so cute? I just love little guys like him.\" Gwen then brings you closer to her face as her smile gets bigger and bigger. Then she brings her finger to your face and gives you a little tap on the nose. \"Hey buddy, don't be scared I'm going to hold you close. Oh my gosh, your just the cutest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen then closes her eyes as if to savor the feeling of holding you. After about a minute she opens her eyes and just looks at you. You then watch as she starts to sway back and forth holding you tightly. The whole time you felt a little strange and frustrated with how you were being treated. I mean your not some pet for her to play with, you are a person. So, you did your best to try to struggle and push away at her. But it was really no use as Gwen didn't even notice your tiny protest's and instead thought you were enjoying the experience as much as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just keeps swaying you while walking over to Megan saying \"Megan I can't believe you don't think these guys are just absolutely adorable. I wish I could just take one home and cuddle with it.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan just rolls her eyes and says \"Yuck... why would you want one of those little things at your home.\".<br>\r\nAs you continue to struggle and push away, it begins to pay off as Gwen actually notices. But sadly it's not in the way as you hoped. As she thinks that your struggling means that you want to be held closer to her, she begins to react a bit. She actually starts holding you closer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey tiny guy, were you trying to make Gwen give you more love awwww..., Gwen will always be looking out for you and things will be better than they are now.\" Gwen says, while continuing to hold on to you. Which makes you try to struggle even more but she is much stronger then you so, your efforts are unfelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to listen to meanie Megan, Gwen can make your problems go away and she will always take care of you.\" Gwen just smiles after saying that. While Megan looks at Gwen with a bored expression and then says \"Gwen you know he's a man right, not some pet hamster...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow its Gwen's turn to roll her eyes and you hear her say \"Megan! I know I'm not dumb, but he's also so tiny and need's someone to keep him safe.\". Then she turns her attention back to you and is again just swaying back and forth holding you close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time you were struggling like this, your mind was actually trying to come up with a way out of this mess. Unfortunately, your only a tiny little thing, and Gwen is a giant compared to you, she clearly has all the strength in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then decide to try to kick her gigantic fingers. But unfortunately for you Gwen doesn't even feel your feeble kick. She just continues to hold you close to her as she just smiles and nods at whatever Megan is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear a new voice as Cassidy has now walked over to Gwen and Megan. She says \"Gwen will you just put that tiny guy back in his cube already.\". Gwen immediately stops her swaying and says \"But Cassie, he is scared.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy rolls her eyes as usual and replies \"Gwen he's not scared. Now go put him away, we have actual work to do...\" With this order, Gwen gives a sad look and says \"Fine...\". She then quickly hops away while holding you in her grasp. You feel a little nausea with each hop she takes back towards the cubicles. But fortunately it doesn't take long for her to reach the cubicles as she opens one of them and then places you inside and then quickly locks it. And with a quick bend to look in at you with a sad expression on her face, she says \"...Don't be sad little one, we can play later..\" Gwen then gives a smile as she skips away back towards the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just roll your eyes at this as you turn around and see...</font></span></div></div>",

Then there's two girls who were just talking among themselves. You watch as the man gets off the bed and walks over to you \"Hello there, I'm Russell, I take it you are new here?\". the man says while extending his hand out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look at it for a second \"Ah no, I'm not new here, I think I actually just got put into the wrong cubicle, that crazy girl put me in this one.\". With this excuse you wonder if you should start trying to get the giants attention, but Russell stops you from doing that by saying \"No no no, it's alright, it was a slip up, don't be so paranoid. We have a fourth bed anyway so, it's all good. Oh by the way the two girls over there are Emma and Bailey\". He points to them as he mentions that the blonde one is Bailey and the brunette was Emma. The two girls both nod at you and say \"Hey\" with a smile. So, you just give a wave and say \"Hey\". Then, you start examining the room a little more and see that it looks exactly the same as the cubicle you were in before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you and Russel walk over to where the girls are as Russel points out what bed is unclaimed so you could sleep in. And as you reach the girls Bailey ends up being the first to speak. \"So.... You're new, right?\" She says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head \"Yes, I just got here.\" You start before Russel interrupts by saying \"Right you are then, so, you also go to that university that we all go to.\". You quickly nod your head \"Yes\" as you reply. To which Russel then jokes by saying \"Well you should ask one of these two cute girls out when you get the chance, they will approve.\". Which makes you nervous to hear,... But your nervousness ends as Bailey just slaps Russel and says \"..That's not funny Russ, I think last thing on his or any our minds is dating.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see Emma just give a bit of a sad look. Which you instantly say to Emma \"...Is something wrong?...\". In which Emma gives you a nervous look as she realizes the situation and then quickly goes into a smile as she says \"...Oh nothing I was just lost in thought...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then just say back \"..Okay...\" and try to let it go. But Russ comes up next to you and whispers \"...Yea... I sort of forgot that we should probably not mention dating around Emma since she sort of had a big thing going with some guy before she shrunk. And ever since she has been tiny and in here she has been pretty down about it.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a nod to what Russel is saying and look to the unconcerned girls. They are both on cots next to each other, looking very close as they brush their hair. You sort of pause for a second... as you think about your girlfriend Naomi who is someone that you haven't even thought about till now. You feel for Emma for a moment, but trying to keep your spirits up you just let the thought go. Which then you and the others begin talking and having some fun in till you eventually all went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day your woken open by a loud tap on the clear door of the cubicle that your in. You stand up and see that the other three are already dressed and by the door. You also see that giant who woke you up was that Nick guy who you saw before. Russel looked over at you and then pointed towards your clothing. In which you immediately got the idea of what he wanted you to do. So, you quickly got dressed. And then headed over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick opened the door and picked up all four of you without saying anything to any of you. he yawns as he carries all of you to a location. Which it doesn't take him to long to drop you four into a much bigger version of the cubicles that you four were in that looked like a cafeteria of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell quickly informed you that this is breakfast time and that we should probably eat quickly since every 30 minutes they rotate cubicles in and out to eat, then they go to there tests. So, you see that food on trays were already set for you four and you all went to eating. Some chatting went on but not much as the 30 minutes came to an end, Russell and Bailey were taken away to begin there tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once you saw Dr. Lily peek her giant face above. You knew that you would be the next to go. As you followed the lead that you saw Russ do earlier and throw away your food and then walk up to the giantess hand. You were a bit surprised that she told Emma to come as well. But you assume that she might be doing the same tests as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lily carried both of you out of the cube of a lunch room and then down a hallway. She informs you that today she won't be able to re-do your intro tests due to something else she has in mind. She leaves it at that as she brings both of you into the lab room that you were in when you first got the giant building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set's you on a metal tray and as she explains what your test will be.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What does she say you will be doing?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">She set's you on a metal tray as she explains that your test will be to compete in an obstacle course. Then over the next few minutes you and Emma are transported by the tray to a big room. that you see a giant doll sized obstacle course that to you is regular size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe course is set up all over the giant room and involves a lot of jumping, climbing, pulling and carrying things. Once you and Emma are put down, you see four different entrance's and then you see 4 other tiny people including Sam, Alice, Bailey, and Russ. Sam of course is still in a state of yelling as the giants clearly ignore her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other tiny people don't look too sure about the whole event but then you hear Dr. Lily's voice come from some kind of intercom above. You all turn to listen as she says \"Okay so this will be a team obstacle course to test certain abilities. Now some of you have been resisting to do each test and so we decided to offer some kind of a reward for if you finish. So, the reward will be a request for anything you want or want to know. Now there are exceptions to the reward like you can't ask to be unshrunk, but for the most part it is a limitless single request. Now each of you came in as teams of two. So, that person you came in with is your teammate.\". She pauses for a moment before continuing \"...Okay, now if you all may step into the door that is front of you and one more thing. The last person in the group to make finish last place overall, will face a sort of punishment.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all slowly go through each of the doors as you and Emma enter through your doorway you notice right away that the first course is a maze. The doors close behind you and then you hear two giant clamps close. You look at each other a bit confused before you hear a voice from the speakers, It is Dr. Lily \"When you are finished with the maze, you have 2 more courses to complete afterwards before you all finish. Good luck and have fun!\". The voice is a bit monotone but seems sort of friendly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really have no idea where to begin so you decide to follow your partner's lead. As Emma begins making her way through the maze while you follow. You and Emma end up getting lost for about 20 minutes before finally finding your way out. During that time you were surprised about how smart Emma was being throughout the maze. It made you look at her a little differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once you two walked out of the maze you see a giant rock climbing wall that takes you two some time to get over. I turned out that Emma had a sort of fear of height's, which forced you to carry her while she shut your eyes and climbed. And since you two were practicality the same size, carrying her while climbing was pretty tough. But you did your best to endure the lifting and even tried to keep her calm with some laughs and conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you two are over the wall. You guys know that you have one more course to finish. And after walking down a narrow walkway. You two walk out and see that the last of the course is a straight mile run to the finish. And turning your head you see Alice and Sam standing there looking at the course ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really know what to think as you heard Emma say \"Alice, hey...\". Which makes both Alice and Sam looks your way. Then as Sam notice you, she seems to get some kind of evil look on her face that spells trouble for you. Seeing that you told Emma to run with you. As you grabbed her hand and began bolting down the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear Sam yelling \"...Come back here you little squirt. I swear I'm going to kill you for allowing me and Lauren to be put into this terrible place.\". On top of this you could hear Alice saying \"Sam... Sam...\". Trying her best to defuse the situation but it had seemed that Sam out match her in speed as she charged after you and Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sure that Sam wasn't intending to run you over as she was speeding towards you but then you wouldn't really know since you started screaming loudly and Emma also screamed. You looked back briefly and saw that the both of them were a decent distance away, you then thought that maybe you two will finish before they catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then disaster struck as you and Emma were nearing the finish line, Emma tripped and fell hard on the ground. You instantly stopped in your tracks as you checked to see if she was okay. her ankle looked a bit twisted but nothing serious. She tried to get up but had a hard time walking on it. You heard Sam's screams get closer as Emma tried to convince you to leave her. But you had no intention of leaving her as you began carrying her on your back. Emma the whole time tried to be nice and make you put her down as she is slowing you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you continued in till you were a few feet away from the finish line and heard Sam almost about the same distance you toss Emma off you right before Sam tackles you. Emma ends up being the first to cross the finish line as Sam starts to wail on you, While Alice who is exhausted, passed out as she crossed the line. It was clear to you the the giants didn't really care about you guys in till you finished the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your best to dodge blow after blow as Sam lets her anger out on you. But it get's really scary for you as Sam puts you into a choke hold. You feel yourself unable to breath for about a half a minute before you hit the ground. You wonder why your out of the hold as you take in deep breaths and then look to your side to see Russ has pushed Sam off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two then quickly cross the line as a buzzer goes off. Emma wobbles over to you and then gives you a big hug as she cries about what just occurred. You on the other hand are still shaken up about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I am so sorry about what happened on the race, if I had been paying more attention you wouldn't have been in any danger!\" Emma says as she cries near you.<br>\r\n\"I'm not mad, things happen, just don't do that again please.\" You answer as you attempt to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time after race felt like it flew by as Sam was taken away by Dr. Lily to do her punishment thing. While Emma of course asked to give you the request. But she was quickly told that she couldn't give away her request, but she could use her request whenever she wanted, so she decided to save it for a better time. Then all of you were separated for a bit to health checkup's. This led to the day finishing and you some how got put into a cube with just you and Emma that night. Which made for a fun night overall as you two talked and laughed.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">The days and weeks after this night were filled with test after test. With most of these test's ending up being one's that were just you or you and Emma. The whole experience itself would have been absolutely terrible for you if not for how much fun you were having while being with Emma. You had to admit that it was a bit strange that you two always seem to end up together and always ended up in the same cube at the end of each day. But you didn't want to jinx anything as you and Emma seemed to be developing a thing for one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point in time it's been about a month since the obstacle course. And you were taken to dinner where you met up with Emma. She was taken to a different room from you, but she met you at dinner. Once you see her you greet as you have been for the past week \"Hey beautiful,... so do I get a kiss for making through another day of being tiny. Usually she would smile and then give you a kiss right there. But today she just embrace you with a hug as she sat back down. And then began talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed nervous, in a sort of good mood type of way and she also was way more talkative than she normally is at dinner. \"Hey, so, what did they have you do?.. I was taken to another physical. \" she keeps talking with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about her happy tone for a moment as even though both of you had fun together, it had always seemed that before today Emma would always feel bad due to never seeing her old boyfriend again which only bothered you slightly as you understood whenever you thought of Naomi. But you get snapped out of this thought though as you hear Emma say \"Ummm.. hello?... were you listening.\". Which you nervously stumble through your next words that end with \"...Uh sorry no,... I was just a bit distracted by a thought.\". This is when Emma of course asks \"Oh really?, well come on tell me?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when you felt the need to come up with some kind of lie as what you were thinking was something that should probably left alone \"Oh, I... got my report back today on my intro tests that I toke a month ago. And it made me feel bad as I saw how low it was...\" You reply with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! just ignore those things. I swear a test for a tiny person should be obvious that it is low.\" she says with a bit of a laugh as she sips on her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you aren't sure how to proceed so you don't say much after that as you two continue eating in a bit of silence. This lasts for a bit of time in till Emma who seems a bit more off now as she says \"...So,... tonight I am thinking about using my request... and I want you to come with.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mood that was a bit off now seems to be completely ruined as you sit there with your drink looking down and say clearly \"What did you have in mind?\". At first it sounds like she doesn't reply, but then she starts to laugh a bit and say \"Well, I want to make it a surprise. So, what do you say? Will you come with me?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have thought about this a lot about what to say and how to say it so you just agree right away before going back to drinking. You know that whatever it is, it must be something she has been thinking about for awhile as she never asked you before so you'll have to respond in a special way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this makes her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Dr. Lily comes for Emma. And she tells Dr. Lily that your coming as well, which she was fine with as she picked up both of you to take you guys down a hall and into an elevator. The walk after the elevator is a bit strange for you as you had never been at whatever floor this was. But you decided to stay quiet during this process. As Dr. Lily enters a room and then while placing you on her desk she informs you that the request is just hers so, she can be the only one involved. After saying that to you she walks over to a gigantic machine that was even taller that Dr. Lily. It looked like one of those dumb teleporting machines with two pods from those old sci-fi movies. Dr. Lily then set's Emma down inside one of the clear glass pods. She then pushes a button that locks her inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lily then makes her way back to you. And as she sits down, you are very curious to what is happening and say \"Ummm.... what does this have to do with her request?..\". Which when Dr. Lily heard that she just responded to you with a smile saying \"This is just something she agreed to before the request...\". She leaves it at that as she pushes the keys on her key board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then says into a microphone \"Ready?...\". And in a flash lights sprung up everywhere and gray smoke seemed to enter the capsule that Emma was in. And you watched as she disappeared in the gray smoke. The process lasted about a minute or 2 before the gray smoke began to vacuum through vents and you were able to see Emma, which when you did see her you were shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoked cleared in the capsule, you noticed a growth in Emma. As you are now looking at her standing in the capsule at about 5 feet and 6 inches tall. She was now like Dr. Lily the height of a giantess to you. Her clothes also seem to grow with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lily said some things into a microphone as she pushes a button to open the capsule. Dr. Lily then looks down at you as you are thriving for some kind of explanation which she is happy to apply as she says \"...Well as you see your little friend is not so little anymore.\". She pauses to giggle as you say a bit confused \"Wait I thought you said that she couldn't ask to be grown.\". Which this causes an eye roll from Dr. Lily as she continues to talk to you \"Yes I did say that and I did try to keep to that but... I should probably start by telling you that your little friend has been helping us out recently with research and other stuff about you tiny people. She had been so helpful that I felt a reward was in order and as she finally came up to me and gave me her request of...\". She is cut off though as Emma who now towers over you as a giantess, walks over to you two and says \"...Dr. lily can I please explain the rest...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn which, both of you are now looking at Emma as Dr. Lily nod's yes. To which Emma says \"...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What is the first thing Emma says?)</span></div></div>",

And when she asked me, I told her I wanted a way to se my old lover. So, she agreed to let me grow back to normal size if I keep this place a secret and work here. Which this actually had nothing to do with my request...\". She nervously slides her hand up and down her arm as she pauses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so confused at what is going on. And feel as though Emma has been lying to you the whole time. But before you can say something Dr. Lily interjects with a bored tone \"...Okay I'm going to get this moving. I have a lot to do and don't want to sit here all day.... So, Emma's request was that she wanted to keep you safe.\". She pauses as she wants to see your reaction which your shocked and curious to know more so she continues \"...It seems Emma had actually taken liking to you while trying to get info out of you and everyone else. So, her request was that we let her take you with her out of here. And since we have two extra tiny people already with Sam and Lauren, I agreed to let her take you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that Dr. Lily gestures Emma to take you out of here as she says \"...So, I will see you tomorrow Emma and as for you,..\". She pauses as she looks at you and then smiles as she says \"...have a good life.\". With that Emma was handed a purse, in which you were placed into with her saying anything to you. You just lay in the purse as the top of it is zipped shut and you are in a state of surprise and confusion. All this happens with the only sound given to you is Emma's heels hitting the title floor as she walks to exit the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma though was in a different mood as she tried to drift her mind off you. She couldn't believe that she was her normal sized again. And she felt so lucky that during the time when she was helping the lab she was able to talk to her boyfriend through phone calls. Of course he was told a lie about what she was doing, but it was always nice to hear his voice. She thought this as she walks towards her car that was taken here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she enters her car, you are finally taken out of her purse. You are frustrated, confused, and overall don't know what to think at this point as she holds you out in the palm of her now gigantic hand. You stare up at her, ready to say something. But she instead goes to make the first mood as she says \"...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What does she say?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">You hear what Dr. Lily says and then hear Sam making a larger then life racket for all those around her, Lauren tries her best to calm Sam down. While Sarah approaches the table and looks down at you three. You could only just stare up at her, as she contemplates who she is going to pick to run tests on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam rants on, Sarah can't help but laugh a little bit at Sam while she thinks about her decision. She looks at you, and then at the other two. You know that doing what Sam is doing will just get you in trouble so you decide to play along and hopefully when your alone with one of the intern's you can get some answer's. And after that thought it seems that Sarah had finally made a decision and she replies \"Well I suppose,... that I'll pick Sam, she can be my guinea pig for today\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You can't be serious!\" Sam replies in a loud and angry tone. That really only makes Sarah laugh and smile as she very easily picks up Sam and holds her in her grasp. Sam was yelling and struggling the whole time but to Sarah her struggles were to weak to notice. And you watched as Sarah went to another room while carrying Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lily then tells Nick to pick and says to make it a quick one since she doesn't have all day. But luckily for her, he already had his pick in mind as he reaches out and says \"Yea.. yea... I guess I'll pick the pretty little pink haired one named... Lauren right?\" To which Lauren looks up at Nick in a bit of fear as he reaches and easily picks her up. You then watch as Nick takes Lauren with him to a separate room in the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, looks like you have our prime subject Lola treat him with care, he's probably the only one of the three that actually matters to our results.\" Dr. Lily says and then reaches for you and picks you up into her grasp. She then drops you into Lola's soft palm. With that being said Dr. Lily leaves and goes to check on to do whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lola holds you in her grasp and carries you over to a small room where there's a computer and a lot of lab equipment. You are then placed onto a nearby table and as you look up at Lola she begins speaking to you saying \"Okay now, I will give you the intro tests. I will be simply measuring your reflexes, agility, pain tolerance and attention to detail. All these tests that I perform will be minor version's of what you can expect later on. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a few questions but they all relate to the process of being shrunk and how you're going to grow back to your normal size. So, you just decide to try and ask \"Could tell me what is going on here?\" In which Lola responds to you with an eye roll and says \"Ugh,... why is that always the first question from you shrunken people, listen you heard Dr. Lily and I follow her rules. But how about this, I really want to just get this over with so, how about you endure each of my tests and after I'll answer two question's. But your question can not relate to what our operation is about or anything to due with the shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it and agree to her terms though you do wonder what is the actual purpose of all this. \"Okay good, Now we will start with two, agility and reflexes.\" Lola says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this day you ask her what \"Agility? reflexes?\" means and she tells you \"Listen your result will be a number from 1-100. 1 being the slowest and 100 being the fastest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she picks you up and moves you to the floor. You try to ask what will be in this test but she just walks away from you to get the test ready. You watch her as she walks up to a solid box that has holes around it, but no way to see inside of it. She then opens the box and a kitten jumps out. The kitten is cute and very fast, it's also 10 times your size. You watch as it runs around in the room a few times, before it notices you, in which the kitten stares at you for a moment. The kitten seems to almost know that you are there and runs straight for your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to move out of the way and you succeed with what seems like 1 inch. You run around and searching for a place to hide but each time you tried to run under something Lola would stop you with stomping down her sneaker in front of you. So, you just kept dodging the Kitten and this process felt like it was going on for 20 minutes. But in reality its only been about 3 minutes since you've been experimented on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitten then finally jumps on top of you and for a second you feel afraid that it's going to eat you. But after a few more moments, you hear \"Okay that's enough...\" as the kittens teeth begin to get closer to you Lola picks up the kitten and places it gently back into it's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I believe that is a 61 for reflexes and 43 for speed.\" Lola says this while jotting it down. You don't fully understand what she means by it but you sure hope its not bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola then walks over to you and picks you and places you back onto the table. Lola looks down at you and say's \"Okay time for pain tolerance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then picks you up again and places you back on the ground. Curious to what the pain tolerance test would be you just stare up at her in confusion as she gives you a sort of bored look. She then toke off one of her shoe's and hovered her socked foot over you. She then without any warning stepped down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave an immediate burning sensation all over your body and you felt a tremendous amount of pain. You couldn't believe how much you wanted to scream and it took all of your willpower to try and hold it in. You then heard Lola say \"Come on I'm just a girl who is putting little strength into stepping on you. Is this really causing you pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her and she was still standing there with a bored look on her face. You didn't know if it was because she didn't really feel anything when she did this to you or if she was amusement. Or even if it was just some sadistic act towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you finally let out an howling pain that caused her to remove her socked foot off of you. She then proceeded to put her sneaker back on and begin jotting down the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of silence she gave you a smile and said \"47 not to bad I guess...\" She then picked you up and replaced you on the table. She then looked at you and said \"Okay last test, is to ask your questions. So, ask away...\"<br>\r\n</font><br>\r\n(what do you ask?)</span></div></div>",

However, out of nowhere your voice seemed to come back to you and you asked \"Why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" Lola looked a bit confused by your question not knowing what the question was referring to. You then said asking \"Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola looked at you and thought for a moment. She then said \"Well I can't on why the company or anyone else does this. but I can tell you why I'm here doing this. You see I have always wanted to be on a team that was on the breaking edge of something new. And strangely enough a professor at our school found out about this want that I had and then recommended me here. And I will say I was a little put off when I saw all the people that were tiny and then found out they didn't have a choice in the matter. But then I had a talk with Dr. Lily and it all made sense to me. This is the team I always wanted to be on. I can't say anything to enticing about it yet. But I will say what comes out of this process will be greatness. Plus I do have to say I think when a person is all tiny there just absolutely adorable.\". She smiles and giggles to herself after saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stay quiet and think about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't have time to think to long as Lola looks down at you \"Okay tell me your next question already...\" She then says in a demanding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are at a loss for words as you don't even know what your next question is. How is she going to chose whether or not to help you if you haven't given her a question to choose from. But then you become curious about something and say \"Uh...well...I guess I am wondering why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Lola looks at you with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say \"I mean why shrink me of all people?\". This question stops her smile as she thinks about what she will say next and then replies with \"Well... here's the thing I can't tell you why you were chosen to be shrunk. But how about instead I tell you what the process is that leads up to someone like you being shrunk...\". Which you just agree to at this point since you can't think of any other question. So, Lola says \"Okay... so here at the lab we don't have a lot of people shrunken. If we did then we would be found out pretty quickly. So, for each batch we only really have a about a dozen or less people shrunk. A batch is refer to your group of people that enter with you. So, before we shrink anyone else, we must wait till the old batch is gone. And that might scare you so let me clarify that we don't intentionally kill people here. Sometimes they get lost, there atoms can't take being small and they explode, or they can't take a certain test. So, I think that is where I'll leave this conversation off with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this small bit of information, you gain more and more questions. But Lola isn't going to answer anymore questions as she says \"Okay last test is a pop-quiz on what you learned today, to test your ability to take in information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head quickly as you don't want to let her see you hesitate now \"Great!\" Lola says with some enthusiasm as she asks you a few questions and gives you a few commands that lead to you getting a 62.3. Lola gives you a big smile and tells you \"Pretty good, you aren't the worst tiny I have ever seen.\". Which you just respond with giving a nervous chuckle as you say \"Uh...yeah...\" .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I do think that you could do better... But that is for the future. Right now we should get you ready.\" Lola says with a smile. Hearing this you respond by saying \"Ready? ...Ready for what?...\". Lola responds to you by saying \"Ready to get you to a place to sleep.\". Which you are a little confused to hear and say \"So, what am I sleeping in a cage in the lab...\" Which Lola giggles at and says \"No... no.. were not that cruel to just leave you alone in a lab to sleep in. Plus we use to do that and people as tiny as you escaped...\". You were now more confused and then asked \"So, am I going home with you then?...\". Which Lola again laughs at and says \"No I prefer not to take my work home with me... But you will be...\". Lola stops herself as she checks the time and then says \"Ugh! no time to explain...\". And with that she then reaches and picks you up into her grasp and then carries you out of the room. You don't know what to think at this point as you are carried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you do find out quickly as Lola says while dropping you into a strangers hand \"Listen Carly I got to go now and I didn't really fill him in yet. So,...\" Which the stranger who is holding who is Carly stops her and says \"Oh just go,... I swear you do this to me every time.\" You then see Lola smile and say thanks as she heads out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look at the woman who is holding you. So you her name is Carly and you see that she has long pink dyed hair, she is wearing a peach colored blouse and looks like jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looks down at you in her palm and says \"Here I'll explain while we do the process.\". She then dumps you into a sort of test tube with some kind of computer chip on the bottom and you see a wire from the computer hook into the test tube. Carly smiles as she punches in numbers on the computer and then she says \"Okay so lets start with do you know about your universities de-stress with a buddy each night program...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment and then say \"Yea I think so,... it's when students who want a pet to help take there mind off things but they don't have time to take care of one. So, for a day, week, night or whatever, a student can adopt a pet and then return it afterwards.\". To which she gives you a smile as she continues to quickly type and says \"Exactly, and more times then not the pet is rented for just the night as these students can't be responsible for taking care them for any longer usually.\" She laughs at her own comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still confused though on what she is leading to though as she then continues talking as she finishes typing \"...Okay with this push of the enter button the program will be all set for you. Now like I was saying before, so,... how do I say this... we provide the pets for the school and they believe you tiny people are just adorable hamsters.\". You still don't really understand and say \"..Wait how are tiny people mistook for hamster...\". In which Carly just smiles at you and says \"Well that is easier to just show you, then she pushes the enter button and in a flash lights appear around you. And you feel things being put on you, then the lights are gone as you hear Carly say \"Okay all done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly then holds a mirror up to you and you see that your in a hamster suit that your unable to get off. Carly smiles as you realize that fact and then says \"Okay so that hamster that is on you can only be taken off by this machine. Also that suit makes it so what ever you say is just a cute hamster squeak.\". You are about to reply back but stop as you hear the hamster squeak that she had said would only come out of you. You then look at her as she continues talking \"...okay this last part needs to be quick so, with you being so tiny and now stuck in that hamster which only lets you speak in hamster squeaks. You will be put into a box and placed on display for a student or professor to take home for the night. Then afterwards the student take you back to us and we get that suit off you.\". You don't really understand this process but it doesn't really matter as Carly puts you in a box and then carries it over to the crew who gives out the hamsters to rent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the crew leader takes the box and leads over to a shelf that is in the pet rental building. You freak out about being put on display and you can even hear the squeaking noise's as more boxes line up with other tiny people in them. The boxes all have small breathing holes and pictures of cute furry animals which is what the students think you look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you could manage to get out, you would probably be running away right now, being put on display like this is really embarrassing specially in a hamster suit that makes you look and speak like one. But you are to tiny to do anything to the box except sit and hope that no one picks up the box you are. But sadly it seems to only take about a few minutes before a student comes by and picks up the box you are inside of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake around the inside of the box as if an earthquake was happening, before the top of the box is finally opened to reveal the student's gigantic face above you, who would be taking you home for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Who do you see?)</span></div></div>",

You continued running underneath desks trying to get to the end of the class room so that you could go around the whole class and reach the door. As you were running, in the distance, you see a girl sitting at her desk.She had apparently removed her shoes, a pair of loafers. She had her loafers in front of her feet, while her feet were with the soles facing back, her toes touching the ground and the rest of her foot lifted. She was wearing a pair of long black socks. As you drew closer, you began to notice a foul smell. It smelled unmistakably of feet, and you knew it was her feet. The smell got worse and worse as you got closer and closer. You stopped, and wondered if you should get any closer, or go around her desk. Going around her desk would take more time, but you really didn't want to get any closer to those feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You decided it would be best to get it over with and just speed through. When you got really close to her feet, almost in front of them, you noticed just how gross they were. This was a hot girl in the class named Alina. You never knew her feet would stink like this though. The smell was so thick you felt like you were slowing down just inhaling the stench. It smelled of pure foot odor, and sweaty feet. You kept running full speed, hoping to get it over with as quick as possible. Just as you made it in front of her feet, in an instant, she kicked both her feet forward. At your size, the speed seemed almost impossible. The incredibly foul gust of air that her feet made knocked you down. Her feet came just barely centimeters within reach of you. You were knocked onto your ass, gathering your thoughts now, when you finally looked up. The smell almost made you throw up right then and there. It was incredibly raunchy and sour. It seemingly made you forget what fresh air smelled like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You looked up and saw something that you could only image would be a nightmare. Her feet were now situated in such a way that you could see the full soles. She had her feet propped up on her heels, as if to stretch the soles, and you were right in full view of these soles. Not only did the smell make you want to throw up, but the sight did as well. You could see in great detail her sweat stained socks. It looked like she had stepped in a puddle, but it was clearly all foot sweat. Her soggy socks seemed like they wanted to eat you alive, just waiting to catch you in their grasp. You immediately got up, and began to run again. Her feet were ready to move once again!</span></div></div>",

Never could you have imagined the disgusting-ness that awaited beneath her feet. Just as you got up to run, she brought her feet down on top of you, and dragged them back to a neutral angle with her legs. The event took place in an instant, but to you it seemed like forever, due to the incredible disgust of the situation. It almost seemed to happen in slow-motion for you. As you had started to run, her foot came down, and the space under her toes matched up perfectly with where your head was. As her foot came down, you felt the sock area of the space under her toes wrap around your head, like some kind of animal trap composed of stinky sweat stained sock. It proceeded to encompass your head completely until you felt the top of your head hit the underside of her toe. In that moment, your entire world was composed of stinky feet. Your head was essentially inside her sock for a moment, and you inhaled the atrocious odor that her foot gave off. It was the unmistakable scent of foot odor and sweaty feet, but magnified seemingly 100x over. At your size, you figured the smell must be stronger. Not only that, but you were cascaded in an incredible amount of foot sweat. It felt like somebody wrapped your head in a wet towel, except it was foot sweat not water, and your breaths inhaled foot stench, and it was a sweaty sock, not a towel. As the top of your head touched her toe, she, almost on queue, clenched her toes, sealing your head inside. With you firmly latched into her sock, her foot was dragged back to a neutral angle with her legs, her knee at 90 degrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this angle, is where her foot applied the most pressure. You were now completely encased under her sweat stained- sock clad, smelly foot. You tried to fight it off, but the smell alone was making you dizzy. You could only see darkness, but a little bit of light made it through from in between her toes. You could only see the shadows of your captors, her giant sweaty toes. Your head was under the area under her toes, but your entire body was stuck under her sole. You couldn't move an inch. She kept wiggling her toes, releasing a torrent of stench upon you, making you feel even more dizzy. You were stuck her for about 5 minutes, fighting to get your arms free from under her foot, so that maybe you could pull yourself free. During these 5 minutes, you were just marinating in her foot sweat. It was dripping onto your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally lifted her foot, but with great force. You were stuck to her foot, glued by just her foot sweat. She was swinging her feet up and down, but the foot sweat held you onto her sweaty black sock pretty well.

She just put in the front of her foot, the part where you were. Alina had no idea she was causing this type of cruel and usual torture, she was simply carelessly playing with her feet. Upon putting the front of her foot into the shoe, she began wiggling her toes pretty hard, causing you to come lose, and plummet down into her shoe. Unfortunately for you, you landed face first, and with a squishy bounce. You stood up immediately after getting a face full of insole infused foot sweat. You noticed your feet kind of sunk into the sweaty insole, and you looked up to see what could only be described as a deity, her giant foot, wiggling her toes as if to say, \"welcome to your new home.\" You noticed the smell somehow got even worse, and covering your nose didn't work not a single bit. If you breathed in through your mouth you could basically taste her foot. The air was incredibly damp, it was like breathing in a cloud....of pure foot sweat. You were presented with a couple problems. 1. Her foot blocked the exit. 2. Even if her foot wasn't there, you weren't sure you could climb out. Your ran to the end to try to climb out anyways, only to find that the sides were far too sweaty and slippery to climb out. You noticed at the heel that there was writing on the insole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt said, \"Incredi-sole! The insole that lasts forever! This insole can take whatever you throw at it. Have sweaty feet? No problem, incredi-sole will absorb it! Have dirty feet? No problem, incredib-sole will absorb the dirt! Incredi-sole is made to last forever, so you never have to buy new insoles! Incredi-sole can even absorb large physical objects!\" It was then that you noticed why your steps were heavier the more you stood in one spot, you really were sinking into her sweaty insole! Just then, you heard a loud voice, \"TIME!\" The test was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her begin to re-insert her foot into loafer. Out of instinct, you immediately tried to run away from her foot, but in the end it was a futile effort, where could you go? The shoe was like a prison. You made it to where the main area of her sole would rest, the ball of her foot, and where the most pressure would be applied. You tripped over the incredibly sweat-soaked insole, and landed on your back. Just in time to see her toes pass over-head and her foot land right on top of you. Normally, this would crush you, but unfortunately, her foot merely pressed you down into the spongey-insole, sealing you firmly into her sweaty shoe, under her sweaty raunchy foot. </span></div></div>",

Your face was pressed directly into her sole, so the sweat began to force it's way into your mouth, no matter how hard you tried to keep it closed. You couldn't budge an inch. Once again it seemed you were stuck into a pannini press of sweaty feet. She began walking back home, and after a few minutes you began to lose consciousness. The constant walking combined with the utter disgust of being trapped in her sweaty shoe, under her hot stinky foot, was taking its toll on you. In a few more minutes, you were out. Alina was still completely unaware of the being trapped under her sole. She just thought, \"wow, these incredi-soles were a great investment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke about an hour later, except her foot was now out of her shoe. You thought, \"Finally! My chance to escape!\" Just then you realized, you couldn't move any part of your body. It felt like you were trapped in cement. It seems the sole had sucked your entire body in to it's maximum depth, leaving only your face exposed a few inches above the surface. You began trying to thrash about, a useless effort, you couldn't even move a single toe. You then heard Alina's voice yelling, \"Hey Mom! I'm going out with friends, I'll be back later!\" She was about to put the shoe back on, but she looked at her feet. \"These socks are pretty gross.\" She peeled them off and wiggled her toes in the freedom. She took one sniff of her socks, \"Gross! These stink! It's a good thing nobody knows about my foot odor problem. These feet could kill an elephant! Thankfully, I have these special incredi-soles to suck it all up! It would really suck if someone ever ended up inside there, oh god, poor person. Haha, what am I saying, that's impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to stick her bare foot into the shoe. She slid her foot into the shoe, rubbing off a piece of toe-jam on your face along the way, finally resting her sole on your face. Your face was now pressed into her sweaty bare foot, and the smell was indescribable. You were now trapped, sealed into this ever lasting insole. You always hoped she would pick a different shoe, but nope, she picked those old sweaty loafers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hard as you tried to fight it, her foot sweat and toe-jam forced it's way into your mouth. her dead foot-skin got in there too. Unfortunately for you, that  was enough nutrition to keep you alive, and she always wore her shoes enough to provide your tiny body with that nutrition. You would be sealed into the insole until the day you died. Incredi-soles had an insole recycling program, insoles that were thrown away were simply placed into another shoe. You were a woman's insole, so even if Alina did throw you away, you would just be placed in another woman's shoe, trapped under her stinky foot! Sucks to be you.</span></div></div>",

And as she put her loafer on she thought for a moment that she felt something in her loafer and she began to slide her foot half way in and out of her loafer, which caused you to roll to the toe section of her loafer. And at the moment you were there, she had decided to just ignore the feeling as she put her foot fully back into her loafer. Causing you to be right underneath her gigantic toes. There was no where left to go, you were now trapped in her loafer in till Alina took them off. You thought this as she now has the shoe on. She then continues to work through her exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you spend the next couple of hours laying there on your back being trapped in her loafer. During this time the smell absolutely awful and you could never really get use to it. Especially when Alina started moving her toe's inside her loafer. And you weren't sure if she felt you or not. But her toes while scrunching back and forth, grabbed you. And it was if her toes were just playing with you as she scrunch her toes back forth with you now between them. And she did it without realizing it, which made it all the more worse to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours past like this as you couldn't really move your arms or legs, but you could definitely feel every movement she made and could even hear every step she took as the shoe squished you around. The whole experience wasn't very fun for you as you felt the humidity and then there's that awful smell, which just wouldn't go away. It smelled like sweat and feet and stuff that shouldn't be in a human being. You actually felt like you was going to be sick. And if you knew where she was at now you would probably feel more sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina enters the school's girl locker room for a daily gym session. She sat down to change her shoes. And she didn't realize that right under where her massive foot, stuck to her toes by her sweat was, that little tiny you was squashed between her big toes. Gong through some of the worst smell's ever imaginable, (Which if you can ignore the fact that you were just up close with her gigantic foot, you would be able to smell that she smelled like flowers and lemons.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her giant foot and somehow you were taken with her foot. Unknowingly by her into her gym sneaker. The smell got ten times worse in here being trapped in her sneaker. You couldn't really move around much, but you could definitely hear every step as you were now being enclosed within the sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina walked her way out of the locker room and went right away over to the track field. The smell was really bad as you could smell not just her feet, but sweat and a mixture of other bodily secretions that she leaked onto the sneaker while she walked. You covering your nose and mouth with your little hands as you were now completely enclosed within the sneaker. You couldn't escape anymore as the stench was already making you feel sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a moment as she got to the field and began stretching. Her movements were became fully aware to you as she began doing some jumping jacks.  The smell was starting to become overwhelming to you. If she only knew how bad you smelled right now. But sadly she had no clue the kind of torture that she was putting you through as she stepped onto the track field and began her run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran the length of the track and back, not stopping for a moment. You have no idea how much distance she covered in that time. And though you couldn't see anything but her foot in the sneaker, as she ran her sweat poured down on you like rain. The smell was awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes having enduring this, Alina finally finished her run and had now returned to the locker room. At this point you were really upset. You didn't want to do this anymore and you were hoping that an opportunity came when she takes off her sneaker that you can get out and run as far away as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seam's you just have no luck today as Alina reaches her locker and takes out her loafer's. She removes her gym sneakers and again her toe's unknowingly take you with them back into her loafer as she begins to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you are enclosed within her loafer with her foot. You hate that familiar smell and when she puts her shoe fully on. She unknowingly has her toes play with your tiny body as she walks out the girls locker room and heads towards the parking garage where her car is at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks, you are still being played within the shoe by her gigantic toes. You are sort of upside down right now and you can only just stare at the squishy insole below you. You don't know how she doesn't notice you. But you assume that you must just be to tiny for her to be aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens the door to her car and climbs in. You can hear the sound a loud noise as Alina slams her car door shut and she gets it in gear and drives off. You endure being in her loafer, under her foot, covered in sweat for the 20 minute car ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls into her garage and then leaves her car. You are use to by now feeling her every step as she walks inside her house. Her family is the type that take there shoe's off at the doorway. So, you finally see light as this time your not stuck to her foot as Alina sits down to remove her loafer. And as her foot was leaving her loafer, she had a strange feeling. She didn't really think about it before. But with you now dislodge from her foot she thought that her foot felt a little different. She was still completely unaware to the fact that you are tiny, stuck in her loafer all day, and still in her loafer. But she swore that she felt some kind of pebble or something earlier on her foot that she wasn't really curious about till now.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Does Alina investigate and see you in her loafer?)</span></div></div>",

She is met with her familiar hideous smell that is much more bearable to her. And as she looks into her loafer you are just laying in there unsure of what is going on in till you hear \"<span class=\"cgrape\">The hell?</span>\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich her voice alone makes you look up to see Alina's gigantic face peering into to her loafer as she looks directly at you in her loafer. You watch as her face looks like it's either disgusted or annoyed. As you her say \"<span class=\"cgrape\">How did you get in here?</span>\". You then watch as her gigantic hand enters her loafer and reaches in and picks you up easily into her grasp. You could do nothing as your tiny size is easily out matched by her single hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swings your tiny body out of her loafer. And with you in her grasp she brings you up to her face. At first she thought you were some kind of tiny bug that she wanted to look at before crushing it for being in her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she looks at you a bit closer, she notices right away that you don't look like a bug. And though she has never talked to you in class before she actually recognize you as a boy from her class. Which is something you realize quickly as you hear her say with an annoyed tone \"<span class=\"cgrape\">What the hell are you?</span>\" She says. Which you tried to come up with something to say, but you assume you weren't quick enough to answer as you her say \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Wait a second?, I think know you from somewhere Hmmmm... Yea... you are a guy from one my classes!.. Why are you so small? And Why were you in my loafer?...</span>\" She continues to question you, but you are pretty much speechless at this point as you try to come up with something to say. But again your not fast enough to say anything as Alina's tone turns from annoyed to frustrated as she begins to jump to conclusion's \"<span class=\"cgrape\">...Wait a second did you shrink yourself?...Do you have some wearied foot fetish?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you heard her say that you instantly blurt out \"No... no... I didn't shrink myself... and I don't have...\". Alina cut's you off by saying in an agitated tone \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Oh now you want say something?.. So, if that's not true then explain to me how your so small and in my shoe??..</span>\". Hearing that you didn't know what believable thing you could say, so you tried telling her that you have no idea how you shrunk and while trying to get her attention you ended up in her loafer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich after hearing yourself say this you think that it sounds clearly not believable even though it's true. And she of course doesn't believe you as she started jumping to more conclusions, with saying sarcastically \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Oh Yea,... I bet that's it...</span>\" She then switches her tone back to frustration as she says \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I bet I got it right that you are some foot freak wanting to experience the inside of my loafer.</span>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably one of the dumbest things you have ever done was starting to argue with this girl. While arguing with her you made the mistake to try and explain your situation, which only lead her to believe you are even dumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she then decided to just end this little argument with saying \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well, you can cut the act already and just face the truth that you got caught. I don't need to sit here talking to some insignificant little foot freak. So, tell me was the experience everything you imaged it to be. Living out your little fantasy underneath my feet..</span>\". Hearing this you are frustrated and again try convincing her that you didn't shrink yourself and your not into feet by saying \"No way,... the whole experience was awful and I hated smelling your stinky feet and being put through that intense humidity. ...And also like I said before I'm not into feet and....\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she has already made her conclusion's about you so she just ignored the last part of what you said as she says to you \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Wow I guess for once you tell the truth, I bet the experience wasn't all you thought it was going to be and instead you found out that being in a woman's shoe isn't pleasant at all...</span>\" She continues talking and it becomes apparent to you that she clearly still thinks you shrunk yourself and are trying to live out some dumb fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after listening to her basically tell you that you got what you deserve you hear her say \"<span class=\"cgrape\">...Now like I said I don't want to sit here talking to some tiny little foot freak all day so, I guess the question is now, what do I do with you now?...</span>\".</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What does Alina decide to do with you?)</span></div></div>",

Not the first thing he expected to hear to be honest.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I mean... You have to be, right? Dude, even I know my feet are absolutely vile. No way I'd get near me if I wasn't, well... Me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really was no way to respond to that, was there?<br>\r\nNo... Evidently not, because the girl began to speak again.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Can you speak? I need some sorta confirmation.

There were a few games consoles around as well as a box of makeup and an air freshener which seemed to be working decently well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she returned with a bowl filled with warm water and a towel.<br>\r\n\"Listen, this is gonna be awkward for both of us, but you've gotta take your clothes off since surprisingly enough I haven't come prepared with a convenient childhood dollhouse or anything with spare clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice.

The girl leans back a bit in her chair, apparently a bit tired of the upright position she'd been in since the exam began. You find it easier to scurry up now that you have an edge.

You live on in agony for a second longer, before at last your head is crushed as well under the fingers of the fit girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi sighs and opens her left hand again, having already procured a tissue from her pocket with her right hand.

You're surprised you'd slept so long, but the mini watch in the pencil case was probably the right time. You guess that Naomi didn't want to wake you so she didn't move you from the pencil case. As you wipe the sleep from your eyes, you wonder where your friend is exactly. After rummaging through the pencil case to the edge, you peek out. Apparently this is Naomi's bedroom, by the look of it. You finally spot the girl at a desk, looking at something intently on the computer. She sin't aware of you since her eyes have been glued to the screen since you're awakening. You don't want to seem like you need everything one for you, so you strike off on your own to get to her. Calling out for a ride would have made you look pathetic, you decide. With one motion you slide down the side of the case and planet your feet on the desk. You're at the far left side of it, away from Naomi who is on the far right. A quick run would let you reach her in just a minute or so. After a few seconds before returning to full consciousness you run, feet almost sliding on the waxed wood surface. By the time you reach the girl, she's put her hand down on the lip of the desk, still watching the monitor intently. You hear her murmur in distress at something on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to waste, you search for a means of getting Naomi's attention to you and not the screen. After all, she's supposed to be taking care of you, even if you don't want to be helped in every way. There's a lot of ways you could be potentially noticed, but which way would be safest? You need to rationalize, sleep's fog almost completely receded. You break off from your usual pace and shift to a trot, stopping at last in front of Naomi's cascading hair which ended at the desk's surface. That could be an entry point, you surmise. Climbing the hairs would be no different than climbing a vine at your stature. There was also the choice of making contact with the girl's hand which is to the side of you, motionless. A third option of yelling was rejected, as she wouldn't hear you. But possibly... Naomi is far too engrossed with the computer. Lastly an option of jumping to Naomi's waist to start a climb presents itself.</span></div></div>",

When you arrive at her hand, you take a moment of observation. Her soft, tanned fingers were spread out on the desk, plenty of room for you to hit them. The hair almost got in your way but you were able to land a good hit on her pinky finger. It moves slightly, as if feeling the shock of an itch. You knew you might need to put more force, so you jump on it, slamming down on it, feet first. That did it. Naomi's reacts instinctively, ripping back her finger towards herself. You fall on your ass, slightly bruised but OK. Naomi looks down to the source of her feeling, and doesn't see you. You're not letting her get away with that. You run back to where you were and jump up and down, waving, making a fool of yourself but not wanting this opportunity to slip past you. </span></div></div>",

Curious, you glance at what Naomi had been so engrossed in before on the monitor.Before you can get a good look, Naomi switches the tab to MySpace, without a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't seen much, but an image of a shrunken man about to be stepped on burned in your mind. A horrible truth sunk in just then. She was playing you, all this time. Naomi had a fantasy of being in control of a small man.

You relinquish your grasp on the collar of Naomi's mauve t-shirt, and start to slowly back away from her smooth, lanky neckline.  A silken rain of straight blond brushes against your back after five retracting steps.  With a quick pivot, you are faced with countless poles of lengthy pliability cascading over either side of her relatively slim left shoulder.  You grab a lone strand, its tip amongst the many stretching down to the varnished oaken desk surface, with both hands, its softness caressing your sweaty palms.  Before you can start your hasty rappel, however, your friend speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think any of us expected Lauren to even talk to Matt again, let alone add him as a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou release the hair as you turn around, a quizzical look written into your face. Twisting your neck, you look back at the glowing flat-screen monitor.  The bright pink background contrasts the midnight blue text quite nicely, and it is littered with pictures of a cute brunet you recognize to be your friend Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naomi?\"  You meant for your voice to be stern.  You really did.  However, your words came out as a pathetic whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath your feet shifts slightly, but you manage to keep your balance.  Naomi's flattened hand breaks the magenta horizon, eliciting a shrill squeal from your vocal cords.  A forlorn sigh escapes Naomi's opulent red lips.  The back of her hand touches down at the base of her shoulder, leaving five interlocked prodigious digits waiting before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\"  Naomi trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moments hesitation, you advance toward the massive fingers.  You step onto the tip of her middle finger and begin to trek toward the center of its adjoining palm, your sneaker-clad feet sinking into malleable flesh along the way.  Upon reaching your intended destination, Naomi pulls away her hand with exaggerated cautiousness.  Tired, baggy eyes focus solely on your tiny form as you find yourself presented in front of her dejected mien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll tell you what I was looking at.\"  Naomi gives in, her sweet voice surrounding you.  \"But, before I do, I want you to know two things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head bobs in acknowledgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of determination spreads across Naomi's pretty face.  \"First, when I told you that I would do whatever it takes to get you big again, I meant it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you, Naomi.\"  You speak with a little confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"  Naomi's facial features soften a bit.  \"Second, I'm not a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  you ask with genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi bites her lower lip with sparkling incisors almost as tall as you.  \"Ever since I was little, I've had this dream.  A fantasy, really.  I've always wanted to have somebody really small, like as small as you are, under my control.  I could do whatever I wanted with them, like a little toy.\"  A coy smirk crossed her rose-glazed lips as her brilliant aqua irises floated dreamily to the top of their sockets.  A few seconds later, she comes back to earth, her visage now one of worry.  \"Oh, but I would never...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that what you were looking at?\"  You quaver an interruption.  \"Motivation?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour living platform elevates diagonally, putting your tiny body before the tip of Naomi's cutely rounded nose.  Subsequently, her voice loses some of its volume whilst traversing through skin and bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.  I admit, my mind has been going wild since I found you next to my pencil.  There's no way a passed that exam, by the way; I just couldn't concentrate.  Anyway, I've been praying about this ever since we got back to my apartment.  You know, about whether or not it was okay to...play with you, with your permission of course!  I was too excited to sleep, so I kept checking up on you.  You were so cute, sleeping there in my case this whole time, your little head laying on top of my eraser.  And that's when I had my answer.  I knew I couldn't bring you into my weird fantasies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm cute?\"  Your question carried a unique mixture of ego and indignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Naomi answers.  \"I just thought about how tired you must have been, and how hard everything must be for you now.  Not only that, but I wouldn't be able to live with myself if something bad accidentally happened to you while I was playing.  Besides, I was afraid to tell you about my fantasy.  You might think I'm a freak, or worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A monster.\"  You blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Naomi replies sadly.  \"So, since I wasn't going to include you in my fetish, I had to find another way to get these thoughts out of my system.  I started looking for stuff on the internet, and I've been at it for a couple of hours now.  Nothing's working, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room falls quiet for several minutes.  Naomi lowers her gaze to the floor, her comparatively petite, sloping forehead inclining in front of you.  Several renegade follicles of her hair stream onto your fleshly expanse, bathing you in the soft luminescence of the room's lighting as it reflects off of the golden ropes.  Finally, your enormous friend breaks the dead air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you scared of me?  Am I a monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start formulating a response, unsure of what to say, when you feel a giddiness build up inside you.  Soon, you are laughing uncontrollably, and your side begins to hurt.  Naomi raises her head to its original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\"  Her query purely analytical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just realized something.\"  You rejoinder.  \"This is perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk across the breast of Naomi's palm, the bounce in your step amplified by the trampoline-like surface underneath you.  You come to the gigantic monolith that is her nose, and put your hand on it, the cartillage contorting to your puny fingers.  You lean your weight into the straightened arm attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I have the same dream you have, except the other way around, of course.  While I have to say actually being tiny is a LOT scarier than I envisioned beforehand, I've been very comfortable around you at this size.  Well, up until I thought you were going to step on me, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour support swiftly departs, and you fall where it once was.  The top phalange of Naomi's index finger catches you, replacing the great edifice.  Gently, it pushes you away from the edge of her hand.  You peer up at Naomi's countenance, her eyes glistening with joy and her mouth revealing a joyous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a sign.\"  Naomi declares.  \"I was going to let this go, and now I find out we share the same fetish?!  This was meant to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in agreement.  \"So, where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's entirely up to you, little buddy.\"  Naomi retorts.  \"Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.  I'm just happy holding you in my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciate the sentiment, but Naomi always was a bad liar.  It's obvious there is so much she wants to do, and you trust her implicitly.  Should you selfishly fulfill your own fantasies, or allow your kind, generous friend, whom you already owe so much, to live out her dreams?</span></div></div>",

Exceedingly ironic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDucking your head as you run for aerodynamic purposes you try to avoid the sweeping foot passing by you, and eventually just drop to the ground, landing in a push up position to avoid being decapitated by Jessica's swinging bare foot. After hitting the ground you involuntarily begin to roll, sliding to a halt as you hit her discarded, empty sandal, which sends a vibration through your whole body. Ouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the shadow overhead comes full circle as she moves her other foot up to keep up with its twin. Just one pace from the gigantic girl had been a harrowing struggle for you to survive, and had taken place in a matter of seconds. Funny, it had seemed like an eternity. With the immediate threat out of the way, you get up and run after her, literally right by her heels for the first part. Where was the giantess going anyway?</span></div></div>",

It was about time you actually attempted to make contact, and now was as good a time as any at this point.

At first you're not alarmed, in a unique sense of apathy. But as the sound becomes unbearable and she doesn't appear to be stopping you run for cover.

The impact knocks you down, and you barely recover as you put out your palms to break your fall. Big mistake, that's the worst thing you could have done. It hurts, but you have other problems. The sound of a fallen exam paper drifts down toward you, and the next thing you know the thick sheets of white paper are laying face down right by your sneaker. It could only be Jess's test.

However, my friend went really ill during the exam and had to go to the toilets in a hurry if you understand what I mean. I offered to get his bag for him, since he won't be able to get it himself any time soon.\" Jessica says. You don't hear the man reply but you assume that he nodded to her, since Jess is quickly walking over to your lone bag at the wall and opens it up, seemingly checking whether your things are all there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is taking so long?\" the man asks, his tone a bit tense. Maybe there is something more to this room than the simple exam season ban? Jess keeps her cool and replies:\"His writing utensils should still be on one of the desks. Can you help me search for them?\" Her voice is quite sweet and you can hear the man sigh, before he sets off into the middle of the room to get this over with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Jessica walks over to the location she set you down, not far away from your current position, and drops your bag on the ground, before continuing to pretend to look for your stuff on the surrounding desks. Silently congratulating her on the quick thinking, you run between her feet towards the open bag. She doesn't look down, but keeps her feet still, obviously hoping that you are not too far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I found them,\" the man calls across the room. You can hear Jessica's answer while you climb into the bag:\"Thank you so much. I have to apologize for at first thinking that you would sooner throw me out of the room without the bag than actually helping me search for my friend's stuff. I am relieved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to apologize, young lady. The reputation for strictness that our educators have is well earned and can be intimidating. I wish your friend a quick recovery and better luck on the make up exam.\" You hear Jess walk over a few steps, you can't see her anymore because you dropped to the bottom of your bag during the hasty climb. Soon Jessica's hand slowly descends into the bag, your writing utensils in her grip. You have enough time to get out of the way before she drops them next to you, proceeding to close the bag afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wishing the man a good day and leaving the room, Jessica walks for a bit. The pens roll into you from time to time, a rather unpleasant experience. You realize that other students might recognize your bag and question Jess about it, which is why she would want to go to a more secluded area first. Where does she bring you?</span></div></div>",

You will just reset the situation and make a plan about how to best go about it again, you think to yourself. In the vast heights above you, the conversation between the two giantesses continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please leave me to my exam, miss. I think I can deal with a little bug myself, thank you very much.\", Jess says with an annoyed tone, her patience with the distraction obviously coming to an end on this tense exam-day. <br>\r\nAfter putting the exam back on her desk, the petite girl considers the small creature running across the ground at her feet. For a moment she had thought that it looked somewhat human-like, but she discards that crazy notion now. After all, the bug behaves exactly like she would expect a bug to behave: It is running away after being startled, straight away from the perceived danger, with seemingly no awareness about how easy it is for her or the invigilator to keep track of it. With her opinion set, Jess's eyes harden and a look of disgust appears on her face, as she imagines this bug crawling over her bare feet during the exam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still running, mere seconds having passed, the potential meaning of the booming dialogue slowly becoming apparent to you. Well, this doesn't have to mean that Jess will kill you, you reassure yourself. While it didn't seem like she recognized you, it seems likely that she wouldn't be bothered by your presence, right? That must be what she meant. <br>\r\nYou have made half of the distance now and you can hear and feel how the invigilator leaves, Jess's reprimand seemingly having proven quite effective. You slow down from a mad sprint to a jog, to a halt. It seems like the danger has passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to see whether Jess is focusing on her exam by now and end up looking right into her eyes, two green orbs in the sky, illuminated by the light of the lamps on the ceiling, while you are standing in the shadow of the desk. Your heart skips a beat as you behold her expression. She doesn't look happy. In fact, where you hoped to find indifference or even a hint of recognition, there is only disgust and annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body starts shaking with fear, the disapproving gaze of your godlike crush overwhelming your mental fortitude like a storm would a blade of grass. She raises her left foot and moves it in your direction, the movement appearing unnaturally slow and fluid to you, as if the room was under water. You crumble to your knees, knowing yourself to be at the complete mercy of the cute girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess considers briefly to just squish the bug under her bare foot but decides against it, not seeing the need to dirty her sole with its juices or finding out whether it is capable of stinging or not. Instead, she stretches her leg further, in order to fish for her left sandal with her foot. As she moves her foot, she notices that the bug has stopped running and is playing dead again, instead. Jess cannot help but smile a bit, amused by the predictable behaviour of the simple minded creature. After a moment of searching blindly with her toes, she finds her sandal and slides her foot into it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you began to hope against all hope that Jess had recognized you after all. She was smiling down at you and as her foot went past you, you found the strength to stand up again, a puzzled look on your face as you try to decipher Jess's expression. Her smile doesn't seem reassuring, but rather amused. Is she enjoying this? Is there something that you are missing? <br>\r\nThen, her foot moves back above you, wearing her sandal this time, and your hope dies as you realize what just happened. You turn around and run as fast as you can, your instincts driving you forward, despite knowing in the back of your mind that it will amount to nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess doesn't immediately kill the bug after it started running, rather watching it for a moment longer, still amused by its behaviour. Then, remembering her exam, she places the heel of her sandal on the ground behind the desperately scuttling creature, waiting for it to run a bit further, before casually lowering the rest of her foot, catching the miserable thing squarely under the ball of her foot. The cute girl presses down on the small intruder and, after feeling a satisfying pop, twists her foot a few times to make sure the nasty insect doesn't survive. With that annoyance out of the way, Jess can now finally focus on her second exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the impact of the heel behind you and can't help but look over your shoulder, at your waiting demise. Tears stream down your face, your mind in utter chaos, as humans are not made to be hunted by gods. You can see Jess's face past the sole of her sandal. She looks almost fascinated, with a wry smile tucking at the corners of her mouth, as if this was somehow amusing to her. The area around you darkens, the descending foot blocking out the light. You scream in fear and panic, then the sandal hits you, slamming your small, defenseless body against the cold hard floor. Your end comes quickly, as your crush crushes you mercilessly, and you are spared the torture of experiencing the twists that come soon afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess doesn't bother to scrape your mangled corpse off her shoe, but after exam your remains quickly merge with the ground that Jess treads on, on her way home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having already witnessed how easily even Jessica's casual stride outpaces you, and given that you feel to injured to attempt climbing, it seems like the only hope that you have left lies with the great sandal in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you can not help feeling a bit pessimistic about your chances. You already tried getting Jessica's attention by tickling her toes, even managed to get on her desk for a moment - but even then your crush mistook you for a bug. Now, your options are much more limited than before. If you don't somehow cling to one of the giantesses around you when they leave this room, you might even starve or dehydrate to death on the cold and hard floor of this room. Your only chance is to hitch a ride and wait for a better opportunity to contact one of your godlike fellow students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now standing in the toe area of the sandal, considering how best to proceed while keeping a wary eye on Jessica's dainty feet swinging around close by. As you see it, there are three options. <br>\r\n1. You could climb the strip that is meant to separate the big toe from the other toes. It is connected to a few other strips, forming a bit of a roof for the sandal and a hole through which Jess will slide her foot to put the sandal on. This option might be safest, because if Jess just slips on her sandals, you will already be on top of her foot, maybe even able to secure yourself somewhat properly before she starts walking. <br>\r\n2. You could stay here, at the tip of the sandal. This way, you can try to recover from your injuries a bit and don't need to make the difficult climb up the strip. When her toes come for this area, you just need to climb over them, which should prove much easier than scaling the strip right now... assuming things go as planned.<br>\r\n3. You could look for another pair of shoes to climb. Honestly, sandals are very much on the dangerous side for what you are trying to accomplish and hitching a hike on sneakers of flats seems a lot easier, once you have successfully scaled them. Also, your experience with Jess has been very dangerous so far, although you trust her to help you once you can make her aware of what you are. On the flip side, making the journey to another pair of feet would be quite difficult in your current condition and you don't really see a pair of shoes that looks trustworthy in the vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look at the strip that is rising into the air with a slight angle in front of you with a grim expression. This climb will be very difficult because of your injuries, Jessica's casual swipe having left you more battered than a fierce brawl would have. Nevertheless you know you must go on in this way, if you want to survive. You considered staying at the tip of the sandal but you know that there would only be a small chance that Jess would allow you to get into a secure position before starting to walk. You'd rather take your fate into your own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a panoramic view of Jessica's dainty feet in the distance, swinging back and forth, you get to work. The material that the strip is made of is black and leathery, although you can not be sure what it is exactly. It is very hard to your touch, barely giving in, and has some kind of pattern worked into it. More importantly, there is a seam in front of you, joining a patch of the material together in such a way as to allow it to function as a kind of sheath to the thinner strip within. This is likely supposed to make this section more durable, so that it won't be worn down by the constant movements of the toes. The more you know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing able to grab onto the thread of the seam, you make slow and steady progress, biting your teeth together from the pain, fighting your way through the suffering with pure determination. You will live. Once your focus is completely resting on base survival, you can endure even hardships such as this climb, a feat you would never have trusted yourself to accomplish in this condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"sheath\" stops but now the angle is good enough to allow you to crawl upwards, the friction of your clothing and the material enough to ensure your continued ascent.<br>\r\nFinally you reach your goal, one of the small metal rings decorating the strip you are on. It is large enough for you curl up inside of it, if you wanted to and is light enough for you to lift it a bit and slip your legs underneath, serving as something akin to a seat-belt. You try it out but it is a bit heavy on your legs, so you decide to wait until you need to do it. Now you rest while you can, glad to be able to enjoy the view on Jessica's delicate feet from your hard-earned seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long until Jess suddenly puts both feet on the ground next to each other, before pushing the titanic chair back and leaving, still barefoot like last time. So far so good, she must be handing in her final exam. You wait until she returns, nervously watching her every movement. She sits down again and positions her feet at the side of the chair, dropping her bag that she took from the front of the room on the ground in front of her feet. Upon quickly considering whether it would have been smarter to wait for her to bring the bag, to then climb into it, you quickly get to the conclusion that it is likely that you wouldn't have had sufficient time. No. The strategy you decided on has to be the best. You can hear her moving things on the desk and soon she grabs her bag from the ground and moves it on her lap, quickly stowing away her writing utensils. She puts the bag back down and turns in your direction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour put your legs beneath the metal ring. You are ready. You imagine that any moment now, Jessica's dainty left foot will slide into the sandal beneath you, bringing you to relative safety first and then eventually ultimate rescue. Then, one of her giant feet slam into the ground not far from you, startling you. Slam. Her other foot just did the same, to your left this time. With rising dread you realize what is going on: Jessica didn't want to bother looking under the desk. She is searching for her sandals with her feet! Her pretty feet tap on the ground in quick succession, closing in on your position unti-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of Jessica's left foot smashes into you, slamming both you and the strip you were sitting on down on the insole of the sandal without mercy or care, as the delicate strips are bent and flattened under the weight of the petite girl's foot. <br>\r\nUnder severe shock, you realize that you yet live, since, sitting with outstretched legs, Jessica is only applying a small fraction of her weight to the shoe. The metal ring isn't very thick so it doesn't block any significant weight from resting on you, however, and you are smothered under the girl's sole, unable to move, to breathe or to scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can not feel your legs and realize what happened. Since your hip was beneath the metal ring when the titanic foot came down, your pelvic bones were shattered, rendering your legs useless. As you lie in the darkness beneath your crush's sole, you feel small, defenseless and deathly afraid. You can not breathe, so you don't experience the smell, but her skin is hot and dry. Through her skin, you can feel her toes wiggle, as if in celebration. You weakly struggle against the pretty foot resting on top of you. You know your efforts are futile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the collision, ten seconds might have passed. Perhaps it took Jessica longer to find the other sandal? It doesn't matter anymore to you. When the cute girl starts to drag her sandals back towards her chair, to properly put them on, the weight resting on you increases. The movement is somewhat slow and deliberate, and you can feel how her heel slowly rises upwards, while more and more weight is put on the ball of her foot and therefore on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly your struggles cease, the foot on top of you slowly crushing you to death with increasing force. You were so sure to have chosen a good strategy. You struggled desperately in order to increase your chances of survival, of being found and rescued. It was to no avail, all of it, your hopes and dreams beneath your godlike crush's notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pretty girl carelessly squeezes the blood from your body, transforming you into a stain beneath the ball of her foot, you only wish you could have seen her face one last time. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon deciding to stay where you are, you rest a bit, keeping your eyes on Jessica's feet at all times. Jess is sitting with crossed legs again and you observe her switching the positions of her legs every once in a while, one foot swinging back and forth or moving in a circular manner while the other foot is resting on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sandal you are sitting on has been discarded some distance away so you feel relatively safe even watching the foot on the ground move around from time to time. Although you are aware of the danger, you can not help but feel in awe and a bit turned on at the sight of Jess's giant feet in front of you. Sometimes she raises the stationary foot on its heel, giving you a good look at the slightly dirty sole. You vividly remember being caught under her big toe and are glad to have escaped alive and relatively unscathed. You watch as the giant girl in front of you scrunches her toes. You gulp. Being caught between her toes when she does this would surely lead to a terrifying death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait there, watching your crush's feet and going over your plan again, you wonder what will happen after you managed to find a secure \"riding position\", trying not to think too much about what might happen if you don't. Depending on how stressed Jess feels, she will either go home to relax alone or celebrate with other students in a pub or something similar. You can only hope that she will go home as you can't imagine the situation in a pub to be any better for you than this exam. Now, even at Jess's apartment, getting her attention won't be easy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jessica puts both her feet on the ground, interrupting your thoughts and startling you. Then, the titanic chair is pushed backwards and the girl stands up, before quickly walking to the front of the room again. She must be handing in her exam! There isn't much that you can do in ways of preparation, but you stand up warily. You wince with pain and are glad to have rested for a while. As far as you can tell, half of your body will have turned blue tomorrow from the damage that Jess inflicted when casually flicking you away from her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess comes back. She sits down again, her feet to the side of the chair, as she collects her writing utensils from the table and puts them in her bag. After she is done, the big moment for you has come. The cute girl reaches for her vacated sandals with her feet, not bothering to look under the table to ascertain their position beforehand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are terrified as you watch Jess's dainty yet colossal feet feel around for their sandals, tapping around on the ground left and right of you in the hope of hitting a sandal. She quickly locates them and her left foot smashes on the sandal barely a few centimeters in front of you, carelessly pushing the delicate strips down on the insole. Your eyes almost bulge out at the thought that you considered climbing on top of the strips the safest option and just stayed down here because you wanted to recuperate. The toes that you admired from afar many times now rise and stretch out, before wiggling rapidly a few times, as if they were happy to have found the shoe (or to see you, who knows). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can decide whether to attempt to climb them now, Jessica drags her sandals backwards towards the chair, almost throwing you off with the sudden yank. In the process, her heels rise because of the angle until only her toes and the balls of her feet push into the strips. The giantess bends down and her beautiful face comes into view. Her expression is indifferent, almost serene, as she raises her right foot a bit and grabs the strips with her hand, allowing her foot to then easily slide into the sandal... You shake yourself, having watched that process as if inside a trance. You need to focus! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's attention shifts to her left sandal. You had not anticipated this turn of events but there are a few more things to consider now and you need to decide as quickly as possible. She will likely not spot you on the sandal if you stay still, but climbing her toes might alert her to your presence. Or, you reason, this might be the perfect opportunity to make her notice you, with her eyes already looking in your direction. What will you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to try to stick to your original plan. Every action you can take at the moment is very risky, but climbing over her toes towards the strip on top of the foot seems like a good choice for two reasons: 1. If she doesn't really look in your direction, you will be in the safest position you could have reached. 2. Even if she spots you, there is a chance that she will recognize your bipedal form instead of mistaking you for a bug (again).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait anxiously while the foot in front of you is raised and her hands reach down to lift the strips. You are standing right at the tip of the sandal, making it more difficult for Jess to spot you, should she look at your position. You hesitantly look up into her face, only to see that she isn't even watching her foot anymore! The process of putting on her sandals must be quite the routine for her by now, especially considering how often she takes them off during the day, you reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow her foot is moving through the opening in the strips and sliding towards you on the sandal, the approach of its colossal frame making your knees weak. You take a deep breath and ready yourself to sprint towards her toes. They are slightly raised while the foot is moving into position, so you need to wait for a moment longer. The stress of it all is really getting to you, but finally the toes settle and you dash forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly scramble on top of her middle toe and then run towards the big strip to your left. Multiple small black metal rings decorate this main strip and you throw yourself on top of it, grabbing one of them. Not a second too early.<br>\r\nHaving felt something crawling on her foot, Jess instinctively gives her left foot a quick, violent shake. You hold on to the metal ring for dear life and manage to not be thrown off. For a moment you thought that your arms might come out of their sockets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown, the young woman looks down at her foot to identify the cause of the sensation. At this moment, your decision to wear dark jeans and a black t-shirt this morning probably saves your life, as the giantess doesn't spot you on the surface of the dark strip. Since the sensation was relatively minor, Jessica is uncertain whether it might have been a random itch and doesn't pay any further attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, you barely have enough time to get into a secure position, using one of the smaller metal rings like a seat belt, before the crazy journey starts. Jess swiftly walks out of the exam hall, likely wanting to leave the dreaded place behind her as soon as possible. To you, this experience is like an extreme roller coaster ride, as you are fully subjected to the g-forces with every step the titanic girl takes. You manage to hold on, glad to be able to use the metal ring to assist you, but with all the air blowing in your face, it is hard to orient yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Jessica stops for a moment, giving you some much needed respite. Now that you are able to perceive your surroundings somewhat more clearly, you can tell where Jess is headed. Where?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You recall that Jess is living alone, after having made a few bad experiences with living in a commune, or so you heard from a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Jessica starts walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea how dangerous it will be for you when Jess is driving her car, but you don't really have the option to safely get off her shoe right now, either way.<br>\r\nWhenever the giantess takes a step with her left foot, you feel like you are sitting on an accelerating rocket as the air is pushing against you and your stomach sinks. Then, abruptly, the foot comes to a halt, the sandal smashing into the pavement, while only the ring you are holding onto is keeping you from being thrown forward. After a short pause, during which you can see the other foot fly past you, the area you are sitting on is tilted forward, as first Jess's heel and then the rest of her foot leave the ground for the next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes again and try not to throw up, although it is becoming increasingly difficult with the whirling world around you not giving another moment of pause or peace. <br>\r\nFinally Jessica reaches her car, an old Ford Fiesta, and you can watch her open the door before throwing her bag on the passenger seat and entering, then closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting bang is almost deafening, even through your hands on your ears, and you congratulate yourself on your quick thinking. Although your surrounding are quite dark, it is clear where you are as you look at the three pedals in front of you, the wear on them signaling the age of the car. You look up and although you can't see past your fellow student's knees, you hear her sighing contentedly. The toes in front of you wiggle while her right hand comes into view with the car keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the moment of your next decision, you realize. You can jump off her foot now and, while Jess is driving, climb up the passenger seat to get to her bag. You don't know how long either the climb or the drive might take but you assume that Jess wouldn't be wasting gasoline if she was living in the vicinity, which should leave you with enough time to scale the seat, even if you are slowed down by your injuries.<br>\r\nThe other option is, of course, to remain in your relatively safe and secure position and hope that nothing bad happens until Jessica takes her sandals off in her apartment.

Surely your features could identify you, but then again she must have her mind on her exams; not the wandering bug that managed to be lifted onto her desk. Struggling to open your eyes against the rushing wind around you, a strange sight fills your eyes. You had been expecting the cold tile floor to send you to your death (and hopefully make this strange new life you'd begun end swiftly) when a wall of flesh meets you instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a few seconds to piece this sequence of strange events together, but you think it went like this. You fell onto the exam, were lifted up, and the invigilator woman must have noticed your humanlike attributes, but didn't have time to say anything before Jess brushed you off of the desk with some impressive sleight of hand.

Take your seat now, before you lose any more time, and leave this young man to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndecision wracks Jessica's face, but she spares no more than one regretful glance for you before turning away and returning to her place.  Did you really see a tear in her eye?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes for the rest of you as well!\"  You imagine that this last bit is intended for the other students who had been watching the little debacle earlier.  You're truly alone now, trapped in a prison of flesh and bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you were due to take this exam yourself?\" she whispers down to you.  What?  Does she seriously expect you to soldier on through the traumatic experience of being reduced to an inch in height?  Her gentle yet firm gaze seems to imply that she's on the level.  So, should you tell her that you are a member of this class or try and come up with a lie to get out of this?</span></div></div>",

The leap carried you forwards far enough to catch the waistband of her underwear. Using all your remaining strength, you quickly pull yourself in. If Jess noticed anything, she didn't show it and after two minutes you assumed you were all good. But the weird powers that made you shrink weren't done with you yet. In seconds, you had grown back up to four inches. You were still tiny, but big enough to cause a disturbance in skin-tight jeans, even more on one of the more sensitive areas of the body. Jessica shifted her butt back and forth, causing you some major pain as her weight was directed down on you through her ass. You wriggled around in her underwear, hoping to escape the pressure butonly ended up with your arm and a leg stuck in her crack. In an attempt to free yourself, you reached as far along her hip as you could go and pulled with your other limbs. You were freed, but Jessica jumped and let out a surprised squeak. Quickly dodging a finger that descended into your prison, you kept pulling yourself in the other direction as fast as possible to dodge the groping finger. This went well until you put your hand down in something hot and moist. Even though you pulled your hand out as fast as possible, your carrier still jumped up and let out a conspicuous moan. Some words were said that you couldn't hear, and she got up.<br>\r\nFrom the sensations you could feel, trapped against Jessica's thigh by her pants, she was walking. Where she was going was answered when a door creaked closed, and you heard a lock click. Another hand came down, grabbing you easily now, and pulled you out. Jessica pulled you up to her face, and looked equal parts horrified and amused when she saw you.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in my pants?\" she asked, understandably mad. You quickly related your whole story hoping she wouldn't kill you as a pervert. She still had an angry look on her face when you finished, and braced for the life-ending hit, but it never came. Instead she had started smiling and said \"That is SOOOOOOO coool! I've always wanted a little man, but that stuff is all sci-fi!!!! But now I have you, and you're tiny, and I'm huge!!!!! I think I'm gonna keep you for a while! But I have to finish my test, so you can go...Ooh! in here!\" Jessica said excitedly. You were kind of disturbed by the enthusiasm and stuff she talked about, but tried to set it aside. In the meantime, Jess picked you up and dropped you in her shirt. She took another second to place you snugly between her large, warm breasts. While already large by normal standards, a D, easily approaching DD, these juggs were bigger than you were, and they were all yours for the time being. You smiled, for now you seemed safe.</span></div></div>",

You roll across the surface of her insole for a few seconds, wincing at your bruised back from the impact.

However, your plans are cut short as you feel the ground shifting beneath you. The floor seems to be rising like an incline, and you realize that Jessica is lifting her foot up! As the angle of incline increases, you feel gravity pulling you closer to Jessica's deadly toes. In a panic, you leap forward, latching onto the front of her sandal for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sandal rises up, and you find yourself hanging precariously over her deadly foot. Below you, her toes bounce with lethal force against the insole like the teeth of an enormous maw anticipating its next meal. You feel your grip faltering as her bouncing toes knock you about.

Tenderly, you rise up into a crouch, sitting atop the middle toe of the left foot, which is currently still.  You see that the sandal's edge rises vertically 'beneath' the toe - ninety degrees from the low ground.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You reach out, fingers wiggle as your hand nears Georgina's monsterous toes, and a second before they touch - you retreat. \"No, this could end up very badly\", you think to yourself, as you look and notice the slightly wiggling toes to your left and infront of you. If you tickle her too much, and create an itch, what would keep this giantess above from rubbing you between her powerful digits, playing with you, feeling you, chocking you slowly while the toes tear through your clothes, as you gasp for air? <br>\r\nYou can't bear that thought, as you slowly back away from her foot, keeping your eyes focused on her toes. \"I need to find another way\", you think to yourself as you look around for any kind of help - but Georgina's up above you, chewing on her pencil as she thinks of a proper answer, her hands tap on the table as she goes on. There's no way she'll ever hear you or notice you at your current size, so what choices do you have except rubbing her gigantic feet? all hope fades away as you realize your death might be more imminent then you've imagined..<br>\r\nOr is it?!<br>\r\nSuddenly it hits you! although the foot is your only option - there might be a safer way to approach it. As you turn around, you notice your second option of getting noticed - Georgina's mules, as they lay on the ground, one tipped over. You think of a plan that might just work - eventually Georgina would finish her test and would have to put her mules back on in order to walk and turn in the test. At that moment her foot would get near the mule, you can take advantage of the situation, and tickle the side of her foot. That would surely make her peek down and check her mule, even if she'll want to scrach her itch, and then you could climb the shoe itself and wave until she'll notice you!<br>\r\n\"That's brilliant!\", you think to yourself, \"It's two birds with one stone - I get to draw her attention, while avoiding her foot's most dangerous part, the toes themselves!\".<br>\r\nYou smirk as you start making your way towards the shoes laying on the floor infront of you. 20 seconds after, and your there, looking at the gigantic cave that is Georgina's mule, tipped over.<br>\r\nYou grab hold of the fabric at the entering of the show, and duck near the entrance, as you look at her feet, now miles away from you. Sometime soon, her feet will start moving towards the mules, and the toes would take hold as she'll start wearing them. And then, it will be your chance to strike. But just as you about it, you begin to feel a slight smell emitting from her mule - it's a combination of fruit lotion and.. sweat. and it's amazingly strong down here. And even so.. you seem to like it. Love it, even. You look inside the shoe, and, after taking a quick look behind you to see the feet still in place, dig your nose into the fabric of the mule. The smell is intoxicating, and you inhale deeply. \"This is pure heaven\", you think to yourself as you look ahead, into the darkness of the shoe, and begin thinking: \"Well.. the test begin only a short while ago and Georgina doesn't seem too eager to put her feet back in her mules, plus she's completely in the test and doesn't notice anything else.. so maybe, I can just go in for a quick sniff.. And I'll be out even before she'll finish her next question\". And with those words - you climb onto her tipped mule, rise up and fill your lungs with the musky air. You're completely taken over, as you begin making your way inside, into the darkness, feeling the wall of fabric to your side as you go along. Soon enough, you reach the ending of the shoe - the toe section, and dig your nose again. the smell in much stronger here, and you love it. You inhale once, twice and again. You can't seem to stop sniffing Georgina odor, and soon enough, you spread your arms and legs as you lay flat, digging your whole face into the sole of her shoe. You love every second of it - but unfortunately for you, not all the people who are taking the test, agree with your point of view.<br>\r\nUp above, Georgina is so busy with her test, she doesn't pay attention to anything else - and her feet, in particular. They are emitting a strong smell that some begins to spread amongst the class, and the investigator, who sits just one row away from her, begins to notice it too. Soon enough she gets up, and starts walking towards the part of the class where the smell seems to be the strongest. One look under all the tables - and she quickly understands that a girl, not sure of her name, it to be blamed for. Her feet, more preciesly.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss?\", the investigator begins.<br>\r\nGeorgina is spooked for a moment as she picks up her head, \"Yes, mam?\", she answers.<br>\r\n\"I believe it would be better off if you'd put your shoes back on\", the investigator told her.<br>\r\nAnd with that, Georgina snaps into reality and smells the strong smell that her feet were emitting. She quickly turns red, as she looks down at her table, while her toes puke the floor looking for her shoes. As her feet finally reach the first shoe, they tip it and her left foot slides right in. Her left foot follows as she tells the investigator how sorry she is.<br>\r\n\"No harm done\", she tells her, \"just make sure you keep them in there for the rest of the test\".<br>\r\nAnd Georgina followed. As the investigator walked away, Georgina started to notice something, a piece of lint perhaps, that's been caught within the reach of her toes. \"Come on, you stupid piece of lint, I'll smother you till I can't feel a thing and you're torn apart\", she says to herself as she uses her toes to play with it in her shoe. \"Damn mules\", she thinks as she continues the test.. If only she knew.</span></div></div>",

They stop, as you lay there, trying to figure out what's going on. And then, a voice follows.. a female voice. \"Must be the investigator\", you think to yourself, \"has Georgina done anything wrong?\".<br>\r\nAlthough the voices within the shoe are muffled, you can still figure out a few words out of the conversation: \"Yes.. believe.. put.. shoes\". Your eyes widen and heart sank as you heard those last two words: \"Wait! is she telling Georgina to put her mules back on?!\", you begin to panic, \"I have to get out of here!\". With that, you rise and begin to run into the opening, when you suddenly trip and fall. You block your fall with your hands and yell at the sharp pain, as you look behind you to notice what caused you to trip - and then you see it. One of the threads must have gotten lose, and your foot has tangled in it as you tried to run. \"SHIT!!\", you yell as you quickly reach for it, trying to get your foot out - but it's too late. Earthquackes toss you from side to side, as your whole world turns upside down, and as it comes to a rest, your vision is blurry and breath is heavy. You shake your head as you try and regain balance, and as your vision clears - you see them. Five digits, looking bigger then ever, float above your body as they scrap the ceiling of the mule you're in. And before you can react - they fall down, right upon you. \"AHHHH!!!\", you scream in pain as the toes engulf you, and just before the whole shoe stuffs the mule, the last muffled voice you can hear is: \"..sorry\".<br>\r\nYou're in hell. You keep pushing the plump toes with your hands as hard as you can, while they rest upon your body, trying to descent onto the sole of the mule. \"no.. this can't be happening! I have to get her attention now!\", you think as you start massaging her toes, in hopes she'll notice. For a second, it seems like it's woking - the toes wiggle a bit as they try and feel your tiny body. But then, they stop.. rest carefuly above you as they lay still. you look at the soft skin, the musky smell surround you and invade your nostrils as you breathe quickly, but the next thing that happens - you cannot predict. The toes suddenly clunch with great force, mashing you between them and the undersides, near the ball of her foot. This rapid movement repeats a couple of times, as the massive toes try to get a hold of you. You wiggle yourself, trying to get to her pinky toe, whose the smallest and has the least strength of the five, but each time you do - Georgina uses her middle toe to smash you into the sole of the mule, and drag you towards the big and second toes. You're running out of strength, and fast. The toes clunch you again, this time harder, but you manage to slip away and before Georgina even understands what happened - you crouch and run under her massive toes as fast as you can. \"Second\", you think as you run past the second toe, \"Third!\", you yell as you jump from under her third toe, rolling as it hits the sole of the shoe trying to get you. \"FOUR!\", you yell as you run under her fourth toe - you can already see the pinky toe, as it rises from the ground. You spread your hands, ready to grab it and stay under it, no matter what - because you know Georgina's toes won't be able to grab you once you've pressed yourself against the little toe's flesh. \"FIV...!\" you yell, but suddenly you feel a sharp pain as you plummet to the ground. You yell in agony as you look behind you, only to see that Georgina fourth toe managed to land on your feet just before you made the jump. \"FUCK!!! FUCK!!!\", you yell as you try and wiggle free, but you can feel Georgina's fourth toe starting pulling on your body, towards her third and second toe. \"NO.. NO.. I HAVE TO STAY HERE\", you think as you press your hands forward, and hug the pinky toe with all your might, knowing it's your only chance. The toe continues to smoother and pull you away, as you yell and hold onto Georgina's sweaty little toe. Georgina, feeling this, thinks that the lint might have been caught in her pinky's nail, and uses her fourth toe to mash it to the ground, tearing it apart. You yell in pain as you understand that unless you take drastic measures, Georgina would smoother you to death. You take one last pull towards the pinky toe, and...</span></div></div>",

Her face lowers itself level with George's olive palm, her dark hazel irises focusing lessened black pupils on your diminutive form.  Waves of invisible steam seep from the massive, pointy nose hovering just above the squishy platform on which you stand, causing you much perspiration.  You wait for a more communicative reaction, but Shirley seems incapable of giving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I could maybe reschedule the exam?\", you opt to break the painful silence half-jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question snaps Miss Briggs back into reality, \"That really isn't allowed, but I guess I'll have a talk with the dean of the department.  I bet this'll be the first time she's heard this excuse\", she finishes with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys\", George's voice interrupts from high overhead, \"don't we have more important things to worry about right now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right\", Shirley agrees as she returns from her hunched position, \"Of course\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance up at George's normally beaming face, but find only worry in her deep cobalt eyes.  She quickly takes notice of you taking notice of her, and attempts to hide her concern behind a timid smile, her cheeks blushing.  You shoot her a falsely reassuring look, which she seems to buy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do?\", George turns her attention back to Miss Briggs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we need to show a great deal of discretion here\", Shirley is quick to reply, \"We have to keep this secret from the general public, both for his safety as well as for the sake of the school's reputation\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh to yourself upon hearing this.  George keep a secret?  Miss Briggs clearly didn't know who she was talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Briggs continues, \"I'll alert the other invigilators of the situation.  They'll look for the cause of this poor boy's condition.  In the meantime, I think it best if I look after him\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shirley's open hand extends toward your location, the ground beneath your feet shifts.  You manage to keep your balance as you find yourself involuntarily drawn closer to George's well developed chest.  Your cream colored expanse begins to rumble, this time knocking you on your backside.  Before you emerges a tsunami of smooth flesh threatening to engulf you.  However, the curling fingers stop short, freezing in time just before overtaking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really think he'd be more comfortable with me\", George states determinedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, Miss Pullard?\", Shirley barely holds back her laughter, \"Do you really think you can handle that much responsibility, young lady?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem!\", George answers defensively, \"I just don't think he'd like being looked after by someone so old, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old?!\", George's comment had hit Shirley a bit too close to home, \"Let me tell you something...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two keep going back and forth with each other.  Though you're fairly confident both of them have your best interest at heart, you are a tad annoyed that neither of them have yet to stop and ask for your input.  After all, you're still a human being, right?  Shouldn't you have a say in such an important decision regarding your own life?

George looks down to see you waving madly for her attention.  Her cheeks turn red once again as she flattens her hand.  Your position is elevated hastily, giving you a mild case of vertigo.

The weight of your small body sinks into the light pink surface as you sit at its softly curved end, giving you a temporary sense of significance.  Of course, that feeling subsides when you look straight ahead, your entire field of vision occupied by a humongous eye.  You take a minute to take in your hazy reflection looking back at you through moist whiteness before an ocean blue iris shifts in the way with impatient haste.  Maybe you should get on with your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been going with Naomi for a couple of weeks now\", you begin, \"I've known her since freshman year, and we sort of hit it off right away\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge is quick to stop you, \"You've known her that long, and the two of you are just now going out?  What was the hold up?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hold up was\", you continue in an 'it's rude to interrupt' tone, \"that she refused to go past that 'just friends' phase, saying things would get weird otherwise.  I guess she's had a few relationships like that, and none of them worked out.  Anyway, after years of convincing, she finally agreed to give me a chance\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you Mr. Persistent?\", George playfully mocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore your gargantuan friend's musings, \"She's been kind of uneasy about it, though.  Almost like she's looking for an excuse to call the whole thing off before we get too serious.  Anyway, I'm supposed to take her out tonight, and if I don't show she's going to think I stood her up.  So I have to tell her why I'm not going to make it, or my shot with Naomi is up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge lowers you below and away from her boulder-like chin, her fingers stroking it inquisitively.  A loud \"HMMM\", sounds from behind her closed lips, sending surprisingly pleasurable vibrations through you.  She twirls her dark red strands with the index and middle fingers of her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she taking the exam too?\", George asks knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slap your forehead, \"Of course!  I forgot all about that.  Why don't we just wait around until she's finished\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some boyfriend you are\", George jokes at your ignorance, \"But seriously, I'm not sure if talking to her here is such a good idea.  I'm not about to get scolded by Miss Briggs after all that\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you suggest?\", your voice hints at contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are once again raised to the upper echelons of Georges beautiful face.  The expression on it tells you that she is not amused with your tone.  You retreat into an invisible shell at the cold stare studying you.  Your cowardly performance is enough to bring George's normally cheery smile back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just meet her like you planned\", George advises, \"I'd be happy to take you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, wouldn't that be kind of awkward?\", you are skeptical of the idea to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\", George assures, \"I don't know her very well, so I'd like to talk to her.  I'm pretty protective about who my little buddy dates\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks\", your reply is sarcastic, \"but still, I don't want to get you in trouble, so maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's totally up to you\", George cuts you off, \"No pressure\".</span></div></div>",

Listening to this your relief has disappeared as you begin to realize that Naomi doesn't see you as you, she see's you as some cute bug. But it seem's to late for you to realize this as you are put into her purse and zipped up with a small opening to give you air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what's to come next and once the car starts you begin to roll around the inside of the purse and only given one option which is trying to survive the giant makeup. After some time has passed, Naomi arrives at the location of where you two were suppose to meet for your date. She decided to wait in her car and play on her phone in till you \"showed up\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew right away where you are after hearing Naomi say \"Ugh, I have called him 5 times already and texted him a message. Where is he? He better not stand me up, especially after making such a big deal about wanting to go out with me\" Hearing this, you know that you don't want to mess this shot up with Naomi and then you think to yourself that you have to get out of this purse and get to Naomi's ear for the hope that she realizes that your not a bug and clearing up the fact that you did show up on time for your date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you begin your climb up the inside of the purse and when you make it to the hole of the zipper.

You'd gone from the frying pan into the actual fire, and didn't have much time to get out before you were burned. As your back hits the grooved surface of the pedal, you soon know where gravity is trying to lead you. Allowing yourself to be sent hurtling off the side of it, you manage to tumble off of the edge just as Naomi's sole presses against the brake pedal. She must have been at a red light or something and didn't have time to slow to a stop, but the lack of effort had almost cost you your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her boyfriend's life, for that matter, if she even remember you anymore. You hadn't been gone very long, but your girlfriend could be rather forgetful despite her intelligence. All the greatest minds seemed to be, though. Embracing this trivial pain in comparison to what you would have felt being crushed, you hit the car floor and roll to a stop. But at least you hadn't been smeared, and for that you're thankful enough. After a few winces of pain you get up, looking at Naomi's absent-mindedly wiggling toes. They should be labeled as instruments of torture, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that challenge done, you tried to fathom a new plan. You had just felt the beginnings of a headache before the falling, but now it's increased in fervor from all the crashing. Rubbing your temples, you rack your brain for a solution to get you out of this. There was still the option of trying to get Naomi's attention, but she was driving and probabaly wouldn't be concentrating enough on stuff by her feet as she was driving. You can imagine the scenario of her half-spotting you and half-driving, and through that not recognizing you.

Or rather, take matters to George's hand.  You get on your knees and begin pounding the flesh of George's palm, sending small ripples through the skin and transmitting just enough force for George to feel your tiny fists.  The verbal quarrel suddenly trails off as George's fingers begin to unfurl like a living retractable roof to reveal George's worried face looking down at you in concern.  She must've thought that she was squashing you.  Shirley gets some last words in before following George's line of sight to your diminutive form.  Now that you've got the spotlight, you better not squander it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, I think it would be best if I go with Miss Briggs.  It's my best shot to to cure... whatever this is that happened to me,\" you shout up to George's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I knew you'd listen to reason!  You were always such a bright student!\" Shirley chirps, obviously happy with your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if she runs weird tests on you, or turns you into her pet?\" worries George, still distrustful of your teacher, whose expression sours upon hearing this.  Before they can launch into another argument, you wave your hand at George to assuage her worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine! You should be focusing on your exam and enjoying the summer, not worrying about me,\" you say, although the butterflies in your stomach tell a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Pullard, you had better leave him with me this instant and return to your exam before you miss the next part,\" Shirley interjects, putting one hand on her hip and holding her other hand out flat, waiting for George to deliver you into her palm.  However, George still seems uncertain.  Her mouth open and closes as if to say something, but no sound comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Miss Pullard, if you keep him against his will, you'll be the one treating him like a pet,\" says Shirley.  George, none too happy about her words being used against her, finally sighs and moves her hand into position next to Shirley's open palm.  George's darker hue forms a sharp contrast to the ivory tone adorning Shirley's skin.  George tilts her hand at a downward angle, allowing you to gently walk down the springy flesh of her fingers.  Pausing at the tip of George's middle finger, you turn around and give her a final wave goodbye before jumping down and landing on the middle of Shirley's palm.  Taking in a quick look at your new surroundings, George's expansive palm had nothing on Shirley's adult hand, which is wider and longer than George's, with Shirley's long, slender fingers extending far out into the distance.  George withdraws her hand but still looks a bit hesitant, but Shirley is quick to send her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run along dear, before you're disqualified for the rest of the exam,\" Shirley says authoritatively, but George stays put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you contact me as soon as you find something out about... whatever happened?\" asks your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly.  Your number should be in the campus listing, so do be sure to keep your phone on.  You'll be given a call once we know something,\" Shirley answers dismissively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  See you later,\" says George, as she jogs back to the exam room, leaving you alone with Shirley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's take a better look at you,\" she says, lifting you up closer to her eyes.  The sudden acceleration pushes you a bit into her palm.  Shirley's soft skin seems to be due more to a strict regimen of moisturizer instead of George's youthful, springy flesh.  As your warm, living elevator continues its slow ascent of your teacher's face, you notice some small imperfections in the skin, things that would be nigh imperceptible to anyone but someone of your stature.  Her palm halts in front of her hazel eyes, which squint to scrutinize your tiny form; you, in turn, stare into the her dark pupils, so large they could swallow the sun.  Not wanting to be caught staring at her, you quickly break eye contact and gaze at the other details of her face, like her light brown hair pulled into a tight bun behind her head, her smartly plucked eyebrows and a pair of expensive looking earrings adorning her ears while she moves her hand around to get a look at you from every angle.  Despite being in her early thirties, Shirley Briggs was quite an attractive woman; however, her no-nonsense attitude and her extreme love of fiction doubtlessly kept the men away.  But under her unyielding gaze, you feel like you're already being examined as a test subject.  Finally, she moves her hand down in front of her chin, ending what felt like a silent interrogation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be unharmed, so that's good,\" she says, in a softer tone than she usually uses in class.  However, those words were formed by the same sparklingly white teeth and sharp pink tongue that she so often used to give verbal lashings to misbehaving students, except at your current size her mouth is the size of a small cavern to you, so you should still be on your best behavior.  You could easily fit between those scarlet lips that would so readily recite Shakespeare in class.  Even so, you have full confidence that she'll keep your new size a secret from everyone except the people who need to know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley puts a thoughtful finger on her chin while moving the hand you're on in front of her chest, pondering aloud the names of the biology faculty members who would be best suited to help you.  Now you're in front of the same flat chest that you and your friends would make fun of after class all the time.  It was often compared to a skiing slope, but at your size, you could easily use it like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I should ask you first,\" Shirley says, drawing your attention back to her face.  \"If you're feeling up to it, we can get you over to the biology lab now.  If you're too tired from your adventure, you can rest at my house.  Without charge, of course.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't worry, I'll be gentle.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes at that last statement, since even a light breeze could be dangerous at your size. To keep yourself hidden, she orders you to lie down at the base of her fingers, so she can keep in you in her closed fist, out of sight. Your body sinks slightly into the flesh of her hand as you lie down flat. It feels a bit like a warm, springy bed. The last thing you see is Shirley's face smiling down on you like a divine presence before her fingers engulf the sky and close over you. She clamps down tight enough to keep you from rolling around, but loose enough to enable you to breathe. No light seeps between her fingers, keeping you in darkness. Her warmth quickly penetrates the space, making it seem like a bizarre sleeping bag. True to her word, she walks slowly, and the overall feeling isn't unpleasant. After a short while, she comes to a stop and you can hear a muffled conversation, probably consisting of Shirley claiming to have to leave early due to a family emergency or something and asking them to cover the rest of her exam. It must've gone well, because after another few minutes the flesh roof overhead unfurls and Shirley's face appears once again. She lowers her hand to a table and you clamber off onto a colorful tablecloth. Your current protector sets her purse down with a clunk and begins to rearrange the contents, ensuring that you won't get impaled by an errant pretzel rod. Unfortunately, it's a smaller, fashionable purse, not like the massive overnight bags that most girls carry around these days, so you hope you'll have enough space inside. As she effortlessly grabs objects that seem to weigh tons, you take the chance to kick at a stray crumb on the table. To your dismay, it barely budges. Finally, Shirley is finished creating a safe haven in her purse, and you climb on her hand once again so she can lift you down inside. Not wanting to simply drop you off her hand, she instead tilts her hand at a downward angle, allowing you to climb down her fingers. To aid your descent, she spreads her fingers enough to allow you to wrap your arms and legs around her middle finger and slowly climb down it as if it were a rope in gym class, a living rope that can easily flick you to oblivion. You can feel every ridge and striation in her finger; eventually, you climb down to her fingertip and drop down onto a bed of handkerchiefs resting in a hollow of her purse, all of the makeup and other junk moved to either side. Shirley seems to be getting the hang of your new size much faster than George did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It'll take a few minutes to drive to my house, so hang on until then,' she says, as her face once again disappears as she buttons up the purse. Seconds later, you feel a jolt as Shirley lifts the purse over her shoulder. It feels a bit like being in an elevator, one that swings from side to side as well as up and down. Thankfully, while the contents of her purse rattle around, none of them topple on top of you. After another short while, your movement stops and you hear a deep rumbling from somewhere. She must have started her car and put her purse on the passenger seat. The steady vibration of the engine and the temporary peacefulness is almost enough to lull you to sleep. Before you can nod off, however, the engine stops and the elevator ride begins again as Shirley steps into her house. After another jolt as the purse hits the table, light and fresh air enters your makeshift carrying case as the top opens and Shirley's index finger enters from the heavens, descending slowly until the tip of the short nail just touches the handkerchiefs. Taking the cue, you grab ahold of her fingertip and hold on tight as she gently lifts her finger up and retrieves you from her purse. Your feet touch down on the wooden surface of her kitchen table as your eyes readjust to the light. As you look around her house, your first thought is' what a mess. Books of every size and shape lay scattered haphazardly; romance novels, autobiographies, scientific textbooks, coverless books with yellow pages and books written in strange languages cover every surface of her kitchen, including piles in the corners. If you were tall enough, you would even see that she has books on top of her refrigerator. It looks like God grabbed a bookstore and shook it upside down, spilling the contents all over Shirley's house. She has apparently taken her love of the written word to frightening extremes. You wonder if she owns a Kindle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Obviously, I would've cleaned up had I expected company,' your host says, seemingly embarrassed about the clutter. The collected dust tells you that she hasn't 'expected company' in quite a while; plus, you doubt any closet in the world has enough space for this many books. You stifle a giggle as you realize that even her closet probably has more books than clothes. 'Now if you'll excuse me, I simply must change out of these stifling clothes. They're simply unbearable in this heat,' she huffs, before leaving down a hallway. You hear a door close somewhere in her house. Now alone again, you hear another strange rumbling sound. Hoping it's a pet cat that emerged from under a stack of books to devour you, you realize instead that it's your stomach growling. All that exertion and dodging death has made you famished. Plus, you're so tired that you can barely stand up. You feel like you could sleep for days, perhaps nestled in the soft, dog-eared pages of an ancient paperback. Man, you've only been here for minutes and you've already got books on the brain. A sudden shadow looming over you signals Shirley's return. You turn around and are shocked at her new appearance: she's wearing a tank top a shorts, her brown hair hanging loosely upon her shoulders instead of locked up in a bun. She looks so' normal, not like her usual staid, done-up appearance. She switches on an air conditioner; the sudden blast of chilled air feels refreshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley lays a bare arm onto the table and rests her chin on it; if you weren't the size of an ant, you might be face-to-face. At this close range, you can see that she also removed her makeup, but she's still quite attractive; if anything, even moreso now. Instead of pursed lips and glaring eyes, she now wears a smiling countenance that puts you at ease. 'You must be starving. I can make you something to eat, unless you'd like to clean yourself up and rest instead,' she says. You're rather afraid of what this woman might call 'food', but then again, bad food is better than no food, but you may not even stay awake long enough to eat anything if your droopy eyelids are any indication.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seems you're in the middle, but have no idea if this is someone's chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see that only a few minutes have passed and everyone seems to be taking the exam still.

You began to crawl faster. Almost to the back edge, almost there. You hear the thumping coming back as Brooke headed towards the chair, her hips swaying side to side, jiggling her cheeks out from her sides. You continue crawling and are right near the edge when a shadow casts above you. You look up breathing heavily and shallow as her butt eclipse everything above you as it starts to descend. The leggings wedged so firmly between her cheeks and doesn't show signs of releasing as her butt expands into a giant black apple. You notice the lint crushed to each butt cheek. And on her right cheek what's left of an unlucky beetle she hadn't noticed under her. Legs splayed out and green guts spilled out of what should've been the head, or what's left of it. You feel the warmth as her butt descends closer and closer to you. So close to the edge, you think you can make it, just in time.

You realize that you may have a chance to survive though if you can find a way out. You don't see any light and the warmth and smell under Brooke's ass is intense.

As she sat down she felt a slight popping sensation but didn't really think much of it. Nervous about the test, she begins. After about 10 mins, she feels a rumbling in her lower intestines and a pressure start to build. \"Not Now\" she says to herself as she is intending to hold whatever is brewing in. But the pressure continues to build. Knowing she probably shouldn't have had cheesy eggs, bacon and coffee that morning. She finally decides to let a little bit of it out. Fortunately, it comes out quietly and no one seems to notice the sound. Unfortunately, the smell is starting to waft upwards and because of that she gets nervous and wiggles her butt side to side to get rid of the smell, feeling more cracking sensations. Thinking it's the chair and her leggings she hopes she can get back to her test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to get more sweaty as the heat continues under Brooke's ass. Fortunately, you can breathe, but you continually hear the rumbling above you of her intestines moving. Finally you feel slight moving but then a sudden heatwave hits your face, feeling like it's intense fire against your body. The smell then hits you. Like you opened a box of rotten eggs and rotten milk at the same time. You start to cough and pray to god Brooke gets up, before you feel slight movement. Suddenly your left arm is crushed and ripped away from your body. You scream in agony, before the right side of your body is crushed under her butt cheek. You have just enough consciousness left to see your body hanging and dripping off her butt cheek before her left butt cheek comes down and crushes the rest of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke finally finished the test after an hour of sitting down, she let enough of her fart out that she wasn't in any pain anymore. She was happy nobody smelt it as she stands up to go turn in her test. She didn't notice the red splotch on her chair as she goes to the front. If anyone looked hard enough between Brooke's butt cheeks there was another red splotch lying there. In the shape of a bug with little bits falling off as she walked. And if you looked even harder you could notice a head in between slowly being crushed and shredded as her cheeks rubbed together. Brooke sighed and smiled as she left the class, letting out the rest of her fart, blowing most of the sinew out between them, only the head remained until she finally did laundry.  </span></div></div>",

Sure you don't know her that well...or much at all, really. But she\u2019s the closest thing you have to a lifeline. You clamber onto stable ground, the thin ledge of seat that wasn\u2019t occupied by your classmate\u2019s massive butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling onto your back to catch your breath, you can't help but stare in awe for a few moments. Brooke was already pretty thick at normal size but from your new inch-high perspective, the swell of her ass is impossible not to notice as it looms overhead. It\u2019s squashed under the petite girl\u2019s weight, her cheeks expanding against the hard surface of the chair. She shifts slightly. Her enormous butt rises a fraction of an inch before swiftly falling back onto the seat, shaking your entire world. Going from mesmerized to intimidated, you shudder to think of what might've happened if you hadn't made it to the edge of the chair before she sat down. You would've been crushed for sure if you\u2019d been caught under all that fatty flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize how long you've been lying there staring and shake your head, getting to your feet. Ogling Brooke\u2019s giant ass wasn't going to get her attention. You limp closer to her, weary of the drop you\u2019d avoided earlier. Her back looms high into the sky. Scaling her from here would be like climbing a small mountain. You\u2019d have to get up the rounded wall of her rear before making it into a waterfall of blonde hair. If you could navigate that wavy jungle, you would end up in an ideal spot near her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could try climbing into her lap. The ascent would be much easier but it would take a bit of a trek to get there. You\u2019d have to edge your way around her wide hip to keep from falling off this thin strip of chair. From that point, it would be a quick climb onto the thick plateau that was her thigh. She\u2019d almost certainly spot you against the black of her leggings.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Now you just had to wait, your nose picking up the adhesive of the plaster as well as the aroma of Leia's foot. It was like someone took cheese and proceeded to stomp it into her sandals insole for a few days of not showering. It wasn't pleaseant to say the least, assaulting your nose, not even blocking your nose with your free arm helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was fifteen minutes into the exam. At that point she was holding still only to start tapping her other foot... the one you were on. You couldn't really see that she did, but your legs were painfully bent backwards as her foot rose, almost to the point of breaking them due to pressure and the unnatural bending, only to slam down with a deafening boom making you cover your ears... only that you couldn't! You only had one arm, only covering one ear and leaving your nose free to smell the putrid, cheesy smell of her feet. You couldn't escape either as the constant movement made you dizzy and you needed your arm to shield you, being forced to either go deaf on both ears or smell her feet while she was simply thinking about some hard question, completely unaware that she was torturing a small human as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was twenty minutes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt thrity minutes, she finally stopped tapping her foot, sliding the one you were tapped forward and propping it up on the heel. You were along for the ride, suddenly turning and staring down, only able to see the toes of her other foot. The second and fourth toe were covered in plasters as well, the smell increasing even further, blocking your nose barley having effect any more. You wanted to puke, but you were too afraid of what she would do when she found out you puked on her. No, you just had to endure watching her toes gently flex and scrunch as she thought about what to do, watching the sweat roll down between them, disappearing onto the worn, brown insole. It would somewhat hypnotic if you weren't concentrating on not puking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet that didn't seem to be enough as you watched her toes, and entire foot for that matter, come closer towards you. Her toes were aimed right at you, lifting off of the sandal a bit and showing you the deep imprint they made over the time. The sandal slammed down right below the plaster, her toes extending forward and slamming above it with you trapped between the two, forced to smell both the stale smell of her insole and the fresh smell of her toes. You just couldn't try and hold on anymore, trying your hardest to get off the plaster, clawing at it and trying to rip it off, but not nearly fast enough. She scrunched her toes, hitting your head and giving you one hell of a headache, barley seeing her grab one rather loose corner between her toes and pulling a little on it, only to let go and repeat the same thing. She kept hitting you, coating your head in her foul sweat as she simply and innocently played with one of her many plasters, slowly ripping it off. It wasn't necessary anyways, the wound was basically healed and she had just forgotten to take it off. Her toes kept abusing you, slowly ripping the plaster off until it finally gave way! Only to have one end stick to her toe, the other landing on the insole along with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled into the deep imprint of one of the toes, feeling the abuse they had gotten take it's toll on your back, staring up at her toes as they desperately tried to get the adhesive off it, the plaster rocking about. You couldn't even move, sinking too much into the wet insole, just forced to watch as she managed to get it off... the plaster falling over the crater and sealing the one you were in, blocking out all light and trapping you with the smell. Though, it took barley two seconds for her toe to come crashing back down, the soft insole and plaster protecting you a little as you were simply forced into it, yet felt several bones shatter upon the impact. You couldn't even scream due to the plaster being in your face, just hoping you wouldn't die here... but without something to play with, Leia simply started to drum her toes, sealing your fate as with each hit her toe got on you, another bone broke. By the time the exam was over, you were nothing but a sweat covered red stain... nothing unusual on the plaster, Leia simply throwing it away when she finally remembered it after a few days.</span></div></div>",

The side of the bed doesn't prove to be any harder to climb than a climbing wall and you soon find yourself on top of the bedsheet.<br>\r\nLeia still isn't to be seen, so you assume that she isn't in the room. You actually remember shortly after that Leia is taking dancing lessons and therefore could be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are still trying to figure out what would be best to do next, you hear a door opening somewhere in the apartment. Before you can decide to hide, Leia enters the room. She is wearing a top, a skirt and black nylon tights, her shoes already off. With a sigh she is grabbing the book from her night cabinet and lets herself plop down on the bed, sending you into the air aswell as the mattress is bending under the impact of Leia. She swings her feet in your direction, planting them right in front of you, while she lays down to enjoy her reading. Viewing this as a perfect opportunity to make her notice you, you head in the direction of her head, between her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she moves her left foot while you are trying to pass it, casually placing it on you, trapping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the sudden movement, your attempt to avoid the enormous foot fails and you are firmly pressed into the bed by her foot. It doesn't smell too bad, to be fair, but you can't move and you can't see anything with her foot resting right on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, her main weight is resting on the bed through her back and the bed is soft so you don't suffer any serious injuries. Shifting her foot a bit, the material of her tights sliding over your front side, she seems to notice you. Unfortunately she seems to assume that you are a little piece of something (maybe a piece of dirt or some rolled candy paper) on her bed and not worth of further inspection. She maybe even thinks you to be an insect but she just doesn't really care about that little thing under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly starts to move her left foot, dragging you along (because you are trapped in the material of her tights), pressing you into the mattress while doing so. Her feet are kind of sweaty after dancing and you occasionally twist under her foot and unwillingly rotate, just like a rolled piece of paper would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to find fun in grinding that little thing into her bed and adds weight to her foot to press you into the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain is unbearable and you try to scream but you can't, barely getting any air and with either the bedsheet or the nylon in your face. The pressure of her left foot is too much for your fragile little body and you feel your bones snap. Unknowingly, Leia continues to grind you into the sheets, without getting slower or taking away some of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she stops reading after an hour or so, stopping the movement of her foot but still letting it rest on your half-dead body. She rises into a sitting position and takes her foot away from you, wondering what that thing under her foot was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her head is nearing, her face having a look of curiosity on it, you try to wave with your hand to make her realize that you are a shrunken human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to hope as you see her eyes wide, knowing that your dangerous voyage has finally come to an end with someone noticing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that hope turns into horror as you see disgust creeping into her beautiful face. \"Bugs are so nasty. It's still moving\" you hear her say as her giant left foot moves to shove you from her bed. You can't even move to dodge it and you fall to the ground, still barely alive, although you hoped you would die from the impact of the fall. The last thing you see then is her left foot pad crushing down on you, turning you into paste as she continuously twists her foot to make sure that nasty insect doesn't survive. She cleans up your remains with a piece of toilet paper and throws them into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a miserable end, to die to the beautiful feet of a young woman, mistaken for and squished like an insect.</span></div></div>",

In the confusion of sleep and movement, Leia's shirt is peeled back, revealing about seven inches of flesh where her shirt would normally cover it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tumble ever farther and come to a sudden stop in her belly button. Apparently this tickles your giantess friend above, and she laughs softly in the night. The finger receives new orders and turns, as if staring right at you. Her hand homes in on the source of the tickle which is once again you, the shrunken man trying to get her attention. Leia now has you in her hand and absent mindedly she unfurls it, leaving you standing on her palm. She is not interested in whatever was down there and is engrossed in a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words are large and clear, and the book's title is \"Little Men\". You would have chuckled at the irony had you not been in the hand of someone who doesn't even know you're alive. Princess Leia's eyes scan the pages and you crane your neck to observe the girl in all her splender. With this temporary peaces of you just standing on her hand you can observe the room around you. A desk, a small table by her bed, a closet with folded doors and a soda machine in the corner. Nice touch. You'd never seen one of those in somebody's house before. Leia's attention is broken by...</span></div></div>",

It's purple, and while it may be rather huge, to her it's like she's wearing practically nothing at all.

What she always did, as the bigger sister: Took everything good that Shelly managed to get. It had always been the same story, since they were little. Mom had always favored Leia, gotten her better presents, all of that. Now, when she managed to have in her possession probably the only known shrunken man in history (the idea still oggled her mind) Leia had still snatched him right out of her hands. Long-harbored fury boiled behind her arched eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia sized her sister's little secret with a condescending look. What was this, a doll? Her younger sister was still playing with these things. A smirk tugged at the corners of her mouth. One day her mother would need to have Shelly grow up. It was no wonder everyone teased her at school and she came home in tears. No high school freshman should be playing with dolls anymore. Taking little note of the object in her hand, she slid it into her neglige pocket and sent Shelly off to bed and yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she better get back to bed, since there was another exam tomorrow. Leia spun on her heel and headed for her bedroom. As she pushed the door open after a couple of shaky steps, there was a small pulse within her pocket. Had her leg brushed up against it as she was walking? Impossible, since the garment draped over lower body rather than clung to it. Then what could it be then? Shelly's doll had some sort of movement ability, most likely. What a stupid idea. Leia would never understand the girl. But this movement had made her curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curse aloud as you realize, judging by Leia's sudden stop, that she must have felt you. Having tried your best not to make yourself known until you had time to escape, Leia's most recent stride had sent you flying into the fabric walls of her clothes, and you could tell that your body must have slammed into her thigh. Nothing to do about it now though, the damage was done, all you could do was hope it was too small to be significant to the sleepy woman. Leia resumed walking toward her bed, so you sigh in relief.

Sliding your legs into the back pocket just below where you had been hiding, you attempt to get yourself all the way inside, despite the pull of gravity pitted against you. With grim determination, you inch your way (well, technically millimeters) through the gap, struggling to stay upright as the shaking continues. Besides,if she actually expects you to be intact if you fell from this height, she truly is insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last there's a breakthrough; you muster enough adrenaline-fueled energy to conceal yourself entirely inside the lining of the pocket. Now not only can she not see you, you are safe from being shaken out. Having brought up no findings, Shelly abruptly drops her sister's pants back on the floor in a heap. Once again you hear her tremor-causing footsteps as she continues to search the room for you. Leia fidgeted in sleep. If only she knew you are down here... you wonder how the woman would even react. You plan to wait within the pocket until you are positive Leia's annoying younger sister is gone for good, then you'll commence with the plan and get back to Leia.

Attempting to fight against gravitational forces, you push against the soft blob of flesh, your hands leaving tiny impressions in their wake.  Shelly smiles at your efforts, her jaw muscles accidentally propelling you toward her upper facial features.  You stumble to a halt just beneath a side view of a massive hovering fin poking with a smoothly rounded edge from a sea of light olive skin.  Ignoring the freaky noise being made by the edifice sucking in and shooting out the odorless air, you look into the all-seeing brown eye staring back at you with playful tenderness as you ready yourself to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe I should take the other pillow\", you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly seems a bit disappointed, \"Well, I guess if that's what you want.  Good luck getting there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to begin your trek, you quickly notice that you would indeed be needing that luck in reaching your destination.  Beyond the deep crater centered around Shelly's gargantuan head, a long plateau of white lead to an assuredly deep ravine separating the two pillows.  As you set off on your journey, you shrug off thoughts of the difficulties that lie ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiking on all four appendages, your puny fingers grasp at the cold pillow casing with every advancement up the steep hill.  Your sneakers dig deep into the surprisingly thick fabric in an effort to create your own footholds.  The climb sets your arms and legs ablaze with exhaustion, but you push forward.  That is, until your grip fails you three-quarters of the way, and you begin to tumble hopelessly back to your starting point.  Luckily, your momentum is abruptly stopped as your back crashes into a hard, crevasse-lined beam.  You turn around to find that your savior is an upside-down totem pole of flesh.  The pink encasing of Shelly's nail pushes your dragging behind up the treacherous caldera.  You gaze back at Shelly's face just in time to see her eyelids slam shut, giving the illusion of her sleeping.  You shake your head at the bad ruse before venturing further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crossing the tundra-like plane, you come to the great canyon dividing you from your goal.  From afar, you surmised a strong jump would carry you from one ledge to the other.  Up close, however, it becomes clear that even your best vault will not suffice.  As you plan your next move, your \"mysterious\" benefactor moves to help you once again.  The back end of an enormous hand fills the void between the two cliffs, offering you safe passage.  You accept the invitation, quickly stepping on to the warm platform.  While taking your second stride across your living bridge, its attached fingers decide to wriggle uncontrollably.  Struggling to keep your feet under you as you stagger along, your body shaking violently as it absorbs the vibrations of each movement, a sweet chuckling from behind informs you of your entertainment value.  You step over rocky mounds as they morph in an out of existence.  With a desperate leap off of Shelly's pinky knuckle, you belly flop onto the awaiting cushion of the other pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel eyes watching you intently, but you're too tired to provide further amusement to your benevolent hostess.  Your mind doesn't even have the chance to wander and query about your predicament, probably to your betterment.  No, you simply pass out where you lay.</span></div></div>",

It's hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is withdrawn moments later, the sudden rush of space around you an invitation to gather what reserves you can into your lungs.  Shelly's voice trembles your world.  \"Ah, you're awake, Tecco.  I can't sleep.  I've been thinking about what you said.\"  You're almost literally a captive audience for the girl's out-loud thoughts.  \"You said that you think I'm attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's pitch black here, dead of night with no light, but the subtle shifts in the geography of the bed and general feeling of doom tells you that she's moved to sit directly over you.  \"I'm a virgin, Tecco.

For your trouble you earn another jab in the gut, this one carrying with it enough power to flip you on your back.  You groan in disapproval.  Your arms and legs lay outstretched while the rest of you remains motionless like a beached whale.  A third shot, this one square in the stomach, finally forces your eyes open as your upper body rises in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, you're up\", the kindness in Shelly's tone contradicts her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\", you grunt, still recovering, \"Don't you have school or something?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning glaze begins to clear from your eyes.  Staring up at the youthful beauty enveloping your entire line of sight, her maroon sweat pants are the first thing you see.  The upper half of her unmarked beige t-shirt perks with a \"work-in-progress\" chest, reminding you of the difference in appearance between freshmen girls in high school and college.  Her slightly darker brown hair sways just above her shoulders, threatening to slice into them with its sharp strand tips.  Her salient brown eyes flutter as she shoots you a quizzical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a Saturday?\", Shelly questions, \"What is this, Japan?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\", your wits start to return to you, \"I forgot what day it was\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly shakes her head at your silliness, then moves on, \"You hungry?  Come on, let's go eat!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no argument.  You haven't eaten anything since the night before you shrank, and your stomach isn't being shy about it.  Shelly's prodigious fingers rush you without warning, grappling your body with only slight discomfort.  The slender digits flatten beneath your feet, giving you a large viewing deck to explore the rapidly passing landscape.  The dim red wallpaper of the upstairs hallway blurs at the speed of your travel, though the ride is much smoother than the one you remember taking last night.  Speaking of memories, the sight of those stairs brought a few you'd rather not get into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn almost no time at all, you are delivered into the kitchen.  Shelly's knuckles clash gently with the dark brown surface of the kitchen table.  She tilts her hand, causing you to slide onto the expansive wooden platform.  You blind yourself temporarily by looking directly into the glaring reflection of the morning sun on the table.  Shelly reaches into a cabinet and pulls out a box of pop tarts and a plate.  She opens a bag of the tarts and places two in the toaster.  After a minute, she removes the two toasted pastries from the appliance and places them on the plate.  She takes her place at the table.  Of course, you miss all of this because, as you've already been told, you are blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision finally returns to you, and you are confronted by huge dull white saucer.  Shelly grabs you between her thumb and index finger.  She places you on top of a pop tart.  The warmth of the brown edible plane penetrates your sneakers and clothing.  You glance up at Shelly's pretty face only to see it go through a myriad of expressions.  First, there is a gentle smile.  Then comes a pondering stare.  Finally, a mischievous smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly picks up your tart and holds in front of her dainty pink lips.  A shapeless red figure emerges to caress them.  You've seen this before, and you try to pretend that you don't remember what happened to the last piece of food to see that tongue.  You throw your arms up questioningly, hoping for a perfectly good explanation that didn't involve you being digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\", Shelly pauses for effect, \"should probably run\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heed Shelly's advice.  As you sprint, you feel the ground shift toward the surely waiting mouth.  You can't help but glance over your shoulder, your eyes capturing sparkling white teeth digging into the rough brown floor a few feet from you.  A layer of pink flab follows up the initial assault on the pop tart, pulling just a bit more into the dankness of Shelly's mouth.  Luckily for you, she takes a few more seconds to finish off the corners left over from her first bite before advancing her attack.  You turn your neck back to its normal positioning, focusing on finding some way to escape this nightmare.  A dark shadow befalls you.  Without looking, you know this next bite is going to be cutting it close.</span></div></div>",

You try to slow down in time, but you are unable to avoid colliding into Shelly's left inside incisor.  The pop tart departs from the broken away portion on which you stand, abandoning you to your bleak fate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour holy brown platform pushes forward, toward the now rising front teeth.  You know what's about to happen.  Running to the edge opposite the chewing instruments intent on mashing your tiny form into even tinier bits.  In desperation, you make a mad leap for Shelly's active tongue, catching it by the tip.  All you can do is hold on to the shifty beast and pray Shelly doesn't bite her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the great white teeth, all of them roughly equal to you in height, begin to grind your former abode into mush.  Purple jam squirts from the tattered remains, helping you to picture your not-to-distant future as you swing at the mercy of the faceless whale to which you are clinging.  The tart soon becomes unrecognizable, a gooey substance of brown and purple splattering onto the deadly white linings which created, or rather uncreated, it.  It proves to be a mistake to focus on this development instead of your own situation, for your grip loosens and you are sent streaking straight into the warmed up jaws of your greatest fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly savors the pop tart with every chewing motion.  They are her favorite, after all.  Her eyes wander as her jaws raise and lower, devouring the delicious treat with great relish.  She readies for another bite, but she decides to check your progress first.  She stares blankly at the barren platform, her brain taking a minute to register the truth as she continues to chew.  Then, it finally hits her, and she stops chewing abruptly.  She immediately spits the contents of her mouth onto the kitchen table.  Her enormous fingerprints dig through the disfigured tart remains frantically in search of your hopefully intact body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tecco!\", Shelly cries out, \"Tecco, please be okay!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear her, so that's probably a good sign.  Your body feels a bit roughed up, but nothing is missing.  It is difficult for you to breath through the mound of slippery goo on top of you.  This problem is quickly remedied by Shelly's gigantic fingers brushing the obstacle away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?!\", Shelly's tone is frenetic, \"I was just playing around.  I didn't mean to...to\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears well in Shelly's eyes.  You figure you should stand up and show her your alright.  However, another thought crosses your mind.  Maybe you should \"play around\" with Shelly for a while.  Yeah, maybe you should just lay still and pretend you're not okay at all.  You admit that it is an immature thing to do, but you justify that she is the one who started it.</span></div></div>",

Warm breathe from directly above helps to keep you pinned in your lifeless pose.  The resulting gasp, no doubt caused by the realization that you are no bug, is of a deeper nature than you can associate with Shelly.  Leia has figured out what Shelly was shouting about.  Now it's time to see how much shouting she will do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God!\", the emotional trill in Leia's voice takes you by surprise, \"Is he really...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia's abrupt trail off leads into sobbing.  You feel a rounded tip of smooth, yet cutting rock poke into your torso with unintended forcefulness.  Your body almost slices into two pieces, but thankfully the pressure only lasts for about a second.  As for your body's reaction to the sudden jolt, you are somehow able to minimize its retracting reflexes.  You even manage to hold back the standard grunt tied to a swift punch to the stomach.  Your prank is still intact.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you take no pride in your skillful artifice.  Leia, a friend since long before your university days, is morning your death within your earshot.  You took pleasure in teaching young Shelly a mean, yet valuable lesson regarding your safety.  Leia has done nothing to merit such a cruel teaching, nor do you enjoy seeing (or hearing, in this instance) such a close friend suffer.  Maybe you've taken this thing just a bit too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry\", Shelly's sadness is muffled, \"I know how you felt about him, but...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold on, what's all this now?  Perhaps laying in wait a little while longer won't hurt things too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've had enough of this hear, but don't look business.  Your eyes open in a minor squint, assuring yourself that you're too small for such an action to register with the female titans overshadowing you.  Your vision is treated to Leia staring down at you with watery brown eyes, a sight unbecoming of her nature, you think.  Her hair, bunched in a pony tail of brunet, drapes across the front of her strong shoulders, which are blanketed in lime green.  A little wide, her feminine nose's mounded edge points straight at you.  Her entire face looks flushed, most likely do to the shock of finding you an inch tall and clearly dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also see a golden opportunity here.  Shelly's face is buried in her sister's chest, as is evidenced by the curtain of sienna shinning in the sun's window distorted rays.  You could easily let Leia in on the joke and still keep Shelly in the dark.  Then again, you're sort of curious about where the sister-to-sister chat pertaining to you is going to go, something you'll never know if Leia is clued in to your non-deceased condition.</span></div></div>",

However, your point does get across as Leia slaps her right hand on top of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia's eyes take you in with a mischievous glistening.  You smile back at her with a rascally expression.  You knew Leia would play along.  You've long been aware of her darker sense of humor, and would normally be annoyed at such musings.  Now, you are filled with eagerness to see how Leia will play her hand, so to speak.  You don't have long to wait, as Shelly's buried face comes up for air.

The least you could do is admit he tasted good.  You know, that would be a neat epitaph to have on a tombstone...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are barely able to contain your laughter.

At this scale, you can clearly spot the similarities between her face and Shelly's, but the more mature form certainly puts Leia into the upper levels of attractiveness, even if she currently domimates the sky like an airship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she whispers considerately, \"this would be why you weren't there at the exam yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, because -\" is all that you can manage before her hand drops down upon you, delicately manicured fingers gingerly prying you forth from the swampy remains of Shelly's breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are scooped up between the nails of the thumb and fore-finger, their ceramic surfaces worryingly sharp but surprisingly gentle - there is almost no pressure upon you!  Over your shock, you can still hear her voice: \"Tell me later.  Let's see about cleaning you up, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakes sense, you suppose.  Leia effortlessly lifts you over to the sink, where she contrives to open a cascading Niagra of hot water into a glass, placing the resultant vertical lake on the counter side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second hand moves in on you then, tearing, scratching.  You close your eyes and scream, but after a moment it is over, your body unharmed, if still soaked in jam.  But now you are naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia tore the clothes from your body as easily as she might pluck an errant eyelash from her face.  Still holding you steady in one hand, the other rolls your tattered rags into a tiny ball, quickly deposited into the endless depths of the kitchen's trash can.  You are wordless, and she merely smirks as she drops you into the glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't plunge under for very long, and bob to the surface fairly easily.  The meniscus of the liquid seems a lot more solid at your new scale, and it's akin to swimming in jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need a little help scrubbing yourself?\" Leia coos from the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you answer her positively or negatively?</span></div></div>",

Finally, after much inner deliberation, the older woman spoke: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Shelly, I don't know why in the world you decided to put that thing in your mouth -- and yeah, I said thing, since bugs don't even deserve to have a he-or-she label and I'm not even sure we could even tell its gender -- but I'm going to leave you to your own disgusting habits of sucking on bugs.

Well, I say pen-pal, but we've been communicating through e-mail and chatrooms, mostly.  Facebook, you know?  No, you probably don't do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe talks on for a few minutes more, fighting back the tears that are building up.  When it becomes too much, she places you back in your prison, and that's all you have to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is an interesting development.  You've been out of the loop for a decade, and are now going to be abandoned in the wilderness of a foreign country.  Not a turn that you'd wanted your life to take.  Why, oh why, all those years ago did you choose Leia to go to for salvation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, there's no point in dwelling on the past.  What's done is done, and you must merely make do with the hand that life has dealt you.  Even if it was from the bottom of the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that Shelly plans to transport you inside the selfsdame jewelry case that you are in now.  Only once more does she open it, to deposit some food without a word.  There's a substantial heap of it as well - enough to see you through a trans-continental flight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{We shall gloss over the details of the flight for the sake of brevity - those interested in the subject of shrinking aboard aeroplanes should perhaps check out The Friendly Skies at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1063744\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a> }<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rattling of the prison ceases.  Shelly must have reached her destination finally, and perhaps would be willing to open up the box to allow some fresh air into your stifling situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does, and her face tries its best to smile at you.  You see the worry behind it, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you scale her colossal, warming hand, but now instead of raising you to her face she lowers you to the ground, tilting slightly to tumble you off into the short grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Tecco,\" she says, and runs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have much time to right yourself before she's gone, at a speed that you couldn't hope to match, crunching easily across vast distances through the bamboo forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, bamboo.  The tall sticks sway up to the heavens far above you, like in one of those samurai movies.  Each direction looks the same, but surely Shelly's footprints should still be imprinted in the soft ground, giving you a trail to follow?  Maybe not back to her specifically, but back to civilisation in general.  There's no way that you're staying out here on your own - who knows what could happen...</span></div></div>",

She put you down on the table and she got up, telling you she'll get some tea and some snack. While you were waiting, you heard the door slide. It was tachibana and once she bowed to you, she closed the door and sat next to you. She was very cute and with moment of silence, she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I have talked with koharu sama about you..I'm sorry about what your friend have done.\" Tachibana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No sweat. She believed in what she believed in.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She thought for moment, and then you heard her belly rumble little. Tachibana blushed little as she put her hand on her stomach, you giggled. She sweated little with embarressement and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I'm sorry. I ahven't ate any breakfast this morning due to morning cleaning.\" Tachibana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You thought for moment and noticed one thing: What does the ladies guts look like from the inside? you then looked at her and asked a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say tachibana..would you think, that..you would like to swallow a person?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This made her surprised and made an 'hmph' noise from her.

Besides, it was Leia that you wanted to see, not her kid sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass through one of the mighty portals that regular people call doorways, and back onto a carpeted surface.

There's nobody here, at any rate, so you see no reason to stick around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn to leave, you hear a noise.  Probably too quiet for anyone else to have heard, but you caught it.  You peek over your shoulder, and see a terrible sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA face looks back at you, from atop the armrest of one of the chairs.  The eyes gleam even in the darkness, surrounded by matt-black fur.

It may want you to run, to make the chase all the more exciting and the kill more exhilerating, so perhaps you should stay still until it gets bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you'd be trapped here indefinitely.  If you took a chance and ran, there'd be a possibility that you could get protection from Leia's sister, but that all rests on you outdistancing a cat that could currently comfortably bring down an elephant as easily as a regular cat kills a mouse.</span></div></div>",

All hand-me-downs, she told you in the past.  She must have been trying to do her shoelaces up earlier, when you boarded, but got pushed out of the way by the crowd.  Being her height, she's been pushed around all her life.  Even Kath is taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you try and get her attention?  Or go now, now that you're safe? </span></div></div>",

The creepy smirk stretching her chapped red lips to their limits doesn't provide much ease to the tension building within you either.  Her sooty strands slither just past the forefront of her shoulders as she stares down at you with those beady dark pupils wrapped in dim ultramarine.  A mucronate nose anchors her gigantic flushed face at a slightly declining angle; all the better to see you with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Callie\", you try to reason, \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie is quick to cut you off, \"Nope!  It's my time to talk now.  YOU have to listen to ME\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\", you boldly defy Callie's command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost in slow motion, you watch Callie's tough-skinned right hand upsurge into view from behind her gorging knees.  As the ominous monster reaches the height of its ascent, its attenuated digits unify in ball form.  Creating a dark overcast in your general vicinity, the mighty fist hovers in the sky acting as an anti-sun to your cowering figure.  You decide an immediate evacuation from your current location is in order.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to run, the massive bolder of tanned epidermal fury starts to lower with surprising velocity.  The sound of gushing wind bending to the power of your impending doom resembles an unending burst of thunder.  With great force, Callie slams her coiled hand against the brunet earth mere yards from your position.  The ground quakes from the impact, helping your forward momentum to drive you from your feet.  You slide on your stomach, dirt sticking to your face as well as your clothing.  Callie raises her hand back to its perch on her lap.  The ground stops trembling.  You do not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are your ears broken?\", Callie taunts you, \"I just told you that it was my turn to speak, twerp.  You aren't going to muscle in on my turn anymore\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can return to a standing pose, Callie's dainty fingers tighten around your waist once again.  It is now that you realize she was actually being gentle the last time she grabbed you in this way, for her grip is now tortuous to say the least.  Your pelvis feels as though it is about to collapse under the enormous pressure of Callie's ripply thumb and index finger while she carries you back to her natural, yet moderately pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get a better look at you\", Callie snidely states, \"You took me by surprise earlier, and I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vacuum threatens to suck you into a great abyss below your dangling legs.  You recognize the audible repercussions of a sudden inhalation.  Both fear and relief fill you at Callie's gasping sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you!\", Callie exclaims, \"Why couldn't it have been one of those jerks instead\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you take it as a positive that you are in a different classification than \"those jerks\".  Now you can only hope that Callie remembers you as the nice guy that you think you are.</span></div></div>",

How do you like things on the short end of the stick for once, huh?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally dawns on you that Callie was a really bad choice for you to reveal yourself.  Not that you had much of a choice, though.  It wouldn't have mattered who she found at an inch high.  She feels like the world spits on her on a daily basis, and she's finally found someone to take it out on.  You can't blame her for channeling her frustrations out on you.  Actually you can (and do) blame her, but you can sympathize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently tired of waiting for your response to what you thought was a rhetorical question, Callie's darkly faded blue right oculus zooms closer to you.  Her unpainted lashes sway inches from your body with each movement of her lightly dosed in pink eye lid, generating a slight breeze to flow over you.  This normally relaxing sensation is ruined by the combination of the crushing of your hips and the mean streak in the frightfully large orb staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you too good to talk to me?\", Callie angrily interrogates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of c...course not\", you stammer a reply, \"I-I just...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie hisses at your pathetic attempt at conversation.  Her wrist flicks backward with little effort, sending a catapulting force through her hand.  The pulverizing grasp on your waist is promptly released.  For a split second, the relief of your midsection places your mind in a blissful state. The buildup of wind at your back is snaps you back to reality, however.  Gravity begins to pull you toward the waiting ground.  Your voice box fails to produce the shrieks you order it to unleash, leaving your mouth foolishly gaping without purpose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collision with the murky surface was brief, yet indescribably painful.  You land on your back, your buttocks luckily absorbing most of the impact.  Your head bashes against the dirt laden earth in the aftermath, but it seems to be alright (save the massive headache).  There is a throbbing in your left ankle, which came down awkwardly in your descent.  All in all, your just happy to have survived the free fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stand, but you struggle mightily in this endeavor.  Insidious impressions shoot through your lower body in the effort.  You do, however, manage to return to your feet.  Looking up, you see Callie watching your suffering giddily.  Man, she must have bottled up every mean thing ever said or done to her in anticipation of your pint-sized arrival into her life.  Her puny (by normal standards, mind you) fingers stroke her pointy chin as she no doubt plans what to do with you now.</span></div></div>",

Callie dangles you over the dull yellow contents of the bowl for a bit before dropping you.  It is with a strong sense of trepidation that you finally find the volume of your voice box, screaming at the top of your lungs throughout your great plunge.  The grainy sea of pale gold, complete with sketchy brown swirls at its center, absorbs your momentum as you involuntarily bore to its porcelain floor.  Your exhausted limbs struggle to pull you back to the surface, just barely succeeding at the daunting task before your lungs drown in this unsticky substance.  Unable to hold off your curiosity, your dry tongue licks your yellow stained lips, providing your taste buds with a long lost familiarity.  Applesauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorror washes over you at the sight of capacious argent scooper submerging into the far side your opaque ocean, its long extending handle giving you a means to track the mighty sea monster.  The oval sterling glossa rises from the depths with its bucketing edge coming fairly close to taking you with its ill fated cargo, the wave from its ascension almost pulling you under.  Sure enough, Callie's clenching fingers drag the cupping end of the spoon skyward, porting it into the black inside of her salivating mouth.  In a panic, you swim in desperate motions with your fatigued arms and legs, hoping to make it to the slightly inclining white high wall partitioning you from the world outside.  You know it is pointless; there's no way you can climb such a level structure, particularly since it lacks the footholds to make such a feat possible.  Yet you swim anyway, unable to accept your imminent fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit that\", Callie orders from on high, \"You're just wasting your energy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop\", you doubt your captress can hear your breathless words, \"I don't want to be eaten\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie does in fact hear you, \"I'm not going to eat you, moron.  You don't get off that easy.  Now eat up.  You're going to have a lot going on today, and I won't have you dying on me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should probably feel comforted by the fact that you have been assured safety from Callie's digestive tracts, but the promise of a long and likely painful day ahead of you allows a whole new feeling of dread to build in your stomach.  Speaking of stomach, you have no complaints obeying Callie's order to fill it.  You skipped out on breakfast, and obviously had to alter your plans to eat lunch after finishing your exam.  It is therefore without hesitation that you lower your mouth the the top of the sauced liquid and suck in greedily.  Of course, each dive of Callie's eating utensil provides you with more than enough unrest to prevent you from enjoying the feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, Callie stops eating the applesauce, apparently having her fill.  This means that you have had your fill as well, whether you like it or not.  After all, someone as big as Callie shouldn't be expected to wait on someone as tiny as yourself, right?  The mouth of her spoon makes a final swoop into the light lemon body of water, scooping you up along with a mouthful's worth of the near tasteless food.  You are placed in front of Callie's now moist lips, but they thankfully deny passage to your transport.  They do, however, address you inconsiderately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now\", a creepily cheery voice emerges from the dark cavern before you, \"Let's get on with the next activity, shall we?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please\", you beg, \"Can't we talk about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie seems amused by the idea, \"Fine.  Say your piece.  It probably won't do you any good, but it might make me laugh a little\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her less than reassuring comment, you are determined to talk your way out of this situation.  However, you are stuck between two approaches to take with your gigantic tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you could try to remind Callie that you are her friend.  She really seems to have calmed down since your initial encounter, so she might be more logical and receptive.  Though you have to admit that she appears to still be taking joy in your suffering.  It may be a waste of your golden opportunity to walk (or rather talk) down this path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could beg for forgiveness.  Sure, you have nothing to be sorry about, but that's rather moot at this point.  Maybe if you express regret over whatever it is Callie thinks you've done to her, she'll take pity on you.  Of course, an admission of guilt would likely place you into the \"jerk\" category you were oh-so-happy avoid earlier.  If she doesn't accept your false apology, it may only serve to make things much, much worse for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you'd best hurry.  Who knows how long you'll have Callie's ear.</span></div></div>",

Could that be it?  Did Callie have a crush on you, and you never noticed?  No wonder she's pissed at you.  But this may be a way out of this dire situation.  Perhaps you could fake admiting to your own unrequited longing for her in turn, although the consequencesof being caught out toying with her emotions would be huge.  And probably fatal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other option would be to apologise some more, and perhaps confront Callie on hiding her feelings, accusing her of being too timid to act on them.  That risks angering a giantess, but if she realises just how much she's over-reacting, you may yet save yourself.</span></div></div>",

Spinning around, you look up from Callie's bare feet - crushing down carpet strands upon which you skip - to her snarling face.

First she locates the geographical location of her target, then she sets the field intensity and then that field is projected to and generated at the target so only the target is affected and nothing inbetween.

Once you grab on, you hold on tight, as Lauren continues to wildly fidget her feet about. You can even hear the leather creak and moan, as Lauren continues to take her stress out on her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you persevere, and slowly climb up the tall boot, trying your best to avoid falling off, because landing on the floor right now would definitely cause your death. Eventually though, you make it up to the top of Lauren\u2019s boot, and you take a chance to rest, before moving on. There was a patch of bare skin between the edge of the boot, and her skirt, but you thought that you\u2019d be able to scale it none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, right around when you were taking your much needed break, Lauren felt like her leg was itching, so she begins to rub her boots together, causing you to being to lose your balance. The incredibly loud sound of leather rubbing together started to hurt your ears, but you couldn\u2019t cover your ears and hold on at the same time. You remain on the boot, but you were not prepared for what was about to happen next, as Lauren still didn\u2019t feel like her itch was going away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mumbles, saying \u201cThis exam is bad enough already\u2026\u201d She then reaches for the boot that you were on, and you notice that she had green nail polish on, to relieve the itch once again. She shoves her fingers in the boot, causing you to lose your balance even more, and you struggle to remain standing. And now that her boot was slightly open, a strange yet distinct scent washed over you. It wasn\u2019t incredibly overpowering or anything, but it was enough that you could assume that it would smell incredibly more potent down inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n If you fell into the boot, things would get pretty scary, but it could also be pretty fun as well, depending on how things went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you keep your balance, or fall into the tan boot?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You try to keep your balance, but it doesn\u2019t help, as Lauren roughly scratches at her leg, causing you to feel a miniature earthquake. You fall into the space that just formed between the boot and her leg, quickly plummeting into total darkness, as Lauren\u2019s fingers fade away from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, there was enough space for you to land right onto the top of her foot, and her thick sock broke the fall for you. But she noticed your impact, as she mumbled \u201cNow I\u2019m itching all over\u2026\u201d She skillfully pops her foot out of the boot just enough for her hand to fit inside, as you fall right in front of her sock clad toes.<br>\r\nAs the sound of nails scraping against cotton filled your ears, you look down and notice a number \u201812\u2019, which made you think that you were going to have a wild time while being stuck in Lauren\u2019s boot. While she happily scratches against the top of her foot, her toes wiggle furiously, causing bits of cotton to fall all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spring into action, realizing that things would surely go bad if you stayed where you were, so you run back toward where the toe section was, ignoring the growing odor. And as you ran, you noticed just how soft and comfortable the insole felt, which probably was valued by Lauren herself. But about halfway toward the toe section, Lauren started to put her boot all the way back on, which freaked you out as a massive, mammoth-like, beast seemed to be chasing you. <br>\r\nHer toes quickly overran you, and proceeded to drag you the rest of the way, until you found yourself pinned under her 3rd and 4th toes. And they carried a heavy odor, as Lauren\u2019s constant fidgets, made her feet sweat a bit more. And that, combined with her general discomfort toward the exam, which caused her to sweat even more with worry, created a very strong smelling and overwhelming experience for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were continually pressed under her toes, as they happily used you as their personal stress toy, while Lauren herself was none the wiser. They would grind you under her somewhat sweaty insole, roughly rub into you, and even squeeze you between them. And the constant fidgeting did not stop, which kept you thoroughly disoriented, as it caused you to be tossed all around the toe section, getting to know each of her curious and aggressive toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her smallest pinky toe would ruthlessly have its way with you, absolutely dominating you, while effortlessly squeezing you between their moist and sweaty joints. And during all of this madness, Lauren was beginning to focus on the exam and she felt like she was actually making progress. She still didn\u2019t feel totally sure of herself, but she felt like she wasn\u2019t going to fail the exam, which she was worried about before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stuck in her boot for about an hour, being subjected to insane levels of torture and attention by her vigorous and energetic toes, while Lauren diligently worked on her exam. But through it all, you enjoyed yourself, as those toes never failed to ignore you. You really felt like her toes enjoyed your company, as they continued to play with and lovingly abuse you in more and more creative ways. And once she finished, she happily stomped her feet, practically knocking the wind right out of you, before she started to happily stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her long legs reach out as far as they could, while her toes ruthlessly clenched and squeezed into you, before standing up. She stood up to her full height, which was fairly tall, as she was around 6 ft. Lauren was a pretty fair skinned woman, with a decent amount of freckles, as well as green eyes which complimented her long orange hair. And now that she was standing, you were subjected to her full weight and pressure, which really tested your endurance. You were impressed that you were still okay, as you would have figured that being stood on by an already tall giantess would have easily ended your tiny existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lauren was finished, she handed her paper to one of the exam proctors, before she walked out of the room, to enjoy the rest of her day. And while she walked, you were taken for a crazy ride, as you were subjected to incredibly intense forces of gravity. Whenever she would lift her foot, you\u2019d find yourself practically pulled deeper into the soft and moderately damp sock, and when she would bring the foot back down, you would be harshly smothered under that moist sock material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she walked, she thought that she felt something in her shoe, but she wasn\u2019t really sure one way or the other. Plus, she just got done a painful exam experience, so she didn\u2019t feel like messing with her boots until she got home at least. And Lauren was hungry, so she wondered if she should go grab some grub, as a celebration that she got through the exam. But she also had some things to check out at the library, so she wondered if she should go there instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Lauren go, and therefore bring you to in the process\u2026?</span></div></div>",

You try to peek up for any new detail of your carrier, but from this angle, nothing presents itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer hips stir.  Her hands spring.  She swings a handbag from beneath her arm.  Then, a faint sound echoes from behind the door, the desperate ringing of a phone, and the woman jumps to haste.  Her legs fall and rise anxiously as she hurriedly fumbles through her bag, digging for the most elusive housekey while the phone cries again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour head rattles up and down, side to side, as you attempt to hold yourself even more steadily to her erratic panic patterns.  The blood within is thrown from your head to your feet so rapidly in this rollercoaster, dizziness wraps itself tightly onto the handlebars of your vision.  As a fourth or fifth ring calls out, she succeeds in finding the key and swings her handbag away.  It sways around and smacks down just inches from you, though you'd swear it struck you by the stars you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman inserts the key quickly, and pushes herself through the door, leaving it wide open behind her, all in a bid to receive a single call.  She bounds through the room with bouncing steps, her buttocks swinging wide with each leap.

But is there somewhere that you can throw up from this distressing motion sickness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresumably no one will ever notice the small amount of puke that you hurl over the side of the shoe, but can you expect this woman to ever notice your half-inch tall self?  You could stay with her - throughout her shattering walk home - only to be ignored when you get there.  Or you could jump ship now, and try your luck elsewhere.

In your day you had to put up with - but no, you're not going to get distracted now. And you're certainly not going to start talking like your father...), and at your size you can feel every tremor in the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise is now dressed in a white nightgown of about knee height, and is clearly preparing to climb into bed. Without thinking, you rush over to her, sprinting flat out. if you should so much as take a step in the wrong direction, you'd be history... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a leap you manage to clamber aboard the little toe of her right foot, and hold on across the one next to it. You're sure that she must have felt your impact (you certainly did), but she continues with her business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold on for dear life as the foot is raised, higher than it ever was while it wore shoes. You take in the intoxicating smell of it, and then suddenly wonder why you did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leg swings over onto the bed, and you are thrown loose. You land on soft white surface without injury, but then the rest of Louise's body comes crashing down upon the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are buffeted around, and lucky not to be totally flattened under her bulk. Then everything goes dark. Looking up, you see that Louise has pulled her quilt over herself, nothing out of the ordinary, nothing to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seem to have ended up pretty much where you began, next to her foot. Judging from its position, bearing in mind that it's dark, you judge that she is lying on her side. As you could never hope to lift the incredible weight of the sheet, you are forced to stick close to where she lies in order to keep under the tent-like space that spreads about an inch (her scale) from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up her, rubbing one hand along her leg as you go. You're amazed at how smooth it is; you'd never have guessed that she was THIS anal retentive about shaving her legs. It feels good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass into a darker area, now under both the quilt and the nightdress. Ahead, you see that she is wearing panties as well. You obviously have a mission to accomplish here (survival), but strange feelings come over you again, feelings that you haven't felt before...</span></div></div>",

One is pressed up against the bed, the other hangs from the air above you almost of its own accord.

Hitching up a bag onto her shoulder - seems both girls have gotten dressed sometime while you were asleep - she heads to the door.  \"Well, you have fun, both of you.  See you back here tonight!  And I expect no complaining on my choices, since you passed on contributing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winks, twirling once in her yellow summer-dress before exiting.  Laura gives you a wry smile in her palm before hefting you back to her ear.  \"Take a seat there,\" she insists, \"but keep quiet unless there's anything important you need to tell me.  Answers would be good as well, I guess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Laura's relatively short hair means that it blocks none of your vision, so while your heightened spot sees the world pass by with a sideways motion, you can at least get a good view of it all.  As the woman heads to her exam, you marvel at the living skyscrapers that zoom past, the bizarre scale at which otherwise ordinary scenery appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lasts until Laura hefts her phone to block you.  For a moment you are annoyed, until you realise that she's done it so that she can speak with you without looking crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, really,\" she says, her voice vibrating the entirety of the ear around you, trembling your tiny form, \"why the exam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figured I could visit the place where I was big one last time.  Kiss goodbye to my old life before properly starting anew with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet.  And don't worry - we'll get some food right after, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce within the cavernous hall itself, the memories come flooding back.

You can even see the very seat that you were due to use, currently being approached by a bespectacled girl who -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl suddenly diminishes, shrinking out of sight before your very eyes!  It's shocking, her body contorting and compressing so painfully...  Why has no-one else noticed?  A man directly behind her keeps walking as if nothing had happened!

It sweeps outward, and an upward glance shows Laura's eyes returning your stare, head uptilted so as not to draw attention.  Then you turn and gesture across the room's vast expanse, and the giant stands from her seat.  Fearing a fall, you scuttle down the thumb's length to the plain of her palm, looking over the edge to the far ground as the walking commences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose sandalled feet, taking such careful steps, don't look that massive from this removed distance.  As you clutch tightly to the woman's smooth skin, you have to remind yourself that each of those toes alone is far bigger than your half-inch tall frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ground rushes closer as Laura bends to the floor before the desk, her free hand shooting forward as she gasps.  \"Well, whaddaya know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers deposit another shrunken human next to you as she stands again, that girl in the glasses.  Only she's not as small as you would have imagined - as she looks about herself with panicked eyes, she's still twice your size!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were originally shrunk to an inch high too!  Blinking, she looks across to you, her words barely audible over Laura's stammered excuse about dropping a pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?  Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Questions can be answered later,\" Laura pronounces from above, \"and I'll be thankful if you don't start yakking in my ear.  You should be safe down there for a couple of hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looks up at the source of the voice, and seeing the giant woman whose hand she sits in, she lets out all her panic.  Even as Laura neatly places the two of you on her lap as she sits, her jeans and the desk itself hiding you from casual view, the recently shrunk girl screams.  A little adrenaline carried her through the initial shock, but now it's full-on panic mode.  She starts to run away from you, away from Laura, looking to jump or climb to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a real bad idea, but she's a big girl; proportionally, she's like twelve feet tall to you, and could do you some serious damage if you attempted to restrain her.  But you can't just let her run off unsupervised into a lethal giant world...</span></div></div>",

You startled her the first attempt, so now you need to handle this with kid gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThump.  Something impacts in front of you, and you jump in shock.  Upon closer examination, the pooled substance would appear to be a grainy splodge of liquid, of an off-mustard hue.  Casting your gaze upwards, neck arched back as far as you dare, you notice Louise absently wiping at the chin with the back of one street-smashing hand.  Her eyes are only half open, as is her mouth when the low moan rips free from it, carrying down to you like an ominous portent of doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is it.  Now or never.  Her eyes are diverted, downcast, and you may not get another chance like this.  You wave your hands above your head, jumping and shouting at the same time, and find the attracted scrutiny of the giantess drawn your way, eyes zeroed in on you like spotlights, almost accusing in their focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More bugs?\" Louise mutters.  \"Listen, buddy, I don't have time for this right now.  I'm not messing around now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had you at bugs - had you preparing to run, that is.  But you cannot outdistance this vastly superior person's nonchalent grab, finger and thumb smashing either side of you with enough raw power to shatter many of the bones in your body.  Your mangled body is then hoisted high into the air as Louise stands, dragging the air from your lungs with that everyday motion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the pain, you blinkingly notice the toilet bowl below you, a mixed ocean of water and vomit swirling greedily, waiting for Louise to drop you in to join it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm too hungover to be scared of you,\" Louise says, dragging you back before her face one more time, washing you in breath that is rancid and foul, issued forth from a cavernous mouth full of tremendous teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your final hope; she's bringing you before her face one last time before disposing of you.

My.  God,\" she breathes at last, and you'd let out your own sigh of relief were it not for the velocity at which you are suddenly borne away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are lowered, realtively gently, onto a flat, wooden surface.  Your limbs give out and you sprawl, leading to the moon above you to take on a concerned expression, face creasing new valleys as Louise furrows her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" she booms across at you, adding ears to the list of damaged parts.  \"I didn't see what you were!  I'm still not quite sober...  Wait there - I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait here.  As if there was any way in which you could escape, with your fractured, useless legs.

You must be lying on her desk, you conclude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArousal stirs slightly in you - reminding you that you're alive - as you observe her rooting around for something, her posterior moving in interesting ways before your very eyes.  Sure, to you her arse is large enough to roll over entire suburbs, but it's still perfectly formed, and not covered by much in the way of clothing.  If you were to die, this would be a last sight you'd be willing to accept...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your view is blocked out as someone steps before you.  Someone of the same size as you, wearing dark glasses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you've had enough time to think over my offer,\" he says.  \"Looks like you aren't enjoying your current stature much.  Would you like to cease this foolish resistance and come with me, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy is he still trying to tempt you?

If he needs you to acquiesce, that leaves you a measure of power, no matter how small that may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and a normal-sized protector.  You raise your voice to call out to Louise, to bring her to your aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scream all you want,\" he sneers.  \"Your voice won't carry far enough at this size.  But if you think that a half-inch is the smallest you can get, you'd be surprised.  Not that I'd ever threaten you, of course.  It's just that I really think it would be in your best interests to come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what's it to be?</span></div></div>",

With him goes your pain, and you stand up to find your body in, more or less, full working order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the world around you is far, far larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shrinking your body down even further, your broken parts must have been tightly knitted together as they were compacted.

Better not ask questions like that; if you're alive, you shouldn't question the physics of the situation too deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vastness of Louise returns to the desk, crossing the country of her dorm-room carpet in seconds, and looming larger now than she ever has before, in any of the three previous scales at which you've regarded her.  She lays one hand flat, palm-down, on the surface not too far from your position, and while her fingers were mighty redwoods in their previous incarnation, now the simple distance up to the fingernail of her pinky is closer to that height.  A millimetre must be bigger than you, you reckon.  Her eyes, moons themselves where once her head filled that role, scan back and forth around your position, refusing to focus on your diminished self.  Crap, unless she's specifically looking for someone your size, she's just gonna glance over you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is no more thought, as Louise speaks, her voice carrying down from the heavens with such volume as to drown out all else.  \"Hello?\"  she says, haltingly.  \"Where did you -  No, of course it wasn't there, Lou.  It couldn't have been, could it?  You're seeing things.  Clearly working too hard.  Crap!  I'm going to miss my day job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that last statement she rises to her full height, hurridly withdrawing her hand and whipping you from your feet with the air currents.  A second job? you muse as you push yourself upright again.  Damn, she's busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo kidding.  You watch the goddess as she hurridly shrugs clothes on and gets ready to leave.  It's the sheer scale of her endeavours that makes it enthralling.  Before, there was a mild curiosity involved in watching a human being the size of a skyscraper go about their daily business, but now that you can quite confidently think of yourself as a speck there's a certain requirement to observe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dominates the room.  Too big to draw any real-world size comparisons now, the simple fact is that she can't be ignored, avoided or escaped.  The breasts that she all-too-quickly conceals beneath a black t-shirt could serve as hilltop settlements for entire communities of people your size, and each thread of the denim in the jeans that she is pulling up over her shapely legs is probably thicker than your torso.  Quick movements, great distances, and a strength that staggers you - the girl is so far above you now that you almost begin to doubt your own existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise is yakking on her cellphone as she drags on sneakers.  \"Yeah, I know I'm running late, but you can delay filming for a little bit right?  I'm on my way now!  Oh, and you wouldn't believe what I saw this morning!  It was like a little half-inch tall guy on my desk!  I know!  Guess I'm getting into character already!  Ha-ha!  'Kay, see you shortly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what she's talking about, but the fact that she's going to leave shortly is plain.  If you wanted to go with her, you'd better make some attempt, like getting up to the handbag that she's left on the desk, almost a mile away from your current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, if you're really regretting refusing that mysterious guy's offer this time, maybe you should leave the goddess-that-can't-see-you-at-your-new-size alone and just wait here, thinking of some other plan.</span></div></div>",

The whole area shakes as the bag thumps angrily to the ground.  It may have been a gentle lowering to the giants outside, but in your scale it's a monumental catastrophe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's no surprise that you have fallen loose from your hiding place, scattered to the floor amongst scraps of dust and fluff.  Monolithic items whose familiarity you just can't place at the moment rise above you, defining the landscape with their jutting angles and weighty presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose may be voices you hear outside, but it's hard to make out exactly what's being said.  Louise may just have said 'let's do it,' but it could just as easily have been 'that's stupid.'  That second sentiment matches your current situation most aptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes again, more peacefully this time around, and you find yourself hesitantly approaching the cascading light that enters from your right, through the upended opening of the bag.  Cooped up for so long in shadow, it would be nice to experience its lack once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, the journey takes time, and even as the tempting beacon is bathing you in its radiance, bringing blinks to your eyelids with its intensity, you can hear a sentence that's not ambiguous in anyway, shouted as it is by some man:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would someone please get that bag off the set?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have seconds in which to worry about what you should do before a tremendous impact carries the floor, ceiling and walls away from you - while the bag may have been kicked away or whatever, you were left trailing in its wake, ejected outwards into the wider world whether you like it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bellowed word 'action' is the accompaniment to your dazed recovery, as your eyes adjust to the new lighting and you check yourself for injuries.  Luckily, it's nothing too serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up to inspect your surroundings, and find yourself sitting in a giant street.  It's all outsize, way too large for a person of your stature to interact with, but as you examine it further you see that it's not as outscale as you'd have imagined.  Where previously you were less than a millimetre tall, as you measure yourself against the height of a postbox you are overjoyed to see yourself able to be measured in inches again!  It's a small start, but it does show that the process you underwent is reversing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to find help, and protection in this shuddering world.  You keep your head lowered to prevent the awesomeness of the skyscrapers overwhelming your senses, but dash full out toward the stationary foot of a business-suited man.  When you've reached his toe, you jump up and down, waving your hands in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe makes no move, no sound.  He stands perfectly still.  Suspiciously so.  Climbing up onto his shoe to perhaps attract the doofus' attention, you notice that it has no shoelaces.  In fact, it blends seamlessly into his ankle and trouser-leg, as if there were no flesh beneath and he was in fact - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's not real, you realise, as you register the trembling in the fake sidewalk and hang your head.  You haven't been grown at all, remaining the height you were previously.  Instead, this is some toy landscape, put up here as part of Louise's day job, whatever it is that she does to get money in and pay her debts.  It involves a model set and a film crew, so what's her role?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down the 'street', an immense, regular-sized foot pushes around from behind a skyscraper, a high-heeled and open-toed shoe hanging underneath it.  Slowly it lowers on top of a model car, applying pressure to burst it open and crush it as a deliberate process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second foot glides neatly in alongside, and somewhere, so far above that you're almost lying on your back to register it, a bikini-clad Louise places hands on hips and announces her intention to destroy the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot damn, it seems that she films macrophile movies in her spare time, and you're on the set of one.  She fully intends to crush every little person she finds, unaware that there's a genuine shrunken man, impossibly beneath her notice, right there amongst them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps now would be a good time to run.</span></div></div>",

They are not big, you are small, and so they stride about at regular speed, making them more dazzling and awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise lumbers.  In her role as a giantess, she steps with slowness, her feet rising majestically above the street, allowing you to luxuriate in the motions of her muscles before those muscles come thundering down, toy cars shattering as impacts ripple up her calves.  Far, far above, Louise claws her fingers, snarling like Godzilla as she surveys the tiny scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tear your eyes away from the titan, but your ears cannot shut out the noise of her roars and steps, the crushing of the toy props beneath her, the shuddering through your bones.  Get her attention...  The cars are getting crushed, the buildings are getting - yes, that explosion was her sitting on one, gushing downwards in height beneath irresistible weight.  No, the only object here that may not be destroyed is this human effigy.  A victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScuttling up to the manniquin, you clutch tight to its foot as Louise finally walks in your direction, again that slow, shuddering pace, now with words toppling from above, promising revenge on the man, death at her hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops, feet either side, toes flexing as she sizes up her opponent, still reciting a list of his sins against her.  You can see up her legs, and now realise why they were shaved so smooth.  The cameras out there must be zooming in for great macro detail, no room for any rogue hairs.  Although at your newer scale, there'll probably be some that you could see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shoe is kicked to one side, scattering toy cars briefly before a bare foot - hanging in the air long enough for the viewer to luxuriate in its freed textures - swoops downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToes clutch at the statue above you, walls of flesh with craggy cliff-faces sporting toe-jam, squeezing close around...

Perhaps a whimper escapes as the canyon closes, effortlessly pressing against the figurine, close enough for you to make out the maze of prints encasing each deathly digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a screech as the impressive skin smooshes onto the plastic, deforming around it in an incredible fashion.  Gravity gives way as the foot hefts your platform heavenward, and you smile to yourself once again.  Louise's foot - you've seen it at so many scales now!  From when you were normal, to stumbling across her in the bar at an inch, riding it home at half-an-inch and now seeing its mere toes as deities in their own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeities that wrest the titanic sculpture you hold onto up with ease!  Louise is clearly still trying to emulate the ponderous movements of an actual giant, but still it's an incredible rush to be so lifted.  And to just gaze at the textures of the toes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's a loud hum, and you look over your shoulder to see the slithering tongue of Louise massaging her lips, and once again the toes seem very small.  How is she flexible enough to get her foot this close to her face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, looks like you've achieved your goal in one way.  There's the face of the goddess, the one that brought you here, that saw you as human, just for a moment - and now she's a ravenous demon, words slurring from her mouth as she hams up her role:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't you look good enough to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she's talking to the toy between her toes rather than you, but you'll be along for the ride if you're not careful.</span></div></div>",

You can barely hear the words yourself, so loud is the sound of her delighted moans of pleasure at the thought of devouring so small a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther demonstrating her flexibility, her foot and mouth meet, a whale-sized tongue lashing at the statuesque miniature, running up and down its surface a number of times.  At the foot end you are spared the saliva, but can still hear the creaking of the fragile plastic beneath the exertion of that powerful muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you attempt verbal contact, as the tongue is lowered, allowing the full majesty of Louise's maw to gape wide before you, rows of teeth lining an entrance from which gushes a stinking wind of breath.  Such heat emanating from that dark, dripping cavern...  Now your voice turns to a scream as you are plunged inside the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the moaning is all around you, in pitch darkness as the tongue smashes your shelter back and forth, grinding against teeth with nightmarish force.  No one could blame you for losing your grip, falling against something wet, gooey and infinitely stronger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it's enough to push you to your limit and beyond.  Now you're not only shouting, but bashing away with arms and legs, all your strength directed against the uncaring mass of Louise's tongue.  She won't even notice as she kills you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the mouth opens again, light gushing in to add being blinded to the laundry list of hurts you've suffered.  Sound crushes against you as well as you're ejected from the mouth with a cough, crashing against a surface in a splatter of saliva.  With slowness born of internal injury, you wipe goo from your eyes and look around, finally hearing some sense from the words of the gods above you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no bugs,\" Louise snarls.  \"I'm not eating bugs.  You think you can get away with sneaking them in and I won't notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't!  It must have gotten there by accident!  Let me see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surface you lie upon rises into the air and, scared, you roll to your back, looking up at Louise and a similarly gigantic man looking right back down.  Feeling exposed, you look to either side, beholding the ridged landscape of Louise's fingertip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not an insect at all...\" the man gasps.  \"It's... a little man?  Oh, we're going to be rich...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found him,\" Louise insists, \"and you're not getting him without me being along for the ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so you've been spotted - but is this how you want it to be?  Neither of these people wants to help you get back to normal, and you're almost glued to the tip of this finger...  Should you go to the effort of trying to escape?</span></div></div>",

It is a good, long while before you can bring yourself to lower your gaze enough to make out the still towering toes, shoes discarded off to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA step forward, then two.  These appendages loom over a dozen storeys tall.  How do they expect you to scale even the smallest of those, let alone the leg and beyond?  Still, with the feeling of that immense camera-eye on you constantly, you'd better try to show them the worth of not crushing you like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach the base of the toe, where the flesh mass curves upward, the ridges are almost equal to you in height, a rising strata of platforms.  Peering closer, the building blocks of this living cliff-face become apparent: the individual skin cells making up Louise's surface are visible, and strong enough to provide hand holds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving your bodyweight up as you climb grits your teeth, brings your breath gasping out.  So long as Louise can resist the urge to wriggle these massive monsters this is totally possible!  Of course, you'll need to rest for a week to get these burning muscles back under control...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're nearing the top, but as your left hand reaches up, it slaps against something hard, smooth and cold.  It retracts instinctively, and for a moment you dangle from one arm, almost losing your fight with gravity.  An effort of will, and you wench your fingers back into the skin, saving yourself a fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Hell was that?  Are they messing with you, is there no way to pass their test?  Why would they -  No.  Wait.  Relax.  It's just her toenail!  Nothing to worry about.  Its solid surface will present an obstacle, but forewarned you can bypass it.  Just... how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dangling, you weigh up the choices before you.  One way would be pushing yourself along the side of the toe, into the stinking canyon of flesh separating it from the next, shimmying across until you reach a nail-less surface to pull yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the dank stench, why would you put yourself through that?  An alternative would be to bring yourself to the very edge of the nail, the fresher skin peeling from underneath it, and heave yourself over in one effort, onto the smooth surface.</span></div></div>",

Tolerable enough that you'd been able to get to sleep, even!  That was when you were a mighty half-inch tall; now you're far, far smaller, and as you edge along to the space between two toes - a mighty gulf indeed! - it's almost unnoticeable.  In fact, besides the strain on your arms as you pull yourself along the ridges in Louise's skin, there's no real hardship.  This climb will just take time, that's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence you live in - save for your own grunts and heavy breathing - is shattered by a voice from on high, the mouths of the gods.  \"Little bastard's crawling out of sight!  Hey, Louise, could you maybe raise your toe or something?  We need him on camera!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, chief!\" You cease your climbing as the skin surface before you rumbles, followed by the sound of a tremendous impact behind you, tonnes of flesh and bone slapping down hard.  Risking a glance over your shoulder, You see that the tremendous form of Louise's big toe, the one form her other foot, is pressing down on the toes behind you.  Even as you watch, it nudges closer and bends, its gleaming nail working its way underneath the toe you cling to, pushing you upwards along with your climbing surface!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there he is!\" laughs the cameraman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Louise giggles.  \"Now hurry up, little dude - I can't stand like this all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering, you turn from the behemoth behind you to focus on the relatively tiny toe you cling to.  Its such a short distance to get atop it, and you pause to raise your arms in triumph.  With a laugh, Louise retracts her big toe, and the surface you stand on drops precipitously.  As you lurch, your arms grab out for support, clinging tight to the first thing they find.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen things finally subside and you open your eyes, you see that you have grabbed onto a dark, curled hair that sprouts from the toe - something normally invisible on such a beautiful woman!  There a only a few of them, that you duck under as you start on your trek toward the ankle.  Her skin is firm beneath you, save when you pass by the under-surface veins.  There, the constant surging blood makes it shift ever so slightly -  and you make it your business to step around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead, Louise's ankle stretches upwards, past shin to a knee impossibly high...  Doubt increases with every step closer you take.  It took so much effort just to mantle one of her toes!  Her leg itself is a sheer column, smooth and hairless as you discovered last night, lacking the climbing ridges her toeprint sported.  With no plateaus to rest on, your arms will be constantly supporting your weight.  Surely they can't seriously be expecting you to scramble all the way up there?  They must have been joking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they've had their laugh, got their test footage - perhaps now is the time to turn and face the gods commanding your fate and tell them you're going no further today?  But if they're not joking, things could get bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should climb up as far as you can - maybe they're waiting for you to tire and fall before they cut off this trial, and are ready to step in and save you.

Is that... Louise's saliva?  Then the hulking mass presses against you, not from above but head-on, and as soon as the liquid of the woman's spit touches you you adhere to it, stuck fast and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings her hand back up again, at a speed that would fling you away, were your pathetic body not so easily held captive by her spit.  She slows near the end, and the indomitable, sexy mountain of her face comes into focus, a smile slowly carving its way upward as her lips part.  Of course, crushing you would have been too simple, she's clearly going to finish what she started and devour you, a speck swallowed down into her gut's abyss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did good, boy,\" she whispers, \"but you should rest for now.  Mama has work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's... sparing you?  The finger lifts you up, past a wink from her eye, and zooms closer to a mass of dark, tangled cables.  One buffets you as it comes in close, and you reach out with your arms to fend it off, taking hold and clinging to it as the throbbing heat and weight of Louise's finger is finally released from you, leaving you held a countless distance from the ground by this tight network of hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing about to orient yourself, you can see the film crew ahead of you, shrugging at the giantess' actions, and if you dare to peer down, past her nose, her torso, down her legs to her feet, you can see the toy city spread out before her.  Here, sitting on her eyebrow, you'll get a god's eye view of the devastation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can get back to the new guy later, okay?\" Louise placates the creatives, her voice vibrating the very surfaces around you, but prevented from being deafening.  \"Let's just finish what we came to do today.  I have a life outside being a space goddess, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey grumble, but they return to their positions, checking lighting and cameras as Louise brings her hands up past you, brushing her hair back  and readying for her close-up.</span></div></div>",

Words spill from her mouth, promises of revenge and destruction, and then it begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor such a vast creature she moves with inhuman speed, those feet at the end of those lengthy legs smashing through the walls of buildings, kicking aside cars with each step.  Then the streets get closer as the woman crouches, her hand reaching for one of the gigantic miniature figures.  She brings it close to her face, just below you and ahead of her mouth: there she goes over more elaborate and intimate threats, ones that strike all too close to your tiny heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CUT!\" yells the director.  \"We'll get the clean model for the mouth work, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" sighs Louise, rising to stand and again putting you into the sky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the meantime, how about you hand over that tiny guy, huh?

I'd shrink you so fast, your head would spin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the flicker of fear that passes across the immense face of the director, you can see that, for just a brief moment, he contemplates the possible reality of the fantasy he's peddling, a fantasy that has already become a nightmare for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt passes as he smirks again, muttering \"stupid bitch,\" but you begin to wonder yourself.  Barring your initial incident in the exam, both times you've shrunk further have been in the presence of Louise.  Sure, a tiny man in a black suit did it, but is she somehow a factor..?</span></div></div>",

You close your eyes just to lessen the sensory barrage. As suddenly as it started, the movement stops. Two massive shapes - fingers, you realize - feel you out and tear you from the liquid that so impenatrably ensnared you. <br>\r\nYou open your eyes to find a vast expanse of mirror, stretching 50 feet high.

You'd barely gotten over the whole inch-tall experience, and the adjusting to being half that size is overwhelming at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen next the foot crunches to the ground, you take your opportunity to roll away and free, thudding to the pavement and allowing the bar-maid and her friend to pass on their way with all the haste their impossibly long legs allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's night, you hurt and almost everything in this world is a danger.  At the moment though, the most pressing concern is the need to rest and sleep.  In the morning, perhaps all of this will seem better.  It couldn't really get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are probably better - safer, certainly - shelters out there, but given that you don't want to waste a whole bunch of time looking for them, you settle for the first discarded cola can that you can find.  Slurping up a little of the sugary liquid clinging to the rim for sustenance, you crawl into the darkened interior for some shut-eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust have to hope nobody kicks this can idly, and that you wake up before street cleaners carry it away, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, your dreams that night are filled with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning finds you sticky and scared, but refreshed at least.  The cacophony disturbing you can only be the regular folk of the world outside going about their business, and since daylight is trickling through the ringpull opening you decide to venture outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe louder, constant drone is what really piques your interest, and when you finally emerge, blinking, you get an explanation; the rushing blurs ahead of you appear to be the source. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd just gotten over the size of PEOPLE in this crazy giant world, but compared to cars they're nothing. You find it hard to comprehend how something so vast could move so fast, smashing past and leaving sound and fury in their wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo mesmerised are you by this spectacle that you fail to notice the approach of two people. You only spot them when they are practically upon you, the nearest foot crunching only a couple of your feet away from you. The impact gets your attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar-maid was the only person you'd really been acquainted with at your newer, smaller size, and so you are awed all over again by the five-toed structure that looms over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt (and its paired colleague) is wearing a sandal the height of you, which isn't surprising given the hot summer's day. The titanic toes wriggle a little, each movement enough to crush you several times over. You follow the shapely, tanned leg upwards with your eyes, where it becomes covered by a red dress. A 'short' red dress. Any more than that you cannot see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling despite yourself, you turn the other pair of feet. They too wear sandals, but the white dress is much longer, ankle length by your judgement. That's not what bothers you though. It takes you several seconds before you realise what's different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese feet are even bigger. Half again the size of the original feet, you struggle to come up with new words that mean big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a woman, and the smaller feet belong to a girl (her daughter?). To think that you had thought of her legs as shapely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever mind.  No one need ever think that you had such thoughts.  The thoughts you should be having now are whether or not you should approach these people.  Sure, the ride on the bar-maid's foot was sickening, but you're feeling a lot more content in your tiny physique now.  And it is true that you will need to contact someone if you're to have any hope of getting back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they're so big and scary!  Perhaps you'd be forgiven seeking a LITTLE more time to cower?</span></div></div>",

That's going to take a bit of getting used to.  Time to move on you think, putting the giantesses to your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's another impact behind you, though you're experienced enough by now to know that it's something a lot smaller than even the girl's foot. You turn slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is light brown in colour, in form a cone that starts out as thick as your leg but soon widens until it is some four times your height. When you see white liquid leaking out from the large end, you recognise the alien object. An ice-cream cone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last you ate was that rancid cola, so right now you're not picky. You rush over to the food, breaking several small chunks off with your hands. It tastes as you know cones taste, but at your size the consistency is harder - you really have to work your teeth to get it down your throat. But it's worth it; it feels good in your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a shadow falls over you and you freeze, your mouth locking mid chew. Looking over your shoulder, you can see the smaller pair of feet turned to face you, and the legs to which they are attached bending, as an arm reaches over you to pick up the ice cream. The girl wants it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Leave it where it is, it's covered in germs!\" shouts her mother, audible even over the tirade of the traffic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand halts, and retracts from the spoiled food. But the damage has been done. You have no time to react before a thumb and a finger grasp you roughly and tear you from your place, hoisting you with dreadful power into the air. You almost choke, and that's without the rush of movement and the pressure exerted on your fragile form by the digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up into the face of the girl, you have no doubt now as to her youth. Her age in years surely can't be counted in double figures yet. Her smooth face breaks into her grin, and you prepare yourself for the end. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Speaking of which, she looks just as distressed as you are. The way she constantly taps her fingers against the table in that rhythmic pattern emphasized uneasiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure why, but you notice a little silver ring on her index finger.

She's still pretty young so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! It's alright! I'm fine!\" you interrupt her, assuring her youre A-OK, \"she was actually very gentle to me while she was holding me.\" However, knowing that this kind-hearted and caring woman in front of you is a mother, you can't help but wonder if she's married, too. Maybe it's the ring and the fact that you've grown VERY accustomed to your motherly goddess. So many possibilities could open up if she isn't married... although some might be a little difficult in your size, but you can worry about THAT later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't just flat out ask 'Are you married?'.

Your dizzying trip ends with a landing onto a capped surface of uneven burgundy threads.  As you push yourself to your feet, you take the wondrous visions around you.  Directly across from you stands another purplish-red mounded skyscraper, identical to the one beneath you.  The twin monoliths are dwarfed by an indescribably wide dull-peaked mountain lying adjacent to them, made of similar material by the looks of it.  Far below, a great valley stretches an eternity, its monotony broken up only by two long fissures seemingly created in symmetry with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the room appears normal to you, probably due to your perched position and distance from everything else.  There are four white walls surrounding the room.  The carpet maintains a very light shade of brown.  A standard television set is positioned far ahead of the structure holding you.

A remarkably average apartment by your estimation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may want to find something to hold on to\", your 'chauffeur' regains your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the recommendation and cling to a loose piece of thread.  Your eyes watch in awe as the woman descends upon the couch, the annoyance of the loud creaking her weight forces only surpassed by the violent quakes of the same source.  A humongous wall of red cascades into the contorting seat cushioned valley.  After taking a moment to wiggle into a more accommodating situation, the kind girl turns her attention back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There\", the girl speaks in an angelic tone, \"You can let go now.  I won't move around anymore\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou release your grip on the rugged string.  Venturing toward the ill defined edge of your rounded domain, you take in your first complete look at this marvellous woman.  The scarlet cotton fabric of her dress covers less than a quarter of her endless legs.  Her knees hang crossed over the arm rest opposite you, sandal clad feet swaying carelessly in and out of view.  A curvy chest, each breast as a domed temple to you, stands at the end of the red covering, its cream top showing itself off to you.  Her head sits at the base of your large tumulus.  Random clumps of murky strands lay around her acute ears.  Two blurs of radiant hazel leave their central bases in seas of whiteness, instead gathering at the top of each respective socket to focus upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughtful girl addresses you with a caring smile, \"I figured you must be really tired of looking up at everything, so I thought you might like it if someone had to look up at you for a change\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", her boundless charity never ceases to take you aback, \"Thanks...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\", the woman quickly realizes why you've trailed off, \"I can't believe I never introduced myself.

Hypnotically, it seems, you are drawn to those pouty red lips, now hanging within reach.  An inviting glare of autumn illuminates from Maria's tremendous eyes.  You are bathed in steamy carbon dioxide shooting nervously from the twin nostrils of her perfectly curved nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, you head for Maria's awaiting bottom lip.  You leap as you are about to make contact, your diminutive body crashing into the upper portion soft, impressionable cushion.  Your arms and legs stretch to their limits, taking up as much space as possible, as your puny digits cling to the top of the bottom divider.  You caress your body against the minuscule space you occupy in a determined effort to be felt.  Your own lips pucker, and plant themselves repeatedly onto the comfy wall of unpainted carmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\", Maria hums, sending powerful, yet pleasurable reverberations through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink tip, a tad larger than you, pokes out from the breach separating the two immense lips.  The ominous creature thickens as it continues to slither from its horizontal pit.  It begins to lick slowly across Maria's bottom lip, threatening to engulf you.  And engulf you it does, wrapping its wet surface around your pathetic form with great relish.  You feel yourself rising as you are pulled away from the supple warmth to which you were clinging.  Squirming all the while, you are grinded along the exposed portions of Maria's exposed tongue.  Its tip shows astonishing dexterity in guiding you back and forth against the bumpy terrain.  The ride is rough and violent...but you don't want it to stop.  It does, though, as you are gently rolled back onto the arm rest by the same tongue which was beating you senseless just seconds prior.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your soaked body to its feet, staring curiously up at the Brobdingnagian vision giving you a reciprocating stare.  You try to gauge her reaction to what has just transpired, then quickly realize that she must be doing the same.  You decide to take the initiative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was intense\", you proclaim as saliva drips from your drenched bangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", Maria agrees breathlessly, \"I wasn't expecting that to be so...enjoyable.  Incidentally, you taste a bit like Cherry Coke\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take this opportunity to tell your story, \"Yeah, I can explain that...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fill Maria in on the whole story regarding your little problem.  From riding a classmate out of the exam hall, to the plot thickening events at the bar, to spending the night in a near empty can of (apparently cherry) Coca Cola; you omit no details in your explanation.  Maria watches you with intrigue as you pace and talk, your arms moving in excited motions while you speak.  Once you are finished, Maria takes a minute to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're tougher than you look\", Maria looks down on you with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", you accept the compliment, \"This hasn't been so bad since Sasha found me, though\", you pause for a minute, \"You know, after I get all fixed up, I wouldn't mind taking YOU to a cafe.  Just don't expect me to carry you around everywhere\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not?\", Maria is playful in her response, \"Are you saying I'm fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\", you slyly respond, \"But I'm only saying that out of fear that you'll crush me under your weight.  So take that for what it's worth\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria bursts out laughing at your retort.  You are promptly knocked on your arse.  You get back up and continue the conversation.</span></div></div>",

I'm only twenty-six, and you don't look that much younger than me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to confirm her previous suspicions, Maria lowers her eyes just in front of you.  Her right pupil, as large as your head, floats in suspension less than a foot away from you.  Her electrifying iris of gorgeous brown shimmers.  Yet, despite the great beauty of the monstrous orb before you, your subconsciousness still recognizes it as a monster nonetheless.

Her candor then turns to one of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look really tense up close\", Maria informs you, \"A little relaxation could do you some good.  Or...maybe a little fun would help.

It doesn't take long for her to regain focus, and she looks down on you with curious interest in her glowing brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it\", you proclaim to the victorious goddess, pausing to take a deep breath before speaking again, \"So, Maria, what would you like to do?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you wanted to watch T.V.\", there is a taunting quality in Maria's kind voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your frustration, a smile sneaks onto your face, \"Really?  I must have changed my mind\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's mighty forefinger slides between thick rows of numbered buttons, its dark red-glazed tip stopping in front of you like the front car of a train pulling into station.  The resultant screeching bothers your ears a little, but you've certainly heard worse things since becoming an inch, then half-inch tall.  You know how to take a hint, and you pull yourself onto the higher ground of Maria's nail.  Your weight meaningless to such a massive thing, her index finger rises from the monolithic remote with no struggle.  You are presented to Maria's gorgeous face, making you feel as though you were an offering to Venus (Aphrodite for those of you playing at home) herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to put you through too much\", Maria assures you soothingly, \"I just thought you might want to take the grand tour\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs that all?  You wouldn't mind riding Maria as she strolls you through the apartment.  It would still give you a chance to finally relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun\", you lie, hoping not to spoil a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\", Maria seems thrilled at your decision, \"I really hope you enjoy it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's body begins to shift and contort below you, though she is able to keep her finger (and you) surprisingly steady.  You ready yourself for the coming increase in elevation, but it never comes.  You look back down to Maria, noticing that she has returned to laying on her back.  Slowly, you are lowered down to earth, your flat chariot coming to rest in the middle of Maria's forehead.  You are gently deposited onto her balmy skin and left standing alone with a stupefied look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria begins to speak in an obnoxiously cheery voice, \"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Tours ala Maria.  Our first stop today is the beautiful Visage de la Maria.  Gasp in awe as you take in its shapely nose and busty  red lips.  Lose yourself in the depths of those fawning brown eyes.  Enjoy the grain of that pitch black hair as it drags along smooth, tan skin.  Oh, and no flash photography, please\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not what you were expecting, but you're not about to complain.  In fact, Maria's newly expressed confidence in her sexiness takes this experience to a whole new level of attraction.  You heed Maria's advice, wandering about her face and taking in the various sights; staring into her enormous autumn oculus as it gleams happily back at you, climbing to the tip of her 'short' nose and viewing the rest of Maria's lustful body from its great peak, and bouncing on her familiar lips with playful satisfaction.  Her pink tongue parts the red trampolines, its tip waving to you as would an old friend.  You absentmindedly wave back as you continue on toward Maria's petite chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria must be able to feel your puny feet trample along her skin, for once you reach the cliff at the edge of her face, her index finger makes a return appearance, holding itself level with said edge.  You step on without hesitation, and it lowers straight downward.  You step off onto her throat and begin to traverse the new path in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria continues her skit, her larynx vibrating you pleasantly from beneath flawless skin with every syllable, \"Next, we come to the Great Gullet.  Imagine that just below your feet lies a complex piping system, where food, water, oxygen, and even words travel.  These underground tunnels could very easily gobble up several of you up at once, but not to worry, folks.  I've been assured that she was fed just prior to the start of the tour\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass the gullet and set foot onto the upper chest area.  You had been admiring Maria's towering cleavage from afar, but from this close you are simply mesmerized by the uncovered portion of the gigantic domes.  You see that you are small enough to fit between the crack separating the two breasts.  It is indeed very tempting to slip underneath Maria's scarlet garments and...explore, but you aren't sure if she would be comfortable with you sneaking around under her dress.  After all, you've only known each other for one day.  Also, it would be potentially dangerous for you to be out of Maria's field of vision, particularly when a single movement could kill you.  Maybe you should check back with Maria to see what she has in mind.</span></div></div>",

Leaning against its inside, you watch as the lovely Maria rises to her full, Olympian height and makes her way to the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm off to collect Sasha from school now.

The vantage point seems familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so tiny,\" the girl rumbles, her voice ahead of you, beyond the peaked flesh mound.  \"You must be scared.

No, really, I'm contractually obligated to keep my mouth shut\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but chuckle at Maria's persistent silliness.  Her transport digit once again sets itself before you, and you climb aboard.  You are lifted effortlessly above Maria's titanic breasts, the pointer finger slipping dumping you off at the sinking fabric between the two great megaliths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria resumes the tour, \"Ladies and gentlemen, here we are atop the famous Maria Mountains.  These twin peaks make for a most difficult climb, but I hear the ride down is much more smooth.  Go on, give it a try.  Just remember not to cut in line.  Line jumpers will be removed from the tour immediately!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a moment, giving the imaginary tourists ample time to descend the great hill.  You glance back at Maria, her perfect face filled with giddiness.  She's really enjoying this.  She's not the only one, though.  Once you've decided enough time has passed, you sit down and push your dragging behind down the rounded lump of red.  Your momentum picks up against the frictionlessly silky fabric as you slide down Maria's chest.  Your arms raise to catch the air your speed generates.  Upon reaching the bottom, the adrenaline pumping through you puts you on cloud nine, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tread along the wrinkled portions of Maria's red clothing, the ground begins to shift and incline.  You tumble in rolling fashion down her fit abdomen for a bit, but you manage to cling to the cold material of the light crimson dress to stop yourself.  The movements stop, and you look around your altered environment.  Maria's chest, once behind you, now looms at an angle overhead.  Her legs, formerly bent over the arm rest of the couch, currently stretch unbent angling upward toward the white sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, folks\", Maria apologizes, \"You never can predict these earthquakes.  Anyway, welcome to the Torso Plains.  Flat as a washboard, this vast expanse raises and lowers in rhythmic patterns, like so\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's abdomen swiftly fills with air, causing it to expand upward.  You lose your balance with the sudden change.  The torso releases the air and contracts back to its original state.  You stand up and continue on your journey.  You walk onto Maria's thin hips, staring past her thigh and up her long, long leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ladies and gentleman, I'm afraid to inform you that the lift for the leg ride is currently out of order.  We'll have to climb to the top instead.  If this tour wasn't free, we would give you a refund for this inconvenience.  Oh well, up we go\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou role your eyes as you begin the daunting task of scaling the never-ending appendage.  After a few minutes of solid climbing, you are halfway up Maria's monstrous, yet trim thigh.  Tall, slender fingers start after you from the base of the steep inclination, walking a slow pace on their respective tips.  They catch up to you at the knee cap, a terrible boulder of bone and flesh serving as an insurmountable obstacle to you.  The cold nails attached to those huge fingers nudge you over the hindrance with relative ease.  You continue along the narrowing shin, hastening your pace at the near ending of your adventure.  You ascend to Maria's ankle, and you lean against it with your hand as you catch your breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now wasn't that fun?\", Maria asks in a near gloating tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour answer is breathless, \"Yeah...that was...amazing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria bends forward, bringing her straightened legs to meet her.  The ground beneath your feet quickly becomes a tower to your side.  You begin to fall, but Maria's waiting palm ends your plummet early.  You are brought before Maria's beaming face yet again.  She studies you for a minute, words failing to leave her lips.  Then she glances past you and gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ten to three\", Maria recites the time to you, \"We're going to be late\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to think before you realize what she means, \"You mean to pick up Sasha, right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nods in confirmation as she gets up from the couch, carrying you toward the entryway of the apartment.</span></div></div>",

You wonder why she's so embarassed to say her part, though. In your eyes, your feelings toward her had been pretty evident in these most recent minutes, but then again she must have been waiting on you to say something that proved to her that you were genuinely interested. And you're glad that whatever you did had an effect, because now Maria clearly wanted to be your girlfriend, no matter how small you are. For the first time since shrinking, you feel quite large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the happiness could only last for so long, as new worries crawl into your brain. Just like before, the same facts of life are there: A woman would want a man who could protect her, provide for her, and all of those necessities. True, she can probably handle herself and has done so for the past few years raising Sasha, but it was the sense of security that really mattered. At half an inch tall, how could you possibly make her feel safe with you? And also, there is the intimacy thing. Sure, you aren't going to rush into this relationship, but the realities of kissing and other forms of affection would be difficult... and the other obvious problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least for the moment you should drink in this current joy. Let tomorrow wait until you're good and ready for it! You stare into Maria's eyes one more time, just be sure she's not playing some kind of sick joke on you. The pupils relate a legitimate care for you, so you leave it at that. Your new girlfriend daintily reaches out to pick you up, and it may be the first time since your accident that you had actually welcomed the touch of a giantess. The luck involved that you had been discovered by Maria was just about perfect, too. What were the chances that she actually didn't want to take advantage of a man the size of a mundane pest? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go in the kitchen, I know you must be at least somewhat hungry after your journey,\" Maria proposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess I did work up a bit of hunger.\" You're lying, but you would follow her anywhere at this point, since you're floating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further words she whisks you away to the kitchen, pulling a chair for herself and laying you down against a salt shaker. That way you have somewhere to sit where no one else would spot you. Maria then rises from her chair and walks over to the doorway that served as the entrance to the kitchen, and to your dismay you hear her call Charlotte out of the room. What is she doing now?!</span></div></div>",

Like a daddy, what do you think about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha's eyes widen, \"Mommy really really like him?\" Maria nods and explained what was happening. Sasha doesn't fully understand what's going on but she gets the idea. \"Let me ask him some questions.\" Sasha holds out her hands; you hesitate a bit, but you leave Maria's hands and enters Sasha's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay little guy I want you to tell me the truth. Do you love my mommy?\" You nod. \"Will you take care of her and help her?\" You nod again. \"Will you protect her from all the bad things that might want to hurt her?\" Again you nod. \"Will you take care if me? Protect me from the monsters that lurk all around and want to gobble me up?\" this makes you smile and nod your head once more. \"So you don't care if you have to help take care of me? Even if I might be able to squish you?!\" she says a little amazed about your courage, even though it was her mother that made you feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that question you respond, \"As long as you don't squish me I'll not only protect you two, but I'll love you with all my might.\" In your head though you think: even if I can't push a button on a clicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha though smiles and says, \"Then I'm fine with him being my daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria then says, \"Then it looks like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be cut off by Charlotte saying, \"Hold on! Jeez, you still don't know the guy too well and think, what is going to happen to him if he lives in your apartment. Now, think he can't always be on the both of you, and how is he going to move around if he gets lost? These are some of the things you need to think of Maria. So before you say he's going to be your husband can you at least see how, uhhhh, a month goes by. You shouldn't rush things and he still needs to get used to living at his size right now. Think it's going to be a lot for the both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and you nod to this sadly because it's true. But you look up at Maria and say, smiling, \"Hey I've been through worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiles back at you, \"Well I guess it's time to go.\" Charlotte has made lots of points but hopefully you three, including Sasha, can make the best of this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a huge tub that was just big enough for Maria to comfortably lie down in. To you, it was like a huge reservoir of water! Maria set you down on the sink. She grabbed a towel, set it aside and turned on the faucet. Warm water started tumbling down into the bathtub. Maria got the same cheery voice as she announced, \"Congratulations to our lucky winner! You have won an all-expense paid vacation for one to the Twin Islands Tropical Resort and Spa! All maintained and run by the beautiful and talented, Maria!\" As she said that, Maria took off her clothes, leaving her in a bra and panties. You were left speechless.

You hadn't gotten a good look at her form earlier, but now... she was no supermodel, but with the way you looked at her, she might as well be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria giggled at your vacant expression, dropping character for a moment. \"Keep your mouth closed, you'll catch flies... or... well, you know what I mean!\" Maria chuckled at her joke. \"Well, you're going to have to show me something in return...\" She said with a purr. You caught what she was trying to say. You stood up and you started taking off your clothes, leaving you in your underwear. You weren't exactly athletic, but you were quite the ladies man. You had quite a few girlfriends back in the day. Maria was apparently just as impressed as you were, especially at the lump that was slowly growing. Maria couldn't help but laugh again. \"You're already that excited? But we haven't even got there, yet!\" You felt oddly embarrassed at her blunt observation... you hadn't felt this way with anyone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria continued her short act. \"And to get there, you'll fly on your own private jet, first class... Air Maria!\" As she said that, she stripped her bra and panties to the side, revealing all her nude glory. You were stunned all over again. Maria stooped down and motioned for you to get on with it, as well. You quickly took off your underwear and stepped onto her outstretched hand. Maria stares at you and quietly giggled. Apparently, she liked what she saw as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stepped into the bathtub and slowly slid down to the bottom, and turned the water off with her free hand. She laid down so that only her head and her breasts were above the water. She set you down in the water, right in front of her 'twin islands.' You chuckled. \"So, what activities and events can I expect to see at the Twin Islands Resort and Spa?\" You ask. Maria smirks.</span></div></div>",

Maria smiles down from on high.  \"That was just to get you started.  I expect you to scrub hard, mister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soapiness of the water is enough to sting your eyes, but also means that you're fairly soake din cleaning agents.

It faces you, its whorled underside presented to your face.  \"Rub against this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels weird, scrubbing your dirt off against someone's thumb, but the ridges along it prove just rough enough to scrape away the badness, leaving you clean and squeaky.

Only a moment, yet the pressure she applied would have ripped the skin from your body with ease.  Humbling, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you are rising from the surface, as a palm lifts beneath you, carrying you up to the face of your tour guide.  Her nose approaches, nostrils leaving you gasping as she vacuums all air from your immediate surroundings.  You splutter while she savours the smell.  \"Clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes are back, hooded coyly.  \"If my thumb is getting you that active, perhaps we should cut the tour short and just head for the big finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the mouth is before you, tongue running smoothly over puckered lips.  \"The climax.\"</span></div></div>",

Probably because it wouldn't be as exciting if you drowned during it. Soon enough, her pussy was revealed from the water. \"Well, you're in for a big treat!\" Maria announced in her signature tour guide voice. \"You've gotten an appointment with the Cave of Life! It's been told that only worthy men enter, and after nine months, a completely new human comes out of its depths! And guess what? You've been proven worthy.\" She said with a wink as she let you down right between her legs, her womanhood practically staring at you. You simply stood there in awe. You weren't exactly as pure as the Virgin Mary, but... you couldn't believe this was actually happening. It felt like a dream... or some weird porno...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria giggled. \"What? You've suddenly got cold feet?\" She teased. You gulped and you started walking to the doorway to her \"Cave of Life.\" You start kneading the thick lips of her pussy.

Some stroking and moaning later, her pussy lips started opening. You couldn't believe your eyes. \"Go on... keep going! Harder...\" Maria said through pleasured moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you started moving your hands past her lips. \"Go, keep going!\" Maria replied hungrily. After that, you put your arms into her vagina and you started climbing inside. \"Oh... oh!\" Maria's moans were muffled past her body. You figured it didn't matter. You crawled deeper into her womanhood, massaging the vaginal walls the whole time. The walls were quivering with each of her thrusts.

With an effort, you wrench your head to the left to see what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, looking at her feet, is slowly walking through the city.  She does so because she is a giantess now, so big that regular people seem to her to be the half-inch size of her lover!  But for all her care, her feet crush cars and cleave through low buildings, citizens streaming way from her like ants from a disturbed nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow you wish to help, but what can you do?  But she's the woman you love, and your muscles strain to reach out, to help her in any way you can!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, your left arm lifts from where it lies and stretches toward her, hopefully enough of a gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arm stretches further than you thought.  The city had seemed so far, its people specks at the horizon, but as your fingertips plough into the ground near Maria you see that it was a lot close than it appeared.  The giantess jumps back at the shockwave of your limb smashing into the landscape, absently kicking an office building into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you, she's about half an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou offer a smile, and Maria sets to climbing up the tip of your finger, her mighty muscles hefting her up the ridges of your skin.  From there she strolls down your finger tenderly, and you smile as her several-tonnes weight feels to you more like the tip-toeing of a a creature of Faerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's secure in your palm, you remove your hand from the ruin of the city to bring it before your face, and Maria kisses you on the tip of your nose.  \"Thank you for saving me.  But this new landscape looks awfully unfamiliar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her gist immediately, you bring your hand to your chest, only now noticing how you lie unclothed, a naked colossus unable to stand.  Maria steps out onto your torso, forging through the tangle of hairs above your heart, to start her tour of your body.  You wish your tongue could form words to describe the journey as she did to you when she was your tour guide, but you can manage no fancy talk right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Maria seems able to enjoy herself, skipping across your poor excuse for abs before hitting the minor obstacle of your pubes.

I can wait for us to grow closer, and if you choose to leave me then I -  Um, I can let you go where you want.  I promise I won't keep you here against your will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" is all you can bring yourself to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, now that that's out in the open, should we sleep?\" Maria blushes.  \"I mean, go to sleep.

There, all of half an inch tall, you survey your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an entrance hallway, as evidenced by the colossal front door not far away to your left.  It's suitable scaled for people of Maria's size, and therefore stretches upwards to a height you can scarcely believe, with a ceiling higher still.  The small table you're standing on sits at about waist height for a normal person, making the trip to the ground a somewhat daunying prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the structure to your right, a solid object equal in size to a short line of two-storey buildings (small,in comparison to Maria's towering handbag) will help out quite a bit.  Sure, there's no hope of you ever lifting the receiver or summoning enough strength to push down even one of its numerical keys, but the cord that drops from its rear to floor level will make an excellent drop line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after that descent, you gaze around the hall, pacing through the thick carpet very slowly.

Another voice is laughing, but the girl doesn't share that enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt right angles to that, the other doorway gives way to another carpeted room, where you can make out Maria's sexy tones talking with another woman.

There are discarded crumbs and other debris that only a keen (and tiny) eye such as yours can spot.  But no sign of Sasha...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCue her stomping steps around the corner before you,swaying wildly as she cries out again.  On her heels comes an equally titanic young boy, of her age.  The godlike youth is still laughing, his voice booming from the heavens as he stops still for a moment, merely watching Sasha as she stumbles, slipping to the ground in an undiginified heap, and a loud thump into the bargain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, given that their mothers are only in a room a few steps away, this may have alerted them, so the boy turns his head toward the doorway to see if one of them is coming to spoil his fun.  That's a negatory, but as his eyes sweep the area they alight upon you for a moment, and judging by the way his smile twists into an outright grin, you can tell that he's spotted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, how to play this one, shrunken guy?</span></div></div>",

Can you fix him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be nice to think that Maria could help you, but as you blink your eyes open, the mess that remains of your body below your waist, you don;t hold out much hope.  No, there's just pulp, spreading out across the warm, ridged surface of the woman's hand.  There's no pain anymore, but the sight of your own body so tattered is more than you can bear, so you look directly upward to see Maria's godlike visage, rivers streaming from her eyes.  Were this a fairytale, those tears would heal you, regrow you, and there'd be a happy ending for all involved.  Yet despite the unbelievable condition you find yourself in, this is real life, not a children's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of children, you look around to see where Sasha is.  You can't die with her feeling guilty over you.  Not at her age.  But your limited field of vision does not display the gigantic little girl; Maria's curled fingers, protecting your shattered form from the outside, are the extent of your world.  Not so long ago did this palm serve as a prison, where this woman carried you to the cafe for your introduction to each other.  Then, how mixed were your emotions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief at not being immediately crushed, thrown together with trepidation at what possible fate could await you once the fingers uncurled.  That was just hours ago, and now Maria is the gentle goddess upon whose mercy you've relied.  A mature woman, not at all like those careless university girls that you'd been around earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow differently would things have turned out if you'd stuck with the ass-girl.  You're ashamed to not even know her name, only the gigantic posterior that served as your transport from the exam hall.  She'd been drinking with her buddies, and would have no doubt gone on to a club or something... You wouldn't have survived.  No, that would have been foolish.  You wouldn't have lived very long, and certainly wouldn't have met someone as caring as Maria.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaller, though.  You'd have died at an inch height, unknown to the man in black.  Unless he'd have followed you there?  Would he have found you wherever you went, a relentless tracker from whom there is no escape?  Will he find you even here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd be a shame to die without knowing why you were shrunk.  And only that man could tell you.  Why hasn't he come for you?  You must be important, for him to have gone to such lengths.  He can't let you die now!  Maybe this is just a test, and he'll pop up any second now for another offer to follow him.  For a man that can grow and shrink matter, restoring a crushed body should be nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.  No, he's not coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you're going to die here slowly.  Not the instant end of being crushed.  Which is more merciful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't die...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's voice, Maria's breath, both washing over you in a heavenly gust...  Raising an arm is just possible, and that brings the sky closer, the fleshy ceiling of Maria's face eclipsing all else.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, you're still alive!  Hang in there, it's going to be okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you croak, \"I know I'm done for.  Don't cry.  I'm just some insect that wandered into your life, and you shouldn't cry over a crushed bug...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she hear that?  Her eyes are still watery, and tears fall around you now that her eyes are so much closer to you.  Their saltiness stings where they touch your exposed body, and your numbness is wrenched away as pain reawakens, your lack of a lower half lancing through what remains of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's concern reawakens, and she nuzzles close, her nose an inverted mountain, a stalactite the size of a house.  \"I'm sorry,\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should never have left you alone, let Sasha get inside my handbag at you!  I'm a terrible mother, and now it's actually gotten someone killed!  You died because of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shouts that at the end, and that blast takes your hearing.  She can't hear you anyway, and there's no way for you to apologise, to make her feel better.  She blames her daughter as well, when it was your choice to escape, your lack of trust that brought this all about.  Even the boy, that unthinking brute that sprinkled you into Sasha's hair, isn't really to blame.  To him, you were just a bug, no harm no foul if harm befell you.  You don't even know his name...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFingers from Maria's free hand descend, closing on you like express trains, only to pause and veer away, the colossal consciousness controlling their motion wanting to touch you, to stroke you and soothe your ills, but all too aware that her merest touch could further push your body toward obliteration.  Already, the simple scratch of her daughter took half of you, wiping you away like ink on a whiteboard.  So little do you matter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts, what are they worth?  You don't matter.  Once you've passed, your remains will be almost nothing.  What, will Maria bury you?  Six millimetres deep?  There's not enough of you to be cremated, unless someone decides to stub their cigarette out on you.  It might almost be preferable if Maria chose to devour you, to lick up your pathetic self and take you into herself.  It would be a useless amount of nutrition, but even the smallest amount you could give to this generous goddess would be an offering.  You would be absorbed into her, become one in a way no-one else ever has...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth opens to take a breath, and you gaze overly long into that abyss.  What an adventure that would be, to descend deep into the woman in the last moments of life, the light of your being fading into the endless darkness of her immensity...  You'd offer the idea up to her in a prayer, but for the fact that your voice doesn't carry to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouth closes, the face falls up and away, a new sky shown where once it was, passing along.  She's walking somewhere, but where can she possibly take you?  Nothing can save you now.  Why would she waste time and effort with you, when you are nothing but dirt now, to be swept away and forgotten?  She hardly knew you.  How can you have been more than a momentary distraction to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are others who will miss you more, and they'll never know where you went.  Your parents, other family, friends, acquaintances...  The university might launch an investigation, but there is no evidence of what happened to you.  Some people might have seen you shrink, disappear, or whatever in the exam hall.  Will this just be chalked up to alien abduction?  Are you going to be one of the great unsolved mysteries of all time?  Posthumous fame, a Fortean celebrity for conspiracy theorists to mull over for decades to come?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's some small comfort in that.  Yet you'll be forgotten as soon as that man in black strikes again.  Why would he shrink just one person, after all?  Were you a test run for some larger, more nefarious plot?  Is your death here just tidying up a loose end, a little girl squishing you inadvertently dooming the world?  Man, that would suck.  But you won't live long enough to see what is to come, and shouldn't concern yourself with it.  Just as Maria shouldn't worry for the tiny man, so the tiny man shouldn't worry for the fate of the giant world.  A speck should not concern himself with his betters, with creatures that are infinitely more powerful, and capable of handling themselves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's journey has ended, and her face reappears, absorbing your thoughts, scattering your ramblings to the wind.  \"Hold in there,\" she says, the world of sound returning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I bother?\" you reply, knowing that no-one can hear.  \"Death, or life as an insect.  We had some sweet times honey, but what future is there for us?  Your daughter maimed me without knowing, and I doubt that you can be in full control of yourself twenty-four-seven.  This would have happened eventually, baby.  Best get it out of the way soon, before you get too attached.  Too attached to the cute bug that you let crawl over yourself for a laugh.  Maybe there would have been more to it, but you're going to have to find some other sexual release, my dear.  Meet someone your own size, someone you don't have to worry every second of every day about crushing.  You have your place in the world raising your daughter, not acting as some surrogate mother to a crippled university student.  Mine's a unique disability, but it would have held you back just as much as any other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps some small measure of fame - no pun intended, honest - could have resulted.  Think what might have happened if you came out to the public with me...  The attention would have been on me, but your story could have sold for millions.  It still can.  Wherever you're going now, stop.  Head to the nearest news station, call the emergency services, hail a taxi - anything!  Oh God, make my death mean something!  The life that you and Sasha can have...  I can provide for you, if only you don't let me go to waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Maria didn't suddenly tune in to your voice.  Her eyes are red raw, her nostrils shiny with recent dribble.  Your death is really getting to her that much?  Oh God, what effect has this had upon Sasha..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere your speech went unnoticed, your innermost thought gets attention immediately, as the girl's face nuzzles in close to her mother.  She's not as distraught, but that's definite worry.

The older woman reacts instinctively, moving back to prevent her daughter from finishing what she started, even if it would once again be an accident.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The living room that you enter is familiar - it's the one where Maria lay while you explored her body.  Of course, back then you were seeing it from an elevated position, and your view from the floor is much more restricted.  You can just about perceive the bottle of wine standing on the table, and make out the bobbing head of Maria over the couch's armrest.  No sign of her feet though, so they must be up there with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach that titanic piece of furniture, listening keenly to the women's voices above.  The armchair in the room is unoccupied, so this mysterious Charlotte must be sitting up there with Maria.  As you near the front of the couch, all becomes clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a glow about you,\" says Charlotte, nudging Maria's toes with her own.  You duck down behind one of Maria's discarded sandals to pay closer attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Maria laughs, coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new man in your life?\" the other prys, raising her wineglass to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayyyybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!  Spill.  Tall, dark and handsome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte seems puzzled at Maria's spluttering laughter in response to her question.  While waiting for her to quiet down, she allows one of her massive hands to run through her long, dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Maria eventually responds.  \"Ahem.  But he makes me feel...  I don't know.  I barely know him, and already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin, hiding your own discomfort at learning that the woman felt this deeply about you.  Doesn't mean you're averse to learning more, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's a scream and a crash from the kitchen.  The kids!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go,\" Maria assures Charlotte, reaching across to return her glass to the table.  Then she stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare feet smash down nearby, and you cringe in naked terror.  Sure, you've been near her feet before, when you first 'met', but then they were still, no threat.  And yes, you did come close to being trodden on several times in the bar, but that was when you were twice your current size.  And most of all...  You can't explain it, in much the same way that the woman can't articulate her feelings toward you.  Maria, were she to step on you now, would crush you barefoot.  Without a shoe or sandal between you, bare flesh to flesh, the death would seem more personal somehow, and an even greater reminder of how much of an insect you have become, to be disposed of unaided.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strides over you,leaving the room in seconds and spinning your light body in the breeze of her wake.  Charlotte slides her feet back to the carpet from the couch much more slowly, cradling her glass in both her hands,and you have time to consider her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the forced perspective bestowed from a half-inch high viewpoint doesn't allow you the luxury of the best description, but you take as much in as you are able.  She's of similar age to Maria (understandably), but is slimmer, a woman you would describe (were you at regular height and not in fact the size of her thumbnail) as thin.  It's hard to tell, but you may place her as being taller than Maria, and her hair is certainly longer.  Facial features are hard to distinguish, and clothing-wise her tanned legs lead up to denim cut-offs and a purple blouse of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're alone with her right now, and perhaps this would be an excellent chance to inspect the sort of company that Maria keeps.  If you're going to get to the know the woman, you should also get to know her friends, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, who knows what Maria, Sasha and Charlotte's kid are up to in the kitchen?  Perhaps you should check up on them, make sure that everything's all right.  The sensible part of your brain reminds you that that could be incredibly dangerous, however.</span></div></div>",

It had dealt a blow to her toe knuckle that must have felt slightly stronger than a tickle, but it had been enough to get her attention, since she had just been sitting there alone, waiting for Maria's eventual return. But there really was no time to run, you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look up at the beauty all light is cut out by her shadow. The girl was leaning forward in her seat, looking down.

Now would be a better time to try your hand at escape, but what good would it do to start a game of cat and mouse.

The kids are shouted to, and you're about to be in for a nightmare of walking, under the foot of your girlfriend's girl friend.  She may have felt you before - to attack the underside of her toe now may get her attention and save you!  Then again, it may just serve to bring her attention to the bug on her sandal.  Perhaps it would be better to try and slowly ease yourself out from under the oppressive mass of the toe, the better to live to see another day?  Less risky, but by the time you're out the woman could be well away from Maria!</span></div></div>",

With each step, Charlotte raises her toes above you, a brief window of opportunity to roll yourself a little before they come crashing down again.  Compared to this, your journey with the barmaid last night was bliss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really should count your blessings that you haven't been squashed already.  Charlotte's rapid strides mean that the devastating weight of her biggest piggy is on you for only a fraction of a second.  That's more than enough time for every fibre of your being to feel the titanic pressure, and for your senses to be overwhelmed by the rough texture, slick, rank sweat and oppressive heat.  Only the fact that you can distinguish between left and right foot smashing to the ground tells you that you haven't gone deaf from the impacts around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime is uncertain.  Movements stop, and your world rights itself, no longer sliding alarmingly through the three hundred degrees of a footstep.  You consider your tormentor for a moment, reaching up to pat gently at its whorled surface, and then it withdraws, sliding neatly from the sandal strap and leaving you on your back in a low pool of Charlotte's sweat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking upwards, you can make out the curve of her bare leg leading up to her denim cut-offs, but most of her torso is blocked by a large column jutting toward her stomach, seemingly supporting a large, hollow satellite dish.  What could that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the sandal, you see its partner sitting a short distance away.  The freed feet stretch in the air for a moment, and while you resent their imprisonment of you, you can't stay mad at colossal beauties for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they come down, over your head and behind you.  You turn, just making out raised platforms in the darkness, onto which the feet daintily slide.  One pushes down somewhat experimentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you twig where you are.  Those are the pedals of a car, the column above a steering wheel!  You look upward, to the light, only to see Charlotte's mighty arm already in the process of pulling the door closed.  The deed is done instantly, plunging you, at foot level, into black.  Looking up, you can see the goddess fastening her seatbelt, hear her telling her son to do the same.  Around, you can both taste and smell the rankness of this area.  In your soul, you know that you're being taken from Maria.  There's nothing you can do, and it eats you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vehicle launches into motion,  and your brain whirls with plans for getting out of this.  Charlotte is Maria's friend, so it's not as hopeless as it could be; contact her, and you get right back to your giant girlfriend.  You don't really want to distract her while she has her eyes on the road however.  And if at all possible, you'd like to travel out of here at somewhere higher than ankle level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting here until she steps out would be a no-no - she'd be gone too fast.  No, you're going to have to take a few more risks...</span></div></div>",

It is only just in reach though, so unless you want to dangle from your hands all the while, you're going to have to pull yourself out to listen in on the conversation of giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour upper body strength is nothing to write home about, but it's equal to the task of dragging yourself painfully across the jagged zipline at the mouth of the handbag.  You lie in the sunlight for a short while, panting at the exertion and acclimatising your eyes to their new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, Maria's elbow and arm mark the most that you can see of your benefactor, and there's no way you intend to look down from this great height just to glimpse more of her.  Instead, you look across to the secondary mountainous woman with whom she's sharing her cacophonous conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Maria does not stand perfectly still throughout this, shifting her stance from time to time, but despite the unstable footing you are able to take in most of the woman.  Granted,your view is from slightly above the waist, but you like to think that your eyes have captured all the important details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's big.  Now, given that you're only half an inch high that should be a given, but even if you were regular size you'd find this person to be large.  Maria is more or less perfectly proportioned, but this woman's tanned skin - white lines on her shoulders showing where her sunbathing was covered by bikini straps - covers an overweight mass of fat and muscle.  She's probably not obese, but your unique perspective accentuates the difference in stature, making her seem monstrously bloated.  Her form seems barely contained by the strappy top that she wears on this hot summer's day, and the tremendous size of her breasts puts you in awe, utterly lost for a suitable comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA near-floor length blue skirt covers her from the waist down, and you can barely make out her face past her prodigious chest.  Long strands of (dyed?) red hair hang down though, and you think that you can place the accent with which she speaks as Australian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subject matter on which she speaks with Maria isn't terribly interesting.  They're only mild acquaintance, it seems, since they both have daughters attending this school, and they're making small talk while they wait for their kids to leave.  They talk in that way that near-strangers do, revealing nothing too deep about themselves as they string out hopeful offers of topics to bring them closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a girl runs in from the distance, and you jump up as you fear that Sasha will see you and grasp you again.  But the rapidly approaching colossus is too pale, tall and blonde to be her, and as she veers toward Maria's friend you realise that it must be her daughter.  The mothers exchange farewells and turn to part, but as this happens Maria re-settles the bag on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall off it.</span></div></div>",

The sudden opening of the partition shocks Sasha, her right hand in knocking motion, her left grasped into a ball.

Sasha strolls, head down, past the couch and into the kitchen, sitting at a table in its center.  Maria closes the door and carries you into the kitchen.  As she sits across from her daughter, she carefully sets you onto the tabletop.  She turns her attention from you, glaring at Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why did you come home alone?\", Maria asks more calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't\", Sasha responds, \"and I was so careful, just like you said.  I didn't want to smush him\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria now looks confused, \"Smush who, honey?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other little man, silly\", Sasha says with the innocence only a child could possess, \"He said he was looking for his friend, so I brought him here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha reaches across the table, not to far from you, with her clenched fist.  Her fingers uncoil, and another half-inch tall man drops onto the oak surface.  As he brushes himself off, you immediately recognize him.  That run down black zoot suit, those out of style sunglasses, that sinister smirk; you could never forget that jerk from the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\", you cry with a pointing finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's mouth reveals a wide grin, \"Me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria grasps the severity of the situation, \"Sasha, dear, why don't you go to your room and play awhile\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha nods, seeming to forget about the tiny people standing on the table, and runs to her room.  You glance over your shoulder at Maria.  She looks angry, to say the least.  Unlike you, the mysterious stranger doesn't seem the least bit intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, you have a very lovely daughter, Ms.Givens\", the man addresses the fuming giantess, \"Such a sweet little girl\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you hanging around my daughter?!\", Maria pounds a wrecking ball of flesh into the table hard, causing a great quake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful now\", the stranger taunts, looking at you instead of Maria, \"You're scaring our little friend\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true.  Maria's sudden spout of rage has you shaken.  Maria seems to take notice, toning down her voice as she speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want him?\", Maria refers to you, \"Why can't you just fix him and leave us alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get one thing straight\", the mystery man corrects, \"I don't want anybody, I'm only doing what I have to\", he then turns his attention to you, \"You certainly have complicated things, haven't you?  I told you no one could help you, but you had to go and find help anyway, didn't you?  Well, now your new friend is going to need to come with us, too\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we don't?\", Maria questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you could turn me down\", the man says casually, \"After all, it would probably be a lot easier to parent a child that stands less than a half-inch tall\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me\", you work your way into the conversation, \"I'll go with you, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger shakes his head, \"As I said, that's not enough, anymore.  The two of you need to come with me right away.  Otherwise, the kid is going to shrink.  Well, what's it gonna be?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up once again, and the answer reveals itself to you.</span></div></div>",

The tremor of the collision throws you onto the inside edge of Maria's thumb.  In thoughtless fear, you climb onto the thick digit, the instinctual logic that something can't crush you if you're on top of it taking precedent over all else.  Regaining your senses, you walk to the center of the back of Maria's hand, her distraught face dominating your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do?\", Maria asks you in a state of shock, \"I killed him, didn't I?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", your response is emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria lowers her head, \"I'm sorry.

You cling to the nearest knuckle as Maria jumps from her seat.  You somehow manage to hang on through her hurried pace.  Maria opens the door to Sasha's room, but she (Sasha) is no where to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha\", Maria calls out with a soft desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria begins to take a step into the room, but you think better of it, \"Wait!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sandaled foot retracts to its original position as Maria seems to have figured out why you stopped her.  The two of you scan the floor.  Maria's large eyes struggle to differentiate her daughter from the light blue, tight-laced carpet, but you make out the crying little child sitting in the middle of the room.  You point Sasha out to Maria, and she (Maria) gets on her hands and knees, you still atop her right hand.  Maria crawls to her tiny child, reaching cautiously to her.  Sasha responds the way any little kid (or anyone else, for that matter) would in such a predicament, she turns and runs away in absolute terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha!\", Maria screams with tears rolling down her face, \"Come back, honey.  Mommy only wants to help!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, this whole thing takes some getting used to\", you educate Maria, \"Better let me take care of this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, right!  Ignoring the fact that you haven't even gotten a handle on your own situation yet, you're notoriously bad with children.  Yeah, you're just the man for the job!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap from Maria's hand, and sprint after the scared little girl.  You call her name, and Sasha stops.  Upon seeing you chasing after you, she runs to meet you.  Her arms wrap around your legs as her head buries itself in your thigh.  A minute of tears later, and Sasha looks up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not big\", Sasha states the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou puff your chest your chest out, acting playfully offended, \"Bigger than you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour comment gets a badly needed rise out of the poor girl.  You begin to lead her back to her ridiculously large mother's waiting hand, but she backtracks at the sight of Maria's immense smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not scared, are ya?\", you taunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha's face turns angry, \"No!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are able to guide Sasha to her mother with little resistance.  Picking Sasha up, you set her on Maria's clean palm.  Sasha looks frightened, but calms down a bit when you climb on as well.  The two of you are elevated to Maria's weakly smiling visage.  Sasha hides behind you, peeking at the intimidating vision from the side of your leg.  You can tell it's killing Maria to have her daughter be so frightened of her, but she at least seems a little consoled that Sasha has taken a liking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\", Maria begs for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrape for ideas, \"Maybe we should check out that guy's...remains.  There might be a clue or something\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nods in agreement, carrying Sasha and you through the apartment and back into the kitchen.  Maria shields the two of you from what you expect is a bloody sight.  Maria gasps as she brings you around to see the shocking sight for yourself.  You cover Sasha's eyes in anticipation of the gory scene.</span></div></div>",

It's a long way down from my face and little girls can be very hard to spot when they're lying on the floor.\" The child's too far away for you to hear her, adding to the amazement that only that morning it was a thunderous force even at the distance that now separates the two of you. \"You're gonna have to sort out your sense of distance all over again.\" The giantess sighed. \"We must all try to adjust to these circumstances.\" Once again there's relative quiet as Maria listens to her daughter's tiny squeaking voice. \"I'm not actually bigger now, dear. Truth is, somehow, you shrunk.\" Once again there's a pause as Sasha calls up to her mother; you just make out words like 'Me' and 'How' and 'What'. You watch as Maria now lowers her daughter down to you, releasing the little girl a few yards (your perspective) away from you. Sasha lies back and hold her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\" She complains. \"That hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, deary.\" She replies. \"But you're only a quarter of an inch high or so right now, and I'm more used to holding little people either in the palm of my hand or riding on one of my fingers.

She thinks back to how she held you.

How'd you survive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sneers, \"Please, it would take more than that to actually kill me. Although, you did cause a... fair amount of discomfort.

Teleporting, shrinking, microwave pizzas...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe how many test subjects we needed before we could perfect this technology. You have to get the sciences just right or else you get some nasty results. See, one's size doesn't change evenly. We had to do a whole bunch of work, and admittidly a bit of magic to keep you from freezing to death and so you can comprehend something more than breathing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic...\" You would be inclined to not believe him, if it weren't for the fact that he was right, and that he demonstrated it back at the bar where you first met Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria interrupted, \"That's great and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Daisy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Daisy, but I just came to see if you could unshrink my daughter and my boyfriend.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, under normal circumstances, I would be inclined to help you. After all, I'm not heartless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, it was a side effect of the shrinking!\" Ben said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, blame the side effects! Anyways, I would love to help you, but there's a couple problems. Our data is still incomplete and we need just one more test subject to complete our data. If we just let you go, we'd need some other guy to shrink and that takes too much paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see...\" Daisy leaned to the front of her desk. \"You tried to kill my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Your</i> husband threatened and shrunk my daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad judgment aside...\" Daisy said looking teasingly at Ben, \"You still tried to kill my husband. In fact, if he weren't so smart, he would have died. So, I'm giving you a choice. You can only have one of them unshrunk. The other one has to stay with us until we finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... what kind of choice is that? You can't force me to chose between my loved ones!\" Maria said baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I wasn't the one who nearly turned Ben here into a pancake! Besides, it's obvious that we hold all the cards here, so you might as well choose, because we don't just make fancy trinkets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria is looking at the two of you.

I suppose that you have had a rough day, so there's no harm in putting things off until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your shrunken girlfriend turn to look up, grateful.  Andrews beams back, then frowns briefly.  \"Can't have you sleeping in a box, though!  Good thing I have an alternative here somewhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pops out of sight, and for a few minutes the two of you stand wondering, then the giantess' hand swoops into the box, a mammoth flesh plane that crashes before you, palm uppermost, inviting you to venture atop it and be carried away.  After your experiences with Maria, you're well-used to travel by woman-hand, and Andrews seems to have well-kept fingers, smaller and less worn than those of the woman by your side.  Maria, in her minutes spent at a half-inch tall, has had nothing but bad experiences with being handled by others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" you whisper, looking deeply into her rapidly-blinking eyes, \"there's nothing to be afraid of.  She's big, but she's still human.  She doesn't want to hurt us, and I'm personally sick of this box already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a boost from you, Maria climbs up, sandals abandoned so that her bare toes can gain purchase in the ridges of Andrews' fingerprints.  You follow after, once again luxuriating in the warm musk radiating from a woman's hand.  The two of you carefully navigate the fingers to the palm, and you're free to notice the subtle differences between this younger woman and Maria.  You're no palm reader, but from this vantage you can clearly spot the differences just from the pattern of lines running before you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour introspective comparison is interrupted as the hand lifts off, and you drag Maria to her knees; the platform hardly remains level, and the two of you almost roll away as it tilts upward at the box edge.   It moves too quickly for you to grasp a picture of what the lab' looks like, and touches down again in a few moments, a shudder trembling your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me I wasn't this rough,\" Maria laughs.  You smile back, helping her down to the tabletop to face the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's odd to suddenly find yourself facing a building in perfect scale with yourself, a two-story detached house with neat little red brickwork and a bright green door.  You rub your eyes just to confirm this isn't an hallucination, and then Doctor Andrews fills in the blanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I present for madame and monsieur the 'Handheld House'!  It's really quite a bit easier to reduce non-living structures, and it was so much fun reconstructing and furnishing this thing once I had the materials.  I never had a dolls' house as a child you see, so perhaps I was overcompensating for -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you've swung your eyes upwards, past the neatly tiled roof to where the giant scientist looms overhead, reminding you that this is her world, in her scale, and the house before you is just a polite concession.  She blushes at your gaze.  \"Ahem.  Well,I'm clearly just babbling here, so why don't you two go get some rest, ready to be bright and refreshed for all the exciting tests tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens easily enough, and inside the house more than passes muster.  It's more believable than your own home.  Upstairs,your first port of call,the luxurious double bed is an overdue comfort.  You both collapse onto it, side by side, staring at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get out, find Sasha and get back to normal,\" Maria tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be that simple.  How can we get out of this building at our size?  And they've definitely got a way of tracking at least me, possibly you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so negative.  If they have a means of following you here, then they must have a way to deactivate that same ability,no doubt in this same place.  We find that after we've sprung Sasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have this all planned out,\" you grin, turning your head to look at Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face is raw, further into despairing tears than ever before.  \"I have to be.  If I think of the present, and how those people could be doing anything to my daughter..!  On the other side of that ceiling is a world of giant monsters, and I'm nothing but a lab rat!  If we can't outwit them...  If...\"</span></div></div>",

Daisy brings her hand to her desk where the two of you are standing. Mr. Bristin walks onto the palm of her hand and you climb on after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm going to lay down the ground rules. You can go all over her body, except under her clothing. Just crawl around and don't hurt her, or you'll be the one who gets hurt, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but what am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy's hand reached her bare stomach and hovered above it so you could easily get off. \"Have fun, boys! But not too much fun,\" She winks at you, \"I'm a married woman.\" She blew a kiss at her tiny husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered you, \"I'm sure you'll figure something out.\" He came closer to you and whispered, \"She's got a real ticklish spot under her chin, if you can't think of something.\" He jumped off and started walking to his wife's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there wondering what to do. \"Come on now, don't be shy!\" Daisy winked at you. You start slowly walking around and you fall over when Daisy starts giggling. You start rubbing the soft, but firm flesh of her stomach. Daisy starts moaning softly. \"Come on, guys! You've got to do better than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start crawling up Daisy's stomach and reach her ample chest. You look up to Daisy's face. \"Don't be shy! Knock yourself out!\" You crawl underneath Daisy's bra and between her breasts. You could hear Daisy lightly giggling, and her chest violently shakes when she's laughing. \"Kinda a ticklish spot.\" You start to feel slightly proud of yourself, until Daisy booms, \"Come on, did you forget you were supposed to be pleasing me?\" She kept laughing. \"I guess boys will be boys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turned red when she said that. You'll show her! You poked your head back out of Daisy's cleavage to be met her gigantic green eyes piercing through your soul. \"Well? You had enough? 'Cause I sure didn't!\" Daisy said, teasing you. You free yourself and start awkwardly crawling up to her chest. Daisy's chuckling doesn't make it easier. \"What, fancy some mouth-play or something? Sorry, but I'm not doing that. You haven't showered in, what, a couple days? Gross!\" Daisy stuck out her tongue at you. \"Tell you what, you come up here, and I'll give you a kiss. Sound good?\" You keep climbing her chest and climb up onto her shoulder. \"What are you doing? My face is over here.\" Her eyes suddenly went wide when she realized what you were doing. \"No. No! No, you wouldn't!\" You start scratching at the spot Mr. Bristin told you about. Daisy starts laughing once you start scratching at it. \"No, stop! My husband told you about that, didn't he?\" You start rubbing under her chin even faster, and Daisy goes into an uproar. This should be good enough for her.</span></div></div>",

What are they really up to here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went through the same routine I did yesterday?  Exercise and tests, being put through the wringer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I'm so out of shape!\" Maria laughs.  \"I don't think I've moved above a walking pace since I had Sasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Managed to keep a nice figure all the same, I must say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we've talked about this: there's no need to keep flattering me.

The exercises are exhausting, but the accomodation is adequate.  Nourishment comes in the form of a thin, pasty gruel; Doctor Andrews mentioned to you how it was too expensive to shrink down foodstuffs for just two people, and gave scientific reasons why your reduced metabolisms couldn't process anything more solid, but you'd zoned out before her conclusion.  You eat it because it's all there is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach evening, when parted partners are reunited, thoughts quickly turn to passion over promise of escape, bliss passing the night until a new battery of tests heralds the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after those two days, Maria is sick.  It's a thin stream of vomit at first, but quickly becomes more serious.  Doctor Andrews undertakes tests of a different sort, and you're left pacing back and forth across your cell while you wait.  Eventually, a thunderous tapping at the door brings you outside, gazing upwards at the beaming face of the doctor dominating the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good news!\" she roars, for the first time forgetting how delicate your ears are.  \"It reaffirms my theory that your shrunken forms are developing at an accelerated rate.  Perhaps a month a day?  I'd have to run more tests...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been trying to interrupt her all this time, but only when her eyes alight upon your diminished form does she stop her muttering and clap her hands thunderously.  \"Sorry!  I'll get to the point!  Maria is pregnant, and will give birth in five days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind reels, but you have no quiet to process this world-changing information.  The doctor continues talking above your head.  \"A natural-born tiny person!  Although, I suppose they'll technically be a new breed, and need a proper name and classification...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA father.  It's almost bigger news than the fact that you're half an inch in height and undergoing medical tests!  You don't know what to do next...</span></div></div>",

They'd probably gobble you up the first...\" She noticed your horrified face. \"Kidding! I don't know what I'd do without you either! Soon, the four of us will be living happily...\" Maria suddenly remembered something. \"Wait, Sasha! We should really tell her that she's going to be a sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step-sister.\" You corrected. You tried getting the attention of the doctor. \"Doctor Andrews! You have to let us see Sasha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor warmly smiled. \"One step ahead of you, tiny! I've already sent for your daughter when I learned that your lady-friend was pregnant!

You start to form words of protest, counter-arguments that freedom is worth any price, but Andrews speaks again, a thunderous voice against which you'd be nothing but a breath into a hurricane.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!  There are two more colleagues for you to meet,\" she says, stepping back and opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more women enter, scientists judging by their lab coats.  One is calm and restrained, long black hair kept neat.  The other has wild, untamed blonde tresses, and her eyes rove the room manically, magnified even further by the bug-like glasses she wears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I introduce Doctors Mallard and Beaton.  Doctor Mallard is here to help you, Maria, with your... condition.  There's only so much that I can do, but she has years of experience with unusual pregnancies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Beaton is an expert in the study of insects.  We were hoping that she may be able to turn that to some use in equating your reduced dimensions with properties inherent to similarly-sized naturally-occurring creatures.  I'll leave the two of you to get acquainted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallard and Andrews leave, not even giving you the chance to say goodbye to Maria.  Beaton closes on the table, dropping low so that her eyes are level with where you stand.  Never before have you felt more like prey than you have beneath her goggled gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly fascinating...\" she mumbles.  \"I never thought that what they said would be true.  It's incredible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'It' has a name,\" you say, determined to keep some trace of identity.  You don't want to die a lab animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Beaton stands up to her full height, putting a hand to her ear.  \"It speaks!  And these hearing aids do work in transmitting that speech at a reasonable volume!  They have thought of everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back down at you, licking at her lips absently.  \"Oh, for the perspective you can give us,\" she sighs.  \"You'll have to get acquainted with some of my specimens, yes you will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, how crazy is this lady?  And would she be willing to help where Andrews was not?  She does seem to be an outside contractor, no loyalty to Daisy, but would being in her unsupervised care be even more dangerous?</span></div></div>",

She laughs herself, crouching to greet them.  A few moments of embrace and she rises again, striding over to your waist-high location with both boys in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet my sons,\" she smiles, \"James is seven, and Ford is four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant children have their faces much closer to your level, and the youthful ignorance of their expressions is terrifying.  Instinctively, you move closer to Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you, little people,\" James says in a stilted, school play fashion.  Ford just nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be frightened,\" Doctor Andrews says, sweeping forward and bringing her kids back a step.  \"They're here for god training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, once the majority of the world has been reduced to your scale, we'll need some normal-sized people to care for the transition, to ward off any potential disasters.  Don't want to put all our eggs in one basket!  We went over a few terms, but realised that after a few generations they'll probably just be thought of as gods anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, here we teach the next generation care for people such as yourself!  They'll be raised to care for tinies and ensure they come to no harm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...\"  Maria looks up.  \"And, is Sasha part of this programme too?  Is that why she's not here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Andrews says, flatly.  \"That's the truth.  If you see her again, it'll be when she's fully elevated.  And with your ageing thirty times faster at your scale...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's rambling.  \"So,\" you sneer, \"a few chosen get to remain normal, and lord it over the majority of humanity?  You and your kids, with Daisy as queen-goddess of the damn world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not selfish,\" Andrews assures you.  \"I must remain this size due to my knowledge of the process.  And Daisy, well...\"  Her face becomes resolute.  \"Perhaps you need to see for yourself.  Come with me.  Boys, wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrews' hands slams onto the table, and the two of you crawl onto her palm again, settling in for another journey in each others' arms.  \"How much more shit is there to this?\" Maria whispers in your ear, and you can say nothing to reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrews drops you off on Daisy's desk, and the executive leans forward to loom over you both like the god she so fancies herself as.  A wave of the hand and the doctor leaves, Daisy smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your end game, Daisy?\" you demand, all fear gone.  \"You shrink the world, and then you and your chosen few rule it as gods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got me all wrong,\" she says, lowering herself so her chin rests on the edge of the desk.  \"I will not be joining the god-corps.  No, I have a grander destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how we can re-use the energies from shrinking someone to grow another?  Well, I'll have the energies of several billion shrinkings to infuse myself with.  I'll grow beyond boundaries, an immensity to shepherd the human race.  My lifespan will be extended proportionately, and I will ensure the future of our species by acting as our ark, carrying us into the reaches of the galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe we should try somewhere else.\" You hastily reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm going to tell her to release my daughter!\" Maria ran up to the desk while you grabbed her arm and you both hid.

Remember, if any one of you does anything to hurt her, I'll fire all of you faster than you can say 'Collaborator Defence' .\" Daisy was interrupted by a call on her cell phone. \"Oh hey, Haley. What are the test results so far?\" You could barely hear the sound of her cell phone, but you knew what was coming. \"What? What do you mean you haven't got the subjects yet? They should've been there hours ago!\" Daisy paused. \"Hold on, Doctor.\" She tapped the speaker of her desktop phone. \"Miranda, whomever you sent to send the package to the R&amp;D team. Send him in. Now.\" You could feel the tension in her voice. In minutes, a man came in the office and asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ms. Bristin, you wanted to see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Two hours ago, I sent you to deliver an important package to Doctor Haley Andrews in the R&amp;D team. Directly to her hand, I might add. Would you like to explain why she said she hasn't received it yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought since it was a package, I thought it would easier to send through the courier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me get this straight.\" Daisy leaned forward on her desk, still holding her phone. \"You took an incredibly important package, one that would've shaved months off our schedule, one that was extremely delicate and whose contents were extra sensitive, and one that I had explicitly stated that needed to be hand delivered, and you just gave it to the mail cart boy?\" The man nodded. Daisy said softly, \"Well, why don't you take a box, put all your belongings in it and ride the mail cart to the unemployment line because you are FIRED!\" There was an audible shock on the phone. \"Oh, no, not you, Doctor Andrews, you're doing great, you're still here.\" She continued chewing out the poor man. \"You heard me! You're fired! Go! Now! Don't let the door hit you on the way out!\" The guy darted out the door. Daisy cradled her head in her hand, hit the speaker again and said, \"Miranda. Get me a hot Green Tea, lemon and mint blend. The relaxing kind. Thank you.\" Daisy slammed her head on the desk and resumed her call on her cell phone. \"Honestly, Haley, we go through workers here like coffee filters. And I don't even drink coffee. I swear, if there's two smears of blood and guts where tiny people used to be, I'll fire the mail cart guy, too.\" More talking. \"No, I was not too hard on that guy! He needed to know that I don't tolerate laziness here! Besides, those two were the last subjects before we could start manufacturing these devices!\" Daisy sighed. \"And don't get me started on what I have to say to the girl now...\" The cell phone was talking some more. \"Meeting at dinner? Yeah, I could go for some food right now. Plus, I have a lot I need to discuss with you. I also have to check with my husband to see where they could've gone. All right, see you soon. Bye.\" Daisy hung up and was getting ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria started dragging you to the desk. \"Come on! We've got to hurry! While she's gone, we can see where Sasha is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were divided however, \"I'm actually kinda curious about what they have to say. Maybe we should jump onto Daisy's heels? Or her purse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? They're looking for us! Now, let's go! She's almost leaving!\"</span></div></div>",

If they are, I've got a lot of jobs to kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard. You were really mean to that guy. I really don't think you should've fired him over all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Haley. He messed up, big time. We both know that this would've finished all the tests for the ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it didn't end with his entire division getting the pink slip and wasting three weeks on getting replacements. So, you know, progress.\" The man said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Daisy said. \"Can you at least see where they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never understand how you can do that.\" Haley said. \"I'm lucky if I can find my glasses in the morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man replied...</span></div></div>",

Another tiny person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy tried to silence her. \"Quiet down! You don't want everyone here to find out, do you?\" Daisy's friend quickly quieted down. She turned back to you. \"So where's your girlfriend? You wouldn't leave her back there, would you?\" You shake your head. \"Well, where is she?\" You look back down to the purse. \"Was she in there with you?\" Daisy looks inside and retrieves Maria with her other hand. Daisy's friend squealed again, but covered her mouth. Daisy opened the hand you were in and dropped Maria right next to you. \"So, you found yourself free, and the first thing you do is go back to the one who captured you? I don't know if that was a smart move, or a really dumb one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy's friend said excitedly, \"It's a tiny couple!

You both knew she could easily end both of your lives with little more than a thought, and that she had a nasty temper to boot, so you didn't want to make her mad. Maria finally spoke up. \"We... we w-wanted to f-find where... where my d-d-daughter is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy instantly lightened up and said, \"Oh, she's fine. She should be safe. I've had my secretary get some living quarters for her. You can see her when you're done with the testing. Isn't that right, Haley?\" Daisy's friend, who was sitting across from her nodded eagerly. You felt Maria's mood fall, and so did Daisy. \"Here, I'll even let you talk with her.\" Daisy dialed on her cell phone and held it up to her ear. \"Yes, it's me, Ms. Bristin again. I want to talk to the girl we've put in the room. She's the daughter of one of our test subjects. What's her name?\" Maria tells her Sasha's name. \"Sasha, that's it.\" There's a pause.</span></div></div>",

You don't make it very far, stepping to the edge of her torso, right at her shoulder. You peer over the edge, the valley of her armpit looking none too easy to climb down, as it was as smooth as the rest of her skin. Looking back up you notice a distant and gigantic arm waving in the distance at you, and you wave back, at a loss as to what you should do. Maybe sensing your hesitation, the ground shakes slightly, a soft chuckle escaping Maria's lips above you. Her overly-cheery tour guide voice returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir, but the tour continues over here.\" You turn back to her torso, her other arm looming overhead. You stumble back in surprise, landing heavily on your butt. You hear, and feel, another soft laugh. She must have felt you fall. \"Please do your best to stay on your feet sir, the caves found between the Maria Mountains, and beyond, have been known to move from time to time!\" Her hovering hand motions to her cleavage, specifically to the small space you're pretty sure you can walk in. From your position against her skin, you can distantly feel her heartbeat, which was quite a bit calmer than your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling yourself up, you walk hesitantly over to the dark crevice, before looking up to Maria's face, or rather the underside of her chin. You can't see her face from where you are, so you clear your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir is there a problem?\" Maria's cheery act continues, before going quiet, holding her breath. Probably to try and hear you better, possibly out of anticipation. You clear your throat. \"Miss Guide, are you sure I will be properly supervised in the, uh, cave? I mean, I'll be out of sight and all, Maria...\" You decided to drop the act toward the end, to show her your concern. Hopefully she took it to note you think, as you hear her hum in thought.</span></div></div>",

And above the hole rest her glorious mounds, as tall and as wide as an inner city block. You swallowed nervously, stepping into the \"cave\". You walked a ways in, the space above your head slowly dropping until you had to hunch your head. It got dark pretty fast, the only light in was blocked by your silhouette, but it was enough where you could see where you were going, not that there was anything to get stuck on. From here you couldn't hear the outside world, and the ground rose and fell slightly as you walked. Deep beneath your feet you could hear her heartbeat, dancing wildly, and somewhere behind that you could even hear the rushing wind of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered at the thought of just how <b>big</b> she was compared to you, she could probably breath you in and not notice, heck, you could probably get buddy buddy with her ear canal at your size. You could really become a spelunker then, especially considering your current path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to examine the cave walls as you walk, and feel free to stop and bask in them at any time, but remember, there's more on this tour coming up!\" Maria Said, interrupting your musings. You actually jumped a little, your head pushing into the soft flesh above your head. It felt amazingly soft, like no cushion you had touched before. Leaning into the side of her boob, you press your head and hands into the skin, feeling giddy as you pushed into the giving flesh. It was fantastic. You don't know how long you were there, but Maria's voice beckons you from your hypnotized state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guests, please do not be alarmed, but it appears that there will be a brief cave-in momentarily. Please try to remain calm, but move frantically unless you are feeling discomfort. Enjoy!\" You leaned away from the cushiony wall, somewhat confused by her meaning, then it hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opposite boob suddenly rushed you, pinning you between her entirely. You struggled to move, trying to get your hands into a better position. Surprisingly, or unsurprisingly, this was as uncomfortable as it was comfortable. Surrounded on all sides by heat, the sounds of her body, and her soft flesh, you couldn't help but to love it all. You were having trouble breathing, but that didn't stop your heart from beating a million times a second in excitement. It also didn't stop you from getting an erection. You began to dry-hump through your pants, almost instinctively, but stopped as your lungs began to burst. You might have loved this thoroughly, but it wasn't worth suffocating over. So, you stop moving as she had instructed before, and within moments, air returned as the large masses reformed the cavern from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria and I hope you had a <i>pleasant</i> experience with the cave-in, the tour continues down the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself to your feet, gasping for breath yet wishing for it to happen again. No, that wouldn't be the best idea, you decide, straightening up and continuing on your way, away from the light coming from the top of the dress. The roof of breasts slowly ascends and you exit the \"cavern\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in front of you her belly began, visibly through the red light filtering through her dress. She was surprisingly fit, with a well toned abdomen, as far as you could tell. The dress itself was pulled tight, her knees tucked in near the end, blocking light and holding up your new, red sky. Maria's tour voice chimed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you see the Under-Dress Abdomen Plateau, watch out for the sinkhole near the middle! Enjoy the soft, tanned skin, the rise and fall of the belly, but watch out for the earthquakes, we might have underfed her prior to the tour!\" almost as if on cue, the ground rumbled, and somewhere beneath your feet, you could hear a deep growl. You shivered, standing in place. Somewhere beneath you her stomach, a fleshy sack of acid and darkness, growled in hunger. The scone didn't last long, apparently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head to clear your thoughts from that place, you head out down and onto her belly. The skin rose and fell beneath you, your steps only sinking in slightly before meeting firmly toned muscle. Occasionally the ground shook as her stomach growled, but you did your best to keep your footing. But you couldn't help but think of the twisting caverns beneath the skin you walked, massive compared to you. Thankfully you weren't so lost in thought as the walk right into her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt actually wasn't that deep, only two or three of you to get to the bottom. Not that you wanted to go down there, you might not be able to get out easily, or on your own. You really didn't want to tour to stop on your account, you mused to yourself, peering into the sinkhole as you walked around it. You took the moment to look off towards her \"mountains\", now under them you could see the simple laced pattern of her bra, and the sheer size of her boobs awed you once again. You walked backwards for a time, just marvelling in the view, the sounds, and the sweet smell of her skin, until you tripped and fell backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, you looked to see what you fell on, and quickly got up and of of it. It was the waistband of her underwear you had tripped on. Face becoming a deep crimson, you thought of what to do next. The thought of \"getting into her pants\", or so to speak, was very enticing. But still... she might not be okay with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir, but that concludes this tour, please prepare for exit. There will be bright light momentarily.\" You stepped back from her silken undergarments, not wanting her to think you were getting any ideas now. The ground beneath your feet heaved, as you realized she was sitting up. You fell forward, back onto her underwear, as the ground before you slanted, and the ends of the dress tucked under her legs pulled up, bright light blinding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shifted on the couch, causing another bout of earthquakes as she reached down to where you were with her finger. \"Alright, hop on and we'll conclude the tour! Thank you for choosing Maria as your vacation destination!\" With that, her finger rested at the top of her underwear. You boarded the fingernail, hugging the surface as she brought you out from under the dress. Eventually her finger came to a stop, holding you in front of her eyes. She was lying down again, but her head was propped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, she was smiling and her cheeks were flushed a little. Her beautiful brown eyes regarded you like you were the best thing she had laid eyes on. You smiled back. \"I really appreciate the tour, Maria, it was amazing.\" She laughed, her hand shaking a little, but you stayed firm, listening to her cheerful laughter. \"I'm glad you thought that, I was afraid you would be disappointed, but I aim to please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you shared a chuckle at that. \"I'm not sure how I could not enjoy that, your body is heavenly!\" Checking the rest of her face, you see that she is burning a very bright red, almost like her dress. \"Aw, you really are a little gentleman, aren't you?\" She smiled, shifting into a more upright position. She moved you a little ways away from her face, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have noticed, by my little \"earthquakes\", but I'm actually pretty hungry right now. Want to join me in the kitchen. Or I can wait, if there's something you would rather do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere might actually be something...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for you, the force of her laughter lifted you off of your feet, throwing you against the toaster with a loud ting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's laughter quickly dropped away, replaced with concern. \"Oh my god, what was I- no I mean I'm so sorry- are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was ringing from the impact and previous deafening laughter, but you gave her looming face a thumbs up as you gathered your wits. She seemed to calm down, a little sigh escaping her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a-\" With a resounding DING, the toast popped up, bringing your head back to ringing madness.

I was going to get it before the timer went off and...\" she keeps talking, apologizing, and generally trying to make up for what she thinks she's done.

Go ahead!\" You weren't sure about that last part, but you hated seeing her so... dejected?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria brought her other hand up, adjusting the collar of her dress. \"Well... alright then. If you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at you, her composure pulling back up. She must still have some actress left in her after all. \"Well it's good you don't mind butter, because...\" She began, lowering her finger faster than you could react, causing you to tumble off of her fingernail as it reached it's destination. Instead of the plate or counter, you found yourself on a field of warm, sticky, yellowish stuff. Butter! You were on the toast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shifted as Maria picked up the toast you were standing on. Nearly falling over, you watched as the toast, and you, were moved up to her waiting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding frozen in place, you found yourself facing Maria's lips. Her red lips turned upwards in a smirk as she finished her previous statement. \"my topping is you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth opened, and your eyes grew wide as you stared into her approaching maw. Saliva hung in strands and wavered as her massive tongue slipped out to meet the slice of toast you were standing on. You felt the wind pick up as she breathed in, forcing you to crouch low to the buttered toast, or be pulled into her massive maw. Her mouth loomed over you before her teeth quickly smashed down on the toast, only a few feet in front of you. You stared at the white pillars and red upper lip in awe, she was truly massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the slice of toast back to the plate as she chewed her colossal bite. She looked down at you with a sort of \"I told ya so\" kind of look. You stumbled back, released from your frozen position, and fell onto the buttered toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I didn't scare you too much, but you did tell me to do it.' She said through a slightly sorry smirk. \"I hope you're still hungry after that, you can work on that slice until your full, then it's mine again- minus you of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nodded, before realizing she couldn't hear you. \"Uh, yeah! I'll let you know when I'm done.\" She nodded, before picking up the other slice. You continued to sit there, almost in shock, before standing up from the sticky ground. The butter had moslty melted, leaving an almost rocky surface for you to walk on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kicked a burnt piece off of the ground, picking it up. It was as hard as a rock. You frowned, doing the same in other places as you walked across the toast. All of it was too hard for you to bite, or even gnaw on. Eventually you sat down again, deciding you weren't hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria finished off her piece, before looking down at you. \"You finished there, big guy?\" She leaned in close, the sky being replaced by her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but Maria didn't move away. Instead she squinted at you scrutinizingly. \"You are absolutely covered in butter. Sorry about that, I guess I ruined your clothes.\" You looked down at your shirt and pants, which were, as she said, quite ruined with butter. Your shoes would fare better, but they were soaked through as well with melted butter. After taking stock of your now ruined clothes, you shrug up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria leaned back, lowering her finger to you. \"Well, I don't want you stuck in those soaked clothes. If you were a bit bigger I might just grab one of Sasha's doll's clothes for you, but you aren't really near the right size for that...\" She mused as she moved you off the toast and onto the plate, letting you step off before she continued. \"So, I guess you can either stay soaked in butter and I try to wash your clothes later, or you can just take them off and I can try to wash them sooner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the slice of toast as she said that, taking a bite once she finished. She wasn't wrong, but should you really get naked in front of her? You pick up a crumb, thankfully softer than what you found earlier, and mused the situation as you chewed it. You WERE in her dress earlier, so would it be okay to be in the nude now?</span></div></div>",

Only once you've pried yourself free, standing on the plate in your birthday suit, do you realise how cold it is here.  Your own little fella isn't liking it much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarmth sweeps over you, Maria's face looming in for a closer look.  Following the exhalation from her nostrils, she gasps at your nakedness, almost sucking you from your feet.  With arms out for balance, you expose your junk, and look up into Maria's you-sized pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she says, \"I can almost see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty mean, but the charge of warmth from her words does bring a prick of excitement from you, your manhood peeking up at the goddess with a rush of blood.  You straighten your back as well, and boldly look up at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, that was mean,\" she sighs, and then her eyes goggle wider.  Eyes with pupils as big as your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's not looming as much as she was a moment ago, and as you take a step back, slipping and falling from the plate, you see why.  Somehow, you've grown from half an inch to half a foot - six inches!  A single step for you carried you to the distnat edge of the plate, and a fall now is little more than an inconvenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess those clothes will fit you now...\" Maria mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

My guide will take you to the region, have fun!\" her finger re-appears, and you feel her begin to shift as she waits for you to climb on. You do so, sitting on her nail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world rises as Maria stands from the couch. she walks slowly and carefully with you on her finger, right above her \"Twin Peaks\" as she had called them. She was quite the woman, really. She was kind, and quirky all while having a body that would put younger women to shame, not that she was that old though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carries you out of the living room, through the kitchen, and down a hallway. Maria opens a door larger than anything you really want to comprehend into a room colored a soft lavender, a large bed dominating most of the space. She sets you on a nightstand before motioning around the room. \"Welcome, young adventurer, to my bedroom. The... home of Maria and the tours of!\" She then proceeded to throw herself on the bed, a giddy smile present on her face. Even on your perch upon the nightstand, you feel the shock wave as her multi-ton body impacts the bed. To someone your size, that might have killed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled onto her belly, facing you on the nightstand, her head cradled by her hands. \"So, intrepid adventurer, are you ready for the reverse side tour?\" You nod again, stepping toward the edge of the nightstand as she extended her hand to you. \"A quiet one, aren't you?\" Maria smiled. \"In aw of the natural beauty, I suppose?\" You get onto her finger, holding on as she brings it and you to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen a landscape so beautiful! Truly a natural wonder!\" You shout in her ear as you pass by. You don't see her face, but you're pretty sure she didn't expect a reply by her hand's momentary hesitation as it let you off atop her head. Her black hair flowed up around you slightly, about up to your knees. You hear her voice from below. \"Welcome to Chef de Maria tours, the start of our tour today. Take your time to enjoy the view, smell the fine, clean hair, and when you're finished, climb down the flowing hair to the Spinal Slide, which will take you to the next part of the tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step towards the back of her head, looking off the edge. Her fine hair flowed down to the base of her neck far below. Past there was a slope of red that flowed down to the edge of two small hills, where the dress continued before stopping abruptly. Past the end of the dress, her well toned tanned legs kicked in the air, her sandals removed. Her toes curled and uncurled in the distance, showing that she was at least somewhat excited. Beneath her body, the blue blanket looked like a still ocean, and her body a massive island. You stand and take in the view for a moment or two before taking a few strands of hair in hand and beginning the climb down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, her hair was perfect. No tangled hairs showed themselves for you to use as footholds as you made your way down. A few minutes passed before you reached the skin of her neck, and the edge of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her shiver as you carefully make your way to the edge of the dress, where you stop a moment to rest. Maria must be ticklish here, you think, thinking about how to move forward. Her skin was smooth here, as she seemed to be everywhere, and against the skin as you were, you could see where the dress lifted up slightly at the top, revealing a dark slope stretching off under the dress. You consider this option for a moment before Maria's voice interupts your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you might see, sir, there are two paths here, over or under. Both are available to you as you have permission from the Ranger of this tour. Both are enjoyable, I guarantee!\"</span></div></div>",

You slide down to the gap between her smooth skin and the dress, into the relative darkness. It wasn't actually that dark under the dress, and from here you could smell her. A soapy smell, with a hint of lavender. She must like both the color and the flower. Beneath you her body creaks, you can feel the grinding of her shoulder blades as they arch up distantly either side of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly notice why as you slide under what must have been the strap of her bra, she must have lifted it for you, she really does think of these things, doesn't she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you take the slide to the base of the Posterior Hills, take some time to appreciate the warmth of Maria's skin, and the smell of her moisturizer. It's all there for an adventurer such as yourself!\" You feel her chuckle after cheerfully giving her act another go. Gosh, she was fantastic. You don't know if she was trying to meet up with someone today, or always had a little hope to find some romance, but to receive such gifts was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like eternity, but was barely a minute on her smooth skin, her body leveled out, and beneath her skin you could feel the solidness of her tailbone. You wait a moment, to see if she says anything else. When she doesn't you make your way forward, hardly needing to push the red silkiness of her dress up to pass comfortably. Then, in the dim light, you come to the edge of her underwear. Your breath stops a moment, waiting to see if she says anything, yet still  nothing is heard from your tour guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

The monolith of red moved from her comfortable position resting across the length of the couch, sitting up straight, feet crossed on the coffee table. She smiles down to you, moving her finger back to the armrest. \"I'm actually surprised you chose this tour, its not a normal tour like the others.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back onto the fingernail and it sails up to her face.

You clearly didn't know what was going to happen, yet you were going to go along with this anyway? You take a moment to look off the edge of her nail, toward the ever distance lap of the giantess holding you. A little voice in the back of your mind tells you to jump, you tell it to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? We can do another tour if you'd like?\" You look back up at her eyes, now showing concern. Was she scared that she had frightened you?

White pillars guarded the entrance, and further in her massive tongue sat in her mouth, glistening. Warm air breathed on you, humid with the slightest smell of mint, as well as the food she had eaten earlier. Strands of saliva ran around the edges of her mouth, shaking under her breaths. In the back of the massive maw, looming in the darkness, was her throat. The entrance to her body in full, top to bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, staring into Maria's mouth, just as she did as well.

Sure, the worst that happens to you is a little indigestion, but I could die, here!  I thought you understood that.  You were so clear to Sasha, but it turns out you're no better than her, so fascinated with the tiny freak and what you can do to him that you don't care about how he feels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true!\" Maria blurts, and her forceful ejaculation blasts you from your perch, tumbling onto the hard surface of the woman's dress.  And as you fall out of sight, she sits up to get a better look at you, causing the landscape to fold and rear, surfaces sliding and rising around you.  You fall more, earning more bruises as you roll across the vastness of her body, before coming to a stop at the edge of her cupped hand, the goddess above you having set her eyes upon you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria lifts you up again, and with pained breaths you continue your tirade.  \"See?

What's to stop me getting an itch and scratching you to death without thinking?  No, we need to keep apart, for your safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand transporting you crashes down atop a mantelpiece, cyclopean ornaments towering over you.  As you drop down from the warm flesh, Maria takes a step back as she crouches a little, allowing more of her form to be visible to you, and the merest wisp of her tornado-strength breath reaching you with each word she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.  We'll work something out take things slow.  You stay up there, and I'll get you something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer, she strides off, her powerful form out of sight in moments.

Which she is, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't even as tall as the big toe of this foot, and as you lay your hand upon it to steady yourself you see how tanned it is. Or how pale you are, you're not sure which. You squeeze yourself between the two warm walls where the strap of the sandal divides the biggest toe from the others. There is no smell here, somewhat surprisingly, the strap is something to hold onto in case of an emergency and you can't help but feel a little turned on at the feeling of these humongous extremities around you. You look up, but see only darkness within the folds of the dress that lie above the pillars that are the ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is silence where before was the constant drone of passing vehicles. This is soon followed by a lurch as the foot sets of on its journey. Through the violence of the foot lifting and dropping and the noise of the heel of the sandal slapping against the woman's heel you think you can make out the girl skipping ahead. Looks like you made the right choice of transport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your unwitting helper has taken you across the road, but here is no respite. She continues walking. Fighting the waves of 'foot sickness' coursing through you, you can basically tell that she's walking in the direction opposite that of where you were heading. As the journey continues, you can also tell that you are hungry, mainly by the fact that there's nothing in your stomach to be thrown up by this journey. You're not going to start eating this woman's foot, so you'd better find some sustenance, and fast! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't notice much of the passing scenery, too concerned are you with holding onto where you are and trying to ignore your stomach's demands. When the seismic disturbance stops, you almost think that you've finally gone insane. But it's only the woman stopping walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you peer out between her toes. You have been taken to just outside the gates of a school, which the girl is running through to join with other similarly titanic children. If you wanted to get off this sandal, now would be your only chance. But why would you want to? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go into the school, where there is sure to be some food. You don't know how long it's going to be before your ride is going to indulge herself. The only danger would be the large number of large boys and girls that would quite happily pull your arms and legs off, and then only if they fail to accidently step on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be much safer to stay here with the mother. If it is her mother. You realise that you don't know what relation they are - she could be the girl's mother, an older sister or even just a baby sitter. The only way to find out would be to ride her foot to its journey's end. It's going to be a rough ride, but if you survive there should be some food, or at least someone mature to get help from. </span></div></div>",

The sandalled foot crashes down between you and the scorpion, throwing you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, it is similar to the one that you rode in on, only its owner is paler and, you think, just a bit smaller in scale. She is wearing a long blue dress, with what looks like a flower pattern upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you are grasped in fingers, only these are much bigger than the boy's. She seems to be applying less pressure though, and you are at least able to breathe. From your vantage point, held between the forefinger and thumb of her left hand, you peer past the whorled surfaces to see the scorpion held by the tail in the other. Around, boys are getting to their feet, and you discover that you are being held above their heads. Probably not a good idea to look down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, instead, you move as much as you can to allow yourself to see the face of your saviour. Her young, open face is surrounded by a mass of strawberry blonde, curly hair. Perhaps she's a teacher here.

You certainly don't take him out of his cage! What would have happened if he'd stung one of you, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys don't seem to have any answer to this, although a few mumble sorrys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, run along now and play and we'll say no more about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you are in motion, carried along at neck height by the woman. You see crowds of kids pass by beneath you, some looking at you or Boris, others concentrating on their youthful games. The entrance to the school looms before you, and she effortlessly ascends the three steps that would otherwise have formed an impenetrable cliff of doom to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you are in a classroom, the alphabet running along the top of the wall above the blackboard. You see the right hand lowering Boris into a large glass tank filled with broken vegetation, a scattering of sand at the bottom. Then you are live with fear; what if she intends to feed you to this creature?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are relieved when you see her move away from Boris' lair. She briefly raises you to her face and says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get you back where you belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you are ecstatic; she's seen you, and she wants to help! But as you see what she holds in her right hand now, you realise that she is performing that trick so beloved of women everywhere; talking to a pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops you, and you fall into the high sided plastic cup that she holds, along with the swarms of miscellaneous creepy crawlies already there. You plunge into the mass head first, and are soon fending off antennae from a dozen admirers. Clearly, this is Boris' food supply - he likes it live. You came here looking for food, and it seems that you're now set to become it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a brief moment of freedom, you look up to see the woman's face covering the entrance, smiling down at you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to put you somewhere where little hands can't get to you,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no! She's going to put the cup high up on a shelf somewhere! If she does that, you've got no chance of getting down!

It was a strange bug...it wasn't black or green or anything most bugs were colored. More like peach or tan. And it only had four legs... She made to put you back in the cup, but you dig into her fingertip as she does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other hand's finger sweeps down to prod at you, smacking you in the back, leaving you winded. You cling even more forcefully onto the fingertip you held onto. You were NOT going back to that bug-cup!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger raises skyward, you holding onto it for dear life as you're brought before the face of the massive, frowning woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you like me, eh? Attached to the angel of mercy that rescued you from Boris.\" the woman said, smiling down at you. She seemed to think about it and then shrugged with a slight smile. \"Well...all right. I was thinking about getting a pet anyways,  and a little bug like you is certainly low-maintenance. First, I'll have to put Boris' food away though.\"  With that, she lowers you to a desk and scrapes you off her finger before taking the the high-sided plastic cup with the swarms of miscellaneous creepy crawlies in it and puts that on a shelf too high for anyone other than an adult to reach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUH?! No, no, no, no, no, no! You didn't want to belong to anybody! You bolt, only to skid to a stop as a wall of vertical flesh drops out of nowhere and you crash into it.  \"That tickles.\" booms the woman's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust your luck, as soon as you try escaping, she finished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and shake your head to clear it and look up at the strawberry-blonde, curly hair-framed face of the woman that wants to keep you! The features are proportionately delicate, with large, expressive eyes currently narrowed in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna play, huh? Fine! Come here, little one!\" the woman said and you looked up and gasped at the sheer size of her hand that's reaching for you. Big as a continent, at least! One that was descending towards you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run from it in sheer terror, not caring about direction as long as you avoid getting grabbed, but suddenly you feel a large presence slam around you and you run head-first into a barely visible barrier. Walls of plastic surround you on either side.You look to your right side and see the one thing you were really hoping you wouldn't: A gigantic thumb print from the digit holding your prison in place. You beat your fists ineffectively on the strong plastic surface, then jump back as something slides under the bottom edge of the wall, nearly chopping at your feet until you jump up to land on it as it swiftly becomes the floor.With a sinking feeling, you recognise the technique that's been used to capture you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you, pet!\" the woman laughed, then slid a paper under your feet and the cup before lifting it up carefully and raising the  paper up, making you gasp. You did NOT like this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fun, I'll admit that. Now...let's go home, little thing.\" she said. then flips the cup you were trapped under, along with the paper and you fall to the underside of the cup with a with a minute, painful thud.  Then your captoress sets about finding a plastic cap for the cup, she snapped it on and gazed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll play more when we get back to your home with me, Until then, enjoy the ride!\"  she smiles before carrying off the cup that you were inside of with her.</span></div></div>",

Constant explosions make you stumble, but you concentrate on maintaining a straight path, not contemplating the very real possibility of annihilation striking without warning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour faith is rewarded, the crowds clearly as you close on the three, short steps that lead up to the school proper.

Or so it may seem to her.  From where you're standing, half an inch tall and scared out of your wits, the tremendous detonations the impacts throw up still leave some major seismic activity going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd to that, the fact that she's moving slowly just emphasises her scale, somehow.  The heel, a solid mass that could flatten a house, leading down to individual toes that each boast a mass far in excess of yours, pressing into the ground until they pale prior to the foot launching into the air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's without even mentioning the sight of gazing up the length of her leg to the greater bulk of her body.  Never before have you felt so tiny, and over the last few hours you've been feeling quite small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth feet settle a foot away from you, although the minor motions of restless toes still give you pause as they rear into the air every now and then.

Gently, yet still your bones are compacted within you and your skin screams in torment.

It distracts you from the pain, and the moment of ungodly sickness when you are picked up, the woman standing to her full height and pulling you upward stomach and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a cautious smile that she wears during her examination of you, barely displaying her ferocious teeth and creasing her attractive face.

You turn and run towards the overhang under the kitchen counter but escape from a colossal-sized being is impossible. The  mom takes a single half-stride with her foot and is already right on top of you despite your efforts in sprinting as fast you can! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this mother's foot pounds into the ground from the single step, a loud thundering noise echoes through the kitchen from the impact and the whole ground shakes, causing you to trip up on the ground right in front of  the woman's titanic toes! You stand up again, panting and gasping as you realize that you were still nowhere near the kitchen counter and this mother was upon you, staring at your from thousands of feet in the air, ready to smash you with that broom. You back up slowly and then wave your arms up, jumping up and down and screaming at the same time but she can barely see the tiny, ant-sized being at her feet's real features and just notices that it is moving it's tiny \"legs\" throughout the air as if it is annoyed and about to bite her or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue your desperate attempt at attention but the woman still has an unfazed look on her face when suddenly you see her toes which were each the size of ranch houses suddenly lift up and crash into the ground! Her toes were so large that a simple flexing movement with them caused the ground to shake like a tremor was happening and you lose balance and scramble to get back up. The giantess sees this and her scowl turns into a small smirk as she does this for a while watching the bug continue to lose its balance and scramble before her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the tiny bug pathetically scurrying about her feet. She shakes her head with a scoff and a bemused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before her massive feet, you pale in fear as her massive feet shift, squeaking and sticking to the linoleum floor before you.

She placed it near the bug and begins to drag her toe towards it. \"Look out, the giantess comes! Uh-oh, you're in trouble now, you little thing...\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive unpainted toe slams into the ground and begins to drag towards you. You begin to run away, only to suddenly be stopped by the massive toe, which had raised into the air and blocked them. \"WHERE ARE YOU GOING, HUH? THOUGHT YOU COULD ESCAPE THE WRATH OF A GODDESS?\" the woman thunders from above. The toe started to playfully and gently bat you to the ground, and then hovered above you as you cower in it's shadow. \"LOOKS LIKE THE END....\" the woman says in a teasing voice and lowers the toe slowly, \"ARE YOU GONNA RUN?\" She laughs cruelly, but still sounds playful. To her, she's simply toying with some bug, amusing herself, but you're in serious danger. Just as the toe is about to squash you, it lifts away suddenly. You look around in time to see the massive foot close in on you with a boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you then realise you were in a canyon between her big and second toe, and look up to see her grinning down at you and her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEH. I PUT MY FOOT DOWN AND SUDDENLY IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR YOU, LITTLE MITE. UH OH...LOOKS LIKE A DEATH TRAP...\" she says in a sing-song voice and starts to slowly close her toes around you. However, just as suddenly, it's gone and the toe returns. \"HAHA...FOOLED YOU~!\" the toe begins to dangle above you like a pendulum.  \"SO... YOU LIKE MY FEET HUH? WELL...IN THAT CASE...I'LL JUST KEEP YOU TO AMUSE MYSELF WITH!\" she smiled and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot liking what could be going through her head, you bolt in the other direction...only to skid to a stop as a massive shadow appeared over you and you looked up just  in time to see the head of the broom zooming right at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THWOMP!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and see nothing but tree-sized bristles all around you. You were alive?! Not that you were complaining but...WHOA!

As you slide down, something shifts and you look up to see a massive...thing...sweeping through the tops of the broom's strands.

For hygiene reasons she's clearly going to deposit you somewhere while she eats, so perhaps you should act before that?  You could jump from her hand to a counter, and from there be able to hide and scavenge food rather than being at her dwindling mercy.

I OWN YOU! I GUESS I'M JUST SO RAVENOUS TONIGHT! ALTHOUGH, IT'S NOT PERFECT; I DON'T HAVE ANY <i>CHERRIES</i>! BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU'LL DO IN A PINCH!\" You try to run but before you could get any far, the woman removes the glass and snatches you up. You shiver as the titanic mother has you in front of her face and then smirks evilly before she snaps her teeth in your face and gives you a view of the inside of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she plops you down on top of her ice cream and makes you yell. \"HOPE YOU LIKE THE VIEW OF THE INSIDE OF MY MOUTH,\" says your sadistic and very huge mistress. \"BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE INSIDE OF IT! WE'RE PLAYING A NEW GAME! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO WIN IS STAY INSIDE MY MOUTH WHILE I EAT MY ICE CREAM, WITHOUT GETTING SWALLOWED IN THE PROCESS!\" You let out a scream and that she-devil laughs before digging her spoon into the ice cream and taking the first bite with you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you can recover from being unceremoniously plopped into the giantess's mouth, she begins to eat more and more of her ice cream and you have to swim through some strawberry ice cream just to survive as you cough on the whipped cream that hits you in the face. You plant your feet back on the tung but trip on a walnut before the tongue pushes you to the side of the giantess's mouth into some chocolate ice cream. You grab hold of the giant woman's gums for dear life and have to move down as you're nearly crushed with several walnuts by her teeth. Then some coffee ice cream hits you and pushes you towards the throat. You look back to see the blackhole that leads to a painful demise and work your way through the ice cream as you climb desperately up the tongue to avoid going down your mistress's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen that giant she-devil sadistically sprays whipped cream into her mouth and you're trapped inside the bubble. You work your way out of the whipped cream but now it's in your eyes and you can't see and what's worse is that the tongue is moving around so fast that you're slipping and slipping and you have trouble climbing  through a wall of sherbet as your mistress greedily keeps filling her monstrous world-breaking mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you survive this dangerous game.</span></div></div>",

She must have finally finished her ice cream...THANK GOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you collapse onto the woman's tongue, you hear a gurgling sound coming from the shaft that lead to the abyss of her stomach before there was a large sound and a gust of hot wind that flung you out of the woman's mouth. She'd belched you out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream and flail wildly as you go through the air and then gravity snares you and you start falling, but as you fall, you slam into something smooth, cold and hard.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe spoon! You'd landed in it! You tremble all over, but your too stunned and freezing to do much more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMM...?\" That was the giant she-devil who just made you have to go through all that! She leaned over, looking at you closely, you look up at the woman's face, overwhelming in scale but not somewhat clearer at such a close distance. The features are proportionately delicate, with large, expressive eyes that apparently recognized you, because they narrowed in glee and that terrible mouth you were just trapped in moments ago splits wide, teeth stealing time in the light for a brilliant moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, WELL....SO YOU MADE IT THROUGH YOUR  PUNISHMENT FOR TRYING TO ABANDON YOUR MASTER. I'M IMPRESSED, MY LITTLE BUG!\" the titanic woman said, bringing her thumb and index finger of her free hand to bare down upon you. \"SO...NOW THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF DENYING THAT I OWN YOU, COME TO MAMA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try pushing yourself up but you're too weak and the massive digits snatch you up and your dangling before her face and the titanic mother laughs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW THAT WAS A FUN GAME, WASN'T IT?\" she cooed mockingly to you, then she  licked her lips, \"YOU KNOW...I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA, AFTER EATING SO MUCH,I WOULD ENJOY A NICE LONG DANCE....AND YOU'LL BE JOINING ME! HOW ABOUT A NICE ELETRONICA RAVE FOR JUST THE TWO OF US? I CAN JUST IMAGINE IT--ME, IN A PAIR OF PLATFORM PUMPS, AND YOU EITHER UTTERLY HELPLESS, BOUNCING AROUND AGAINST MY FOOT OR SCAMPERING AROUND DESPERATELY TRYING TO AVOID MY BIG FEET AS I MOVE AND BOUNCE AROUND TO THE MUSIC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pale and furiously shake your head no, the woman seems to get another idea. \"...OR....WE COULD TRY SOMETHING ELSE! \" she laughed as she whipped you around and left you staring as she shakes her rather plump butt at you in delight and spanking herself, she even lets out a loud fart that nearly makes you go deaf as you gag . \"...LIKE SEEING HOW GOOD YOU FEEL IN HERE! FEELING MY LITTLE BUG THRASH AND SQUIRM AS YOU TRY CLIMBING OUT, AVOIDING BEING CRUSHED BETWEEN MY CHEEKS, OR KEEP FROM BEING SUCKED IN DEEPER INTO MY BOOTY....THAT SOUNDS UTTERLY DIVINE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO IT DIDN'T! You didn't like that idea at all! The giantess that had calmed you as her property was going to do either of those to you!? You remember thinking that when this woman tires of playing with you, she's going to kill you...looks like you might not even last until  she gets bored! This was a nightmare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother put the spoon and bowl in the sink then smirks at you before carrying you through her house and upstairs before you end up in a bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smirks and flicked the bug and watched as it went flying and plopped down onto her pillow and tumbled down it before laying there, stunned. She laughed. She didn't know why messing with this particular bug was so entertaining to her--but to be as honest, frank, and blunt as possible, she didn't really care why. Her bug was fun, that was all she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...dance or butt torment? Which sounds better...?\" she said to herself thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n .........................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as you sit up, shake your head to clear it, then rub your arms to warm them up before you look up as the woman who had taken ownership of you. You'd been stunned, but you had clearly heard what she had said. Needless to say, you didn't like either choice at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You bolt, only to skid to a stop as a wall of vertical flesh drops out of nowhere and you crash into it. \"THAT TICKLES, MY LITTLE BUG!\" booms the woman's voice. \"NOW WAIT THERE WHILE YOUR OWNER GETS READY TO HAVE MORE FUN TIMES WITH YOU!\" she said before...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you laid down on your back, arms and legs spreadeagled and waited. Your heart pounded in your chest, this was your last best hope, whatever she decided to do next you were sure would kill you and you shivered in fear as she rummaged in her closet, a MILF on a powertrip. Finally she finished her searching though and turned back, a pair of pumps dangling from her fingertips, a sultry sway in her step. This was all just a very strange game for her but she was enjoying it all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW MY LITTLE BUG I THINK MAYBE YOU'LL LOOK JUST PERFECT...MMM?\" a pause as her eyes sweep down over you. Your body goes stiff with fear and you lick your lips as she hones in on you with eyeballs as large as you are. You just barely keep from screaming as she crouches down then, her face looming over you, those eyes so close you can almost imagine you see your own reflection in them. Breathlessly she whispers, though to you it's still a booming sound, \"YOU'RE NO BUG...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYES! You'd done it! You've made contact and you smile triumphantly with a rapid waving of your hands to confirm she's gotten it right, even trying to squeak back to her, \"Miss, Miss please I need your help!\" though she still cannot hear you. Her head rears back, a thoughtful frown on her face...which then turns up into a wicked grin like no other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH THIS GAME JUST BECAME SO MUCH MORE FUN. I'D WONDERED WHAT CAME OVER ME PLAYING WITH A BUG BUT NOW, MY OWN LITTLE MAN. I'LL NEED TO BE CAREFUL WON'T I?\" she purrs with a half-lidded look down at you that makes your knees quaver. You hadn't considered this, that a woman crazy enough to torture and tease bugs might just do the same to a helpless human being all the same. Being careful was good perhaps, she didn't want to accidentally crush her one and only tiny person, but it certainly didn't sound like she had any intention of stopping play either.</span></div></div>",

You had been canny enough to avoid this girl's feet when you first encountered them - seems like so long ago, now! - and now here you are, even smaller, standing right before them.  At least your diminished size seems to have diminished danger somewhat as well, as you survived the insane drop from Maria's window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut rather than the logistics of that, the more pressing matter of those feet arises.  You stand up on the sandal platform, gazing up the mass of toes, each containing crushing power in excess - relatively! - than the danger you just faced on the dance floor.  The best solution may be to get out of here as quick as possible, climbing down to the ground and away from this whole crazy family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a few steps away from the toes when a voice rumbles above you: \"Hee hee!  A tiny person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you've been spotted, you're as good as dead.  Still, to run further would be to invite pursuit, and a careless child crushing you underfoot.  With a sigh, you stop and look upward, craning your head back as far you can without toppling onto your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet instead of a face hovering above you like a moon, the girl still stands tall, her hands raised before her face.  Of course!  When you fell out of the window, she was in the process of picking something up!  It must be another shrunken man or woman!  This is a piece of luck; while she's distracted, you can get away safely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if she does have a tiny person with her, one that she saw and picked up, then he or she must be bigger than you.  At your present scale you're in more danger than ever, with little chance of being spotted.  If there was someone else - a man or woman a mere inch or so in height - they could act as an interpreter for you, and you'd have some small protection!</span></div></div>",

She was dropped off at school not long ago - and how you now wish you'd stopped there as well! - and her mother hasn't left you alone long enough to have gone and collected her.  Did she come home on her own?  How did she change her clothes so fast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, here you are, shrinking for the third time in as many days and the thing you find weird is this girl being somewhere she shouldn't be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you punch away your doubts, and return to thinking logically.

If she does start walking, you're not convinced you'd be able to hold on as you did with Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not if you were climbing.  You could always just huddle here, clinging to the large craters gouged into the surface of the flip-flop and stay secure until you're absolutely certain it's safe to move.

So much for that hope!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEHE, LITTLE BUG...I CAN ALREADY TELL YOU'RE GONNA BE REALLY FUN TO PLAY WITH!

You fall earthward, expecting to hit the floor followed with a grim death. However, you land on something plush and soft. You look around and see a seemingly endless field of white material.

You remember that from what her mother said earlier, that Shelly must have enjoyed playing with bugs, but you didn't know whether they were dangerous games or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, what were you kidding?! At your size, they'd ALL be dangerous! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolt, only to skid to a stop as a wall of vertical flesh drops out of nowhere and you crash into it. \"THAT TICKLES, LITTLE BUG!\" Shelly boomed above you, she stares at you scrambling around on the covers of the bed, letting you run a bit before blocking you off with her hands, making you crash into them before you turn and run another way, only for the same thing to keep repeating as she keeps cutting you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LITTLE BUGS LIKE YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME LAUGH!\" As such, she lets out a mild laugh. She sat down on the bed, making you move to avoid being crushed. Her enormous stature lying down ahead of you makes her look like a mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD ON WHILE I THINK OF A GAME, BUG.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she's thinking, you're doing the same. How could you try and communicate with her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you figure out how to answer to that problem, a boom like thunder makes you clamp your hands to your ears as Shelly snapped her fingers before snatching you up with her index and thumb and dangles you in front of her face, a wide grin on and her eyes gleaming with no cruelty at all, just playful excitement...not that you were in any position to appreciate the difference!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW!

The idea had seemed great before; but now, you wanted to AVOID the dog more than you did her human owners!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Saint Bernard doesn't pay you any mind as she opts to head for her water dish instead,  laying down and lapping from it noisy. You back away from the dog, wishing Shelly or her mom was here to rescue you if things went downhill with the beast. Still...if you were going to get away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap! No choice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you close your eyes tight and rush towards the canine, hoping she doesn't move, and end up colliding with Ciri's flank, getting buried as you sink into her thick coat; going so deep you feel her hide under her fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Ciri pause in her drinking, apparently having felt you. Please don't scratch...! You may have been the size of a bug, but you weren't a flea! You open your eyes and look as best you can and see Ciri's head swing into view, obviously trying to see what you were. The whole thing brought about a sickening sense of Deja vu from earlier with Shelly's mother and the broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark caves of the wet black nose closes in to fill your vision. The nostrils let loose sudden inrush of air - robbing your lungs of breath - Ciri takes note of you, inhaling your scent. As you gasp, you recall about a dog's sense of smell; possessing up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to about six million in humans. And the part of a dog's brain devoted to analyzing smells is, proportionally speaking, forty times greater than a human's, as well as how dogs' noses also function quite differently than a person's. When humans inhale, they smell and breathe through the same airways within their nose. When dogs inhale, a fold of tissue just inside their nostril helps to separate these two functions when airflow enters the nose it splits into two different flow paths, one for olfaction and one for respiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the nose pulls away, Ciri must have recognized you as the \"bug\" Shelly had introduced her to moments ago. The dog stands and you're pulled up with her, tangled in her thick hair. Then the walking starts, a feeling like an odd mix of an earthquake and a ships at sea rocking. The massive beast pads through the home, each massive leg slowly bringing it forward inexorably. Where was she heading? For your own sake, you hope Ciri isn't paper-trained! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Ciri stops and you smell fresh air again. This is it! A chance to make your get-away! You struggle against Ciri's fur and drop to the grass. The impact hurt you a bit, but you laugh, glad to be outside again and away from giants for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your elation wore off...</span></div></div>",

She continues to smile blissfully upon you for a few seconds before unpinching her digits holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment's fall, then an impact upon a warm, solid surface.  You stand, a quick look identifying your platform as the back of Shelly's wrist, the girl's face above still a constant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stable footing begins to tilt, and you scramble for higher ground as Shelly's arm moves, even rotating.  You scramble over minor bumps and imperfections, kicking aside tiny sprouting hairs in your quest to avoid falling.  Things seem to flatten out and cease moving as you enter a vast plain, creased by tiny, river-like canyons at your feet, the only way onward the trunks of five mighty plateaus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly looks down at you in the palm of her hand, and then closes a fist around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's total darkness, the thudding of Shelly's pulse the only sound as you thrash and struggle, unable to overcome the simple strength of a seven-year-old's fingers.  At last comes resignation to your fate, before the heaven's open and Shelly's face is haloed by light again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a moment to stand before her finger rolls in from the side, buffeting you onto your stomach and prodding your back painfully for a few seconds.  Eventually it relents, and your owner speaks.  \"WELL, NO WINGS THERE, SO NO CHANCE OF YOU FLYING OUT OF THE MAZE,\" Shelly concludes.  \"AND YOUR DIRECTION-FINDING ABILITIES AND CURIOSITY SEEM TO BE TOP-NOTCH.  LOOKS LIKE MOTHER ACTUALLY BROUGHT ME SOMETHING USEFUL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not nice to be referred to as a 'thing'!  You stand again, looking defiantly up at the girl once more, but flinching as she raises a finger again.  This time though, she's only raising it to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHH!  SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN I CALL HER MOTHER!  IT'S MOM ALL THE WAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly giggles, and then begins walking, her hand a surprisingly stable place for you to sit and ponder your fate.  Running a maze like some lab rat?  How humiliating!  But if you can impress with your human mind, perhaps people may start to think you're more than just an insect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand smashes down on a tabletop, and it seems you're expected to exit.  You do so, looking around constantly for an avenue of escape, all too aware that Shelly is watching from on-high and able to see very move you make.  So instead you marvel at the heaps of rubble scattered across the landscape, and watch as Shelly effortlessly lifts a seemingly-shapeless piece of weighty material along with a bottle of presumed glue.  She chatters as she works, and the dull roaring is very distracting.  You're still free to stroll around what little space you have, checking out the drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it's quite the drop.  Sheely's feet don't even reach the ground from where she sits, her powerful legs swinging too and fro as she works!  There's no way out by heading downward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there are plenty of offcuts of paper and detritus scattered around.  Shelly may snatch them up at any point, but if she were distracted for a moment, you could find a piece to act as a parachute, maybe..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slams open, and Shelly's mother enters in all her gigantic majesty.  \"HOW'S THE WORK GOING?\" she asks, striding forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow's your chance!  As Shelly rises - her imposing form impossibly dwarfed by her god-like mother - to talk and hug, you can get to the junk pile and look for salvation!  \"OH, HE'S GREAT, MOM!\" Shelly says, as you toss aside useless lump after useless lump, none aerodynamic or light enough to prove useful.  \"CURIOUS AND RESOURCEFUL, HE'LL BE GREAT AT SCHOOL TOMORROW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right, that's right, keep talking, you think, allow me to find a way out of here...  \"OF COURSE, HE'S NOT CLEVER ENOUGH TO REALISE THAT I CAN TALK TO YOU AND KEEP AN EYE ON HIM AT THE SAME TIME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up for a moment before finger and thumb once again constrict around you, wrenching you into the air between their irresistible forces.  You soar up past Shelly - a smile and a wink from her - to dangle before the face of her mother, a gigantic grin upon her face.  \"WELL, HE SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING HIMSELF,\" she laughs, clearly enjoying the torment her daughter is absently inflicting.  She clicks a pair of scissors in her own hand.  \"ANYWAY, HERE ARE THOSE CUTTINGS YOU WANTED.  HAVE FUN, YOU TWO!  DINNER'S IN FIVE MINUTES.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly lowers you to her side, takes the extra scrap from her mother and skips back to work.  There seems no hope at all of escape now, and you sit and grump.  When the five minutes is up - as indicated by the bellow of the mother from downstairs - Shelly neatly places you back into your cup prison and scampers off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no hope of salvation here, not even a fly comes inquisitively buzzing at you.  Shelly returns in time, gleefully adding a piece of lettuce to your cup for you to feast on.  It's tough and flavourless, but there is nutrition there as you get to work.  The large leaf conceals Shelly from view as she works, and all track of time is lost as she gets on and you struggle to chew.  Eventually, with a \"GOOD NIGHT!\" she turns off the light and presumably settles to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first thought, to use the lettuce to climb out, proves impossible.  As you've eaten at its bottom edge, so the top have dropped progressively lower, and now sits nowhere near the glass's lip.  Looks like it's going to be a cold night, awaiting the fate this girl has planned for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it appears you oversleep, as the first hint that Shelly is up and about is when you are sliding from your prison, poured from the glass into a plastic jar with a lid that snaps closed above you!  It's walls are mistier than the glass, and you can make out only vague shapes of the world as Shelly slips you into a pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it's all tumble this way, tumble that, and waiting - the interminable waiting! - for the main event.  You still have no idea how this maze is going to look - Shelly was very clear that you shouldn't get a sneak peak! - or what form of audience you'll be playing to.  nerves don't begin to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally comes showtime!  The tub is dragged forth, the lid popped with a terrifying application of force, and you tipped out onto the front desk of a classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are giant children assembled before you, the match and more of Shelly in sheer bulk and intimidation.  Ahead of them, grace and beauty in the body of a towering giant...  A female teacher, young and smiling at the curiosity before her.  Here's someone that can take you away from all this!  You just have to impress upon her that you're not an insect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how?  Completing the maze would impress her with your brains, but enough to show what you truly are?  You could run at her right now, but that's just going to look like a bug running around wild!  But you've got to do something, or remain with Shelly and her mother the rest of your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the while, your body receives the full beating of the two fleshy planets around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied, Amber takes a sip of her drink and resumes her conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruised and shaken, you have the urge to vomit, but being as compressed as you are, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. Your organs are still doing award-winning gymnastic feats even though your body has come to a halt. Imprisoned within two titanic mounds of flesh, you fear what you may see if you open your eyes\u2026 that is, if you see anything at all. Upon opening your eyes, Amber\u2019s mammoth wrinkled anus greets with a slight dilation. Realizing you are about to be engulfed by a fellow student\u2019s asshole, you promptly scream and squirm recklessly. The frictionless skin of her ass crack presents no means of slowing your procession down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, feeling the minute movements within her, instinctively tries to repress them by tightening her ass cheeks together; as a result, you slide closer and closer to her puckered anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gurgling of her rectum grows louder with each passing second. Nearly in shock, you establish the fact that you have almost no control over your circumstances. Only the oblivious giantess chatting away with her friend can save you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill she take the pressure off you?</span></div></div>",

Sure, it'll be a tough climb, but it'll be worth it to be free from this sweaty, smelly prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo: you could go down (in a different way than usual, obviously!).

You look down to see the dark hole yawning slightly, then resisting the pressure from your foot and closing up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sinister gurgle within Keisha begins warbling darkly, and more loudly, for a moment.

Her large green eyes stare directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be quite confused at your condition, and I can only apologise that I did not get here sooner.\" she says.  \"But I'm here now, so we can see our way to cleaning up this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will you respond?</span></div></div>",

But if you play your cards right, perhaps you can avoid any battlefields by flirting with this officer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, your flirting repertoire would call for you to make a bold move and stroke her shoulder; however, you'd need Mr. Fantastic's stretchable limbs to reach her arm from your position on the table. Instead, your eyes fall to her hands, folded in front of you.  It's the only part of her body you can reach at your size without doing something reckless like jumping in her lap. Her slender fingers are bereft of wedding ring, a positive sign. You approach her right index finger and place your hands upon the unpainted fingernail. The military goddess above you blushes at your boldness, but says nothing. It looks like you'll have to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what's a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this? I mean, I'd hate to see your beautiful face get scarred in some horrible battle. But if you'll lend an ear' I have an idea that we may find to be mutually agreeable.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what nonsense you're spouting, but it seems to be working.  Her plush lips form into a grin, and she leans forward a little more. 'I'm listening,' she says breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's go into the private espionage business. With your intelligence, and my size, we can topple dictators across the globe without firing a shot! We'll have governments banging down our door, begging for our services! You'll be the most feared, most powerful, and most beautiful woman on the planet!' you babble, leaning forward against her fingernail. You can feel the heat radiating from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it sounds good, anyway. Perhaps if you can convince her to leave the military, you can escape from her without worrying about the might of the military being brought to bear to track you down. However, you're too busy daydreaming about being a tiny shadow ruler of the world to notice the giantess's sudden change of heart. She leaps from her chair, the gust of wind strong enough to knock you on your butt. In one quick motion, she unholsters her pistol, thumbs off the safety and cocks the hammer back. Hovering under her glaring countenance is the barrel of her pistol, pointed right at you, as deep and dark as a train tunnel. You can almost see the bullet at the end of the barrel, poised to turn you into a smoking hole on the table. The index finger you were previously stroking now curls around the trigger, as tense as a viper ready to strike. You're frozen in fear, under her withering gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you really think I would leave the service of the country I love to be a mercenary?' she shouts, zeal filling her face. Her glasses only focus the glare of her green eyes, each boring holes in you as large as the bullets in her gun. Perhaps you misjudged her, and she'd rather get rid of you than suffer such indignity. Or perhaps she's simply in the throes of passion, her own imagination working overdrive at how much personal power she could gain under your plan.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps the best way to serve my country is to oppose it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe the biggest sigh of relief you have ever managed (proportionally speaking, anyway) as the gun moves aside, the woman re-holstering it at her hip.  She looks back down at you, a sad smile playing across her huge face.  \"Who's to say there aren't more like you out there, working for foreign powers hostile to our interests?  No, we have to stop them.  Come with me, and we'll hunt down all those enemy agents, the people that made you this way, and perhaps someone that can restore you.

This could be the beginning of a beautiful partnership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk toward the hand, and destiny.</span></div></div>",

Earlier today, we tested an experimental remote miniaturization device on a random target to record its effects on would be threats to world peace. You, apparently, were that random target. I apologize for the inconvenience, but like I said, the target was randomized by the program in the miniaturization device, so we couldn't know who'd be hit. We were, however, able to detect your location by following a specific wave frequency that the device's use let off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens to me now?\" you asked. She responded, \"I'll take you to HQ. For security reasons, I'll need to keep you out of sight until we're there. Once we're at HQ, we'll ask you a few questions and make sure you're in good health. Then we'll reverse the miniaturization process and you'll be free to go.

You want to scream and rejoice - it's a miricle! You are going to be big again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you notice that you're not growing anymore. You only grew a little, now standing at just about six inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze suddenly. There is something on your legs - pulling backwards. You look down and see a wire as thick as your lower arm on your shins, pulling from behind. You turn around - and scream. A girl has spotted you - the wire was in one of her hands. She suddenly gives a sharp pull from it  on the back of your knees - causing you to fall onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to scream hystericly as her hand comes for you. She quickly wraps her free hand around you and for one moment you are lifted into the air - the next you find yourself in her purse, watching the giant girl's hand zip it up behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zipper is left partially open - but much too small for you to escape by - and as you try futilely to pull the zipper back, you slip and fall. You fall onto something hard and round. You look closely and see its a huge tube of lip stick. You look around the purse and see different varieties of make-up. But you see something else. You walk over to it. It is plastic - could it be a mere sandwich bag? It is. But it has something inside of it. What could it be? After pressing on it, you discover it is soft, whatever it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly loud, deafening sounds emerge. You hold your ears. But then the purse begins to rock - and you find yourself holding on for dear life as the purse begins to swing around, then come abruptly to a stop, then begin to swing back and forth. You try to stand, but regret it as you're thrown into something hard and then find yourself choking on powder. You can't see, and you can't stop coughing. You realize you fell against her powder compact, and that it burst open somehow. You try to get up again, only to succeed in tipping over her powder compact and getting it all over her purse. You begin coughing again, there is powder everywhere. And after a few minutes of the powder settling down for the most part, and you look around seeing her dark purse now covered in a white-ish peach colored powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the purse rocks to a suddenly halt, and you find yourself stuck between the tube of lip stick and something else you cant quite identify. Light suddenly bursts in and you look up. You see her large face. But is she mad because of her purse, or giddy because of how you look?<br>\r\nShe says...</span></div></div>",

How did such a little boy make such big of a mess?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to try to push the makeup containers off of you as you see her giant hand coming toward you. You, with your last bit of strength push the lip stick off of you and stand up and run. But of course you get about a half of a step before you slip on the powder and fall face first back down. You feel two giant fingers grab your right foot and hoist you up into the air - screaming all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you just the cutest thing!\" she sqeals as she hold you up to her face. You can see from your high view that you are in this girl's bedroom. Pink, frilly cushions are everywhere. You scream hystericly as she turns and begins to walk into another room. You see it is a bathroom. She reaches under you and turns on the water and after checking the temperature, closes the drain. After just a couple of minutes you notice you are getting kind of dizzy and light-headed after being held upside down for so long. But you don't have to worry about that anymore as you notice she is getting ready to dunk you under the water. You scream - but too late and water makes its way into your mouth and you begin to spit and cough under the water. Suddenly the giant girl lets go of your foot, and you go completly under the water. You begin to panic as you realize that you cannot surface for air - becasue the water faucet is still on, the water is sitting in the sink going around in a circle, holding you under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just when you don't think you can hold you breath any longer, the water is turned off and you swim quickly to the surface. Getting there you notice that the water is at the very rim of the sink, so you swim to the edge and try holding onto it so you may rest and catch your breath. <br>\r\nYou glare up at the giant girl who is watching you with a warm smile. You turn you head the other way, rest it on the edge of the sink and close your eyes for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel her huge fingers wrap around you, and you are dunked yet again - but being held under by the girl. While you are under you feel her hands rubbing feverishly all over you to get the powder off. Suddenly she lets go of you and you swim on your own once again to the edge - gasping for breath. You watch as she walks to the other end of the bathroom and comes back with a huge bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" you think to yourself, \"She wouldn't do that - would she?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tips the bottle of shampoo and reaches for you. You despirately try to climb out of the sink-but you can't, it's just too hard. Her huge hand grabes you and flips you over in her hand and suddenly you feel a huge glob of shampoo in your hair and on your head. She begans to lather it up and scrub you with one hand while the other one holds your arms and legs down. It hurts badly, she's scrubbing much too hard. Immediatly it stops - and then your sore head began working again as you suddenly began to pray she wasn't going to try to use conditioner on you too.<br>\r\nThank God she doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she does pull you out of the water and lay you down onto the counter. You lay there limply and close your eyes. No bath should leave a person so sore or so weak. After a few moments you notice that the giant girl isn't in the room anymore. You really should be trying to run away now - but you can't, you're just so weak. But it's too late now anyway. You hear her footsteps. The footsteps stop, suddenly a loud startled gasp is heard and then almost immediatly you feel a giant finger poke you on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you okay?\" asks the girl. Without waiting for an answer she flips you over and stares into your blinking eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, I thought you were dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might as well be.\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches forward and lifts you up, you don't even bother  trying to get away.

But then again she really wasn't sure what you were. She didn't feel your tiny struggles between her fingers. So, she wasn't even convinced that you were a living thing. She actually assumed that you were some trinket that hit her ankle. So, she decided to just hand you over to one of the invigilators to put you in a lost and found place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she moves forward, you aren't sure about where she is taking you. But you can feel the pressure of her thumb and fore finger on both sides of your tiny body and you don't like it. So, you attempt some struggles that go ignored by the woman who is holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you quickly find out where you are going. As the blond woman hands her test to a female invigilator who has long natural red hair and looks to be middle aged.

In which the middle aged invigilator replies to her with a nod and then reaches out her hand to take the item which is you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in an instant you go from having your entire tiny body being pinched between two fingers, into the waiting hands of the invigilator. You just sit there in the woman's hand as you watch the blond woman leave the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invigilator who is now holding you in her palm, looks down at you. She isn't to sure of what you are and is pretty sure if you are some trinket that someone lost. There would be no way that person would come for something as small as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't really sure what to do here. And before you can think that this is your chance to move and get her to notice that you are not an object. The invigilator's gigantic fore-finger and thumb descend on you and pinch you up. And you are now back in the position that you were in before, except with a different giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to ascend you up, so to bring you closer to her gigantic eye. You know that you need to let her know that you are not some object.

And you then begin to slightly lower your guard and struggles as you think that she realized that you are a living thing and not some trinket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though she has realized that you are a living thing. That does not mean you are completely safe. And sadly you realize that fact to late as an immense amount of pressure begins to happen. With her fore-finger and thumb using little of her strength begin to push in on you at both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even know what is happening in till you hear \"Yuckk... Ewww... I can't believe that student would put an icky bug in my hands.\". And those are the last words you hear before you drift into unconsciousness and your whole body goes numb as her fingers easily crush your tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invigilator then looks up before doing anything else and sees the students and other invigilators looking at her. But that only lasts for a second before they just go back to doing the test and/or watching the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invigilator who has just crushed you, gets slightly red with embarrassment as she tries to forget the scene she just made. And she begins to flick some bits of you off her finger to join the other insignificant pieces of dust and things that will end up being pass around the ground and peoples shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only though seems be able to flick off a few bits of you as the rest of your tiny form sort of sticky. So, she wipes the rest of you onto her jean skirt that she is wearing. She then goes back to watching the other students. Not caring or even thinking about the life that she just took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for you it would be great if your pain and suffering ended there. But it seems your tale does not end there as you actually did still have some life left in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hours have passed before you regain consciousness with the loud sound of a car door being slammed shut. It's night time, and you are in an intense amount of pain and have zero movement in any part of your body. You have no idea how your even still alive. But it seems that whatever parts of your body that can keep you going were still functioning for now. And you try not to think about how that is even possible as you have now realized that all you are now is a tiny speck of a stain on a woman's jean skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman enters her home and the first person to greet her at her front door is a man that you assume is her husband. She of course confirms this to you as she goes in for a hug and kiss. You are sandwiched between the both of them in an intense amount of pain. Again not sure how you survived that one. But you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a couple hours pass by as your only entertainment is listening to the couple talk and go on about the normal day. The pain continues through this time and you wonder if this is your life forever. But it ends up not lasting forever though. As the time for the two giants to go to sleep comes. The woman makes her way over to her turned on washing machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you are then given your very last sight. When she removes her jean skirt and lifts her skirt up to put into the washer. You see the  middle aged woman's face which expressionless  and her half way naked body which maybe to old for you to enjoy. As she then drops her skirt into the washer. You are drowned and basically murdered by a woman who never even knew you even existed.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end.</span></div></div>",

You dreamed about yourself, shrunk, in school, and giant clones... but it was all over n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize you're not on a bed. You're on a rough soft, fleshy, almost leathery surface you've fantasized about all too much. You groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">You awake?</font>\" A voice bellows out. A voice which you recognize all too well. You open your eyes to see familiar flesh-tones with ridges on them being the main thing which makes the ground. There's also a shadow over you- you can guess who. You pull yourself to your hands and knees, then try to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're quickly forced to sit again. A large amount of rocking makes holding a stance all but impossible. It's just as well- you had a feeling you knew where you were now, but the next sight would have knocked you on your ass anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in front of your eyes, is your face. Your face, with your hair, your acne, your bad shave job, over your chest with the same shirt you're currently wearing. The same face you recognize from so much standing in front of so many mirrors is now looking back at you. Only this time, the face is magnified to the size of a house. And it's not mimicking your motions any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Wow.</font>\" The surreality of the moment floods into your mind like a dam bursting. You're actually there. Sitting in someone's hand. Sitting in YOUR OWN HAND.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" You agree with yourself, meekly. What else can you say? 'Wow' pretty much covered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, you two are silent as you stare at each other. The bobbing of the hand's motion vaguely tells your brain in the back of your mind that you're being taken somewhere... or rather your going somewhere... the brain goes back to silent awe. Your giant doppelganger speaks again first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you actually-\" You cover your ears to show that your double is speaking too loud. \"Sorry.\" He responds, at a much more acceptable volume. \"So are you actually me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond, just barely out of your stupor enough to talk. \"I think so. I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Jacob Andrews. I prefer Jake.\"<br>\r\n\"...Alright, where were you born?\"<br>\r\n\"Little Rock, Arkansas?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you do in your free time?\"<br>\r\n\"I read giantess interactives online.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis silence tells you that all three of those characteristics are shared between the two of you. The pacing continues again in silence. You look behind you, and through the giant's fingers, you recognize the path 'you' are taking as the one back to your room. \"So, um-\"<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">What?</font> ...Sorry, what?\"<br>\r\n\"Any idea as to what caused this?

This woman, while still over seventy metres tall when she's sitting, is scarier from her sheer mass.  Her lap rises above you, a mountain itself without even taking into account the torso that lies at its summit.  As you get closer, she dominates the horizon; you can't see past her, or even encompass the whole of her legs in your line of vision.  Yet you're still some distance off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the rumble of thunder and look up, praying that it's not going to start to rain.  But no, the sun still beams down, the sky is still blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thunder is the talk of those two giantesses!  Their heads being so far above you, it's not so loud, and you can't even make out individual words.  You imagine trying to converse with one of them yourself; you'd be deafened in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, having fought through the jungle of grass, you reach the outskirts of, well, her skirt.  It hangs loose here, her knee lying a few feet away, but it's sturdy enough to take your weight and you begin to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe denim is coarse, and provides plenty of foot- and hand-holds.  In a relatively short space of time you are already atop her knee.  And out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs slope a lot less, and it might even be an almost pleasant stroll to her midriff, assuming that she doesn't try standing up or anything.  From there, who knows?  The near vertical surface of her stomach, covered by the pink tee that she wears, would be difficult<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as you're psyching yourself up for this challenge, you notice the large lump sitting some distance ahead of you, roughly near the middle of this denim expanse.  Straining your eyes, you realise that the woman has some sort of pocket sewn onto the front of her skirt.  You could try sheltering in there for a while, and try to contact her later, instead of killing yourself from over-exertion.</span></div></div>",

You rush forward to sink your teeth into the substance, but it's far too brittle for someone of your size to chew.  The giantess laughs, and with a simple movement spreads a glob of strawberry jam larger than you at your feet.  The seeds are inedible, but the goo is finally something that your diminished digestive system can process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her own part, she casually lifts the house-sized toast to her mouth and tears away large chunks of it with each bite, teeth working away to utterly demolish it.  The crunching is terrifying, industrial in scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles between mouthfuls, but is too busy chewing to start conversation.  Perhaps you should begin?</span></div></div>",

Soon the horizon becomes a distant memory as you close.  A glance to the right shows that she is still occupied with her daisy chain, and so you make a dash for her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass here is all flattened, as if the giantess had rolled over at some point in the past.  That should be warning enough, as it presents a 'killing ground' very much like that around a medieval castle.  Yet your lucky stars must be in alignment, as there is no crushing death from that direction just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thump into the black fabric of her trousers, but find it a lot harder than you anticipated, falling onto your back at the impact.  Seems that being smaller makes things seem more than just bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that means that the space between fibes is that much greater as well, and you hoist yourself up.  It's a necessity as the nearest pocket to you is actually beneath the giantess, and climbing into that would be an act of contortionism...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle up the cliff-face, but are grateful that no movement from the woman tumbles you to your death.  Soon you are atop her, and telling yourself not to look down at the drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pocket at her hip lies before you, larger than a parking garage, but it does look a bit tight.  Who knows how much room you'd have when she started walking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA better bet might be to wander down her leg to the pockets at her knees.  There you'd be a lot safer, but they carry two other risks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, she may get up before you reach them, and then you'd fall.  the hip pocket is right here, but it must be several dozen feet to the knee, and that over uneven (creased) terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, there's not much chance that you'll get noticed.

That's it \u2013 she seems to be done.<br>\r\nLosing no time, you give yourself a sharp push and manage to lift your body a bit more, tucking your feet right in the space where the nail meets the skin.

However, your current hold provides shelter from those small hurricanes, and you breath a sigh of relief - realising your plan worked alot better than you expected.<br>\r\nThe hand finally reaches it's position in between the two gigantic women, as the brunette gestures the blonde during her conversation. The blonde laughs as the brunette continues to elaborate \u2013 using both hands and all five fingers to make all kinds of gestures to seem to add a lot to tale, as the blonde seems entranced in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, do whatever you can to keep your stomach from turning, sometimes shutting your eyes and hoping to god she would ease down a bit. Sure, the position you took kept you safe and secure even in times like these, but your couldn't help but catching glimpses of the ground below, of the girls' feet and wiggling toes and their gigantic faces staring in each others directions. They don't even seem to notice you at the slightest - and you begin to fear this nightmare would never end.<br>\r\nBut then, the brunette finally stops. With all five fingers outstretched, and a wide smile on her face, she's waiting for the blonde's response. You see this as an opportunity that would never return \u2013 and open your mouth to scream at the blonde's direction...<br>\r\nBut it is already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand starts moving towards her again, fingers loosening down a bit. You start to smile, figuring that any minute now, she would reach for her face in some way, bringing you one step closer to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose dreams are short lived, however, as the hand suddenly takes a sharp turn, plummeting to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold on for dear life, as your head stops spinning and your eyes adjust to your new position, but before you could even have the chance to do anything else, you turn around, and come face to face with...</span></div></div>",

But your not sure if a stranger would help you out here. So, you think that it's best to try and find someone else to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and see a few people in the distance. They all seem to be hanging out in an area that you assume is the concrete area outside the cafeteria. So, you venture your way towards the direction of the people in the distance. And with you being so tiny, it takes you a good hour to make it over there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb your way up onto the concrete area. Your so tiny that when you begin to look around you notice all the small cracks that to a normal person would be nothing more then a crack but to you each crack in the concrete is like a gigantic cavern that if your not careful, you could end up falling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped that just one person in this area would be someone that you knew. And as you looked around you were starting to lose hope as you just saw gigantic figures of people who you didn't know. All them had no idea who you were and they never noticed your tiny presence there. It almost got to a point for you that you were going to just pick a random stranger in till you saw someone that you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance on one of the outside dinning tables, you saw your friend Nicole eating food while playing on her phone. Nicole is someone who use to work with you at your part time job. She has long brunette hair and has a chubby mom body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered that she left your work because she started dating your best friend Luke and now she is a pre-school teacher. She's here at the school studying to get her teaching degree and you couldn't believe that you actually have seen someone that you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you wasted no time in making your way over to the table that she is at. And once your there, your almost completely out of breath. You take a second and lean against something rubbery to catch your breath. While breathing in and out you smell something off. You turn your attention towards the bad smell and realized that you were leaning against Nicole's gigantic black sandal. And that smell was her feet, that probably didn't smell that bad to a normal person, but to you it was definitely amplified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to think about that though as you just stared up at your now gigantic friend Nicole. She had no idea that you are tiny and in front of her feet as she minds her own business and plays on her phone. You knew that it was going to be tough to get her attention, and so you scanned your surrounding for someway to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd looking around you knew you had to wait for a better chance to get her attention. So, you saw two options to stow away and wait to try to get Nicole's attention. You could either take a ride on her sandal or seeing her gigantic purse slumped over on the ground you thought that could also be a place to hide in for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the problem with the purse is that it was a good distance away from you and you got really panicked when you heard some loud ruffling of things above you. And looking up you realized that the ruffling is Nicole who seems to be putting her trash on her meal tray which indicated to you that she is getting ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant you had to think fast and decide on what your going to do here.</font></span></div></div>",

And that's when you realized that you had no time to reach the purse. But the sandal is still within reach of you. So, with extreme effort you went up to the gigantic sandal and extended your tiny arm up as far as you could with your eyes glued on the top, your tiny arm started to reach its limit, but your able to grab onto the top part of the black sandal. And with an intense amount of strength you pull yourself up onto the top of her sandal and being as stealth as you could, you started to crawl over to the plastic piece between Nicole's toes and hold on to it for dear life as Nicole just casually got up and grab her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost at losing your grip of the plastic with each step that Nicole took. And with you being very panicked, that also made it really hard for you to keep your hold. But you were somehow able to keep your grip so that became the least of your worries. As you had other things to worry about. You could hear the sound of Nicole's footsteps slap of the sandal hitting the ground each time as Nicole stepped down onto the concrete. And top of the noise the smell of being in-between Nicole's toes is just awful to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Nicole was just casually walking towards her destination. She had no clue that you were tiny and enduring her giant feet. All she is concerned about is getting to where she needs to go which in this case was her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a 10 minute walk Nicole makes it to her car and climbs inside of it. She then shuts her car door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the sound of the engine turn on, and your grip tighten as you felt her giant car slowly moving in reverse as it hit a bump in the parking lot, you end up losing your grip and go airborne for a moment as you land on her car's carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole put's it in drive as head's down the street. You didn't know where she was going and didn't really care to much either as you stared up at her giantess legs that led down her feet that are in the black sandal's while she pushes the gas pedal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide since you have a bit of time you could look at your surroundings and you notice that her drive side carpeting has piece's of dirt, crumbs, and loose hair. which were all bigger then you. But made you think that she doesn't really keep her car all that clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you let that thought go as you think that now you have to decide if you should try to get her attention now or wait for a better opportunity.</font></span></div></div>",

So, you manage to find a way to climb up to her center console. And to your luck she rests her gigantic arm right on it. So, you think that climbing up her arm to the top of her shoulder would be a good enough spot to make your presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich you end up doing and once you make it to her shoulder you see out her windshield that she is in a parking garage. You know the place and remember that this is the parking garage for her apartment. So, as she parks her car you quickly need to think of a way to grab her attention. So, you yell up to her ear that is a few feet above you \"Nicole! I'm tiny and on your shoulder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns her head around as she still is holding onto the steering wheel and says in confusion \"Huh?... what the?\" as she makes sure to instantly put her car in park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is a bit surprised to see you tiny and on her shoulder. Which causes her jerks back a bit and since you are a tiny little thing this motion causes you to fall off her shoulder but luckily you end up just landing in her lap. She is so surprised and at first thinks you were a bug and that thing you said was her imagination. But before she tried to swipe you off her, she looked a bit closer and saw that it was you. She is now in a bit more shock for a moment as she just stares at you on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then after a good minute of you two looking at one another you hear \"Oh my god... I cannot believe this.... How did this happen?\" She asked in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really know how to answer her so you just say the first thing that comes to mind \"I was taking an exam and I got shrunk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she was in a bit of shock, she slowly moved her gigantic hand to touch you and when you see her hand you see that her finger alone is much bigger then your height. She then proceeds to move her finger up and down your tiny body a bit as she sits in shock that you are here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How....Where.... When....Who did this...\" She starts to say as she fumbles trying to find answers in her head \"Are you okay?...\" She then asks you in a bit more concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really don't know how to answer this so you revert back to the answer that you think she want to hear \"I'm fine... I guess...I'm just so little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least you're not in pain... \", she starts to calm down a bit as her other hand moves towards you and she askes \"Here can I pick you up?...\". Which she doesn't even wait for you to answer and instead snatches you up into her gigantic grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks you over and still can't believe that you're real. I mean just a second ago Nicole was getting ready to park her car and head up to her apartment. But now she has you in the palm of her hand. And as she stares down at you in her palm she can't help to think that you are so tiny and cute in her giant hands as she looks at you with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand while all this was happening were surprised that she didn't wait for you to tell her it was okay to pick you up. But you decide that given this situation that you should probably just let that go. And so, you just stand there in her palm and look up at her, waiting for her to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut She then finally says to you \"Come on, I'm ready to head up to my apartment. I don't really want to sit in this car anymore.\". She again doesn't wait for you to say or give any kind of acknowledgement. But instead she just swings your tiny body into her gigantic pocket. And with you in her pocket she grabs her things and heads up to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as she walks down the narrow hallways of her apartment building. You having nowhere else to go, just settle in for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually reaches her apartment and with you in her pocket. She goes inside and puts down her stuff. And then she places you down on her kitchen counter. You can see that she is now almost fully reclined against the kitchen counter as she just stares off into nothing. You don't really know what to do at this point. And so with her staring off into space, you just look around Nicole's gigantic apartment from the top of her kitchen counter. You haven't really gotten much of a chance to just take in your size till now and seeing her familiar apartment that you knew when you were normal sized is a strange sight to see when you're so tiny. I mean the kitchen counter alone you can actually see specks of crumbs that are as big as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Nicole?\" you start to say and she immediately snaps out of her stupor. \"Hm?\" she says with a smile on her face, still reclined against the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any ideas on what we should do about me being tiny?\" You say nervously as you are now thinking about how you just want to be normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.... I'm sorry I need to eat something. How about I make us something to eat.\" She says this ignoring what you just said. She then walks away from the kitchen counter and opens her fridge to look inside. You just give her confused look while she searches her fridge and then think that you are hungry as well so you just watch as she prepares something for both of you to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour or two has passed now and both of yall have eaten and are now watching TV in Nicole's living room. During that time Nicole couldn't help her self while watching you eat. She kept poking you with her giant finger and playing around with you. Each time she stopped to let you eat you would hear her say \"Sorry it's that you look so cute being that tiny.\". She would then giggle and then repeat the process. And since she is so gigantic, your tiny protests that you did to try to stop her were pointless. So, you just tried to ignore her and finish eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole must have thought that you didn't mind all this cuddling and touching as she did this. But thankfully it ended when both of you finished eating and her attention is now focused in on the TV. Your now positioned on her giant lap as when you finished eating Nicole just picked you up and put you on her lap. Again you were given no real choice in the situation and just decided to get comfortable by sitting down and leaning against her flabby stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good 10 or 20 minutes pass by, and it's at this point you think that it would be a good time to discuss your current position. So, you say \"Um... Nicole?\". In which upon hearing Nicole instantly smiles and looks down at you to say \"Hmm?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look up at her and say \"Uh... well we should probably try to think of a way for me to get back to normal size.\". To which she...</font></span></div></div>",

She finishes saying this while still looking down at you with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze when you hear her say this since you didn't expect that response. And at first you think about what she just said, but then think that of course you want to get big again. So, you say \"No! It's not like that at all! I want to become back to my normal height again. I hate being this small. Now come on stop joking around and let's think about a way to get me back to normal size!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing you say this, Nicole still gave you a confused look but this time dropped her smile and said \"But I'm not joking, wouldn't you like to be tiny forever?\". You get angry and say \"NO! Why the hell would I want to be tiny forever, that sounds like hell!\". At this point you're angry enough to start kicking so you tell her again to stop joking around and to start thinking of a way get you back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole watches you as you get angry with how she is treating this conversation. She does her best to try to listen to everything that you're saying but she can't help but find this whole thing adorable as she giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a bit frustrated hearing her giggle, which she notices and ends up being the first to talk as she says \"Oh how cute!... Ummm... I 'm sorry I didn't mean to say that. But you do look cute.... while being so tiny and throwing a fit.\". Nicole pauses for a moment as she nervously thinks through what she just said and then quickly continues talking by saying \"Uhhh..... just forget I said that. I... uhhh... listen you're tiny now and I know it must be tough being so small but none of us here are super genius. And it would be almost impossible for us to figure out how to regrow you. It's not like you hear about people shrinking all the time. So, maybe it could just wear off eventually and you will just grow back to normal. And in the meantime you could just try and enjoy life of being so tiny. And.... you can live here with me and... I'll make sure to keep you safe\" . Nicole stops talking after saying that and then nervously looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about the first couple of things she said that were off and sort of made you more frustrated. But then thinking about what she just said and that she has a point that none of this is really common knowledge. I mean you would probably have a hard time figuring something out as well if the positions were reversed. And even though you hate the idea of staying this tiny for any longer, you think that maybe she could be right and there's a chance that it could just wear off. So, you calm yourself as you look up at Nicole and say \"Okay fine for now we could just wait this out...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles and says \"Great idea\". She then goes back to watching her TV. And you just lay down on her lap and watch the TV as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it comes time for you guys to go to bed. In which you then watched Nicole turned off her TV and picked you up into her grasp. She continued walking in till she made it to her bedroom. Once there she placed you down on her bed and without even thinking of you being there she went over to her dresser and changed into her pajamas. Since she is your best friend's girlfriend and you thought maybe she is just too tired to think right now about you being in the room. You just turn away from her as she changes clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished she strolled back over to her bed and smiled down at you as she said \"So, where would you like to sleep?\".</font></span></div></div>",

And with that she is unknowingly cuddling you with her gigantic arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly wake up and see nothing but her arm skin. Luckily the softness of the pillow behind you is preventing you from being crushed. But the pressure and weight of her arm was still something to endure. And top of that you were way too tiny to wake her or move her arm. You settle down and endure it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't encounter anything else for a few more hours and you were actually able to fall back asleep till later on that night. You were awaken when Nicole's arm unknowingly took you with it, as Nicole was turning in her sleep, which moved her arm towards her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then held there unknowingly by her as she slept. You were inches away from her chest trapped under her gigantic arm. You could feel her warm breath and also smell it. The feeling you got being there made it impossible for you to fall back asleep.

She says \"Ohhh......what are you doing there?\" in a sleepy yet annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her a little annoyed and tried to respond but instead Nicole just switched her tone to a smile and said \"Awww you know you really do look adorable trying to stumble through saying something.

So, you clutch down tightly on the shoe lace and continue your painful ride. In till the man finally enters the English department and walks into a teacher's office where you roll off of his shoe onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there dazed for a few minutes in till you finally begin feeling a little better. Which your then able to take in the area of where your at as you hear the giant invigilator talk to the other person in the room. The invigilator says \"Here you go professor, sorry it took so long.

You pass by loose hairs, dust piles, and other nasty floor items. It's about a good minute before you finally make it to her desk. You stop for a second to catch your breath from all the walking and running you did to get over to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you see Mrs. Crittenden as she continues grading exams. She has no idea that you're there at all. And now you figure that you need to find a way to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a moment of thought you realize that the best way to get her attention would be to find way to get up onto her desk. So, you look around the area of the desk and see little notch's in the metal and wooden parts that lead all the way up to the top of her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince its a bit of a climb you are going to have to use your hands as well as your feet and body weight to get yourself up there. And As you start to pull yourself up you wince in pain at just how much climbing you actually have to do. But you don't let that lazy thought get to you as you stagger through the climb. In till you finally make it up to the top of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Crittenden is just lost in her own little world as she is going through each exam question and grading them. This gives you time to think about how you should handle this. And once you think that have come up with a good approach to her, you hear from behind you \"Hey, how's the grading going?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around you see a tall man who you assume is another English professor at this school. He leans against the doorway as he waits for Mrs. Crittenden to answer. In which you hear her say \"Ugh, it's going... there's just so much here\". The man then responds by saying \"Oh I know what you mean exam week is the worst. But hey me and a few others are going to grab some food from the cafeteria. You wanna come?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes Mrs. Crittenden spring up from her chair as she says with a smile on her face \"Absolutely I need a break from all this\". You then watch as she and the man walk out of the office. Leaving you alone in Mrs. Crittenden's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really know what to do now. And seeing that she probably won't come back for a while you decide to take a pause to look around some more from the top of the desk. As you look around you realize the office is filled with books. You also notice some small windows high up that let in just enough sunlight to keep the room from being too dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around some more, you see in front of you the giant paper exam's. There has to be a good amount of them spread across the desk and some on the floor. And as you approach the exams you begin to think about how basically didn't even take your exam and probably don't have a believable excuse if you ever get big again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about that you turn your attention towards Mrs. Crittenden's computer. You can see that she either forgot or didn't care that she left the exam grading site up on her computer. Looking at the screen you see the list of names followed by I.D numbers and other info that leads to there final grade. And you stop as you see your name which is just after the person's name who just got graded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then have a dark thought of entering your own grade. Thinking that she probably won't remember that she didn't enter your grade in yet. And I mean it is a little unfair that this shrinking thing happen to you and you weren't able to actually do the exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis leads you to convincing yourself that entering your own grade into the system is just a fair thing to do. So, you then rush over to the mouse, But you realize quickly that this is going to be a tough task for you. As the mouse is decently heavy to you now and your just barley able to move it. But you manage to go back and forth between the keyboard and mouse to get it into the right area for where you can enter your grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while doing this you try to ignore the outside sounds of shoe's and heel's hitting the floor. Thinking that Mrs. Crittenden should be gone for a good hour. And none of those sounds should be of people heading to enter this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally get the mouse clicked on the area to enter your grade. And as you tiredly make your way over to the keyboard. Climbing on top of it. You hear a heel hitting the tile right outside of Mrs. Crittenden's office.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Who is by the office's doorway?)</span></div></div>",

Well better get them done\" She says this and then walks casually  over to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so close to just getting your grade in as a believable C +. And you quickly rush to each key, leaving the enter button for last. You are able to hit the enter button right in time, but then fear comes into you as you hear \"What the heck?\". And you slowly turn around to see Mrs. Crittenden with her long brunette hair, skinny middle aged Asian body, and a look of confusion directed right at you as she tries to figure out what you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walks up to you and puts one of her hands on her hip and then reaches her other hand out to quickly scoop you up into her grasp. She holds you up to her face as she is curious to what you are<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? It looks like some kind of tiny man\" She says as she continues looking you over. You were trying your best to act like some doll but as her finger came close to you to poke, you flinched. Which she then instantly backs her finger away as she realizes you're real. And while still looking at you she says \"Who are you? And how are you so small?\". Which you didn't know how to answer her and your silence led her to look at her computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn which she see's your name followed by a message that came up to say \"Are you sure you want this grade entered\". This turns her curious and confused look to one of anger as she begins to jump to conclusion's. She looks back and you in her grasp to say \"So, that's who you are. You are one of my students. And you decided to somehow shrink yourself to put in your own grade?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After hearing that you didn't know how to answer and so you try to tell her the real truth by saying \"No, I didn't shrink myself to change my grade. I don't even know how I got shrunk\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head as she clearly doesn't believe you and believes that you somehow shrunk yourself to cheat. She then decides to quickly re-word her statement by responding and saying \"But did you try to put in your own grade?\". Which you say nervously \"Well yes but that has nothing...\". Mrs. Crittenden quickly cuts you off by putting her massive pointer finger over your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then speaks to you in a demanding tone \"No, I don't think so. I can't believe someone would go through all this for a grade on an exam. I mean do you see how small you are. One miss step and you would be like an ant squished under my heel. Do you have anything to say for yourself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was clearly a rhetorical question as she wouldn't let you speak since she held her finger over your mouth. All you did get out were a few mumbles that made her do a cocky laugh. As she continued talking to you by saying \"Hmm... I guess either you don't have anything to say or your just to tiny for me to hear. So, I believe this kind of behavior can not go unpunished. But clearly one of those academic punishment's would be to easy, I mean getting you kicked out of school would do nothing for your future and could lead you to do worse things with your life. No, I think if you don't want to study and do collage right then clearly someone should just pick a job for you. I mean really you don't need all that studying and hard work to get a job. I can instead provide you with a perfect one, you don't have to be a collage student anymore, instead you will be my pet.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to object but she is much stronger then you and can easily keep her finger over your mouth which prevents you from speaking. Plus even if you could escape her grip, you would take too much time to get away from her so you just struggle there and mumble. And after she watches you do that for a good minute she giggles and says \"I am sure all that movement and mumbling is you being excited for your new life. Now I have a few more things to do so you can wait inside my purse for me to finish.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said she puts you into her designer purse and zips the top of it all the way up. Which trapped you in darkness. As she went on to finished grading the rest of the exams.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

So, you spent your second half hour trying to get her to let you out. But sadly being in the purse and you being so tiny. Made it to where Mrs. Crittenden could not hear you at all. So, you ended up just falling asleep for the rest of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with about halfway finished with her work she says out loud \"Well that seems like enough work for today. I think I can just finish the rest of the grading tomorrow\". She then finishes up closing the grading program and logging off the computer and then turns it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she picks up her purse and flings it over her shoulder. She then opens the door of her office and strolls out of the building heading to the parking lot towards her car. And with that she is excited to get home and have you ready to serve her as she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaking of the purse woke you up right away and you spent her walk and the car ride to her house juggling around the inside of that purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mrs. Crittenden enters her driveway and exits her car. You hear the sounds of her hitting the lock button on her cars remote as she heads inside her house. She drops her purse with you inside of it on her kitchen counter as she goes to pours her self a a glass of wine. While she does that, you think about what you will do next. And you come up with a plan that once she let's you out of the purse, you will bolt in a random direction and hope for the best. And so, you ready yourself for this genius plan of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you began to lose your balance a bit as Mrs. Crittenden finishes half her glass of wine while carrying the purse to her living room. Once there she sets everything down on her living room table and then sits down on her couch as she bends over and unzips her purse. You hear the sound of the zipper being undone and then instantly ready yourself once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking forward you saw it at half way open and then you bolted forward. Not realizing that you are on a table that to a normal sized person is only about 2 to 3 feet high. But to you its like falling off a an extremely high cliff. As you run out of the purse and continue forward. You are quickly in a state of plummeting towards the carpet that is below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Crittenden was a little bit caught off guard by you suddenly bolting out of her person. But luckily for you her reaction time was good as you left her purse and only were on the table for half a second before you ran off of it and began your fall. Mrs. Crittenden's soft hand landed right below you before you hit the carpet. Her fingers then wrapped around your tiny body as she brought you up to her face. As you were lifted up you heard her laughing. You were a bit confused to why she was just laughing since you originally thought that she would be angry about an escape attempt. But your confusion ended as she held you in her grasp and began to spoke to you through slight giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you think that went?\" She goes into a big smile as she continues talking to you \"You know I have to say that I was already expecting some kind of escape attempt from you. But I didn't expect you to just try to bolt at the first opportunity you got. I mean come on you had hours to think of some kind of plan to escape and your best one was to just run out of my purse. Did you even have any idea of what would you do after you got out of the purse? I guess not, since you almost just killed yourself.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel so humiliated as you are stuck in her grasp while listening to her basically making fun of you. And then you feel even more humiliated as she takes her free hand and pet's the top of your head lightly while saying with a smile \"I guess you're lucky that you're so cute and are going to make for an adorable pet\".</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

In till she gave a big smile to you and said in a jolly tone \"You know I don't think I have told you yet what your new job description is as my pet. So, I feel the need to enlighten you since it seems that you won't ever be able to escape.\". She giggles at that last sentence before continues by saying \" As my pet your new job is very simple all you need to concern yourself with is entertaining me and making sure I am in my best mood possible.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her sentence she gives you a small squeeze and then places you on the table. Even though being careful with your light body, she still drops you slightly hard on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But unlike other pets that live in homes and have there master serve them, you will be serving me and making sure I am happy.\" She adds while still smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to comment on how that's a very unfair job and your not going to be her plaything, but all she does is just give a little squeal at how cute you are when you try to argue with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my sweet pet, you will see that this is the best thing that can happen to you.\" By now she gets up from the couch while still holding you in her single hand and then she continues on with a walk around her house, with you struggling in her massive grip the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of struggling she stops in place as she enters her own bedroom and holds you back up to her face once more. She then says with a smile \"Now we should probably talk about where you will be sleeping. Since clearly I can't have you sleeping in the same bed as me. I need a place where you will stay for the whole night. And I think I have the perfect spot.\". She says this while walking over to her bed and then placing you on her bed side table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you were placed down you scanned the area for a way down but you found none and the bedside table was much taller then the living room table. So, you just look over at her as you watch her begin to take off the wedges that she is wearing on her feet. Which once she gets both of them off she holds one of them in her hands and says \"Oh my god my feet feel so much better to be out of those darn wedges.\" After saying that she lifts the wedge that she is still holding and smells. Which she then quickly retracts her hand as she holds her nose with her free hand to say \"Yuck! That is one smelly shoe. Or should I say the place where you are going to be sleeping tonight.\" She smiles looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare at her a little confused about what she just said in till you see her free hand let go of her nose and reach out to snatch you up into her grasp. Then she gently brings you over to hover your body over her wedge. The smell of feet and sweat is coming out and to your tiny forum it's a lot worse. And after about thirty seconds of silence and hovering over the wedge she drops you inside the wedge. In which you immediately try to get out of to avoid the smell. But you find that you are to tiny to get out of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly look upwards to see her face as she holds the shoe and looks at you in it. You can't help but to try to argue with her but before you can get out more then a squeak she begins to say with a smile on her face \"Sorry that my shoe reeks so bad. but I guess I worked harder then I thought today.\". She finished saying that with a smile and then continues by saying \"Well I have a big day tomorrow and I don't want to smell this wedge any more. So, you just enjoy your new home and I'm heading to sleep. Good night!\". After that statement she placed the wedge that you are trapped in on her bedside table. As she went to change into her pajama's and get ready to go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was asleep, you had to just endure the awful smell. You were hoping that this would be your best opportunity for escape. But as you had a look around you didn't find any way out.

It would be crazy for her to go to work today given that it's the weekend. So, you are left to wait and wonder if you should attempt to escape this wedge again or just wait her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the wedge, you have already tried to climb out on multiple occasions. But you found that the walls of the wedge with being very tall to you are also to slick and slippery with her sweat that made climbing impossible. So, you are forced to wait out her sleep. And even though the smell diminished slightly, it wasn't completely gone which meant you also had to wait there while continuing to endure the disgusting odor left behind by her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feels like an eternity, you heard a loud yawn followed by a thud, then footsteps that lead to some doors opening noises and you now know that she has to be awake. The waiting is the worst part, being unable to do anything except wait. Sure you can sit and you could probably go for hours without moving around. But sitting still all day was definitely not something you wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her footsteps as she leave the room, and they sound pretty far away. Another 20 minutes goes before you hear footsteps reenter the room you're in and you finally hear Mrs. Crittenden's voice say \"Hello pet, it is time for you to wake up to begin your first day of being a my pet.\". She went on speaking and you were noticing that her voice was getting louder as she got closer to her wedge. In till you looked up to see Mrs. Crittenden's smiling face staring down at you in her wedge as she said \"Well did you enjoy your sleep last night?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even want to answer her, since your sleep in her smelly shoe wasn't pleasant in the slightest. Then in the moment of silence, you watch as a giggle begins to forum from her. Which just adds to your frustration of this situation. And makes you attempt to argue with her saying how sleeping in her shoe isn't pleasant and that she should just let you be free, but all that did was give you the same response that you got last time you argued with her. All she does is just give a little squeal at how cute you are when you try to be all demanding with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then continues by plucking you out of her shoe with two of her fingers and places you on her palm as she uses her finger to gently tickle you. You do your best to stop her but it's no use. As her one finger is bigger and stronger then you are. And you are forced to endure her having fun with you as you have to listen to the annoying tone of her voice over and over say \"Tickle tickle tickle..... you're so cute.\".  Your pleas fall on deaf ears as she continues for what seems like forever but is only like a minute more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich she does eventually stop and gives you a smile while saying \"Well that was very fun. You see you're already doing good at your job as my pet. Making sure my life is happy. But now that silliness is done. How about we get something to eat for breakfast. I don't want my little pet here dying of hunger.\". She says that last part in a cute tone to humiliate you some more as then carries you with her as she walks to her kitchen, with you struggling in her massive grip the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reaches the kitchen with you in her hand. She sets you done on her kitchen counter and says in a humiliating tone \"Now don't get any ideas of running little guy.\". Which you just stare back at her hating every minute that you have to be here with her as you feel so helpless. And you watch her grab some things to make breakfast with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know by now that she wouldn't put you in a spot where you could easily escape. So, you just decide to obey for now. As she prepares and then finishes making eggs and toast. You then see her hand come at you as she pick you up with one hand and she turn towards her living room. She is carrying you and the breakfast. And she enters her living room she sets you on the table and says \"Here we are!\". You watch her then pick up the TV remote from the table that you are on and turn on the TV to some morning news channel to see what's going on in the world today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then takes out some napkins that she had as she cuts off bits of her eggs and toast. Then she places them on the napkin while placing it in front of you she says \"Here you go! Eat up\". She then turns her attention back to the TV. And as she watches she begins munching down on her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the meal that she just gave, you see the eggs and toast. You think about how to her this food is just a bunch of crumbs, but to you its an actual entre. And so, you just dive into to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 or so minutes pass by as the two of you finish eating and you watch as Mrs. Crittenden turn her attention back towards you as she begins to tell you about what is happening today.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What is going to happen today?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"> She looks at you and smiles while saying \"So, last week I don't know if you were paying attention. But I told my students which you were one at the time. That if they had any questions. They are free to come over to my house to ask their questions.\". Hearing that you sort of remember her saying that a week ago. But you might have been in a daze at the time. So, you just look up at her and respond with \"Yea... I remember so, where will I be at during all this?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich your just given a dumbfounded look by Mrs. Crittenden as she says \"Well out here with me and the student who's here to ask the question. I mean I can't trust you alone. And clearly you could learn a thing or 2. Even though it doesn't matter now since you're just my cute little pet.\" After saying that last part she smiles while gently petting on your head and then goes to drink her coffee while watching the rest of the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would of been frustrated with the humiliating comments that she was saying. But you were to distracted by the idea of one of your peers or even worse someone you know seeing you like this. All you kept hoping was that the rest of your class either didn't hear her or won't show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half went by and you actually thought that maybe no one would show up as Mrs. Crittenden had now cleared all dishes in the sink and you two were now in her home office. Where looking around you see a big desk with her computer and other things on it, also a second table with some chairs, and a white board with expos near it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched from her desk where she placed you on top of. As she prepared some teaching supplies on the table with chairs near it. The whole time you kept thinking that no one was going to show up at her house to ask her questions. But it seems that you are fresh out of luck as you jump when you here the loud sound of the door bell ring. And Mrs. Crittenden says \"Coming!\" And then in a softer tone she turns to you and says \"Now you stay there and be good.\". She then left you in her home office as she went to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she left your sight you instantly thought that you need to get out of here. And looking at your surroundings you see a jumble mess of different school supplies that appear to be no help. Then seeing the ground below you think it's way to high to get down in time. So, you decided the next course of action would be to try to hide somewhere on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought this as you heard Mrs. Crittenden voice as she was talking to the student that she was with saying \"Oh yea I can show you how to that problem. Here let's just head over to my office.\". There foot steps got closer as you scrambled around the giant desk to find a hiding spot. And you ended up settling on hiding under a big pile of papers on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were hidden right in time as Mrs. Crittenden walks into her home office with her student. They were talking and you could not hear their conversation, but you could see their figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Mrs. Crittenden and her student who is a female with long brunette hair. But you stop concentrating on that as Mrs. Crittenden turns toward her desk and just so happen to pick up the pile of paper that you were hiding under. She gave you a quick disappointed look that instantly transformed into a smile as she said to her student \"Oh! yea I have the assignment that you were talking about right here. Also kind a funny but my little pet seems to have just been found.\" Which you hear the student reply with saying \"Oh that's good, is there any chance that I could hold him?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you could hear the the voice you instantly recognize who the female student is. She is the girl you had a crush on in your class. Her name is Amanda. And she already knows that you are the pet. Since Mrs. Crittenden told the false story that she believes is true where you shrunk yourself to cheat and because of that you are her pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear Mrs. Crittenden say \"Of course you can hold him. Play with him how ever you want to while we go over this problem.\". Which Mrs. Crittenden then reaches for you a grabs you into her grasp. She then reaches over and places you into Amanda's soft hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looks down at you in her palm, you're not sure if you should get upset or just stay quiet. But then in a moment of being courageous you think you should confront Amanda about this and make sure she knows the truth. And the first thing you say as you look up at her \"Please Amanda, I need help.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It really is you, wow your so small.\" She says this while completely ignoring what you just said as she turns your tiny body around in her hand to observe you. \"I couldn't even image how small your private area must be.\" And with that last comment she begins to giggle a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand don't find that statement at all funny and begin to feel embarrassed on how this situation is playing out. And at the same time you also feel a little angry that she is ignoring what you said earlier. Amanda seems to not even notice your embarrassment or your frustration as she continues looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich you just had enough and shout again \"Amanda stop that already I'm not a pet. I need your help to get me out of here.\". At first You don't know if Amanda was even listening to you since she didn't stop and kept playing with you in her palm. But then she finally says in a sort of commanding tone \"No no no you are a pet. Mrs. Crittenden told me everything. And I can't believe you went through all this for a grade.\". Which this makes you want to argue that you didn't shrink yourself and that it happened mysteriously. But Amanda wouldn't even let you speak as she continued talking to you by saying \"Well I guess if you don't want to do the work then you get what you deserve. And in this case you should be grateful that you ended up in the hands of the wonderful Mrs. Crittenden.\". Hearing that actually frustrates you even more, since being with Mrs. Crittenden has actually sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your still not able to get anything out as Amanda keeps talking and says \"Then there's another thing, one my friends told me you had a crush on me. And to think I was actually starting to like you back. But after seeing you so tiny I will definitely pass. I mean you're cute now but not in a I want to have sex with you kind of way. More like you're cute in the way that a hamster is cute.\". This time you are finally able to speak up and interrupt her by saying \"Amanda!\" but she doesn't seem to care or even hear you as she goes on with her little speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well I guess you won't be having sex with much of anything.\". She finishes with a slight laugh. You feel very humiliated and embarrassed in this situation and Amanda doesn't seem to care or want to listen to your arguments. \"You know though I got to say...\" Amanda says this and then continues with in a motherese tone as she says \"...you are just so cute and adorable being that tiny. I mean I love being able to hold you with one hand. Heck you might be small enough for me to hold on my finger.\". That comment made her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sends you over the edge and you finally feel like you want to jump at her and attack her with your bare hands, but how exactly are you going to accomplish that? You are 1 inch tall right now. It seems like if you even tried this, she would just flick you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you sit there and get angrier as Amanda continues to look at you without a care in the world. Amanda then continues speaking \"You know, now I am a bit curious about something.\". Amanda says this and then without even asking for your permission she restrained the top half of your tiny body with only her thumb. As her finger stroked against your private area. Your face goes red as Amanda giggles while saying \"Oh my god, it really is tiny just like you. I mean its smaller then a thumb tack. You would have no chance satisfying a person as big as me. Heck a Barbie doll would be unsatisfied with you.\". Amanda then laughs  and stroking your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so disgusted and upset in this situation that you just want to get out of here, as you struggle to get out of her grip. But you are much to pathetic and tiny to get out of Amanda's hand. She isn't squeezing nearly as much with you in her hand but it doesn't feel like she is holding you so much as she is restraining you. You can still wiggle around a bit and struggle a little but Amanda has complete control over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then turns her attention back to Mrs. Crittenden as they both start reviewing questions that she had. While you just struggle in her playful hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half hour that Amanda stays for. You spent that time being played with by Amanda's thumb, which then led to while Mrs. Crittenden was showing Amanda how to do a problem using her white board. Amanda while listening to her held you up in front of her chest. And It seemed that she made sure to keep you an inch away from it so you wouldn't have a chance to touch her chest. Which sort made her giggle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the half hour session is finally over, so Amanda can leave. She thanked Mrs. Crittenden for helping her and handed you back over to her. And as Mrs. Crittenden went to walk Amanda out, you were placed on her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore walking out the door Amanda turns to Mrs. Crittenden to say \"You know I might be looking forward more now to come over for some more question's.\" She smiles as she walk's out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laid down on the gigantic desk as you felt your whole body aching from being held by Amanda as she played with you and lifted you in the air so much. She was only here for about 40 minutes and you feel that tired. But your glad that whole experience is over and you never want experience something of that level of embarrassment again. You think as you lay on Mrs. Crittenden's desk for her to come back.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

You are a little shocked as you begin to recognize the girl as the smart girl from your class. You know her name is Megan but other then that you don't know much else about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't supposed to be here for another hour.\" Mrs. Crittenden says as she walks in with Megan.<br>\r\n\"I know, but I had some extra time so I thought I would stop by a little early. Hope that isn't to much trouble.\" Megan responds<br>\r\nIn which Mrs. Crittenden turn to her and says \"Oh no it's fine. I am glad to see a student who cares so much.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan then just smiles as she reply's \"Well thank you, you know though since I am here a little early. Could I see your pet that you were telling me about at the door.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh of you can dear. Here just let me grab him.\" Mrs. Crittenden says this with a smile as she walks over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you know it, you are being handed over to Megan. And As you are placed in Megan's soft hand. You think about the fact that Megan on top of her being the smartest student, she is also the shortest student in your class at 4 feet 11 inches tall. But to your 1 inch tall self, she is a giant just like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Crittenden watches as Megan holds you in her hand. And she thinks about the 10 to 20 minutes she had to wait to get Amanda to focus. So, she decides to say \"You know Megan since your early. I do have some papers to grade. So, how about you take him out to my living room. And I can help you out in 10 or so minutes after I take care of this work. Okay?\". This makes a smile form on Megan's face as she nod's her head yes and walks out to Mrs. Crittenden's living room while holding you in her hand. As she sat on the couch, she opened her palm and began to look down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh you are little.\" Megan says as she looks down at you.<br>\r\n\"Well, umm, yes I know.\" You respond<br>\r\n\"So, Mrs. Crittenden told me the whole story. But I don't really believe it. I mean you are probably too dumb to figure out how to shrink your self.\". She giggles a bit before continuing talking. \"So, tell me how did you end up this tiny?\" She says curiously.<br>\r\nYou don't really know how to take what she just said. But seeing that she is actually willing to hear your side of the story you responded by telling her how you have no idea how you shrunk and then lead your story up to the present moment.<br>\r\n\"Yea that makes a lot more sense.\" She says this to you and then turns you around in hand to observe you. In which you just respond in an annoyed tone \"Hey! Stop that, I'm a person you know. Now that you know my full story. Can you help me grow back to normal size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan just smiles as she still holds you at an awkward angle. You are still a little annoyed but as your held there you smell the perfume that she is wearing and actually recognize it as a sweet smell. You think as she finally responds by saying \"Well I might be able to figure something out to make you grow.\". She says this and then pauses as now begin to smile and get excited as you ignore the fact that she is still holding you at the awkward angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that happiness of yours fades fast as you hear Megan say \"But I don't think I will help you. I mean cheating aside, you are a little dumbass. No pun intended. But you never seem to come off as a good student. As I see it you probably just lucked out here.\". Her expression then suddenly changes to a joyful one as she continues to talk to you \"I mean look at you. You are just absolutely adorable right now. Heck if I found you first I might of made you my little test subject or pet as well. Hmmm.. you know that actually gives me an idea.\". You got angry while having to listen to all this and she says that last statement she pauses as she sits you back up in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then say in an angry tone \"Hey what are you doing?..\". But she of course didn't care about your protests as she then feels your entire body up with just her index finger and thumb. She smiles and giggles as she does it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then for the next 10 minutes, you were passed back and forth between her hands. Each time it would be her thumb and fore-finger tightly clenching your shrunken body and then finally letting go to let you \"recover\". She would always make sure to whisper \"say please\" or \"begging so nicely\" in your ear before doing that. Every time she did that, the same argument's would come out of your mouth \"Stop that... I'm not a toy.\". In till you finally wanted it to stop and said said \"Please stop.\" Which made her smile as she actually did stop this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then looked you over in her hand as she says \"You know you are kind a tough. But also you are really are like a cute little hamster. I don't know if you know this but I own a hamster and there is something that I always find cute and fun to do with my hamster. So, I want to try it with you.\". She smiles as she doesn't say another word to you. She then bring the hand that is holding you downward. Fear grew in you as you didn't know what to expect next. In till you looked down and saw where you were heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking down you saw as she used her free hand to open her pocket on her black jean short's. And in less then a second you were placed inside her pocket with only your head sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look down at you in an endearing way, which made you feel humiliated as you hear her say \"Wow you are actually so cute down there in my pocket.\". She giggles before you 2 hear Mrs. Crittenden say \"Okay Megan lets get those questions done now.\". In which Megan smiled as she walked over to Mrs. Crittenden's office with you in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. Lets get to work.\", She says to Mrs. Crittenden as she walks into her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the home office was uneventful. And once there, it seemed to take forever for her to finish with the questions she needed to ask. The whole time you just had to sit there with only your head sticking out of Megan's pocket as they both went through some lessons. You found out very quickly that the pocket was tight enough to restrain you in it, but not tight enough to cause you pain. It felt really awkward for you as you just laid your head against Megan's belt lope that was above you. Also while the lesson went on Megan didn't even acknowledge your presence in her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally after what seemed like forever, they were both done and Megan began getting ready to leave.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Megan's muscular legs move with swiftness as she walks out of Mrs. Crittenden's home.  In her pocket, you feel every fold of the denim, raking mercilessly at your inch-tall form.  \"We'd best get home before she notices you're gone, little guy!\" your captor says.  So she <i>hasn't</i> forgotten you!  That's small comfort as she quickens her pace even more, her pounding steps taking you on a journey through an entire odyssey of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime has ceased to have meaning by the time she slows, and you can take a few breaths, regretfully looking down at the puke you threw up across her shorts - too small for a regular-sized person to see, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see...\" she mutters, more to herself than anyone, but at your size you can't help but overhear her every thunderous utterance.  Then her fingers are upon you, digging you from your place and lifting you out into the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAble to move your arms and legs again, you give each a shake, then gasp as you descend rapidly, Megan bending to drop you to the floor.  A red carpeted floor, and as you raise your eyes you take in outsize furniture like a wardrobe, a beanbag chair, a bed - this can only be her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground quakes, and you turn to see that Megan has risen to her full, four foot eleven height, and is using her toes to pry her feet free from her great, clumping Doc Martens - the boots crash to the ground like collapsing buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer now bare feet step forward, a single pace to bring one on either side of you, the girl herself standing directly above you.  \"Hmm,\" the giantess says absently, \"looks like you're one seventy-fifth regular height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't take any more of this.  You sprint directly forward, seeing the topless doorway of this room open ahead.  It's so far, those few human inches, but you're determined to get there, pumping your body beyond anything you've ever done before.  The carpet fibres hinder you, each thick stalk threatening to trip you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you run, you can't help but think of what you and your peers did to Megan, back in the day.  As she seemed to peak in height, yet her fellows all grew beyond her.  In particular, you think of that time she wore sandals, and everyone - yourself included - mocked her for her tiny feet and toes.  She never wore open-toed shoes again from that day, always encasing them in great, clumping boots to hide her shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose feet certainly aren't worthy of mockery now.  The right one impacts in front of you, cascading a shower of dust up into your face as the heel grinds down with monstrous finality.  With a single step she overtook you, blocking your escape route with the simple presence of a foot bigger than a house, bearing countless tonnes of weight.  You stop running and pant, waiting for her judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" she says again, stooping and reaching for you.  \"Seems that you still move like a regular person, square-cube law be damned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip clamps around you again, lifting you as she rises.  This may be a terrifying experience, but those words do give you hope!  \"Science!\" you shout up at her.  \"You're doing science stuff!  You are going to try to find a way to restore me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you,\" she says calming, bringing you directly before her gargantuan face, \"I will not just 'try' to discover what shrunk you, I will succeed.  But I'm not doing it to restore you!  I want more tiny people.  Imagine, little old me having a whole collection of people as pets!  The things I'd be able to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that wide smile takes on a creepy aspect as she drags you closer, held powerless between her finger and thumb.  \"For one, I'll have replacements in case one of them breaks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that last word, she makes the tiniest squeeze with her finger and thumb.  Tiny, to her, anyway.  For your part, you can feel your ribs beginning to crack under the pressure, your organs pinching tight within you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for a moment.  She flashes another smile before dropping you onto a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then, I'm going to have to treat you gently,\" she says, as she manoeuvres herself into her chair.  While she does so, you get a better look around the room, seeing a desk on the other side of the room covered with test tubes, beakers, a microscope and other scientific tools.  The table you sit on is reserved for books, a lamp, and a quivering cage whose weird rustling noises mean it can only be the home of that hamster Megan said she owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she - the owner of you yourself, now - leans closer over you, and you flinch back at so massive a creature moving so fast.  Now both of her hands descend upon you, pinching carefully at your shirt, your trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you shout, but there's nothing you can do to stop the giantess tearing your clothes from you, leaing you utterly nude.  \"What's the big idea?\" you shout up at her, outrage momentarily overcoming your terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" she says, putting the clothes - so miniscule in her grasp - into the palm of her left hand.  The right descends to the table.  \"You think I wanted you naked?  No, I just want your clothes.  Look; whatever process shrunk you, it shrunk your clothes as well, so it's not something that you ingested.  I must be some energy or material that you were exposed to externally.  I need to search for traces of that to see what the process was, and I'm sure you'd much prefer I dissect your clothes than your body, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod nervously, suddenly aware of your nakedness and bringing your hands down to cover your junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if your pathetic manhood would interest me,\" Megan sneers, curling her right pinky finger in mockery.  \"Although you'd probably be rather grateful to have a dick as big as this right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing that finger down to your level, she bats your hands aside and brings up your penis, resting it on the tip of her pinky.  As it sits there, it does truly look puny, atop the etailed ridges of her fingerprint.  Yet, as the blood pumps through that daunting digit, you can feel yourself becoming erect, your own blood following the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Megan laughs.  \"You'll have to do a whole lot better than that to impress me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finger withdraws, yet your dick remains upright of it own volition, the power of this... Mega-Megan breathtaking.  You try to think unsexy thoughts even as you focus on that pinky finger curling again, its tip touching against the underside of her thumb...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning fast, Megan flicks the head of your dick with her metal-hard pinky fingernail.  It's a glancing blow, yet you are still knocked off your feet, blinding pain running from your crotch to every nerve in your body.  Megans' alughter continues to ring in your ears before she speaks again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, keep quiet down there while I make some preliminary investigations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough tears, you see her turn her swivel chair from your table and scooch over to her science desk.  That might distract her for a while, and give you a chance to escape.  Although you are nude, one-inch tall and recovering from a devastating blow to your manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you can see a few avenues of escape.  Light shines down upon you from a window directly above the table, and a claming breeze accompanies it.  You could climb up there, work your way outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, the room door is still wide open.  It's a long way down, but once you hit the ground you could just run straight out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of those options are risky, so long as Megan is present and capable of spotting your movements with a simple glance over her shoulder.  Perhaps, if you were to hide, you could lie low until she left to search for you and then escape in a cunning double-bluff!  Given how hiding under paper didn't work back in the teacher's house, you reckon that a much better idea would be to hide under the shredded bedding of that hamster cage -  the last place she'd look!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...  Maybe not the last.  The best place to hide something is directly beneath the eyes of the person searching!  It's risky, but you could sneak over to Megan, hide on her and let her carry you free of this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, why do you want to escape?  Sure, this woman has beaten and humilated you, but she is your best way out of this situation, with her massive brain working on the problem.  If you let her do her thing, and don't anger her, you may be able to persuade her to restore your size once she cracks the code.</span></div></div>",

But instead She reaches into her pocket and pulls you out. And then she just carelessly places you onto the table. You lay there and watch as Megan doesn't even say another word to you. As she just grabs her things and Mrs. Crittenden walks her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only lay there for a few minutes in till Mrs. Crittenden finally strolls her way back into her home office. She checks to see what time it is. And seeing how late it is, she message's all her students and told them that the meetings were over for today. After messaging them she then turns to you and doesn't say anything to you. Instead she reached and pick you up into her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little confused on where she was taking you in till you were finally placed down on her familiar living room table. You just look up at her and wonder what she was planning as she looked down at you and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to take off her heels as she said \"Well you had an eventful day today. Being held and played with by 2 pretty girls. I bet you enjoyed every second...\" She pauses for a moment and giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that comment made you a little frustrated as nothing part of either situation was pleasant for you, but you decide to just stay silent and listen as she continues talking while she is now removing her nylons \"...Well maybe it wasn't all that fun for you since you weren't really seen as anything more then a pet.... Which leads me to your first assignment as my pet. Like I said before your new job in life is to make sure I am feeling good. And to make me start to feel good. I believe you should give me a foot rub.\". With that said Mrs. Crittenden laid down on her couch and swung her gigantic feet next to you onto her living room table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her for a moment as she smiles at you. And turning your attention towards her feet you smell the aroma emitting from her feet that is just awful. You back up a bit until you were nearly at the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now pet, get back over to my feet. I gave you an order.\" She says this to you in a demanding tone. With that comment she smiled and begins to move her feet and wiggles her big toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her feet for a moment again and you smell them from as far away that you are now. And .there is nothing pleasant about them. You don't want to go anywhere near are her filthy feet that are in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now pet! At the rate you are going, I'll be here forever.\" At this point Mrs. Crittenden begins to snort a bit as if she found your predicament very amusing. But you on the other hand didn't find this to be very funny at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try your best to get out of the position you are in, you find yourself trying to escape. But it doesn't seem to go as planned as you slip on something that is on the table edge. And you are then sent backwards towards her feet. You felt the full might of her sweaty feet slamming on your tiny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut since her feet were so soft the impact felt like nothing. The smell hit you right away though as you slid down her foot. You could hear Mrs. Crittenden laughing loudly at your predicament. \"Ohh, This is priceless! but now your up close with my feet so you can get to work.\" She laughed. You slowly get up as she looked at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now pet, start rubbing my feet.\". She says this to you in a demanding tone. And you realized that your to tiny to do much in this situation and so, you began to rub her foot with your tiny hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you look so cute when you obey me! You are so small...but adorable.\" She says while looking at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you begin to work out the knots in her feet. Your hands were working on her large and sweaty left foot while you were hearing her talk about how cute you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm I do love having a cute little pet like you pet. And I bet your going to love being able to do this kind of stuff for me forever.\" You just tried to ignore your frustration in this situation as you just kept working on her right foot at this point. Your hands were getting sweaty as you kept on rubbing. You look over and see how her whole body is moving with her feet. Her eyes close and she begins to enjoy the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love having my feet rubbed!\" She lets out a content sigh as she enjoys her own ability to relax in the moment. You are at this point wishing you were anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then finally hear her say \"Okay that is enough for today. Let's get to bed.\". And with that she picks you up and grabs some of her things with her free hand and heads to her bed room. Once there she places her stuff down including her heels that she was wearing all day. And she looked at you and said \"Okay time to get into your sleeping spot.\". She then hovered you over her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt so small and helpless in this situation. As she then dropped you into her gigantic heel. You fall onto the soft insole of the heel and hear her say \"Good night!\" She say's as she tuck's herself into her own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that your to tired to care at this point. And with the room being so silent, you just drift off to sleep.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What does tomorrow have in store for you?)</span></div></div>",

Your bit confused since you know that it's Sunday and even professor's have Sunday's off. But your told right way why is dressed as she says \"Hey there little guy.

So, I'm going to need you to be on your best behavior.\". She says this and then smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich you actually smile back as you think that maybe someone part her family could actually help you out of this terrible situation. You then say \"So, when will they be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even get that last word out, she tells you to hold on as her phone rings. She gets her phone and begins talking to whoever is on the other side.

She then goes to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd within a few minutes there is noise from the dinning room as you hear the voices of Mrs. Crittenden talking to her niece Naomi and her sister Alyson. They were laughing and carrying on a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick yourself back up and slowly move to a spot where you manage to climb down the dinning room table.

The incredible amount of G's on your body is almost near fatal. ('ALMOST' is the key word there.) You can't handle the strain any more and pass out.<br>\r\nYou awaken a few hours later in the nice soft palm of someone, but who? You look up and see the beautiful face of your older sister, Ashley. Looking down from right over you, you can just about grab her flowing blonde hair. You really don't want to stand up because her hand is so soft but she AND your other sister, Anna are staring at you. You stand up as Ashley starts to talk. \"Hello there, <i>little</i> brother,\" she says playfully. You really can't think of anything to say, so you just wave at them. \"So,\" Anna starts this time. \"How did you get so tiny?\" Since Ashley has brought you up to face level since they started talking, you could probably say something but you don't, you just shrug because you are scared, awestruck at their beauty from this size, and embarrassed at the situation at hand. \"I know you talk, silly. Now answer the question.\" You shake your head furiously and turn your back on them. One of Anna's fingers hit you in the back and it feels like someone just punched you a lot. \"Oww! That hurt, stupid!\" You scream as you fall over from the pain. \"I know, I meant it to be, and stop being mean or we'll tell mom your being a prick,\" Anna says with a giggle. \"No! You take me to mom! Now!\" You demand, and surprisingly you older sisters, who have always teased you for being a bit shorter than them, follow your orders and take you to your mother. She is siting on the couch talking to your girl friend when Anna gives you to your mom.<br>\r\n\"MOM! Anna hit me, again!\" \"Anna, don't hit him! you could seriously hurt him... or worse,\" you mother says sternly to the twins. She turns you attention back to you. \"Well, I've heard what you've done the past day, and I'm pretty ok with it. But do you really want to stay with your girlfriend or do you want to stay with me or you sisters?\" She lowered her voice to a whisper in the last sentence, but everybody still heard her. You really don't want to choose because every one wants you to pick them.</span></div></div>",

Once you're sure she can see your head you nod heavily. \"Well, no point in letting it go to waste, eh.\" And with that she puts her chocolate bar down on the desk and uses her free hand to sweep up what you've left.

So, when seeing her now you realize that she look's exactly the same from high school which is that she wasn't all to attractive with a clear gut that could be described as a muffin top, short brunette hair, boob's that weren't to big at all, and a sort of cute face. But as for what you remember about her other then her looks, she think's she is the hottest girl in the world,also she was a big time country girl and a complete nerd who had a fair share of boyfriend's that were... let's just say very desperate people. And one of those boyfriends of her's was a really good friend of your's Jason, which is how you two met and even though you never really had a crush on her, but you continued talking with her even after she broke up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her for a moment as she is taking people's order's. And wonder if you should instead just focus on getting the attention of a complete stranger instead. With that thought in mind you suddenly begin smelling the food and get a little hungry.

But the other things, so what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say? Well obviously the answer is no. I mean to be real you know that the thought of being someone's pet if you have to stay this size forever has crossed your mind before but to Sierra there's just no way. Plus you don't want to be a pet, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what do you say or do?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's clear to you that this whole conversation is really going no where and getting help from Sierra will be impossible. So, you make a run for it, and even though you don't know where your heading, you don't really care as long as it's away from Sierra. And looking towards the edge of the coffee table, you can't believe that your actually going to try to jump down from there. But just know that you need to get far away from this giant girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the awhile this is going on, Sierra watches you as you are running across her coffee table, in which she actually thinks looks cute and start's giggling. In till she see's you getting really close to the edge.That's when she get's worried and feel's the need to step in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you are inches away from reaching the edge in till a giant wall of flesh appears in your way and you run head first into it and then get wrapped up in it. Being brought up to Sierra's giant face she tries to act upset with you by saying \"What did you think you were doing? I asked you a question and all you did was run away and almost kill yourself. So, what do you have to say for yourself\". The way Sierra has said this to you make's her sound like an adult talking down to a child. Which has just added to your level of anger of the situation, so you just come out and say \"NO, Okay the answer is no I have NO interest in BEING YOUR PET! Now PUT ME DOWN\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis catches Sierra off guard a bit, she actually figured that you would jump at that kind of opportunity, but then had a thought about what you just said and the way you said it. So, she gave you a smile and said \"Oh I get it, your still frustrated from before when I turned you down. Well listen how about I throw in some bonuses. Like you on top of being my pet can do some services for your goddess, like wash my panties/bra, give me special messages, and other thing's. But only if your a good pet *wink*\". And it is at this point that you realize that Sierra is nut's, but your to frustrated at the way she keep's talking to you to think of a rational thing to say so you just say \"No again NO I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR PET SIERRA. I have no interest or attraction towards you and never did,so now again LET ME GO\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't work the way you think it would. Instead it just confuses Sierra as she is sure that you are just lieing to her. She thinks that of course you like her but since she turned you down, you need to act all tough. She gives a *giggle* and then say's \" Awww you are just to cute, looking all tough and saying all those thing's. I get it your just to nervous to admit that this is what you want. Now don't worry no more, I believe the decision is settled that you will become my pet\". You are just confused and frustrated. And you show this by yelling out to her about how wrong she is but at this point she can only hear squeak's as she has gotten up and held you tightly at hip level in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then make's her way to her room and places you on her bed. Followed with her saying \"Now you stay here, I'll be right back. *she giggles with saying* that's an order by your new master\" and then she stroll's over to her closet. Your not waiting though after hearing that. And you begin to bolt towards the edge of the bed. But to your dismay Sierra was really quick in grabbing what she needed and you were easily scooped up into her hand \"Wow if I didn't know any better, I would assume you really didn't want to be my pet *giggle's*. But I know better, yes I do, yes I do. Now let's get you tucked away into your new home\" This when you see what she went to get it was a hamster  cage that looked well like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.irisusainc.com/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/image/400x400/e9c3970ab036de70892d86c6d221abfe/3/0/301256_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.irisusainc.com/pub/media/cat...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra opened the cage and dropped you in saying \"This use to belong to my old hamster that I had when I was seven. I guess now I feel lucky that I held on to it for this long. So, now you go explore your new home, I have to go take a shower and get ready for bed. Oh and there is a bed for you in the little square home at the top of the slide...\" with that she left the room. You realize quickly that there isn't any good spot's to escape and you just actually feeling tired have decided to just head to sleep. And soon afterward's Sierra follow's. And you just have to wait till morning to see what day 1 of your new life is going to be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What does day 1 have in store?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">You wake up to the sounds of *slamming* and Sierra's voice talking. You weren't really sure if she was trying to talk to you or not so you come out of your little hamster home inside the hamster cage. Looking straight ahead you don't see Sierra. But as you turn your head toward's her massive bed. You see her sitting up right, dressed in a gray top and black jeans. She seem's to be talking on her cell phone as she looks over at you and smile's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear \"Okay girl...., thanks for doing this on such short notice. Your the best friend ever....\". The cell phone conversation goes on in till you hear Sierra say \"....Oh that's fine,..... I'll just leave the key to the house under the door mat. Thanks again for doing doing gtg.\" Sierra hangs up her cell phone and then turns her attention toward's you. She smiles and say's \"Oh I hope my adorable little pet slept well. *in her baby talking voice* Now listen mommy has a trip that she is going on with...*stops the baby voice*.. well granny to you. So, I called a friend to pick you up and look after you for a week. And you don't have to worry, she know's who you are.\" After hearing this you don't know what to say. Your more in shock that she is still keeping this whole pet thing up. You figured or hoped that he would drop this whole thing by the morning. But now she i dumping all this on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you get your chance to say something angry towards her she says \"Well sorry But I don't have much time to talk. My mom will be here any second to pick me up. So,...\" Sierra opens the hamster cage from the top and then gives you a gentle pat that you try to bite but she is to quick for you. She then smiles down at you as she re-locks the hamster cage and then say's \"Well that wasn't very nice. You lucky that you missed and that I have to go. But you better be on your best behavior while your with Samantha.\" She say's as she blow's you a kiss and rushes out of her house, leaving you locked in your cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shocked once again as you hear that name Sam and know exactly who Sierra is talking about. Sam is a total geeky/nerdy looking girl. She is super country, fat, tall at about 6 feet something inches and has an less then average boob size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour not really sure though how she has ever felt about you or even knew you exist, since you never really talk to her. But you do know that you don't want to spend any more time being a pet, let lone being one that has to be pet sat. You need to think of a way to escape this dumb cage. While you have time alone. Looking around you see just like before that there is no physical way for you to get out. So, you sit on your little bed and think. In till you hear loud sound *A door opening and closing*. Followed by Sierra's room door opening and you see Samantha, who looks exactly the way you remember her. And seeing her approach the hamster cage your in, you thought of an idea to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiles down at you. As you stare straight ahead and see nothing but her fat gut being tightly covered by a purple T-shirt. She then say's \"Oh there you are. Wow Sierra wasn't kidding it really is you *insert name*. Wow I wonder ho you got so small and  why you want this life. But oh well...*Sam picks up the hamster cage*. Come on you get to have some fun with me for a week.\" She smiles looking at you in your cage. She gives you no way of saying anything back her as she carelessly moves her hand holding the cage to her side and giving you a bit of an earthquake as she walks out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking Sierra's front door she makes her way toward's her white Pickup truck. That is your typical country person's pickup with the hydraulics and huge tire's. She very easily climbs up in her car and set's your cage down on the passenger seat. She even locks your cage in with a seat belt as she begins to start the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shaking finally down and Sam sitting in one place while making her way to a main road. You think back to your idea of escape. It's something you really don't want to do but your desperate enough to try anything at this point. You think as you remember your idea of asking out Sam. Basically your thought is that if you can flirt it up a bit with Sam or even given her appearance just flat out ask her out. She would say yes in a heart beat and then you can go from pet to best friends boyfriend. Which wold lead to you getting out of this dumb cage and then sneaking away one night. The plan was perfect, you think anyway.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(But you jut wonder hen the best tie is to start your little plan?)</span></div></div>",

Looking up to her, you see her in own world while just focusing on the road. You can't help to think how much of a challenge this maybe based on the fact that you are basically an ant to her. But you need to get some kind of conversation started. So, you say with a yell \"Umm... Hey Sam,... so...What have you been up to since High School?\" Sam actually hears you and say's with a smile \"Well well you finally decided to talk I see. Well I have been working on my families farm. What about you, I'm kind curious to why your Sierra's pet?\" You say something that Sam can't hear and as she comes to a red light she interrupt's you with \"Hold that thought I really can't hear you down there.\" She opes your cage and grab's you tightly. You can tell that she probably doesn't ever handle hamsters as her grip is squeezing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer palms are actually kinda sweaty and your only in her grip for a second as your dropped onto her shoulder. Sam then say's \"Okay hold on little guy tight to me. This will make it easier for you to talk.\" You try to get a good footing and then your hit with a wave of a smell that you can tell she didn't shower before coming to get you. Getting  good footing while leaning against Sam's giant face you hear \"Awe you know you really are adorable at that size. So, tell what's with the tiny pet thing?\". You reply with \"Well the tiny part I can't really explain. I sort of shrunk randomly in class while taking my exam. There's not much more I can say about that. And to make a long story/journey short.... (You try to think of  way to word this without insulting Sam's best friend).... I sort of ended up with Sierra and she thought it would be easier if I was a pet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam didn't really get much of the story from Sierra and she was just told that you were her pet. So she found your story to be believable enough as she say's \"Oh that makes sense. You are small and cute enough to be considered a pet. So, I guess it sort of suck's though that it wasn't your choice. But I'm sure you don't mind that much with being able to be forever close to pretty girls like me and Sierra *she giggles*.\" You do your best to hold in any comment's about how you don't ant anything to due with being a pet. And you instead take the opportunity to say \"Well....*Ugh*... I guess I don't mind getting a chance to be very close to someone as pretty as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment caught Sam a bit off guard, which causes her to swerve a bit on the road and you to slip off her shoulder and into her shirt. \"Oh no my bad...\" You slip between her boob's and since she was sweating a bit you slipped through and came out into her seat, with her front part of her jeans being in front of you. You are then back into darkness as you hear \"Oh my bad little guy. But I guess for you it wasn't all bad you little perv *she giggles to make it clear that she is joking*.\" Sam then drops you back on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then giggles and says \"That little sweet comment you said sort of caught me off guard.\" You are a bit coated in her sweat and you can't stand the smell of her un-showered hair. But you swallow all pride and anger you have to say \"Yea your fine *fake laugh*. But it's..... true.... though.... I.... really think your incredibly beautiful...\" you say fast, followed by saying \"...And...It would be cool if you would....*You continue with saying quickly as you could*.... go on a date with me?\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What's Sam's reaction?)</span></div></div>",

But this time as you slide inside her T-shirt. Your leg get's caught into Sam's bra as she freak's out cause you have fallen once again. Sam know's that she has to put her attention back on the road. And she look's back up as he continue's driving forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see that your leg is really in tangled in Sam's bra and she can feel you sort of as she say's \"Well it seem's you got to second base a lot faster then most boy's *giggles*. Listen I don't think I can get you out in till I get home in like 10-15 minutes. So, seeing that were in an awkward situation here I think it's best if we hold on the conversation, in till I can get you out. So, I guess your getting a lucky day today *giggles*.\" She then just puts her full attention towards the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while you hang cradled next to her boob's. You can actually feel it getting hotter and understand why she is sweating under her shirt. You don't know if it's because your not all that into Sam or if it's your size or even some other reason you can't think of. But you really don't understand the joy in your current situation.  The smell is just awful and it's the only real thing you can think of as a Girl's boob is literally right next to you and even though there less then average for a regular sized guy. To you they have to be the size of a small house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tries not to think of you probably perving in her shirt. She really just needs to forget about you for a little while, she think's as she focuses on other thought's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt take's about 15 minutes for Sam to finally make it home. And once she has made it home, it has seemed she has forgotten about you. While you have fallen asleep and woke up to a ringing noise the car is making as the car door open's. Sam turn's her head as she is getting out of her truck and look's over at her passenger seat to see the hamster cage. She then instantly remember's your existence and frantically put's her hand's into her breast's and roughly get's you out of your predicament with ease. It's at this moment you realize just how much stronger Sam is to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hold's you up in her and look's at you. She smiles and then follows it up with a poutey face\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f saying \"You better not of been to much of a perv in there.\" She then pauses and eventually gives you a giggle. In which you who are to tired to care about but don't want to have to wait for another time to reinstate your question. You say \"Well did you...um... think about what I said and.... come up with an... answer?\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What does Sam say back to you?)</span></div></div>",

But I don't think my <span class=\"clred\">boyfriend</span> would appreciate you saying thing's like that to me. So,....I think you now get the idea.... But hey let's just reset and forget all that cause you can still spend time with me. And I can see you might need some alone time so I will put you in your cage and go get some work done. We can just play later.\" Sam say's this to you and feel's to awkward to even listen to your reply so she drops you in the hamster cage and locks it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are once again put through n earthquake as Sam carelessly takes you into her home and tosses the cage on her bedside table. And then she exit's her room without saying much to you. Looking around you see horse poster's and random bedroom furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe she has a boyfriend. And to think you don't even have a relationship at all. That thought clouds your mind for a second and then you also think.

Also at this point you are just crazy desperate to make a plan work. But seeing him you think maybe you could compete. You've accidentally stolen other dude's girl's in your past. So you think what if you just make yourself seem like the better option and once she \"eventually\" chooses. You go with your original plan and dip out of her life. Allowing her to return to her original man and everyone win's. I mean your only doing this to escape to H*** of a life.

You don't see the problem....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain seeing how your desperate and maybe not thinking straight at the moment. This idea seem's like it's flawless and to you it feels like nothing could go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there is a part of you that thinks that maybe you should just abandon this plan and try to think of a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(But what do you finally decide on?)</span></div></div>",

You try your first attempt to move the gigantic hay bale and then realize very quickly that you are to tiny to even make it budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Sam just starts moving a hay bale that is in front of her with ease.

And while trying one last push you fall into the mud below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sees you and thinks your resting. She gives you a puzzled look\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and then replies \"Oh? Well I guess I will carry this one\". Sam then with little effort picks up the hay bale that you were struggling with and carries it over to the barn. She then calls over to you \"See? I told your to tiny\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so mad at this point \"How the hell am I going to look her in the eye after this\"?. You curse to yourself and as soon as you see her coming your way. As she is a good distance away. You see an ant that is about your height walk by you carrying some kind of twig. The ant looks at you and you freak out a bit in till Sams massive boot slams down and crushes the ant. Sam doesn't even notice the ant that she crushed as she reaches down to pick you up into her grasp.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What does Sam decide to do you next?\"</span></div></div>",

Hearing this just frustrates you and makes you want to try again. So, you say \"Come on I still want to help you. Please\". In which Sam just looks at you with sweat pouring down her face. One drop of her sweat even comes off her forehead and drops onto your tiny body. Which she doesn't even notice as she says \"Okay one more chance. You can help me plant some seeds in the garden\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brighten up instantly and reply in the most cheerful tone you can muster \"Planting seeds?! How hard can it be?\". She gives you a wry smile in return and then replies \"Well it'll depend on how fast you are, but your skills might come in use if I need watering or something else\".<br>\r\nShe has already started walking towards the garden with you in hand. You quickly jump up onto her shoulder and look down at the massive garden.<br>\r\n\"Okay here it is. I will give you some seeds. And if you can kill whatever bugs you see\" Sam says to you while placing you on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then takes some seeds out of a bag and hands them to you. \"These are poppy seeds. They will grow big and make a great tallent in cakes and muffins. I grow them on my farm because my mom likes to grind them into medicine when they are fresh. Now here are your seeds\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then shows you seeds that are much smaller than the one she showed you before.<br>\r\n\"These are anise seeds. They taste like licorice. I save them for myself because they grow really easily and make great food for farmers like me. Alright now I'll leave you to it. I'll plant the poppy seeds since we have more of those\".<br>\r\nAs Sam turns around and starts to walk over to the place where the poppy seeds will be planted, you immediately get to work and start to drop one of the seeds on the ground. You then drop them near the tiny hole's in the soil that are meant to hold the seed's. The wind picks up a few of the seeds and blows them away, but since Sam didn't see that you just pretend that you planted them all. You then use a tiny hoe that you find lying around to make the soil around the new seed's perfectly even.<br>\r\nBy the time Sam returns, you see her looking around the garden like she is searching for something. She sees you and thinks you are doing a great job since she leaves you to complete the task at hand.<br>\r\nDuring the whole time that you are working with Sam, you try to think about your plan to convince her to leave her boyfriend to got out with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally finish planting and seems like it only took you an hour which is impressive for someone at your size. Sam had already completed her planting and was finishing some other things around the farm. And while walking over to the spot where you said that you were going to meet up with Sam. You thought about what she said about bugs which you have seen none of in till you heard a loud crash behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around you see a massive beetle that is much bigger then you. The beetle looks at you. In an instant you run as the beetle chases you. Sam is approaching at this point and says \"Well I guess you almost did a great job\". As she easily puts her boot over the beetle and crushes it. She then reaches down and picks you up into her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....you did a good job planting. Guess your not completely useless\". Sam says to you while looking at her crushed beetle foe.<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" you ask still trying to catch your breath.<br>\r\n\"I saved your life, so how about we head inside and get changed\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't argue and the two of you head inside.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

By the time you change into the doll clothes, it is getting dark. Earlier you heard a knock on her door followed by Sam talking to someone. But you thought nothing of it, in till you see Sam come into her bedroom and pick you up into her grasp. She carries you over to her couch without saying anything to you. And places you on her living room table where you see her taking a close seat next to her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe what is that?\" the man says while looking at you.<br>\r\n\"Jacob, this is my new playmate. Oh and tiny guy this is my boyfriend Jacob\" Sam replies as she sits down next to her boyfriend Jacob and talks to both of you. Jacob looks closely at you and says \"So, he is real?\". Sam nods her head while saying \"Yea he is Sierra's pet and I'm just pet-sitting him for her\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob takes one look at you and his eyes widen. \"He is real, wow\" he whispers. You just try to ignore Sam's boyfriends reaction and start thinking of a way to make her boyfriend look bad. You sort of feel bad about trying to get Sam to dump Jacob and go out with you. But you think about your plan, on only dating her to get out of being a pet and then you can escape. And hopefully her and Jacob end up back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he is small...but I'll bet he is feisty\". Sam's boyfriend Jacob responds with a huge grin on his face while pointing his finger at you.<br>\r\n\"Oh he is honey\". Sam says while giggling to Jacob.<br>\r\nYou internally cringe and Sam's boyfriend takes another look at you.<br>\r\n\"Wait, this is a tiny man and you got him as a pet?\". Jacob repeats with even more surprise while looking at you.<br>\r\n\"Yes and he is way smarter then he looks. Don't judge him by his size.\" Sam replies to Jacob.<br>\r\nYou hate the idea of being called a pet. But you just continue to ignore him and try to come up with a way to get rid of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just go on to talking to each other. While you just sit there and listen. Sam decides that the two of them need some alone time. So, she picks you u into her grasp and takes you back to her room. As she sets you on her bed she says \"So, me and Jacob are going to watch a movie. And so your not to bored I will let you stay out of your cage for now. Just make sure to go in it when you feel tired\" She giggles and then walks back out to sit with Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel glad that she didn't lock you in your cage, but you are still left with the problem of being tiny in a house with two people you don't know very well. And they are both people you don't want to be around. So you take the chance to do some thinking.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Do you realize that this is the perfect chance to escape or are you to blind by trying to make your original plan work that you don't see this opportunity to escape and instead deciding to think of a way to begin that process.

As your looking around the room you see what looks like some expensive jewelry. And your mind instantly thinks that you should take some of it and stash it on Jacob to make him look bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You think that this plan can work. So you walk over to where Sam has left her items and pick up an expensive looking ring that is a bit bigger then you. You struggle to carry the giant ring and it takes you about an hour to get out of her bedroom and down a hallway. To Sam's living room where Sam and Jacob are snuggling up on the couch watching a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are to tiny for either of them to notice you as you carry the giant ring over to the couch that they are sitting on. They have no idea that your tiny self is right by them. You watch them while waiting and looking around for a perfect place to put the ring. You're looking for somewhere that looks like Jacob would stash the ring in. And Luckily Jacob carries a backpack around full of items so all you have to do is scurry over to the bag and put the ring in the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd seeing the bag on the other side of the couch from where you are. So, you start carrying the ring over to Jacob's backpack. And your first obstacle is front of you as you pass by Sam's feet. At your size you can see all the specs of dust and hairs that her feet have picked up while she has walked around. The smell is absolutely awful and you would rather be anywhere else. But you stagger through it and make it past her feet. And luckily Jacob seems to have his feet up so, you have no problem getting past him as you carry the ring over to his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly creep closer to the backpack you hear Jacob say something.<br>\r\n\"Sam, why did you pick this movie? Its really bad.\"<br>\r\n\"It's a romantic comedy and I think it's a really good movie\" Sam say's to Jacob<br>\r\nJacob continues his discussion with Sam after hearing that reply and you continue carrying the ring over to the backpack and once you reach the backpack you crawl inside of it and place the ring down in it.<br>\r\nYou then begin to crawl your way out of Jacob's backpack.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?

As you think about all the things that could go wrong if you climbed up to the counter to try to get her attention. It became obvious to you that if you wanted to get Sierra's attention to give you help. You would need to climb into her shoe and wait for a better opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then take a deep breath of fresh air before walking up to the gigantic wall of rubber that is Sierra's shoe. As she takes orders and hates her job. She has no idea that you are tiny and right next to her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to climb and pull yourself up onto Sierra's sneaker. And while carefully making your way over her shoe laces which are just so much bigger then you are. You make it to the hole of the shoe where Sierra's gigantic ankle is right in front of you. You take one more clean breath in before shimming your way directly into her shoe. Sierra didn't even feel you climb into her shoe as you were just so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in the giant shoe, your stomach does indeed feel uneasy as the smell of Sierra's foot and sweat hit's your nostrils. You continue to squeeze your tiny body to become right underneath Sierra's gigantic foot. You ended up laying down on her insole right underneath her socked foot arch. You lay there and look around at the dark place that is Sierra's shoe. You then think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might take a while...\" And with that thought you must wait in Sierra's giant shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra has no idea that you are in her shoe as she just continues about her day working. The smell to you doesn't get better or any easier to endure as her foot sweat actually begins to drip from her foot onto your tiny body. You lay there on the insole in her shoe and try not to move. Stay still and endure it as best you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra's shift lasts a couple of more hours. And the whole time you were wishing that you made the other option that didn't involve you climbing into her shoe and waiting. But there was really no going back now as you felt Sierra's being lifted into the air as she makes steps towards the clock out system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to just grip Sierra's insole so you wouldn't end up rolling underneath her foot. But each time her foot came down as she stepped. You lost your grip and had your tiny body bounce off of Sierra's gigantic foot and end up in your initial spot where you repeating your gripping of her insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sierra leaves work, you continue to wait and grip her insole. Constantly have her foot sweat odor around you. You sit there and try to remain still as Sierra's motion begins to stop and you hear a loud sound of a car engine and figure that Sierra is driving home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou of course stay in her shoe and continue to wait as she drives. And when about 20 minutes pass by Sierra arrives at her apartment parking garage. You give a sigh when you hear the car door open and close. And even though you have now reexperience the feeling of her walking again as Sierra just casually walks to her apartment. You know that your time in her shoe will hopefully come to an end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip the insole with your hands and begin to flex your fingers. You grip tighter and tighter with each time that Sierra's foot steps on the ground. You aren't sure how much longer you can take this. She steps into the elevator and stands in there as she waits for the elevator to take her up to her floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the elevator doors open, Sierra begins to exit it and walk towards her apartment. You grip Sierra's insole with all you have as you feel her loud footsteps hitting the ground with each step that she takes down her apartment's hallway towards her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel as her foot starts to place pressure on your form. And quickly roll back towards the area under the arch of her foot. You can't even see anything due to your place under her foot in her sneaker. You just grip her insole and wait for her to reach her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you hear the door open. Footsteps sound loud as she takes a step towards her apartment. Then you feel her lifting up off of the ground. As she sits down by her doorway to begin taking off her sneakers. You begin to think during this time about the possibility of her feeling something or more like you in her shoe...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Did Sierra feel something (you) in her shoe?)</span></div></div>",

As you slide and hold yourself against the wall of the sneaker, you look up and see Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe isn't looking at you at all or acknowledges your presence as she still has no idea that you are even in her shoe. She just holds her shoe out while looking at the spot where she ends up placing the sneaker you are in down at. You feel a shake as the shoe is tossed into a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push yourself up and find that you are now standing in the shoe. You still have the awful smell of Sierra's foot smell around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump in fear though as you hear a loud sound which was just the sound of Sierra's other sneaker hitting the ground next to you. After Sierra takes off her shoes she gets up and begins to walk over to her living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to hear the sound of the TV as Sierra turns it on and sits down on her couch. It's at this moment you decide that you need to get of her sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump and try to move around inside her shoe as you try to get yourself out of the smelly sneaker. You at first can't manage to climb out. But with a little bit of extra effort you finally manage to pull yourself out of Sierra's gigantic sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now able to breath again. You stand on top of Sierra's sneaker and look up at the living room TV. You watch as Sierra sits down on her couch and begins to watching some late night guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing where you should probably go to, you carefully make your way down her shoe. You jump down to the ground and look around at your surroundings before beginning your adventure towards Sierra's gigantic couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so tiny of course makes this simple trip of getting to a living room couch exhausting. But you feel fortunate that Sierra's apartment is mostly tile so you don't have to venture through gigantic carpet strands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile continuing walking you see random amounts of filth that tells you that Sierra doesn't sweep up to much. As you pass by crumbs of probably old food, specks of dust, and strands of Sierra's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also find an old tooth pick that you decide to pick up and keep for just in case. It only takes you about an hour to walk from Sierra's shoe to her couch. During this time Sierra has been watching TV and occasionally getting up to walk to her kitchen to check on her dinner that she is cooking for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are finally though at her couch. You look in front of you to see the underneath of Sierra's gigantic couch. And as you slowly approach the area under her couch, you notice how dark it is and you can't tell what a lot of the things are, under there. And then for a quick second you actually believe you saw something move and then you lose sight of whatever it is in the darkness. Seeing all this makes you think that maybe your best trying to go around the couch instead of following your initial path of going right underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to either side of yourself you see Sierra's kitchen on your left which has the risk of her getting up and unknowingly stepping on you. Then looking towards your right you see her couch against a wall which would lead you to still having to go underneath the couch but at least you should have light since above that is just the couch's arm rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course you also notice that you are located in a spot where in both directions is the same distance and no matter what direction you take it will take you about 30 or so more minutes to make it around the couch versus going underneath the couch which would probably be about a 10 minute trip.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Which way do you go?...)</span></div></div>",

This spells out danger for you that you don't want to admit to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you decide that you have already wasted enough time and seeing that it's a lot faster to just go underneath Sierra's gigantic couch. You venture forward into the darkness of the underneath of Sierra's couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you carefully pick your way going underneath the couch, you don't know what exactly is in store for you. But you do know that all you have to do is make it to the light at the other side of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look to either side of yourself as you nervously clench the toothpick that you found which is taller then you. You then look ahead as you try to stay as calm as you can while you continuing to walk forward. The darkness around you hides whatever huge objects are around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass by an object that you can't tell what it is you touch it and jump slightly as you quickly realize its just a tennis ball that is like 10 times your size. Going onwards in the pitch black darkness with only the light of the other side of the couch being your direction to go. And after that tennis ball experience you start to feel dumb for ever thinking that this was a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with that thought you hear a crackling sound behind you. And without even looking to see whatever it was you bolted forward. You're probably more scared than you've ever been in your life right now. Your body is shaking and you feel lightheaded. You can't even see where your feet are stepping as you are running as fast as you can towards the light of the other side of the couch. You have a good feeling that your being chased by something as the cracking sound gets closer as you are continuing to run forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a sudden burst of adrenaline you make it to the other side and the first thing you see is Sierra's gigantic bare foot which you just barley dodge as she sets it down while just casually walking over to her couch to sit down to enjoy her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you see Sierra in all her giantess glory. As she doesn't even notice you or even have any idea that you are tiny and on the floor of her apartment. All she does is begin eating while watching her TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really know what to do next, as you begin picking yourself up and realize that the crackling sound that you heard in the darkness of the couch wasn't your imagination. As you see an ant that is a bit bigger then you crawl it's way out from under Sierra's couch and just look at you. You don't want to mess with something so big, but your pretty sure the ant could easily catch up to you if you ran. And it looks at you, it seems to have no intention of letting you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you do the only thing you can think of. You get into a stance and hold the toothpick you have out like a sword. As the ant gets ready to charge at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really don't think you have a chance in this situation but you feel like you have to try. As you look forward and are surprised when some food crumbs rain down onto the tile. Sierra of course doesn't notice or care about the tiny crumbs that burst from her food or fall from her cheek as she eats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the crumbs of food you get an idea, that maybe you could get the ant to become distracted by the food. But you know that the only way to make your idea work is to make it over to the crumbs that are on the other side of the ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you wait for the ant to make its first move. It does so quickly lunging at you with incredible speed. You twirl around and swing your toothpick sword at it.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?...)</span></div></div>",

You twirl around and swing your toothpick sword at it. You end up succeeding in making the ant stop moving completely. It doesn't even eat the bit of skin it almost landed on because the toothpick you had pushed up against it is in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that for the moment you and the ant have about the same amount of strength. But you know that eventually the ant will out match you. So, seeing one of the ants legs very close. You make a quick risky decision as you swing your toothpick sword away from holding the ant back to swing it hard against the ant's leg as you roll under the ant to the other side of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toothpick actually succeeds in giving a slight injury to the ant's leg that you swung at. The ant is so surprised that it drops to the ground and you are able to roll away to safety. And without checking to see if the ant will get back up you begin to charge towards the area of raining crumbs. The ant ends up getting up fast and is probably more angry then ever as it charges at you at a slightly lower speed given it's injured leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole focus is on the idea that you had earlier and hoping that it works. As you enter the area where the crumbs that unknowingly or uncaringly fall from Sierra's food or face as she eats while watching her TV. You hear the ant getting closer and know that it's about to be right on top of you again. As you then turn to ready to strike at it again. You look in front of you to see the ant has stopped in its tracks being about a couple inches away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant seems a bit conflicted as it looks at you, but then turns its attention towards the crumbs. You watch as the ant has changed it's focus to the crumbs of food. You are still cautious, but feel confident that the ant won't attack you anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just slowly backway while turning around a few times to search your surroundings for a place to hide and wait for the ant to leave. You see a single sock laying on the ground a few feet away from Sierra's gigantic barefoot. So, when you feel you get a good distance from the ant you charge yourself toward the sock and crawl in it. You only just stick your head out to watch the ant, as it begins picking up the fallen crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sock itself does have a lingering smell to it that you just do your best to ignore. As you wait in the darkness of the sock, for the ant to eventually leave, you find yourself thinking about this strange situation that you are in. Being mysteriously shrunk to an inch tall and now having to survive this gigantic world of normal sized people and things. It's a lot to just think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the ant does leave in a matter of 5 or 10 minutes and it exits back into the darkness of the underneath of the couch. You wait a few minutes longer just to make sure it's really gone. When you are sure, you get out of the sock that you're sitting in and head towards Sierra's gigantic barefoot. You look up at Sierra as she just texts and plays on her phone while her TV is playing in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that your going to have a very hard time trying to get her attention. And you also know that you need to figure something out quick since you have no idea the amount of time Sierra plans on sitting on her couch. So, looking at your surroundings you think that maybe you could just run up to Sierra's foot and start banging on it or maybe there's also an option of trying to find a way to climb up the couch.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?...)</span></div></div>",

So, it is obvious that you need to find a way to scale up the couch. You figure that if you can get up there then you can get the attention of Sierra in some way. Maybe bang on her leg or something. Either way you're going to have to move quickly before Sierra gets up from her phone and her TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see that the couch is up pretty high, almost vertical in some spots. There doesn't appear to be anything in your reach that would enable you to scale it. You do see a tiny, remote control like device next to Sierra's feet. It appears to be short enough for you climb on top of then use it to get to the couch and then scale your way up the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way over to the small remote which is the size of a house to you. Then you reach out your little arm and grab the top of device to pull yourself on top of it. Then walking across the remote over to where the wall of couch is front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin scaling your way up the cloth couch. With each move you make upwards, you get more cautious about your climb as the couch to you is like a tall mountain. So, you just hold onto the sides of the couch and slowly climb up the rest of the way until you are able to pull yourself onto the cushion of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest for a moment as you see Sierra's gigantic thigh that has her black work pants worn on it, only about 7 feet away from you. Looking up at her you see that she is just really into whatever she is doing on her phone. She has no idea that you being an inch tall is just a few feet next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now you just need to try your first idea as you decide the best way to bang on her leg would be to climb up onto her gigantic lap. You begin to scale Sierra's gigantic thigh, using her work pants that she is wearing as the thing to grip onto. While climbing you can't help to notice a rather bad sweat smell coming off her work pants, that wasn't as bad as her shoe but still smelled bad to your tiny self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you just focus on the goal of making it to the top of her gigantic lap. You reach the top of her gigantic lap after what seems to be an eternity but was only about 10 minutes since you are so tiny. You are just so tired from all of this tiny activity that you have been doing. Your body feels like it needs a break as you just look at the gigantic curved surface of your surroundings. You see left over crumbs of her food that she hasn't brushed off of her lap. Also some stains on her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to just lay down and fall sleep due to how tired you are. But you try to stay focus on your goal as you take one last look up at the giantess who as no idea of your existence. You then begin pounding on her thigh with your tiny fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do this for a good minute and then you finally get some kind of movement out of her. And as you excited while beginning to look up to see her reaction. You realize quickly that she isn't moving because she noticed your movement (I mean if she didn't feel you climbing her thigh, then there would be no way she would feel you pounding on her pants wearing leg with your tiny strength).

Her gigantic arm that was just resting near your tiny body has been lifted up into the air at this point. You are at first expecting her to notice you as her eye's seem to scan her jean covered lap. But it seems that you are so tiny that as Sierra looks down at all the crumbs that are on her lap, she just views you as one of the random crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you watch as her gigantic arm begins to sweep down to her lap to begin brushing the crumbs off her lap. Seeing the gigantic mass of her arm swing quickly in your direction. You instantly brace for impact as you lay down and grip tightly to the black jean pants that she is wearing.

But as her gigantic palm swept over you, the after breeze alone that was caused by her gigantic hand blew you off your grip and made you fly into her stomach, and as your body began sliding down her stomach region you were trying to get some kind of grip and you ended up gripping the groin area of her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that happened to you Sierra was satisfied with the fact that she had swept all the crumbs off her lap and didn't even notice the crumb (you) went to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sort of just wanted to drop off into the couch area below you. But you weren't able to get any kind of chance to do that as Sierra began to get up from her seat on the couch and you were forced to grip tightly to her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rose up from the couch, you actually took a glimpse at the ground. The sight terrified you as you saw just how high you were. this made you grip tighter to her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra stood still for a moment as she turned off her TV and then tossed the remote on her couch. She then began her walk to her bedroom so, to get ready for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she began walking, you clenched her jeans and were only able to look at her gigantic thighs. As you looked up, while she was just casually walking while texting. You couldn't help to think about the fact that you are so tiny and insignificant to her that she has no way of telling that you are there and clenching her jeans for your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked and texted away while you had no idea where she was going in till you heard her open a door and you turn to see a bedroom which you assume is hers. Sierra just casually walks into her bedroom and turns to go into the bathroom that is attached to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sierra enters her bathroom with you still clenched to her jeans. You look up at her and as soon as you realize where you are you begin to get a little scared as you watch her just casually remove the shirt that she is wearing. Your new sight is her in just her bra as your inch tall self clenches to her jeans while she walks over to turn on her shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip tighter to her jeans as she re-adjusts her grip on her phone and begins texting again. During this you only have the choice of gripping her jeans or risk falling off from your current height, which might kill you given your size. Sierra doesn't seem to notice you are even there as she walks while checking her phone. It only takes about a couple of minutes before she feels the shower is ready at this point she begins to remove her work jeans that you are clenching to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she does this you are unsure about what your going to do. But since you don't think of anything fast enough you clench on the jeans as they come off her and onto the floor. Sierra of course doesn't notice you as her pants come off her and you begin to crawl your way out of the rolls of fabric that is now on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you stand your tiny inch tall body on one of the jean loops you look up to see the giantess herself Sierra as she is now being to take off her bra. Seeing her from this view makes you feel so small as you just look up at her gigantic massive naked body. Her hair alone on her body is longer then you. And you still are having a hard time grasping that she has no idea that your even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about how normally seeing a sight like this would be a man's dream. But given that Sierra isn't all that attractive given her more tom boyish look and the fact that you could end up being crushed with anyone of her unknowing movements. The situation itself doesn't really make you feel anything except a bit of fear. This is especially when she steps out of the jeans that you are on and you watch as she begins picking up her fallen clothing that she had just taken off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra picks up her work shirt that she had taken off earlier first and carries it over to a nearby basket that has some other assumed dirty laundry in it. Sierra then proceeds to pick up the other pieces of clothing that she had just taken off and seeing this you think about the fact that she will pick up the pants soon and do the same. So, you should probably try to quickly get to the tile floor fast.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?...)</span></div></div>",

But as you screamed to try to get her attention you realize quickly that you are far to tiny and far away for her to hear your tiny insignificant voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Sierra's giantess naked self, carries the pair of pants over to her dirty laundry basket and then drops it inside. After dropping the pair of pants into the dirty laundry basket, she turns around and walks over to her turned on shower and walks into it. Sierra stands under the hot water and begins washing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there and wonder what you should try to do next.

So, your best bet is to probably find a spot where you could attempt to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the bathroom and see that there isn't anything in here that would help you. So, you probably go to her bedroom since that would be where she would be heading to next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decision made you make your way out of her bathroom which is linked to her bedroom so, once you slid your tiny self under the bathroom door you made it to her bedroom. You stand there and look around for a moment. You see her gigantic queen sized bed in the left center of the room, followed by a desk against a wall, a dresser next to it and more closer to you, see her walk-in closet. Seeing all this from your tiny perspective followed by the bits of dust and loose hairs that are as big or bigger then you, it's all still a bit intimating to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd looking at all the potential spots that you could get her attention from you are a bit unsure about where you should go to try to make your next attempt in getting her attention. Her bed would probably be your best option but it might be to tall and vertical for you to climb. And before you could consider your other options the gigantic bathroom door that you have been just standing in front of opens. And turning around you look up to see Sierra in her full giantess naked self step out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that her two gigantic barefoot were to either side of you. And looking up at her you see that she is standing there wearing her towel on her head to dry her hair and taking a moment to text on her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour unsure on where to move to next as you witness water droplets that haven't been dried off her yet, slide from her skin to the floor near you like gigantic rain drops. Which to a normal sized person would be nothing more then small drops of water, but to you the water began to create a pound or small lake at her feet around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that your going to have to move now.

In which she presses and then says into the phone \"Okay you should be able to get in now.\". In which you then hear the sort of familiar voice from her phone say \"Alright, we will be right up.\". In which they both then hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Sierra begins to walk over to her gigantic fridge and opens it. You watch as she starts to take out some food and drinks. You see a couple cans of coke and bottles of beer. And the food that she takes out is a couple sandwiches. You think as you continue to look at Sierra. While you are looking at all this, you hear a loud noise as Sierra's apartment front door opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump when you hear it. As Sierra then looks over in the direction of her open door. And then following her lead you turn to watch as four people begin to enter Sierra's apartment. They all smile and laugh as they greet Sierra and get confrontable with one another. And of course Not a single one of them notices your tiny self on the tile floor watching this all go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at each person and see that there is 2 girl's and 2 boys. You weren't sure at first if you knew any of them, but then you began to sort of recognize each person as some of the country people that went to high school with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with the boys, you see a guy with a beer gut and greasy looking hair, who you sort of remember as a guy named Ben. You and him never really talked to one another. And he was in one of your classes way back when, but other then that you just remember him being the type of student to always talk in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy you see is a skinny man with short black hair named Austin. You and him also don't really know each other very well. But you recognize him from your old high school and also as the boyfriend of someone you do sort of know whose name is Mikayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading towards the two girls, you look at the chubby girl with long brunette hair, who you recognize as Mikayla. You and her never really got along, especially when you turned her down and sort of bullied her when you were around your other friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally looking at the last person who is a chubby girl with long dirty blonde hair, who at first you have a hard time recognizing but giving a good three seconds you instantly recognize the girl as your ex-girlfriend Skye. You and her broke up 3 to 4 years ago due to going to different collages. And you haven't seen her since the break up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there and just watched as now you have to deal with 5 giants instead of 1. In till they all begin to walk over to Sierra's living room as they chat with one another.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

And after dismounting there stuff near the front door, they all begin to walk over to Sierra's living room as they chat with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are certain none of them have even noticed you yet. You think this, while watching them get confrontable in Sierra's living room while she offers to grab everyone some beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really don't know what to do at this point. But seeing all them you begin to think that maybe since there are more people, at least one of them should be able see you and then you should be able to get the help that you have been striving to get this whole time. So you make your way over to the group of them. This time your able to just walk along the side of the wall with the couches arm rest being the only thing above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you get to the other side of the couch, you keep behind one of the legs of the couch as you out look at all them. And the first thing you see is Mikayla's gigantic barefoot only being a couple feet away from you, with a smell that makes you just want to keep backing away. But you try hold your nose as you look up from her barefoot and see Austin and Mikayla sitting by each other on the couch. They seem to be drinking, talking and enjoying the football game that is on Sierra's TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn your attention towards a single chair that ben was sitting on. At the moment he seemed to be in cased into focusing on watching the football game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your attention from him you then see Skye was sitting on the floor drinking and eating some snacks that were on Sierra's living room table. She seemed to be in cased in eating at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you wondered where Sierra was. In till you looked across the gigantic couch and saw her sitting on the opposite side of the couch of Austin and Mikayla. She seemed to be drinking her beer and talking to the group of them. Every now and then she would laugh at something that was said making her gigantic jiggly belly shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit unsure of what your next move should be. As you look out at the all these giant people, you can't help to think back to when you were in the school and originally shrunk. During that time you had to make a decision of what to do next with the possible thought that if you make the wrong choice of what to do next you could end up crushed unknowingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you paused while watching them all mingle and thought after a good minute and watching the giant people in front of you have there fun as they are unaware of your tiny presence.

Seeing that she is sitting on the floor and the fact that you probably know her better then anyone else here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decision made you leave your vantage point at the leg of the couch, and begin making your way over to Skye. While walking over to her you can't help to think about how different she looks now from when you two dated way back when. I mean not only the fact that since you are an inch tall, she is now a giantess to you. But also she has gained some weight and seemed to have embarrassed the country lifestyle a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you come close enough to Skye, you see that the way she is sitting her feet are stretched out under the table and would be the first thing you reach. And as you near closer an awful smell hits you. And at first you can't even think about what it could be, but you soon realize where the awful smell comes from as you see a gigantic mountain wall of flesh that is the heel of Skye's barefoot in front of you. The smell is very clearly emitting from Skye's gigantic bare foot, and this is very apparent to you as you gag at the smell while forcing yourself to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd being only inches away from Skye's barefoot, you can't help to think -does any of these country people shower-. I mean your sure that you don't remember Skye's feet smelling this bad but of course the smell must be only this bad because your so tiny. But then again you also never been this close to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, while basically trying not to gag you look up through some of the small pieces of glass that the gigantic living room table has in it for design. And you can see Skye's face as her gigantic hand is reaching into a chip bowl and she continues to talk to Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, this was such a fun idea Sierra....\" She says as she reaches for her shot glass that has some kind of liquid in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you continue to watch her while standing only a few inches away from her gigantic bare foot that you can't stand to near at this point. You try to decide what to do next but your only thought is to get away from her gigantic bare foot which is just towering over you. So, you decide to just do that then as you walk forward with Skye's gigantic leg next to you. And while focusing on making some distance from her stinky foot, you gain an idea while having your eye's focused on the denim hot shorts that she is wearing. You see a loose thread that is coming off the pocket area of her denim hot shorts and hanging down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny normal sized person would probably not see it or just ignore it since its such a skinny and almost invisible piece of thread. But to you it might as well be a thick piece of rope that you could use to try and then eventually try to reach a point where Skye could hear your tiny voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a thought that goes through your head that this could be a bad idea where you end up unknowingly crushed. But you also know that you don't have much time to think this over though since you are now only a few inches away from the thread and your unsure of if Skye would get up or something.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(As you approach what happens next?)</span></div></div>",

There's no going back you think as you right about to grab the thread. And to your surprise the thread begins to jolt away from you quickly. You are so confused by this action and looking up, you see that Skye is actually getting up for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes just scan for the thread in till they finally lock on to it and you bolt towards it as you hop while running. But to your dismay it quickly becomes out of reach for your tiny arms. All you can do is watch as the thread goes higher and higher as Skye begins to stand. And of course a familiar smell that you didn't see coming, hits you like bus. As Skye's feet speed by you the smell they leave behind makes you fall to your knees and gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only stare at the ground in disgust as you try to recover from that awful smell of Skye's feet. And during this time you hear Skye say \"...You keep the beers over here, right?...\". In which Sierra confirms as she swigs more beer down her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Skye walks over to the case of beer you had finally recovered enough to think straight. And even though you just had to watch your first good chance in a while, just slip away. You try to think positively as you consider the fact that Skye is only just grabbing a beer and she should be sitting back in this spot after she grabs her beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a minute or so of waiting you look up to see Skye reentering your line of sight. As she talks to Sierra while nearing the turn around the gigantic couch. You get ready to move some distance to not have to deal with the toxic smell of Skye's feet once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen turning your attention back towards Skye you witness as Sierra scooches over in her seat and pats the sitting area right next to her while saying \"...Oh come on Skye why don't you just sit next to me instead of the floor. In which Skye shrugs her shoulders and agrees while making her new seat become the couch spot right next to Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that you now have to come up with a new plan as the spot where Sierra and Skye are at is a good distance of a walk away from you, which was the biggest reason why you didn't go for Sierra in the first place. And top of that you know that who ever you pick now you are going to have to figure out a way to climb up one of the gigantic piece of furniture that each person is sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take this all in and sigh as you start turning towards Ben and your first thought is your last thought about him which is that you barely know Ben and with the stuff you do know about him, he sort of comes off as an annoying person. So, you think he should probably be your worse case scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen turning towards Mikayla your in sort of a lucky situation there as Ben is only the 3rd closet to you. As Mikayla is the closet to you, with her boyfriend Austin being the next. And you actually do know Mikayla sort of But then again if you choose Mikayla, she might hold the fact that you bullied her in high school affect her decision of how to handle you. And if you somehow get Austin's attention, you are put in a similar situation as with Ben as you barley know of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hate that keep being put in these situations where you need to decide what won't kill you faster. But that is your life no or more like hopefully for now. As you think of other things you could do. Which you then think that you also could just journey to the area of Skye and Sierra, but that could take some time that your unsure if you have. Of course there's also abandoning all hope of talking to any of these people and just focus on getting to a good spot where Sierra could see you later.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(It seems our adventurer is unsure of what to do next so, What should he do next?)</span></div></div>",

The feeling is really uncomfortable as your hands begin to feel like they may rip if you keep stretching them any longer. And the feeling of Skye's stomach gives you almost zero leverage, as it instead allows your tiny foot to slip every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly though reach your biggest obstacle yet as you gaze up at Skye's gigantic mountain's of breast's that are right above your head. You don't know if you can really make it around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you have no other choice so, you continue your climb upwards, which ends up being a bit harder then expected.  As you find that once you get half way up, your in a sort of hanging position such like as if you were clinging to monkey bars instead of someone's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a couple of moments of climbing, you manage to get around the bottom half of one of her mountainous mounds. And at this point your body and arms are tired and killing you. As you take a moment to just rest on top of shirt with her breast being right underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take in a deep breath and can smell her scent which is a mix of her body odor and a slight smell of bubble gum perfume smell. The soft/squishy surface your on, actually makes you feel kind a relaxed as you lay there. For a good moment it seems that you forget about how tiny you are and the location you are currently in, Which even makes you begin to think that you might be able to just fall asleep. But your sadly mistaken as your relaxation feeling turns to a bit of worry when the surface beneath you being Skye's breast's begins to... jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then suddenly hear something that you have been actually able to ignore in till this point at least, which is the sound of Skye's voice as she gives a loud giggle. Your unsure of what she is giggling at and while keeping your tiny hands clenched to her shirt you scan your eyes up from Skye's neck to her gigantic head that is laughing up a storm while looking at what ever is right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you actually thought that maybe she finally noticed you. But seeing that she isn't even looking your way and is instead looking at whatever is behind you, which to the left of her. You can conclude that she has clearly not noticed you. And she is certainly has no clue about your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, being a bit curious to what she is laughing at you turn your head. To hear and see the gigantic figure of a man who she is talking to, which is Ben as he makes a joke while conversating with Skye and eating out of the chip bowl. Her giggling in this situation has made your situation much worse and your relaxation non-existent. All you can do at the moment is clench and hope you can get a chance to move upwards once these there conversation ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?...)</span></div></div>",

As she laughs at the jokes that Ben makes. Which causes her breast's to jiggle like crazy. And if that wasn't bad enough you also had to listen to Ben's talking which clearly sounded like flirting which you weren't even sure if Skye was into it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole situation was not just bad, it was depressing with just how tiny and insignificant you are now.

In which Ben finally just caved by nodding his head yes while saying \"I.... Yea... I mean I was.... But it was only because.... uhhh...\". Ben heisted for a moment while mumbling nervously as he tried to come up with some kind of excuse and then he remember something that he did actually see earlier as he continued talking \"...I saw something land in-between your.... uhhh... chest area.\". He tried saying confidently while giving a slight laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn which Skye just responded to him with a pouty face as she said \"Yea right,...

In which Sierra confirms as she swigs more beer down her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Skye walks over to the case of beer you had finally recovered enough to think straight. And even though you just had to watch your first good chance in a while, just slip away. You try to think positively as you consider the fact that Skye is only just grabbing a beer and she should be sitting back in this spot after she grabs her beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a minute or so of waiting you look up to see Skye reentering your line of sight. As she talks to Sierra while nearing the turn around the gigantic couch. You get ready to move some distance to not have to deal with the toxic smell of Skye's feet once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen turning your attention back towards Skye you witness as Sierra scooches over in her seat and pats the sitting area right next to her while saying \"...Oh come on Skye why don't you just sit next to me instead of the floor. In which Skye shrugs her shoulders and agrees while making her new seat become the couch spot right next to Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that you now have to come up with a new plan as the spot where Sierra and Skye are at is a good distance of a walk away from you, which was the biggest reason why you didn't go for Sierra in the first place. And top of that you know that who ever you pick now you are going to have to figure out a way to climb up one of the gigantic piece of furniture that each person is sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take this all in and sigh as you start turning towards Ben and your first thought is your last thought about him which is that you barely know Ben and with the stuff you do know about him, he sort of comes off as an annoying person. So, you think he should probably be your worse case scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen turning towards Mikayla your in sort of a lucky situation there as Ben is only the 3rd closet to you. As Mikayla is the closet to you, with her boyfriend Austin being the next. And you actually do know Mikayla sort of But then again if you choose Mikayla, she might hold the fact that you bullied her in high school affect her decision of how to handle you. And if you somehow get Austin's attention, you are put in a similar situation as with Ben as you barley know of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hate that keep being put in these situations where you need to decide what won't kill you faster. But that is your life no or more like hopefully for now. As you think of other things you could do. Which you then think that you also could just journey to the area of Skye and Sierra, but that could take some time that your unsure if you have. Of course there's also abandoning all hope of talking to any of these people and just focus on getting to a good spot where Sierra could see you later.</span></div></div>",

The glass walls are steamed up from breathing so you bend over and wipe some condensation off to look out.  Looking back at you is an eye almost as large as you re tall.

Keeping you trapped by her arm she tilts her hand and deposits you on her soft bed spread.  She brings her face down and places it upon her hands and lovingly regards you again.

Then as she had no worries of retrieving me again it was out of simple curiosity to see where I was going to try to go.  About the time I had reached her knees and was getting winded it had gone from curiosity to entertainment.  Now sliding her body up I was corralled back to the way I came from being blocked off by her half bent leg.  Turning back to run the other way I was met with her other black slack pant leg in a similar half bent position.  With no where else to go I headed for the edge of the bed.  This might have brought some concern for my safety to her as she pushed her legs together like two massive doors shutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was assailed by two tan nyloned feet that were pushing together to complete her indian style position.   Being caught between them they compressed together trapping me and simultaneously immobilizing me at once.  My face was engulfed in nyloned flesh that had seen an entire day inside some leather pumps.  The smell was overwhelming to say the least.  Individual nylon strands were like thin ropes pressing against my face.  I could hear  the amused giantess merrily giggling from far above at my embarrassing predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Were did you think you were going little man?  Did you think I would let you jump off my bed to your death?\"   I could not respond as my face was busy being smooshed by thousands of tons of foot flesh.

At first I just heard little tiny squeaks but then he understood his mistake and started yelling.  I could make out his words it was so adorable.  He told me from the palm of my hand that he was in my 2nd period class last year and that his name was Kevin Steward.  I gasped from this revelation and remembered him being a trouble maker whom I sent to the office on more than one occasion.  I also had a theory that he was going to get into a lot more legal trouble when he was older.  But at his current stature I think he has bigger concerns than the police (giggles).  He told me that he wasn't sure what happened and how he came to be like this.  One minute he was taking an exam in Mrs. Boudine's class and the next he was sitting on the floor and at his present height of 1 single inch (I know this because I measured him when he was sleeping that first day).  He eventually got around to asking for my help in getting him to a hospital but I just ignored this request and offered to feed him as he must have been famished at that point and was'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n' I know what your thinking right now but I doubt you'd do any different if the shoe was on your foot.  Here was a living, breathing,  thinking being whom would make the most precious little family mascot.  I just knew my daughters were going to love him and be as thrilled with his company as I already was.  Let's face it.  In 3-4 years he probably would have been in and out of jail, unemployed,  and a burden to society.  Now he would serve a very useful purpose though in a somewhat diminished manner (Heh heh!).  I mean it is so empowering to be able to balance a human on the tip of your finger.  I love it when he throws little tantrums you really must view it sometime, it's the sweetest thing you'll ever see.  A one inch little man shouting curses up to his omnipotent benefactors whom need only close their fingers in a fist to stifle his outburst from an imprisoned palm.  I can just make a displeased expression and this is enough to give poor little Jake (We renamed him but more on that later) pause.  I think that my daughters like punishing him too as they're always finding reasons and infractions to make him sorry for his actions.  And no one ever really get's angry with him, I mean how can you do anything but just laugh at his silly little antics.  I do get upset when the girls are careless with him and he get's hurt which happens more than I'd like to admit.  But accidents do happen. (a sigh) I never take kindly to his pathetic little escape attempts which all 3 of us are always on the look out for these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's very resourceful you know.  I remember one time Megan had thought it cute to have him swim in her bowl of onion soup.  One of her friends had called her on the phone and she left for a few minutes to converse at the kitchen phone.  In a manner of 5 minutes (she swore it wasn't a half hour but I still don't believe her) he had managed to pull a hand cloth over to the edge of the coffee table and drop a second hand cloth upon the floor in order to cushion his fall after climbing down the other hand towel as far as possible.  It took us an entire hour to find him and oh how I was upset with  him.  I took away his eating treats and television privileges for a month over that one.  Oh how many humorous stories I could tell you about our little pet.  We all do love him so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like for me to tell you some more about him?\"</span></div></div>",

Helplessly, you try to grab her pants to prevent your fall, but to no avail. You wind up landing on the hard ground right in front of her feet. You stare up to see your gigantic Goddess looming above. Now that she is standing with her full height, you get a new appreciation for her giganticness and your miniscule self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now worship my feet.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is sore from the fall possibly with a few broken bones. You try to get your body up but are unable. You lie there too hurt to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I SAID NOW!' With that she kicks you up into the air a few inches into the air (but from your perspective is a few feet), and you land back on the ground. After this you know you can't stay on the ground anymore (you don't know how many of those kicks you'd survive) and must all your strength to get up and walk over to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now worship!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel down and start to worship her big toe like you did on her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bow lower!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did exactly that. During each kneel, you went a little lower and spent a few more seconds on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bow lower!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you went completely prostrate in front of her gigantic foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I SAID BOW LOWER!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow? you thought to yourself. You couldn't get any lower than you already were. You were completely prostate in front of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't tell me I didn't warn you! I told you to go lower.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this you saw her foot rise above and big toe push you lower and lower into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ahhh. Help,' you scream. You doubt she can here you as your face is being plastered into the floor. You start to suffocate as you feel your lungs being squashed into the ground and the only air you can breathe seems to be the stink of her foot. You try to squirm your way out of the pressure of her big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No. You don't try to squirm your way out of worshipping me.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this she lowered her entire foot on top of you, not just her big toe, to push you down with. You suffocated even more as she pushed with twice the force as she did before, and you were now completely engulfed by the stink of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now that's better,' you hear say from some voice above. 'When I say worship my foot this is how low I want you to go. Next time I may not be so forgiving in sparing you for failing to follow my commands.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly killing you, she removes your foot and looks down expectantly from your pale, collapsed, and nearly dead body.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of us here know anything about how you got to be so tiny. So, the way I see it, the most reasonable outcome here is that you stay stuck at that size forever. And even if that isn't the case, you are currently tiny which means if we have you just roaming around here, you could very easily end up unknowingly crushed under one of our feet. I think it's way to dangerous for you to be living a normal life and your best option would be to become my pet. Which isn't a bad life, I can take care of you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that you also hear May put her input in saying with a smirk \"...Plus you're so small that whatever you try to do will be insignificant. You're much better off taking the offer to be a pet.\". Even though you see Jane's point and it's obvious to you that they are fully on board with you as there pet.

So, without really think of where you are or what happened the last two attempts, you bolt away from the two woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane and May go from waiting for you to respond to watching you run away from them as you are just scurrying across there desk. Jane is the first to just roll her eye's as she is frustrated and surprised with what you are doing right now as she says \"...Oh my god, is he really trying to run away again?...\". This leads May to do the same and as she rolls her eye's in frustration and says \"...Ugh, where does he even think he is going? I mean... one misstep and he is flying off the desk and plummeting to the floor...\" Hearing that Jane actually gets a little worried for you as she is on top that frustrated with your current response as she says \"...Oh! will you help him May...\".

And your so focus on this objective that you don't hear or notice May as a wall of flesh (which is May's hand) appears in front of you. In an instant you are wrapped into May's grasp. You struggle in an attempt to get out of her gigantic grasp. But your struggling is just pointless as May doesn't even feel it and she is also a lot stronger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay just looks down at you in her grasp with an angry face on as she then holds you out (still in her fist though) in front of Jane. Looking at Janes face you can't tell how frustrated she really is with you right now as she gives you a disappointed look and then says \"...What the heck? We were just having a conversation and you decided to just run away. We weren't forcing you to do anything. Did you think we were going to force you to become our pet?... Which that isn't an excuse even if you thought that. I had no intention of making you do anything. I mean we were conversating like normal people. So do you have anything to say?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are trying to think of something to say or do so that will cause Jane to not be mad at you, well at least not at you for too long. But your not quick enough to respond as Jane continues talking to you \"...Well seems like you have made your choice. If you don't want to talk to us like a civilized human-being, then you no longer get to be treated like one...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane then with a single swift her arm, she moves in to pick you up off of May's now open hand. Jane then picks up a nearby jar that has just been sitting on her desk the whole time. And with one quick motion she easily drops you into the jar. And then picking up a lid that had holes in the top of it. She very easily sealed you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all happened so fast that you couldn't even comprehend your predictament in till Jane held the Jar up to her gigantic face. She smiled as she looked in on you being inside of the jar. You don't really know what to do as you just stare at her and hear her say with a smile \"....Well welcome to your decision tiny guy,... welcome to life as being my new pet....\".</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",
