A title not to be made small, and is held by yourself and any that pursue a path like your's. You make your way across the holds by the virtue of your strength, study, and stealth, although what you put to the fullest usage is the <i>well</i> endowed body you were born into this world with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat very same body is a wide and towering one that others could only dream of having...or being had by. Your broad shoulders frame your silhouette, but so too does your musclegut, powerful thighs, and mountainous pectorals. Between your legs swings a foreskin-covered cock that can swell to the size of an old tree's trunk, and beneath it a churning sack. When men look to your face they see bright yet cold blue eyes staring through them, broad nose and freckled face, and wide jaw that your thick beard grows from. Upon your head is a veritable mane of wavy hair, the copper and deep red tones blend together making a fiery display against any scenery. Underneath the furs and leathers made from beasts you've hunted is flesh carpeted in hair that displays your virility. You armor yourself with maille from time to time, and you ensure that your garb displays the men you've slaughtered during your travels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've lived a life of tales worth telling, but something tells you the next great saga is only beginning. Your body recognizes it too as churning noises erupt from all the methods you have at your disposal to take a man. As if rewarding a pet you rub over yourself in turn for such readiness for battle. You relish every opportunity to exert your will on the world, to it's fullest extent. A grin spreads across your face knowing you may find your hands molding the world to your every whim despite the strange tidings the land has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand looking out at the world, but you realize after all of your reflection that you forgot your next destination... it seems you will have to gather your bearings.</span></div></div>",

Rorikstead isn't a proper city, but it is a large area of farms and folk you know well. Nostalgia floods back of the times spent with your kin and friends, and your first tastes of the power you'd someday hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lumber along the paths, and after some hours you see that the path forks ahead. You know from experience that they both lead to Rorikstead, but after time they've both changed. Whether you go high or go low you know both hold danger you must confront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first path to the right seems to be a pass, and your experience in travels tells you it's the perfect site for a bandit to ambush travelers. You think of how best to approach the situation, and decide if you take that route you'd be trying to find their camp and flip the usual narrative so that your prey is on the defensive. Bandits are used to being the one with the element of surprise, and usually fall into the fatal error of hesitating when they lose it from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second seems worn in a way you faintly recognize, but easier to tell is the potent musky scent coming from ahead. There's no doubt about it that giants and their mammoths are down that ways. You nearly catch your mind drifting at the thought of a massive man thrashing within your form, and your body already churns from how long it's been since you had slain one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decision awaits as to what your next fight will be...</span></div></div>",

Shouldn't the Companians protect innocent people? Oh well, you think, nobody will notice one innocent life lost. <br>\r\nYou spring from your hinging spot, pouncing on the man. He screams, but not before an enormous wolffish jaw closes in over his head. He struggles, but after only a couple powerful gulps, he slides into your belly where numerous humans, animals and others have met their end. <br>\r\nWith a smile you pat your screaming belly, but the satisfied feeling is short lived. <br>\r\n\"A werewolf!\"<br>\r\n\"A werewolf! To arms!\"<br>\r\nSeveral Whiterun guards have spotted you and sprint up the hill, swords drawn. You growel as you feet the first man, imidiatly catching him in your maw and sending him down to your belly with ease. Guards left alive would tell of what happend here, and bodies would be a giveaway. In each of your massive hands your grab an attacking guard and stuff them both in your mouth. A gulp, hard belch and you're on to the next frightened man. He attempts to block your vorocious onslaught with a shield, but it shatters in your mighty maw, dooming him down into your belly. <br>\r\nYou're beginning to enjoy yourself as you cram in two more guards, and then a third. The remaining guard  flees, but you catch one in your powerful arm. He is pulled back into your gaping mouth, which snaps shut as he too slides down your throat. <br>\r\nYou sit with your back against a tree, belly gurgling, groaning and churning its contents. The screams and shouting begin to subside as the struggling slows. Several hours later, you awake from your slumber to find yourself under a great deal of pressure. <br>\r\nBehind a huge tree you squat and relive yourself. The hide and cloth of armor and clothing broke down entirely in your stomach, only some metal armor and bones remain. The pile is massive, a slew of skulls and femurs, ribs and other bones. <br>\r\nIt was an honor to feed such a powerful beast. </span></div></div>",

However, before you had even made it a mile into the forest, you would come across a road, which let to a small village. Unfortunately for you, a patrol of guards came by just as you came out of the forest. Normally they would have just ignored you and continued on their way, but the recent bandit attacks made them weary of strangers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!
