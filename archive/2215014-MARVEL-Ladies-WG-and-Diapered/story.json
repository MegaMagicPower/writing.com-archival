New Mutants member Karma had been possessed by Xavier's old enemy Shadow King. During this time, his overindulging habits rendered Karma immobility obese. The X-Men and New Mutants had successfully rescued and brought Karma home. Now, Professor X and Fantastic Four member Reed Richards were trying to find a way to help Karma while the X-Men dealt with Shadow King's remaining forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, \"C'mon Kitty! What's the harm of one more bite?\" Karma was complaining as Kitty \"Shadowcat\" Pryde held a large slice of pizza away from her while her body was being partially phased in Karma's gut and one hand phased in her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the last four bites you took wiped out eight extra-extra large pizzas! I think that's enough snack time, Karma.\" Kitty explained gently. At that moment, Storm arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, the team is mobilizing to take on what's left of Shadow King's organization. I need you to stay here and look after Karma.\" She said. \"Easier said than done!\" Kitty retorted as she and Karma kept struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the others left, Karma stopped struggling. \"It's just not fair! I can't help it that I'm always hungry nowadays!\" She pointed out sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to find a way to curb your appetite somehow. I'm sure the Professor and Dr. Richards'll come up with a plan.\" Kitty said reassuringly as she walked away. Karma frowned in dismay as Kitty did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll never understand. I'll just have to make her understand!\" she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Biting her lip in concentration, Karma used her powers to implant some of her enormous hunger into Kitty. As this happened, Kitty froze, her eyes becoming purple in color, the way anyone's Karma used her powers on did. She then turned back to the fridge in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMM!! Let the snacking continue!\" She smiled, licking her lips as she grabbed a carton of ice cream and poured it into her mouth while grabbing another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma smirked as Kitty kept eating. Slowly, but surely, Kitty's belly started swelling up. As it got bigger and bigger, her costume's shirt started ripping open, exposing her jumbo belly. Her face also grew rounder as her body also bloated up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Karma's delight turned to fear as Kitty started hogging the foods and drinks for herself. After eating the second ice cream carton in the same manner as the previous one, Kitty started guzzling down a large bottle of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP* *GULP* *GULP* Kitty gulped very loudly, letting out a large burp after she finished. \"H-Hey! Save some for me!\" Karma wailed in alarm. Kitty grinned and, waddling slightly now, handed Karma some red velvet cake while keeping the rest to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's much better.\" Karma smiled as she ate her slices, growing bigger as well. Kitty just smiled and buried her face into the rest of the large cake, eating like a pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours seemed to just fly by as the duo ate and ate and ate and ate and ate. Finally, Karma was much bigger than before and Kitty was getting closer to being the same size as her friend. Karma, however, didn't want her too. She only wanted Kitty to know hunger and not end up immobile as her. \"I'd better take my hunger out of her otherwise she's gonna need help movin' around too.\" she decided as Kitty devoured an entire basket of large buttery biscuits in one go, her belly now hanging over the waistband of her tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

I'd better look in on her and Karma...\" Ororo decided as she headed for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, she couldn't believe it. Karma was now much larger and she wasn't the only fat one in the kitchen now. A very bloated Shadowcat was eating like crazy, her belly jiggling as she did so and she didn't even seem to notice her obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?!?!? Karma? What's happened to Kitty?!?!?\" Ororo demanded to know in disbelief as Kitty devoured an entire ham in just a few bites before loudly chugging more soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted Kitty to experience the same hunger I've been facing so I gave her some of mine. Don't worry. I'm gonna take it out of her right... now!\" Karma explained as she quickly pulled her hunger from Kitty. The second she did, Kitty let out a large burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUURRRRRRPPPPPP!!* Ugh... man, what happened?\" Kitty groaned, rubbing her head. Then, she noticed her very large, squishy, jiggly belly poking out of her costume's jacket. Her hips and butt were also bigger, her face was round and doughy, her boobs had gone up a few sizes, her arms, legs, feet, hands, fingers and toes were all plump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Karma?!?!? What happened to me?!?!?\" She asked, poking her large belly, causing it to gurgle loudly. \"Um... well... I kinda used my powers to give some of my hunger to you.\" Karma sheepishly explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?!? You brainwashed me to become fat!?!?!?\" Kitty shrieked, only to clutch her belly as it rumbled ominously. \"No! I-I just wanted you to understand the level of hunger I'm facing right now! I mean, you pack food away like crazy and don't seem to either gain a pound or even think about it!\" Karma protested. \"I am sure her intentions were noble, Kitten. Though they were a bit misguided.\" Ororo said gently. Kitty frowned, but then sighed and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, Ororo. Karma, I'm sorry if I didn't understand your hunger pains. Boy, I sure do now! *Brrraaaapppp!*\" She smiled, letting out another giant burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you seemed to enjoy our pig out.\" Karma smiled. \"Yeah. Somethin's tellin' me I'm gonna need to have a few extra Danger Room sessions to lose this blubber.\" Kitty giggled, poking her gurgling, rumbling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure they will only be for a few weeks, Kitten. Then you'll be slim and trim again.\" Storm smiled. \"Would you like to start now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Kitty smiled. But then, *RUMBLE* *GURGLE* GLOOORRRRRPPPP* *SLOSH* *GGGURRRRGGGGLLLLEEE* Her belly let out five alarming tummy noises. \"Uh, actually Ororo\u2026 could I take a raincheck? My tummy's got other plans!\" Kitty whimpered. \"Certainly.\" Ororo smiled as Kitty, despite being rather bloated, turned and raced for the bathroom where Storm and Karma heard her puking a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Storm's theory about Kitty's dieting and exercising worked and Kitty was back to her slim, trim fighting form within two weeks. Though Kitty's new larger appetite remained, she was careful not to extremely overdo it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, the entire X-Men outright objected such a forced notion, but it wasn't something that even the famed heroes could do a thing about, for it was the choice that Kitty's parents had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with sorrow in her heart, Kitty was left with little alternative but to say a saddened farewell to the people she fondly referred to as her \"second family\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Present Day ==<br>\r\n== Two Weeks Later ==<br>\r\n== England ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding just outside of the local airport, Kitty, dressed in an overcoat with a fashionable hat, holding her suitcase in both hands, as the stereotypical English rain downpour around her. The emotional baggage of unwillingly leaving the people she called family still fresh in her mind's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as to what brought here all the way to Jolly ol' England... Apparently, her parents received an invitation for their daughter to attend a rather prestigious school known as <i>\"The Academy of the Order of the Friars of Saint Francis of Wycombe\"</i>, or simply abbreviated as <i>\"The Wycombe Academy\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Kitty was initially reluctant to attend this new school, thinking that there was something shady about the whole thing, but she had to reluctantly comply at to her parents' behest to attend, which lands her in her current situation at present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen thirty minutes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally an hour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eventually, she was greeted by the arrival of a pristine antiquated limousine. It stopped only just a few feet away from her, to which the chauffeur promptly opened the rear door to allow it's passenger to exit the elegant vehicle.

Aren't you such an adorable cherub?\" She chirped, taking note of the young Pryde's adorably petite physique, a subtle twinkle in her sapphire blue eyes. Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, Kitty took a substantially long moment or two, gazing over the entire physical appearance of the woman standing before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the blonde woman had this air of <i>\"Nobility\"</i> and <i>\"Elegancy\"</i> to her, especially with her all-white ensemble and flowing ivory cape with the fur collar around her shoulders. However, in contrast to the woman's choice of attire, there was a far more notable aspect about her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight and overall size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Kitty would guess, the woman had to at least weigh in at approximately the four-hundred pound mark, with nary a sign of dimpling or unsavory blemish in sight. The woman had these wealthy plump breasts, which pressed against her corset-like one-piece clothing, which was only surpassed by the woman's substantial yet matronly boulder of a belly. However, Kitty couldn't help but feel like something felt...<i>off</i>, regarding what she was wearing underneath such expensive clothing, but it was a mere thought for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...E-Excuse me? Are...A-Are you Miss Emma Frost? The headmistress of the, um...\" Kitty stammered, looking back at the brochure to properly ascertain the school's full name then continued, \"...The Academy of the Order of the Friars of Saint Francis of Wycombe? ...I-I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> It is quite alright, my dear.\" Emma retorted, reassuring the younger woman of her shyness, to which she then performed a small curtsy and elaborated, \"...And to answer your question, I am indeed Emma Frost. Headmistress of Wycombe Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like a lioness circling it's prey, Emma Frost looked over Kitty  from nearly every angle with eyeing curiosity, to which she then asked, \"...And if I must wager a guess, you must be the lovely Katherine Pryde, are you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-Yes. Yes I am, Miss Frost. B-But...M-My friends call me \"Kitty Pryde\". If, um...I-If that's okay with you.\" She timidly answered, obviously feeling a little tense due to being examined in such a manner by a person she had no familiarity with. Of course, Emma Frost couldn't help but become quite amused with the young woman, to which she then reassured, \"Quite the adorable name, my dear. And please...You can call me \"Emma\", if it makes you feel more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...O-Okay.\" Kitty complied, and like a mother coddling her child, Emma Frost calmly and gently guided Kitty towards the limousine as she said, \"...Do not fret, my dear Kitty. I'm most certain you will be quite at home in Wycombe Academy. Now, what do you say we get out of the rain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I would like that.\" Kitty answered, being personally escorted by the rotund Emma Frost. However, she couldn't figure out what exactly was making all these <b>*rustling*</b> and <b>*crinkling*</b> noises, despite being in close proximity with said sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Emma Frost allowed Kitty to enter the vehicle first, only to then enter inside herself, making sure her elegant ivory cape was not caught when the door was closed. And with that, the chauffeur proceeded to return to the driver's seat to escort his charges back to the illustrious Wycombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Kitty couldn't believe how...extravagant, it was inside the limo. Looking at her interior surroundings, she soon noticed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though, it was there that Kitty Pryde soon caught a gaze at the newest individual in proximity within the luxury vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her appearance and vocal accent, Kitty could very easily tell that this person was undoubtedly Scottish, sporting a short mane of fiery red hair, as well as an equally heavyset physique, albeit not as vast as the headmistress, but enough to be distinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, instead of a lavish ensemble like Emma Frost, the Scottish redhead wore a one-piece schoolgirl-esque uniform, complete with a plaid skirt. Speaking of the lavishly dressed Emma Frost, she soon sat beside Kitty, just as the limousine began to move, to which the rotund blonde then quipped, \"Come now, Rahne. Surely, you haven't forgotten about the arrival of your new roommate already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roommate?\" Kitty questioned, initially flabbergasted at how she was going to have a roommate, only for the ivory-dressed woman to compensate, \"My sincerest apologies, Katherine! I should've told you sooner! Anywho, allow me to introduce you to your new roommate-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rahne Sinclair's me name! So...\" Rahne interjected, to which she then got really close to Kitty, whilst the sudden <b>*crinkling*</b> filled Kitty's hearing once more, as the feisty redhead then blurted, \"...Whit kinda d'you hae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\" She rebutted, becoming quite confused as to what exactly she was talking about. Meanwhile, Emma Frost couldn't help but chuckle some from Rahne's feisty curiosity, obviously finding amusement towards the Scot girl's child-like wonder. Of course, she soon stepped in and retorted, \"Again my apologies, Katherine. Though, to put it simply...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Emma Frost began to use her telepathic abilities to converse with Kitty, as she telepathically continued, \"...She is simply curious about your Mutant abilities is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reaction, Kitty was completely taken by surprise, quickly putting two and two together, which ultimately culminated in her gleefully yelping, \"You...Y-You're Mutants! You're just like me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> Indeed we are, Katherine.\" Emma replied, a plump gloved hand gesturing over towards Rahne, only for Kitty to bear witness to a surprising metamorphosis. In appearance, Rahne's body began to take on more lupine features, as reddish-brown fur began to grow and sprout from every part of her body, which gave her short fiery red hair to look more akin to an exaggerated wolven mane. Her teeth sharpened into a pair of lupine fangs, as her fingernails became a pair of claws on each hand, along with a short canine tail floofing out from behind, with her legs becoming digitgrade to cap it all off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Kitty couldn't help but be amazed by the sight before her, as Rahne mock howled at an imaginary moon to sell the look, to which Emma then coyly teased, \"Down, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever ye say, Teach!\" Rahne complied, just as swiftly reverting back to her human form, where it was soon Kitty Pryde's turn to speak, with only astonishment in her voice while she asked, \"This is amazing! But...I-I don't understand, Miss Frost. Are you like Professor Xavier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> ...In a way. I suppose you can say I am England's equivalent of Charles Xavier, my dear Katherine. Right down to being the proud owner and headmistress of an illustrious academy, no less. Now...\" She explained, laying the truth the bear before Kitty, to which she then presented a bountiful spread of cuisines before the brunette and politely asked, \"...Would you like something suitable to eat? I have a guess that the food provided to you on the plane wasn't as substantial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess it would be rude to refuse. Sure, I'll bite!\" Kitty chirped, grabbing a few steaming scones, taking a bite out of them one after the other. \"Mmm! These are pretty good!\" She chirped, her tastebuds soaking in the delectable taste of the scones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst Kitty was busy stuffing her gullet, Emma Frost watched as the baked treats began to slowly work on Kitty's systems, mentally noting to herself, <i>\"Hmm... She has begun to eat them. Excellent. And don't worry, my dear. I'm sure you'll become...\"acquainted\", with the new meat on your bones in due time, along with a surprise or three as well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Emma Frost blocked her mind off from having her agenda revealed to Kitty Pryde, who appeared as if she was in a gluttonous trance, scarfing down several handfuls of sweets at a near breakneck pace. Of course, such binging was bound to show itself on the young Pryde's physical form, as her stomach began to slowly but surely bloat and expand outwards, yet not enough to stick out a great deal to be conspicuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Emma contemplated how this school year will be quite...<i>\"unique\"</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wise men would say that <i>\"A lot can transpire in the span of a week\"</i>. Though, she certainly didn't expect THESE kinds of changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of it good, while some of it was legitimately bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first arrived at Wycombe Academy, the first thing she noticed right off the bat was how...<i>\"Substantially endowed\"</i> all the female students and some of the female staff were, along with unsubtle hints of what could be underneath their specifically designed attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't all bad. After all, she and Rahne quickly became fast friends, not just outside of class. Plus, Kitty soon found out that she was transferred into a school for Mutants, similar to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, but in England. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, much to her own personal shame, Kitty began to experience this bad case of bedwetting, always waking up with soaked bedsheets. At first, she tried to disguise this source of shame from her new best friend/roommate out of attempting to preserve her personal dignity. Of course, having the abilities of a wolf, Rahne was easily able to discover her bestie's wetting predicament. In fact, they made a deal regarding Kitty's \"issue\", as the young Pryde recalled her friend's words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look, Kitty. I understand the shame of wetting the bed, so I'm not going to judge ye. However, if it starts getting bad, we're gaunnae hae to blether this to Headmistress Frost aboot yer...\"issue\". Okay?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the bedwetting wasn't the only change in her daily regiment she had undergone, as Kitty stood before her pee-stained bedsheets, now sporting a somewhat chubbier physique, complete with a small but developing potbelly, fuller breasts, plumper butt, and the subtle beginnings of a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there in her nightgown, with her panties dampened some in the front. Suffice to say, it felt rather embarrassing for her. Fortunately, her new best friend was there to console her, to which the redheaded Scottish Mutant then asked, \"Dae ye want to head to Miss Frost's office, lassie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Headmistress Emma Frost's Office ==<br>\r\n== 10 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, within the bowels of her personal office, adorned with numerous trophies and shelves full of works of literature, Emma Frost was looking over some of the student records, inspecting to see if their educational grades were up to snuff, a plump gloved finger tapping against the mahogany oaken surface of her lavish study. That is until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Knock!*<br>\r\n*Knock!*<br>\r\n*Knock!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a series of rattling knocks at her double doors, to which she promptly answered, \"You may enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with such permission granted, Rahne and Kitty soon entered their Headmistress's proverbial lair, with Rahne hauling in the rolled-up bedsheet from Kitty's bed slung over her shoulder. From there, the duo swiftly closed the doors behind them to allow some privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Emma Frost soon diverted her full attention upon the two roommates, keenly gazing upon them with intent, to which she chirped, \"Ah, Miss Pryde and Miss Sinclair! To what do I owe the pleasure from you two lovely ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Teach... We hae to blether to ye aboot something. It's important.\" Rahne retorted, her Scottish slang prevalent as ever. From there, she then unfurled the bedsheet before the heavyset headmistress, thus revealing the full truth to the leader of Wycombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see your point, Miss Sinclair. I take it that this is your bedsheet, Katherine?\" Emma calmly hypothesized, to which Kitty reluctantly and timidly nodded her head in confirmation, obviously quite embarrassed by her current predicament, meekly uttering, \"...Y...Y-Yes, Miss Frost. I...I-I-I don't know wh-what's going on w-with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing her newest student feeling so ashamed of herself, Emma calmly stood up from her wheeled chair, waddled over towards the embarrassed Kitty, to which the <b>*crinkling*</b> sounds filled the air once more. From there, she placed her plump gloved hands upon Kitty's shoulders, then quickly pulled her into a matronly embrace, akin to a mother coddling her child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I am terribly sorry for this, my dear. You have my utmost sympathies.\" She caringly whispered, showing her sympathy towards the young girl. But then, as if it was preordained in her mindset, the bloated blonde, now with a reassuring smile across her lips, looked back at Kitty and said, \"...You know, I believe I may have a solution to your <i>predicament</i>, my dear. ...If you are willing to make a few necessary changes to your lifestyle, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, Kitty swiftly looked back at the headmistress, a glimmer of hope in her eyes, to which she instinctively hugged Emma Frost, despite her arms not fully reaching around the woman's body, and chirped, \"Thankyouthankyouthankyou!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, if it will allow you to be more at ease, please follow me.\" The larger woman quipped, to which Kitty followed suit, unaware of what the headmistress had in mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 5 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, after waiting out in her study, Rahne was soon re-greeted by the return of Emma Frost and Kitty Pryde. However, the Scottish redhead easily noticed what was newly different about her new bestie, as Kitty fidgeted a bit in her new puffy undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...M-Miss Frost? Are...A-Are you sure about these...<i>things</i>? They're very bulky.\" She asked, noting with clear clarity at how thick and padded the diaper she now wore actually was, as she could easily feel how the padding positioned between her legs forcibly pushed her legs apart some, giving her a semi-noticeable waddling gait, as well as making her butt appearing to have doubled in size.</span></div></div>",

I have quite the hunch that you will need them as a necessity.\" Emma Frost answered, coyly patting Kitty's newly diapered behind twice or thrice, which explicitly enticed a beet red blush of embarrassment upon the brunette's fuller face, obviously not used to having such cumbersome undergarments before, not since she was a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye! Indeed ye will, Kitty!\" Rahne quipped, obviously trying to reassure her bestie that wearing such bulky diapers wasn't all bad as she thinks it will be, to which she cheekily handed Kitty a more <i>fitting</i> Academy uniform. Of course, Kitty then reluctantly shrugged, as she then began to undress out of her nightgown in order to don her school attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...With all due respect, Miss Frost, but...A-Are these REALLY necessary? Something feels...<i>off</i>.\" Kitty asked, as she began to equip the one-piece uniform shirt onto her body, still feeling a bit uneasy considering what was transpiring. However, becoming rather sympathetic towards the younger brunette's apprehension of the whole situation, Emma let out a empathetic sigh, then inevitably confessed, \"<b>*sigh*</b> ...Well, I suppose it won't do harm to tell you the truth, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...What are you talking about?\" She questioned, becoming rather confused as to what exactly Emma was going on about, only to then feel the bloated blonde waddle over to her to do up the button flap on her onesie-like uniform shirt. From there, while she carefully and properly dressed Kitty, Emma Frost then calmly elaborated, \"Now, I'm not entirely sure how to properly put this into words, but...Katherine; This school...has a curse attached to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cursed? Come on, Miss Frost. There are no such thing as curses.\" Kitty scoffed, as she felt the larger woman button up the diaper flap on her onesie-esque shirt, thinking that the headmistress was pulling her leg. However, it was Rahne's turn to chime in as she chirped, \"I'm afraid it's naw wee ghost story laddies and lassies tell each other around the campfire. What dae ye think we're wearing under our uniforms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing what her best friend and roommate just told her, Kitty was struck with a surprising revelation, her noting the crinkly bulges around the waistlines of both the headmistress and her bestie, hearing the enciting <b>*rustle*</b> and <b>*crinkle*</b> noises from the motions made by both individuals chafing about. Finding the right words to say to them, Kitty eventually spoke up and questioned, \"...H-How long has it been like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Emma looked back towards the diapered Kitty Pryde, to which she promptly responded to her question via plainly answering...</span></div></div>",

Finally, she looked at Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So is that why we gotta wear-\" she began, nodding to her thick diaper. Emma and Rahne both nodded. \"I'm afraid so, Katherine. Ever since new students arrived, we have been plagued by bedwetting and messing ourselves, myself included.\" Emma confessed gently, nodding to her large diaper. Kitty didn't say anything as she poked her diaper through her onesie uniform. Then, she turned to her roommate, classmate and bestie. \"R-Rhane, was it this bad for you?\" She asked. Rahne smiled and nodded gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye. I was barely here for two weeks a'fore me bladder stared actin' up. In fact, I wet meself five times in classes a'fore I came ta Miss. Frost here for help. I've been in these nappies for a year now since I started attendin' this school.\" Rahne confessed, her diaper crinkling loudly. Kitty just looked at the duo, clearly still trying to figure things out. While she still didn't fully believe in curses, she did know this one was apparently all too real. \"W-will it remain after I leave here?\" She finally asked. Emma and Rahne both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid so, Kitty. I thought when we leave for holidays and whatnot, it would fade away. But I was proven wrong after Christmas my first year here when the girls and teachers all revealed that they had wet and pooped themselves repeatedly, forcing them to keep their diapers on at all times, unless they managed to reach the loo or were already in it.\" Emma explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but curses can be broken, can't they? W-what if we learn how the curse came to be and if it can be destroyed?\" Kitty offered. But both Rahne and Emma shook their heads. \"I fear it would not work, Katherine. We have been trying for a year to figure out the curse and it's weaknesses, but have come up with nothing.\" Emma confessed gently. Kitty honestly felt like bawling her eyes out. She was just 13 and a half, she couldn't need diapers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Emma looked at the clock. \"And on that note, girls, I do believe it is time for breakfast. The cafeteria is making lots of good food and I cannot stand missing a meal.\" she smiled kindly, putting a hand on Kitty and Rahne's shoulders and steering them for the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goody. I'm so starved I could eat a horse!\" Rahne smiled eagerly. Kitty nodded in agreement, her potbelly gurgling in equal hunger. Though, secretly, Kitty was wondering about the curse and how worse it would get as she stayed at Wycombe.</span></div></div>",

I mean... I'm going to be turning fourteen. I shouldn't be needing to wear diapers. Why is this happening?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Earth to Kitty! C'mon lassie!\" Rahne chirped, quickly noticing how much her roommate was involuntarily spacing out, to which she responded by shapeshifting her hand into a lupine claw-like hand, using her now canine fingernails to emit an even louder finger snap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it was more than enough to easily snap the distracted Kitty Pryde back to terra firma, as the chubby diapered brunette instinctively blinked twice and thrice in initial confusion and stammered, \"Huh? Wha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye alright, Kitty? Ye were spacin' out on me.\" Rahne asked, showing obvious concern toward her bestie, placing a hand on the girl's shoulder. In response, with the audible <b>*crinkling*</b> noises emanating from her own bulky diaper filling her ears, Kitty blushed and ultimately confessed, \"...I-I'm sorry, Rahne. It's just that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-You're naw used to what's gonna happen? <b>*sigh*</b> Aye, I ken whit yer sayin', lassie. If it helps, ye willnae be alone when ye hae to gang.\" She answered, giving off a rather reassuring posture towards her friend, which seemed to be quite effective in putting Kitty at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you, Rahne.\" Kitty spoke, thanking her friend in the process, to which they wen on their merry way towards the Cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Wycombe Academy Cafeteria ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the Cafeteria, amongst the rabble and gossip of the other round pamper-wearing schoolgirls, one student sat by her lonesome, as if she was waiting for some friends of her's. In appearance, much like the headmistress herself, the teen girl sported a flowing mane of straight golden blonde hair, with shimmering blue eyes. However, much like the entire student body and school staff, she too wasn't spared from sporting a more chubbier physique and equally padded undergarments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she was in the midst of devouring a platter full of jelly-filled sprinkled donuts for breakfast, only to then hear an all too familiar voice, \"Oi! Illy! Yoo-Hoo!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few tables across from her, she easily became aware of a certain Scottish Mutant's greeting, to which she responded by turning her head briefly as if to non-verbally say, <i>\"Get over here.\"</i>, to which they complied with such an answer, waddling their way over to where she was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, they sat before the heavyset blonde, carrying their own assortment of sweets and edibles upon two trays for each of them. Of course, during her first week here at Wycombe, Rahne first introduced Kitty to one of her other friends, Illyana Rasputin. However, Kitty soon found out that Illyana was actually the younger sister of one of her friends back at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters; Peter Rasputin, also known as \"Colossus\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, upon hearing of this, Illyana was relieved to hear that her brother was doing quite well over in America, which garnered a great deal of respect towards the young Pryde. Obviously, Illyana gave off a warming smile towards Kitty, which showed how close they've became as friends, only to then resume her binge assault on the small hill of cuisines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to strike up a friendly conversation with her, Kitty spoke towards Illyana, taking a bite out of some blueberry pancakes as well, and said, \"So, Illyana...How's it going with your training? Learned any new skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not much, Kitty. Though, I did learn how to deflect energy blasts with my sword...\" She replied, bearing a thick Russian accent, which made Kitty feel a little nostalgic in regards to Colossus. After all, despite the man's Mutant abilities of Super Strength and being to turn his skin into a flexibly hard steel-like tissue, he was a rather \"Gentle Giant\" as it were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Kitty was actually surprised when she first saw Illyana's Mutant ability to harness and use magic, thus garnering her the now-famous nickname \"Magik\", with the word having a \"K\" instead of a \"C\" in it. Overall, much like her nickname's namesake, Kitty became rather curious with Illyana's more supernatural abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the trio conversed for about half an hour, including the part where Kitty was now in diapers just like them, to which Illyana offered her sincerest sympathies.

The three girls headed to the school's large gym where Betsy was waiting for them. Like most of the staff and girls, Miss. Braddock was rather obese, weighing in around 350 pounds, though she still had somewhat of a hourglass figure. She had purple hair and, like most of the staff, wore a thick diaper under her uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class. Today I've decided we would go for a mile jog around campus. Don't worry, I won't be keeping time so if you need to stop, you may and as long as you at least run most of the mile, you'll get your points.\" Betsy smiled as she grabbed her clipboard and led the girls out. Once they'd warmed up, Psylocke blew her whistle to start the mile. At first, Kitty did surprisingly well, despite her slightly cumbersome waddling run due to her new diaper. However, by the half mile mark, she was wheezing and panting heavily, sweat rolling down her face. By the time the mile was finished, Kitty was among only three girls to have made it all the way. The other two being Rahne and Illyana. The second they finished, the trio flopped onto the ground, gasping, panting and moaning in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha'... was... bloody... hell!\" Rahne gulped, her tongue lolling out like a wolf as she panted heavily. \"I... agree. I... wish... Miss. Braddock would... let me... just teleport with... my... portals.\" Illyana groaned, laying on her back. \"Man... I probably... shouldn't've eaten... those last... 10 blueberry... pancakes. My belly's killing me.\" Kitty moaned in agreement. Psylocke waddled over with a smile. \"Well done, lassies. You completed the mile in good time.\" She said. Then she turned to the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies. Tomorrow we'll take an off day as most of you did manage to do most of the mile today. Let's head back in and get ready for your next class!\" She called. Huffing, puffing and groaning, the girls all started waddling to the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it lunchtime yet?\" Rahne asked hopefully. Kitty looked at her watch. \"Nope. It's only 7:50, Rahne.\" Kitty confessed with a smile as Illyana laughed as they waddled after their classmates. \"Blast. I was hopin' ta sink me teeth into a juicy hamburger with cheese, pickles, ketchup, mustard, onion and bacon!\" Rahne groaned. Both Kitty and Illyana moaned in delight at the thought, their bellies rumbling in equal delight. \"Now you've done it, Rahne. How're we gonna focus on our next few lessons while we're waitin' for lunch?\" Kitty playfully teased her bestie as they changed into their uniforms, having reached the locker room. \"Sorry Kitty. It's jost that I'm starvin'.

Nicknamed \"Domino\" due to her black and white hair and white face with a black spot over one eye, she was a fairly cool teacher in Kitty's eyes. Similar to Emma and Psylocke, Domino was obese and diaper clad. Unlike most of the teachers and students, she wore only a t-shirt and her thick diapers in class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, Rahne and Illyana all found their seats at the front of the class and Domino waited until the other girls were ready before beginning her lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning girls. Today we'll be covering basic geometry and algebra. Don't worry if you don't get it, I'll be happy to help you.\" she smiled kindly as she wrote a few problems on the board. The hour passed fairly quickly, with Kitty and the girls working on the problems Domino had written down for them. Finally, the bell rang and the girls got ready for their next class. \"Okay, remember girls, there'll be a quiz in two weeks so study hard!\" Domino called as they left with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty waddled with Illyana and Rahne to her next class, she let out a giant fart. \"Och! Kitty! That reeks!\" Rahne protested playfully, shoving her bestie's shoulder. Kitty blushed as she then froze, a look of pain on her face. \"Kitty? Are you alright?\" Illyana asked with concern. Kitty bent over, clutching her stomach as she squatted and started straining and grunting. A second later, with a very loud *POOOOOOOTTTTTTTTT!!!!* she pushed a large, hot, sticky and smelly load of poop into her diaper. After she finished, Kitty stood up and, upon noticing several girls looking at her aside from her besties, she went deep red. Without a word, she turned and raced away, tears of humiliation pouring down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn't stop running until she reached her and Rahne's dorm room and, not even bothering with her full diaper, flopped face first onto her bed and started bawling her eyes out with loud sobs. After a few minutes, there was a knock on the door. \"Katherine, may I come in?\" Emma Frost's voice asked gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty sniffled and sat up, whining as she felt her poop squish against her plumper butt. \"C-Come *hic* in, Miss. Frost.\" she hiccupped sadly. Emma slowly waddled inside and smiled gently as she saw Kitty's bulging, poopy diaper. \"W-what's wrong?\" Kitty asked. Emma smiled as she sat down next to Kitty. \"Miss. Sinclair and Miss. Rasputin just told me what happened on your way to your next class. Are you alright?\" she explained with concern. Kitty hiccupped again before shaking her head in dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. I'm s-so e-embarrassed! I-I haven't pooped my pants since I was three! And now I j-just took a major dump in- in front of e-everyone!\" Kitty sobbed, burying her face in her hands as she kept crying. Emma gently rubbed Kitty's back reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright, Kitten. Everybody here has had a similar accident in or before a class since this curse began. I actually anticipated you would poop your diaper before or during lunch today.\" She confessed. Kitty looked at her, tears still rolling down her chubby face. \"R-really?\" she asked with one more hiccup. Emma nodded and gently hugged Kitty like a mother would a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright, Kitty. According to Miss. Rasputin, everybody was only staring out of sympathy. Not amusement or anger at you.\" She revealed. Kitty smiled despite her teary eyes. It cheered her up that her friends weren't laughing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why don't you change your nappy and take a nap? Tonight, I would like to have you eat with me in my private quarters.\" Emma smiled. \"Okay.\" Kitty sniffled as she got up and took her full diaper off and started cleaning up. \"I will tell your next few teachers that you wanted to lay down after your accident. They will understand since, like I said, this has happened before.\" Emma said reassuringly as she waddled out. \"Thanks, Miss. Frost.\" Kitty said as she taped her new diapee on and got dressed again. She then sunk onto her bed and decided on following Emma's advice about taking a nap before dinnertime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, Rahne and Illyana came in to check on Kitty as she woke up. Rahne's diaper was bulging and smelly while Illyana's was soaking wet and bulging with poop as well. \"'Ow're ya doin' Kitty?\" Rahne asked her bestie. Kitty smiled at her friend's concern. \"I'm doing much better. Thanks.\" she smiled. \"Miss. Frost told us you were having dinner with her tonight so we should make sure you don't eat too much. She said she's having the chiefs make a really big dinner a'fore the two o' ya.\" Rahne added with a smile. Kitty grinned as she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was lunch?\" she asked, having slept through it. \"It was good. Turns out Rahne's prediction about it being hamburgers was right. She pretty much licked her tray clean and you can smell the result in her diaper!\" Illyana joked with a smile. Rahne smirked and stuck her tongue out. \"Well, at least I didn't flood me nappy with pee like you did after a-drinkin' four cans of lemonade and soda!\" she retorted. Illyana blushed slightly. \"Yeah, that might not have been a good idea.\" she agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just giggled at her two besties playful jeering of each other. \"When did Miss. Frost say I should head down for dinner?\" Kitty asked after a moment as her two besties started getting changed into cleaner diapers. \"She said ye could drop in at anytime, lass.\" Rahne smiled as she finished putting a clean diaper on. Kitty nodded and, upon looking at her alarm clock, saw it was 5:56 P.M. \"Guess I should probably go now.\" she smiled nervously as she stood up. Rahne and Illyana both smiled assuredly to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinna fast yerself, Kitty. We've both had dinner with teach a'fore an' it's actually very nice.\" Rahne said as she hugged Kitty, their diapers crinkling loudly as they were pressed together. Kitty nodded, waved goodbye and waddled off to meet Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Kitty took a deep breath and did so. There was Miss. Frost, already seated at a large oak table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss. Pryde. Glad to see that you could make it.\" said Emma with a grin. Kitty nervously sat down across from Emma, her face stating that she was clearly nervous. Emma just gently patted Kitty's hand with hers. \"It is alright, Katherine. I am not going to bite your head off. I have dined with students before.\" she pointed out. Kitty blushed and nodded sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Miss. Frost. I'm just a little jittery.\" Kitty apologized. \"Perfectly understandable, Kitty. Now, I hope you enjoy our dinner tonight.\" Emma smiled as the chiefs came out with several trays of food. Hamburgers, fried chicken, steak and lobster. As well as desserts such as cake, pie, doughnuts, eclairs and all kinds of yummy treats. Kitty was so hungry, she feared she was going to start drooling over the food. Emma giggled slightly at Kitty's reaction, causing the brunette to blush deeply again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's eat!\" Emma smiled as she grabbed a large plate and started piling food onto it. Kitty quickly did the same. Once she had loaded her plate to overflowing, she used her knife and fork to cut a piece of chicken. However, to her surprise, Emma was eating a drumstick with her hands, loudly tearing chunks of meat off the bone. Upon noticing Kitty's surprise, Miss. Frost swallowed and belched loudly before smiling kindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not hold you against eating like you normally do, Kitty. You must be hungry.\" Emma smiled sweetly. Kitty thought for a moment and then, dropping her fork and knife, grabbed her own drumstick and began tearing equally big chunks off it, sauce and grease smearing her face as she did. After that, she grabbed a large scone and crammed it into her mouth, chewing loudly as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it taste so far?\" Emma smiled. Kitty swallowed loudly before answering. \"This has gotta be the best meal I've ever had!\" She smiled truthfully. Unknown to the young girl, her belly was now beginning to expand more, slowly forming into a large potbelly. \"I am glad to hear it, Kitty. Now, let's eat it all before it gets cold.\" Emma smiled as she went back to stuffing her mouth with scones, burgers and other foods. Kitty nodded and quickly followed suit, cramming 3 cheeseburgers, four doughnuts and 6 scones into her mouth at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo didn't have speak anymore as they scarfed down the mountain of food like crazy. Manners were tossed out the window as they chugged, chomped, belched, hiccupped, slurped and licked their way ahead , slowly shrinking the feast down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the entire table was littered with empty plates, pie tins, pitchers and glasses. \"Well *BBBURRRRPPPP* that was a very fine meal.\" Emma smiled with a large burp as she rubbed her enormous tummy, which gurgled and sloshed happily. \"And how was your meal, Kitty?\" she asked the equally stuffed and happy 13 and a half year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPP* Definitely... really yummy... Emma...\" Kitty panted after letting out an even bigger burp than Emma just had. She gently poked her now genuine gut as it gurgled in delight at being so full. \"Do you feel better?\" Emma asked Kitty as, huffing and puffing, the duo managed to stand up, sweating slightly as they did. \"Yeah I do.\" Kitty grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo then slowly waddled to the door of Emma's office. \" You should probably get back to your dorm, Kitty. It's nearly curfew and I doubt you want to be in detention on your second week here.\" Emma smiled. \"Thanks *Buuuurrrraaaappp* again for the *hic* meal, Miss. Frost. It really was awesome!\" Kitty smiled with another loud burp, this time with a hiccup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm *urp* glad you *hic* enjoyed *burp* yourself Kitty *hiccup*. Now, head off to your dorm please.\" Emma smiled back, giving Kitty a fleeting hug before gently pushing Kitty towards the hallway. Kitty smiled, gave a wave, and waddled back to her dorm, burping loudly most of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRahne and Illyana were both waiting up for Kitty when she finally came in. \"Well, how'd it go, Kitty?\" Rahne asked kindly. \"It went really *uuuurrrrrpppp* well.\" Kitty smiled, unleashing another rumbling burp. \"We can see that.\" Illyana smirked, playfully poking her friend's tummy, causing poor Kitty to fart loudly again. \"Och! Seriously, Kitty. I think ya need ta see the nurse 'bout yon stinky booty!\" Rahne giggled teasingly. \"Maybe I should've passed on the baked bean burritos.\" Kitty agreed sheepishly, rubbing her belly as it gurgled and rumbled, happy to be full of such good food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio then talked for awhile before Illyana went to her dorm for the night. Rahne and Kitty got into their nightgowns, crawled into bed, bade each other goodnight and were soon sleeping soundly, Kitty often burping loudly in her sleep as she dreamed about food all night long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

A plate piled high with scones, a tray of doughnuts, a platter of pies, a giant platter of cinnamon rolls, a large chocolate cake, a tray of cupcakes and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... w-what is this, Miss. Frost?\" Kitty asked nervously as she eyed the banquet. Emma smiled as she sat down across from Kitty. \"This, my young lady, is a welcome present. I figured that that airplane food wouldn't be substantial. Would you like a bite?\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess it would be pretty rude to refuse. Sure, I'll bite!\" Kitty smiled, grabbing a few steaming scones. Upon tasting the first one, she started inhaling one after the other. \"Mmm! These're pretty good!\" Kitty chirped, her taste buds soaking in the delectable taste of the scones. Once she had licked the plate clean, she grabbed two chocolate glazed doughnuts and, ignoring Miss. Frost, shoved both into her mouth at once. With a rather loud gulp, she swallowed them almost whole before grabbing six more. Just as she started to inhale them, she noticed Emma watching with a smile. At this, Kitty blushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Um... I-I'm sorry, Miss. Frost. D-Do you w-want some?\" She asked sheepishly. Emma chuckled and shook her head. \"It is alright, Kitty. I already had lunch and I'm quite sure you can handle this banquet on your own.\" She smiled kindly. \"Okay.\" Kitty shrugged as she then stuffed the six doughnuts into her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Kitty, however, Emma Frost watched as the banquet started working on Kitty's systems, mentally noting to herself, \"Hmmm. She's begun to eat them. Excellent. And don't worry, my dear. I'm sure you'll become... 'acquainted' with the new weight on your bones in time. Along with a surprise or three as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, Emma had blocked her thoughts from having her agenda revealed to Kitty Pryde, who now seemed to be in a gluttonous trance, loudly scarfing down giant handfuls of sweets at a surprising pace. Of course, such binging was likely going to reveal itself on the young Pryde's physical form as her belly started to bloat and expand outward, not enough to stick out to be conspicuous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Emma anticipated this school year to be... \"interesting\". </span></div></div>",

Slowly she rubbed her eyes and looked around her own room. <br>\r\nWhen she first got here she did't really knew what to think. She was a mutant. Most people were't too fond of mutants. They made that very clear. Then she went living here. But to be honest it was't so bad here. This was her new home and to be honest she felt very good here. It felt like home. All other persons here felt like... well family. Sure there were rules, and if you broke them there was a chance you were punished but that's everywhere. <br>\r\nBut what was the best thing was that her powers were here not strange or different. Everyone here had powers. Perhaps not the same like her but still they had something special that made them 1 force. The X-men.<br>\r\nSlowly the young teen sat up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that was a good night sleep. Now I would like some breakfast. I gotta admit I'm pretty hungry. Like, don't you agree Rogue? Rogue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look at the bed of her roommate and saw it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she up already? Ah well. Like, it doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed some clothes, got dressed and walked downstairs. She walked right through the kitchen door and looked around. No one was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one here. Probably enjoying their free day. But breakfast totally is, like, the most important meal of the day, and I'm starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon grabbed some bread and made four peanut butter jelly sandwiches and a big glass of orange juice for herself and started her breakfast. The tasted pretty good. Soon the sandwiches disappeared in her belly. She let out a soft girly: \"burp!\" and giggled. But for some strange reason she noticed she was still hungry. She grabbed the box of cereal and poured a big bowl full of cereal, whole milk and also poured some sugar over it. She just liked cereal more when there was a lot of sugar on top of it. Some others told her that there was already sugar in the cereal but telling her that was a lost cause. She just liked it more with sugar. And with no body else around she could do all she liked without receiving criticism. But after her first bowl, she noticed she still didn't feel full and took a second bowl before she was really full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Guess I was more hungry then I thought. Ah well I'm a growing girl after all.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe lifted her shirt a bit and looked at her belly and slowly rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hmm. That feels good. Well I'm really full now.\"<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She was so lost in thoughts she bumped against Wolverine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch were you're going half pined.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry Wolverine. I was a bit lost in thoughts.

Sometimes a man just wants to be on his own without kids around him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked over her shoulder while Wolverine walked further. She had sometimes mixed thoughts about him. He sometimes acted a bit grumpy and sometimes had a bit of a temper, but at the same time she knew he could be very nice. He would never hurt her or the other kids around here. If someone would attack her or one of the other kids, she would almost feel sorry for that person. Wolverine would go totally berserk at that that person. So he was nice and friendly but did't always show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the living room . No one inside. She wondered why all the others were. Maybe outside playing. Well better for her. Then she could watch T.V without anyone else asking to change the channel. She watched T.V for about one and a half hour but suddenly noticed she was hungry again. She did't understand why. It was't like she did anything other then normal. She did't used anything. So why did she suddenly had such a big appetite. Perhaps puberty? Growth spurt? She must admit she would like it to grow a bit taller and got some more female curves.<br>\r\nShe walked into the kitchen and after looking around for some time she found three bars of chocolate, on box of cookies, two family sized bag of chips and a two liter bottle of coke. She carried it all back to the T.V. As soon as her butt hit the couch she started stuffing the first chocolate bar in her mouth. She quickly finished him and started on the second. After that one was gone she devoured the third one in a record time and drank some of the coke. after that she started on the cookies. Eating them one by one taking sips of coke every now and then. After they were gone she ripped open the first bag of chips and pushed them in her mouth. To much focused on the T.V shows to really notice how full she was getting. She even finished the second bag of chips. After that she emptied the bottle of coke and let out a huge belch.<br>\r\nThe teen laid lazy on the couch. Crumbs of cookies and chips around her mouth. Her belly a bit bloated thanks to her current snacks. She Finally turned the T.V of and looked at the empty box, two empty bags, some empty wrapper and one empty bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men did I eat all that? I did't even notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe she suddenly felt how full she really felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Now I believe I ate it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly lifted her shirt a bit showing her bloated belly. She pushed with her finger a bit in her belly button but finally started rubbing her belly and it did work. Slowly the full feeling got less. She lazy kept laying at the couch slowly she closed her eyes and fell asleep.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty slowly opened her eyes. Suddenly she remembered why she was in the living room. She saw the remains of her snacks. She fast stuffed the empty bags and wrappers in the empty box of cookies and threw it in the garbage bin. <br>\r\nShe'd really made a pig of herself. But no one had been around to see it so it didn't really matter. She brushed the crumbs off her face. She suddenly noticed all the crumbs on her shirt and a few chocolate stains. While she stuffed the chocolate bars in her mouth, some small pieces fell of and had melted causing some brown stains. She walked upstairs straight to her room. She pulled off her shirt and looked for a new clean one. A minute later she walked back downstairs in a clean shirt. <br>\r\nSuddenly Nightcrawler appeared in a cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kurt! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kitty. I just wanted to tell you we gonna have lunch. It's such nice weather so we decided to eat lunch outside. Do you come too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty thought about her recent snack. She really shouldn't. If she kept eating like this she would turn into a blimp in a few days. At the other hand she would like a bite to eat. How was that possible? She should have a tummy ache from eating so much food. Was something totally wrong with her? Perhaps she should ask Charles Xavier, or else Hank McCoy. <br>\r\nThey were both the two smartest people she knew. Or the smartest mutants. But according to Charles Xavier mutants were people who were just a bit more evolved. Perhaps one of them knew what was going on with her.<br>\r\nShe thought again about the lunch. Lunch did sound good and she didn't had a weight problem yet so one day of overeating wouldn't change that. Would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'll come too. Lunch sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later she came outside. Everyone was sitting at a table or on the field. One mutant ran around in her dog form with a sandwich between her jaws. She went sitting next to Kurt and grabbed two sandwiches and a glass of orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you been doing all day? I have't seen you?\" Rogue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing much. Watched some T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also made a total pig out of myself, she thought but she didn't say that. She stopped thinking that quickly since Jean or Xavier could hear that thought in her mind. However they probably wouldn't tell anyone. But still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Wolverine?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I've seen him. Don't go bother looking for him. He went away on his bike. If he doesn't want to be found... you don't find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you have someone who's good at following tracks. Like Sabretooth.\" Spyke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I really hate that guy. He's so scary and mean,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hate him?\" Kurt asked. \"That goes double for Wolverine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or even triple,\" Spyke said. \"Those two really hate each other.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty already finished her first two sandwiches and grabbed two more. She hoped no one would notice how much she consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her side and saw Scott and Jean in the shadow of a tree. Eating and kissing. She felt a bit jealous. She would also like it to have a boyfriend. Well you had Lance who seemed to like her. But she didn't like him. Every time when Lance was in a bad mood he made an earthquake. And his friends weren't really people she liked to hang out with. Especially Toad. He ate insects and had the hygiene of a dead pig. Also the place they lived looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages. What probably was the case.<br>\r\nShe sighed and grabbed another two sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Kitty. That are you fifth and sixth sandwich,\" Kurt said. \"Are you feeling all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess I'm just a little bit... hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I would touch you long enough\u2026 would I then also gain some of your weight, or only your appetite?\" Rogue asked with a naughty grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never find out, you rechargeable battery,\" Kitty said grinding her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after her sixth sandwich she stopped eating. She must admit she did start to feel full.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty walked to her room and sat on her bed. She was a bit angry at what Rogue said. Maybe Rogue just made a joke, but she said what Kitty was scared of. If she did keep eating like this she would lose her body for sure. She liked her body. Sure she would like it to have some more rounder female curves and to grow a few inches but she was slender and she was proud of that. She didn't want her flat stomach to turn into a overinflated beach ball. Then Rogue would really have something to laugh about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell down on her bed and looked at the ceiling, thinking about what could have caused her hunger. Puberty? Sure that could cause some hunger but not this much. Did she ate anything strange or drink something strange? She couldn't think of anything. Not anything she didn't had before. At least not that she could remember. But she wasn't sure. Of course if she knew this would happen she would have put a little more attention to what she had been eating and doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly her hand went right through her drawer and came back with a bag of candy. She liked it to chew on something when she was thinking. She kept pushing one piece of candy in her mouth after another and didn't notice how much she ate. At least not until she noticed the bag was empty. Had she eaten the entire bag? It had been pretty full. She looked at her alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This late already?  Better get down or I'll be late for dinner. Hm I could of course....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she faded right through her bed, through the floor and dropped out of the ceiling landing perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can go down being perfect on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly all other members gathered at the table for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for dinner?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turkey, mashed potatoes and green beans.\" Storm answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked with open mouth. She loved Turkey, and mashed potatoes. Green beans were fine but not special. Suddenly she knew the growing rumbly feeling in her belly. She wanted to eat. No! She wanted to pig out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPull yourself together Kitty she said to herself. You can't go making a pig of yourself. You're a human not a pig. She smiled a second at the thought that her name Kitty was also the name of a animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she did grab a lot of food. She was able to eat well mannered. Ate without dropping anything on her clothes. But the food went down pretty fast.Turkey with greasy gravy and mashed potatoes went down so fast she barely had time to chew.  After her first plate she took a second, and even a third. During her third plate she started noticing others were looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  She asked. \"Do I have something on my face?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling all right?\" Storm asked. \"This is already your third plate. Normally you never eat so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just love Turkey and mashed potatoes,\" Kitty mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You maybe do but your clothes don't,\" Rogue whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty wanted to give her a mean look but saw she had been right. Her belly was, thanks to all snacking and not yet digested food, pretty round and poked out between her pants and shirt. She blushed and hoped no one else had seen it. <br>\r\nAfter the last piece of food went past her lips she decided she was full for now. But she had't counted that Storm came with cake. She cut the cake in perfect slices. Kitty couldn't help herself. She grabbed with both hands a slice of cake and pushed them in her mouth. Suddenly she realized what she had done and looked around. Most people looked a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't think I'm feeling well. Sorry I... I'm going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she ran to her room she noticed she really didn't feel good. She had a terrible tummy ache. No wonder if you realized how much food  was in it. She felt terrible. Her belly made gurgling noises in protest of being so incredibly full. She was in so much pain. In her room she quickly unbuttoned her jeans. At least it took some of the pressure off her belly. But still she was in a lot of pain and was hearing constant gurgling noises from her belly. Suddenly she remembered how good it felt if she rubbed her belly. She put both hands on her belly and started rubbing. Her belly felt kind of hard, like a bag of wet cement. Probably because of all the food inside it. She started rubbing her round belly. It did feel good and the pain did become a bit less. She continued rubbing her belly. It felt so good she didn't even notice that she fell asleep.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Her belly rumbled and wanted food. Even after having a terrible tummy ache last night. But that was yesterday. That food had digested by now. She wanted food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be this hungry? I don't understand. I really need to ask the professor what's wrong with me. Or else Mr. McCoy. He's smart. But I'm so hungry. What should I do first? Hmmm, guess talking with the professor is easier on a full stomach. Besides it's not like he's going anywhere. I can take a breakfast and ask him afterwards. Good idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked downstairs. She hoped she didn't see anyone. She didn't liked her sudden hunger attacks but still she ate. But no body else needed to know that. She walked further and listened. She heard a lot of voices outside. Well it was a nice sunny day. Perhaps she could go swimming. If the water was warm enough. It would be a nice chance to wear her new bikini.<br>\r\nIn the kitchen she saw Wolverine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi Wolverine. How was yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine. Sometimes I just need to blow of some steam kiddo. But I need to work on my bike. If anyone needs me I'll be in the garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon if he left, she grabbed bread and peanut butter and jelly and made five peanut butter jelly sandwiches just for herself. She also poured in a tall glass of orange juice and fast stuffed the sandwiches in her mouth. They tasted good. She must admit that. That was why she was sad they were gone that fast. She decided to finish it with a few bowls of cereal with a lot of sugar. But instead of the two bowls from yesterday she ate three entire bowls. It seemed like it only got worse and worse everyday. This way she soon would be a blimp. <br>\r\nSuddenly she saw her belly poking out between her pants and shirt. She sometimes wore shirts that showed her belly but not in this way. And those times her belly was flat. Not round. She tried to pull her shirt down but it rode up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid shirt. I wish someone washed it in too hot water. But I know that's probably not what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran back to her room and looked in her closet for a bigger shirt. She soon found one made sure it hide her belly. She brushed her hair a bit and decided she looked presentable enough and ran downstairs.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw professor Xavier behind his desk and also Storm. Storm looked doubt full at her like if she knew something was wrong with her. She also saw Beast. It was sill a bit strange for her to see her old teacher with blue fur and claws but knew very well he had a heart made of gold and would rather fight with words and science then with his muscles. But if he needed to do that he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Kitty. Nice to see you. Why do you come to see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's about the cake don't worry,\" Storm said. \"I've made plenty more. Besides you seemed to feel bad after\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that. But I did feel bad afterwards but that's not it. I seemed to have suddenly since yesterday a huge appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's something to worry about Kitty. If you're hungry you just need to eat. You're a growing girl.\" Professor Xavier said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No professor! It's not just a bit more. It's a lot more! I seem to don't have control! It started yesterday,\" Kitty said and started a list about what she all had consumed yesterday until the two slices of cake and the terrible tummy ache afterwards. \"And today I woke up with a terrible hunger. I already ate five peanut butter jelly sandwiches and three bowls of cereal. Being a bit hungry I can understand that but this is not normal. Not for me. I have a small appetite. Now I have a appetite like The Blob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That is strange. It seemed you can suddenly eat about three times what you normally eat. Just suddenly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since yesterday morning. Could it have something to do with my mutant powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never heard mutant powers effect someones appetite. Except maybe like someone like The Blob. I don't see any reason why your body would suddenly want more food. Did you do or eat anything strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can think of no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it might have something to do with her mind,\" Beast said. \"When your stomach is full it gives a sign to your brain so it knows it's full. If your appetite suddenly is so out of control it might be that someone is playing a trick at you. playing with your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean a telepath? Like professor X?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or Jean,\" Professor X said. \"But I did't do anything and I know Jean would't do anything like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps Emma frost? The white witch?\" Storm suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could do that,\" Professor X said. \"But I seriously doubt it. Why would she do that? give Kitty a bigger appetite or making her gain weight I don't see how that would help her. That's not her style. But perhaps another telepath. This seems like just teasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just teasing?\" Kitty yelled. I'm at risk of losing my body. I already have one shirt that's to small and\u2026 I don't wanna get fat.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe other three looked at her<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You should have been throwing up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty shivered. She hated throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Kitty I'm here to help you. I will see if I can find anything. But at the moment I'm not sure I or anyone can do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what can I do now. I just\u2026 can't control myself when I'm getting hungry. Like I'm two Kitty's. This one I'm now, and one that only wants to fill her belly. Not really caring about anything else. Not really caring what it is as long if it's edible. That's gonna ruin my perfect figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you don't want that but what do you want us to do?\" Storm asked. \"Change your appetite back to normal? We would love to but we don't know how. But we will look if we can find anything until then\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty walked out with a bowed head. Like someone who had been sentenced to death. She know what soon would happen. Soon she would be hungry again and ate a large meal. She could try to stop it, but was aware that it wouldn't do any good. She knew her hunger kept growing and growing until she couldn't control it and she stuffed herself. She might as well just eating large meals. Eating large meals would make her gain but maybe keep her hunger enough under control so she didn't made a total pig of herself. Otherwise Rogue would really have something to tease her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is how it all started. Kitty did what she could trying to eat enough so her hungry side wouldn't take over. It did work most of the time. Lucky for her it was summer vacation. At school she wasn't allowed to eat during classes. However the eating of large meals did take a toll on her body. Slowly she started gaining all over her body.   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She didn't notice Rogue went to bed. Did she sleep through that? What had happened? Suddenly she remembered. The huge dinner and her taking two slices of cake. How embarrassing. Well Storm was normally a pretty calm and understanding woman. So she probably wouldn't make a to big deal out of it. That was one good point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really needed to ask Professor Xavier what was going on with her. How to stop it. Or else she would soon look like The Blob. However Blob was fat but could take a lot. His fat protected him from objects of people that hit him. She didn't think she would have the same luck. Then her belly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again. I had a terrible tummy ache just a short while ago. How can I be hungry now again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed outside it was pitch black. Rogue was in bed. What time was it? She looked at her alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Middle of the night? That makes sense. After dinner and dessert I had a tummy ache. Not so strange if you knew how much I stuffed in my belly. But that was a few hours ago. I guess the food has digested. But why am I so hungry again? I need to ask Professor Xavier. But he's asleep now. I should do so but I'm so hungry. Perhaps just a small midnight snack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to fall asleep again but the hunger kept nagging on her. She sighed and decided, fighting it was a lot cause.<br>\r\nKitty faded right through the bed, through the floor and dropped out of the ceiling. Right in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the right place. Just a small snack...\" Her voice drifted of when she opened the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't knew what came over her but the next moment she started to stuff anything edible in her mouth. She even ate a raw broccoli. She ripped of leafs of lettuce and ate it with a gulp of dressing. She grabbed jars of jelly and poured the sticky stuff right in her mouth. The same went for the ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise. But she kept eating everything inside. A block of cheese, slices of ham and bacon. Fish and some other stuff that was probably mend for next dinner. But Kitty didn't mind. All she cared about was filling her belly. She even ate the six sticks of butter. The she slowly opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRP!! Oops. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty suddenly saw the empty fridge and all the empty jars and wrappers around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. I did it again. I made a total pig out of myself. Well I'm full now. I'm just pooped and\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she passed out right on the kitchen floor. Her belly round and bloated because of all the food in it.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Curious, Kitty decided to check it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered, Kitty saw it was very old fashioned on the inside. It had old chairs and tables that, despite their age, were still in very good shape. Though there weren't many people, despite it being the middle of the day, there was a fairly decent sized line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty got in line and looked at the glass case. There were cupcakes and slices of normal cakes for fairly decent prices. After a few minutes, Kitty's turn came. A plump redhaired girl around Kitty's age was working the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi and welcome to Schulz Bakery, where we've been pleasing customers for 100 years. My name's Brittney. How may I help you?\" asked the girl in a cheerful voice. Kitty looked at the options again and decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll take one of the Choco Creamed cupcakes.\" Kitty smiled. Brittney nodded and pulled one of said cupcakes out. It was a large chocolate cupcake with chocolate cream filling inside and white frosting and colored sprinkles on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be three dollars please,\" Brittney smiled. Kitty handed over the money, telling Brittney to keep the change. As she left, Kitty unwrapped the cupcake and took a bite. Upon contact, her taste buds erupted into singing. It was basically the best thing she'd ever eaten. Kitty wolfed down the cupcake quickly and licked her fingers to make sure she didn't miss any crumbs, frosting or filling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that was totally the best cupcake I've ever eaten! I've totally gotta hit that place again!\" Kitty smiled, letting out a gentle burp before giving her  fingers one last lick to make sure she'd gotten all the frosting filling and crumbs.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it was the closest shop to the mall anyway. As she entered the shop, it was empty of people, which Kitty guessed was fairly common since it was pretty early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Kitty didn't know was that she'd put on a little weight from the cupcake yesterday. It wasn't noticeable, ten pounds at the most, bringing her weight from 90 lbs. to 100. Instead of Brittney, who had worked the counter yesterday, there was another girl. She was slightly plumper than Brittney and had ginger hair pulled into a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. I'm Rachel. Welcome ta Schulz Bakery. What c'n I get a'fore ye, lass?\" she asked in a Scottish accent, smiling and showing her double chin. Kitty looked over all the cakes before deciding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll totally take the chocolate cake,\" Kitty said, pointing to the cake behind the case. \"Okay. We be havin' a special deal today. Buy one an' get four a'fore free,\" said Rachel smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty thought that was a weird offer but took it anyway. She sat down at a table and started eating all four cakes, leaving no crumbs. She was soon licking globs of chocolate off her fingers as Rachel came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah. Ye really enjoyed the cakes, didn't ye, lass?\" Rachel remarked, surprised that Kitty had managed to eat all four cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They were, like, totally amazing. Like, I'm Kitty by the way.\" Kitty smiled as she and Rachel shook hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we be havin' a job opening for a new taste tester. The owner's takin' interviews in the back.\" Rachel shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that'd totally be awesome.\" Kitty smiled, figuring she could use the extra money. With a quick nod, Rachel went to the back before returning a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss. Schulz'll see ye in the back,\" Rachel said, helping Kitty up. What Kitty didn't know was that now she had ballooned from 100 pounds to 110, giving her a chubby belly due to the four cakes adding ten pounds to her weight.</span></div></div>",

She had only taken the bakery over a year ago from her late parents. However, more modern bakeries were getting the attention nowadays. But, Dani had developed a plan to stop this. \"I'm so close to my plans for world dominance. Once everyone gets addicted to my cakes, they'll all be too fat to stop me! It'll teach them to ignore my family's business. \" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door from Rachel. \"What is it, Rachel?\" Dani asked with a fake smile as the young girl waddled in with Kitty behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dani. This' Kitty. She's here about the position.\" Rachel said, pointing to Kitty before leaving the two. Dani took a moment to look Kitty over. It was clear she'd enjoyed the bakery's cakes, judging from her chubby belly and the chocolate smeared around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi miss...\" Kitty began but was cut off by Dani waving her hand, hitting her dark brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Dani. I hate the whole formal thing.\" Dani said, rolling her eyes with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I'm gonna ask you some questions and you just answer them to see if you get the job.\" Dani added with a smile. In reality, it wasn't a food taste tester she was looking for, but someone who would promote her cakes and it looked like Kitty fit the bill, but she needed to make it look like an actual interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, first question: Have you ever worked in a bakery before?\" Dani asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. But, like, I totally make cupcakes sometimes.\" Kitty said, a little nervously. Dani just gave her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. When would you be able to work?\" asked Dani, tapping her fingers on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I can totally come in everyday after school. I usually have a ton of free time then.\" Kitty offered. That was true. Aside from missions and training, Kitty usually did have everyday after school free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now for the final and most important question: How do you like our cakes?\" Dani asked, even though she already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, they're totally awesome! The best cakes I've ever had!\" Kitty smiled, rubbing her chubby belly in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. I think I've heard enough. Welcome aboard.\" Dani said, standing up with Kitty as they shook hands. Kitty was feeling pretty proud about getting the best job in the world in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, when do I start?\" Kitty asked, ready to start eating some of those yummy cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now.\" Said Dani, quickly calling Rachel, who waddled in carrying Kitty's new uniform. It consisted of a red t-shirt, a red visor hat and stretchy black pants. Rachel was also holding what looked like a thick diaper. Kitty grabbed both, looking at Dani in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I forgot to mention that all employees are required to wear diapers so we can have 100% of our employees' time.\" Dani explained. Kitty nodded after a moment and ducked into the bathroom to change. A second later, she came out in her new work clothes, the t-shirt already stretched tightly across her belly. \"You look perfect.\" Dani smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Like, I totally can't wait to try more cakes.\" Kitty smiled as her belly rumbled, wanting more cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Go take a seat near the counter. I'll have Rachel bring you the first batch.\" Dani ordered. Kitty nodded and walked to the front. Dani went to the kitchen, where six cupcakes with pink frosting were all ready for Kitty. Dani then injected a brainwashing serum into them. It would take a few weeks to kick in, but she could wait. \"Rachel, the first batch is ready.\" Dani called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it boss.\" said Rachel as she grabbed the tray and took it out to Kitty, who was waiting patiently. \"Here you go.\" said Rachel, setting the tray down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Kitty said as she began to eat. She ate cupcake after cupcake until they were all gone. Then, Rachel brought out four large chocolate birthday cakes, with Kitty eating them all up. She was so focused on eating that she didn't notice she pooped her diaper as she sat back, rubbing her full, large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks had passed since Kitty got the job and there had been quiet a few changes with her. The first thing was that she had completely fallen under Dani's brainwashing. Also, her size had increased quite a bit. Her belly was becoming as round as the rest of her, causing her to resemble a sumo wrestler. Her shirt stretched over the large tummy, which now looked like a wrecking ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd also been going around school, telling everybody about this amazing bakery. This led to quite a few students and teachers becoming fat. With the exception of the other X-Kids, everybody was becoming bigger. Kitty walked into class late due to finishing her third cake of the morning. \"Like, sorry I'm late.\" Kitty said, taking her seat, causing it to crack under her diapered girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" said the teacher, not really caring as she stuffed a cupcake into her mouth, causing a button on her shirt to pop off. Kitty then pulled out a large cheesecake with whipped cream from her bag and started eating it. This concerned her friends, who'd noticed her increased size. Kurt decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kitty, maybe you should cut back on the cakes. You're getting pretty big.\" Kurt said, leaning from his desk and poking her in her large belly. \"Like, I totally have no idea what you're talking about. Besides, tasting the cakes is really good money.\" Kitty said. Thanks to Dani's brainwashing, Kitty was oblivious to her weight unless ordered otherwise. After that, the X-Kids gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring lunchtime, the X-Kids were sitting together except for Kitty, who was off doing something. All the X-Kids were eating their lunch while the rest of the school was eating cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong's going on here. Kitty's been getting really fat since she started working at that bakery and she's acting really strange.\" Scott said with a concerned expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and everybody else is getting fat too. Even the football players and cheerleaders.\" Jean said, nodding to the table where said students were sitting. The jocks did look fat and the cheerleaders were rather chubby. In fact, everybody else in the cafeteria also ranged from chubby to fat size wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has gotta be connected ta Kitty an' that bakery.\" Rogue said with a thoughtful look on her face as she crunched her apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I dunno 'bout you guys, but I think we should investigate that bakery an' see what's happenin' with the K-girl.\" Spyke suggested with concern for his fellow younger X-Man, earning nods from the others. The rest of the day went by fairly normally, aside from the fact that Kitty was absent for that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school found them sneaking to Schulz bakery, which was now a factory due to increase in demand for their cakes. All five snuck into the factory and saw a whole group of obese, diapered girls making cakes while in the middle of it all was Kitty. She was sitting at a table with Dani watching her while Rachel handed more cakes over for Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Kitty. Keep eating. With your help, soon the world will be under my control!\" Dani laughed evilly as Kitty pooped her diaper, the stench carrying around the factory. The X-Kids decided to make themselves known after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step away from our friend!\" Kurt shouted as they appeared from behind a bunch of boxes. Kitty didn't even stop eating her cakes. Dani rolled her eyes and turned to Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, please help us deal with these fools. Attack.\" Dani ordered. Kitty quickly stopped eating her latest cake and charged at her friends surprisingly quick for someone of her girth. Rogue got knocked out almost instantly by Kitty's large belly, being caught off guard for said attack. The others soon followed suit as they didn't want to use their powers out of fear of hurting their friend. Dani looked over the knocked out X-Kids and suddenly had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, I want you to tie these two up, change them into the company uniform and diapers and force feed them. Rachel and Suzanne, help me take those three to be frozen.\" Dani ordered, nodding to Jean and Rogue and Scott, Kurt and Spyke respectively as she, Rachel and a large African-American girl with black hair tied in a ponytail grabbed the latter three and drug them to the factory's enormous freezer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Kitty nodding as she grabbed two uniforms and diapers for Jean and Rogue. She quickly changed them and tied them up to two chairs. When Rogue and Jean woke up, the first thing they noticed was the diapers and that they were tied up. Before they could even speak, they were being force fed numerous cakes. As time passed, Jean and Rogue started to become fatter and fatter, their bellies becoming rounder and they had no choice, but use their diapers, causing Kitty to laugh.</span></div></div>",

Dani smiled at the handy work. \"Alright. With that taken care of, I will be in my office. I have some work to go over.\" Dani said, heading to the office while Suzanne went back to work with the other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, don't forget to lock up the antidote cupcake!\" ordered Dani, who had made said cupcake in case she ever accidently ate one of her cakes. \"Aye, lass.\" Rachel said as Dani went into her office. Rachel went over to lock up the cupcake, when the timer went off for some other cakes. \"Och. Dani will kill me if I let the cakes burn.\" said a worried Rachel, waddling to the ovens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to either Rachel or Dani, Scott's optic beam was charging up and a second later, he had freed himself, causing him to fall to his knees and hands. \"Finally.\" remarked Scott as he got up and quickly began freeing Spyke and Kurt. Within minutes, the duo were freed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man.\" Spyke said as Scott helped him up. \"Vere are Jean und Rogue?\" Kurt asked, looking for said duo. \"I dunno but I overheard Dani talking about an antidote cupcake that can destroy the brainwashing. We just need to feed it to Kitty, then we'll try and find Rogue and Jean.\" Scott replied, earning nods from the duo as he grabbed the large pink frosted and rainbow sprinkled cupcake as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio started looking around the factory and what they saw a few minutes later shocked them. There was Rogue and Jean, tied up, donned in the bakery's uniforms and diapers and being force fed cake. The duo had put on quite a bit of weight, the t-shirts riding up above their bellybuttons. Kitty was still force feeding them, often swiping bites from the cakes herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, stop!\" Kurt called, startling Kitty as Scott quickly used his optic blasts to free Rogue and Jean, who quickly used their new weight to pin Kitty down as they tackled her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! Get this in her mouth!\" Scott called, tossing the cupcake to Rogue, who quickly stuffed it into Kitty's mouth. Kitty, out of habit, ate it and then burped loudly. It took a couple of minutes for the antidote to take hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errg. Like, what happened?\" Kitty asked as Jean and Rogue managed to get off her. Then, all the memories of her time mind controlled came flooding in. \"Like, oh man guys. I'm so totally sorry.\" Kitty said, feeling awful for hurting her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Kit. Ya can make it up by gettin' Dani for us while we try an' free Rachel and her friends.\" Rogue smiled as she helped Kitty up. Kitty nodded and took off fairly quickly despite her weight and full diaper. Soon, she reached Dani's office and phased through the door, shocking Dani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? What is it? I told you to force feed those brats!\" Dani commanded. \"Like, I'm totally me again, Dani! My friends're like, totally freeing Rach and the others now.\" Kitty smiled, nodding to the screens. Dani turned in time to see, to her horror, Jean using her telepathy to free Rachel and the other girls, who now looked surprised and confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!! Those freaks'll pay for this!!!\" Dani snarled as she grabbed a tube filled with red liquid. \"Once I make them drink this, your idiot friends will be addicted just like you were!\" she laughed. \"Like, no way!\" Kitty shouted, tackling Dani and pinning her under her gut. Quickly, Kitty grabbed the vial and forced it's entire contents into Dani's throat. Within seconds, Dani swelled up into a sumo version of herself, knocking Kitty off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have cakes... gotta have cakes...\" Dani moaned as she ran towards the nearest large box and started wolfing them down as the X-Kids and her former employees watched in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, Kitty, Jean and Rogue were having a victory party in Kitty's room. Dani had been arrested and the girls, due to being brainwashed, had been cleared of charges. Rachel, meanwhile, had taken over the bakery and was doing a good job running it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, good thing we totally decided against using the cure to loose this blubber.\" Kitty smiled to Jean and Rogue as they ate their way through junk food heaps. Jean was eating numerous creampuffs, Rogue was chomping down on peanut butter, snickerdoodle and chocolate chip cookies and Kitty was eating numerous cakes. They were also clad in only t-shirts and diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I can't believe we ever hated being fat. We're still pretty active and agile even with our current sizes and we're really strong!\" Jean smiled before stuffing six big creampuffs into her mouth, smearing powdered sugar and frosting on her face and mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kitty, eating a large cake with her hands, pooped her diaper. \"Oopsie!\" She blushed as the stench filled the room. \"Good thing we also decided ta keep wearin' and usin' diapers!\" Rogue joked, causing them to laugh as they continued their party.</span></div></div>",

Since she'd never seen it before, she decided to go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked inside, Kitty noticed the shop was very retro themed. As she walked up to the counter, she rose an eyebrow at some of the names since they were all stuff like \"the gut puncher\" and \"the stuffer\". \"Like, those are totally strange names for doughnuts.\" Kitty thought to herself as she was brought out of her thoughts by the woman working behind the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Welcome to Doughnut Heaven. How may I help you?\" said the woman in a much too cheery tone for the job she had in Kitty's opinion. Kitty looked at the menu and took a few seconds before making her mind up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll have two gut punchers,\" Kitty said. The woman nodded and pulled two gut punchers out from the display case. Kitty was surprised by the size of them. They were as round as her head with pink and blue sprinkles on them. The woman put them into a to-go bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok miss, that'll be two dollars.\" said the woman in her cheery voice. Kitty was surprised by how cheap the doughnuts were given their size, but nevertheless handed over a ten and told the woman to keep the change. Once out of the shop, Kitty pulled one of the doughnuts out and took a bite. Her taste buds exploded, it was the best thing she'd ever tasted and she kept eating as she walked. By the time she got back to the mansion, she had finished both doughnuts and rubbing her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I totally need to go there again!\" Kitty said to herself, letting out a jumbo burp,still rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

I think she's getting kind of...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jean could finish her sentence, there was a loud cracking sound. A second later, they saw Kitty waddling up to the door while using one hand to eat one of the doughnuts. But as she got up to the door and tried to go through, she found that she was stuck. Her big love handles pressed against the doorframe. She tried to free herself but couldn't. After a minute, she gave up, huffing and puffing and her round face slightly red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hey guys. Can you help me?\" Kitty asked, waving her flabby arms, half a doughnut in her mouth. \"Kurt, you teleport and push from behind while I pull,\" Scott said. Kur nodded and teleported behind Kitty and the duo started to push and pull. It took a couple of minutes until Kitty was completely free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks guys.\" Kitty said, shoving another doughnut into her mouth. \"Maybe you should cut back on the doughnuts,\" said Kurt, clearly concerned for Kitty as she waddled to the couch. \"I'm, like, totally fine.\" Kitty said, flopping on the couch, causing her whole body to jiggle and repositioned herself so she was laying on her back, making her burp loudly. As she made herself comfortable, the other moved away to talk about her for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, Ah'm worried about Kitty. She's gettin' huge and Ah bet it's somethin' ta do with that doughnut shop she's been going too.\" Rogue said with a worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.

Jean signaled for them to hide behind some barrels and they listened to the mad scientist talking to himself. \"Yes. My test subject is coming along perfectly, now that Miss. Pryde is growing huge. Soon, I will release my doughnuts around the world and everyone will be too fat to resist me taking over the world!\" laughed the mad scientist. The trio decided it was time to make their presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if we stop you,\" said Kurt as he, Jean and Scott revealed themselves. \"Ah, I see Kitty's little friends have come to put a stop to my plans.\" said the mad scientist with a huge smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will stop you,\" said Scott. But as soon as he stopped talking, a strange mist filled the room, making Scott, Jean and Kurt pass out. The scientist walked over to them smirking. \"Don't worry you will all wake up soon with a little soreness.\" He smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis current situation had put a big dent in his plans. He would need to put his off hand monitoring and take on a more practical approach. Grabbing a large bag of doughnuts, he left for the X-Mansion. Upon showing up, he saw Rogue and Spyke arguing over something in the kitchen while Kitty was still laying on the couch, holding an empty bag of doughnuts. Smirking, the mad scientist went to the front of the mansion and started saying through an open window, \"Come on, Kitty. Don't you want some tasty doughnuts?\" said the mad scientist, waving the large bag of doughnuts back and forth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doughnuts...\" Kitty said in an almost trance like state as she managed to get up and waddled to the door, turning sideways so she could get through. She then followed the mad scientist, with him feeding her doughnuts as he led her to his mansion, which took awhile to get to. Once there, the scientist helped Kitty onto a large king sized bed as she munched on her doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the scientist ran into a problem. Kitty seemed to have entered an eating trance, an unforeseen side effect of having nothing to eat but doughnuts, though the scientist didn't mind this side effect, it also brought out another side effect. Due to being in an eating trance, Kitty didn't noticed she was peeing and pooping her pants due to forgetting about going to the bathroom. The scientist struggled to find away to fix this before deciding on putting her in diapers to deal with the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of Kitty snoring softly, he put her in a large thick diaper, taking time to lovingly jiggle her big belly and love handles. This diaper wasn't like normal ones. It was able to be cleaned after each use, even the wettest pee or stickiest poop couldn't stain it and it never wore out. It wasn't long before this task was done and he went back to his main mission of spreading his doughnuts around the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later...</span></div></div>",

Though Kitty didn't seem to notice the passing time since she spent most of it eating or sleeping or, in some occasions, sleep eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad scientist was quiet happy with how much Kitty had grown. Her belly was now so big, it hung over the waistband of her diaper while her face was like a blob of dough with a double chin, plus her arms and legs were squishy and flabby, her fingers, hands, feet and toes were all plump and her boobs had swollen considerably as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to see if Kitty was still mobile, the mad scientist did an experiment in which he had her waddle to the living room. He found that, though she was able to do so, Kitty was left very out of breath and was quite slow. She then started eating the very big doughnut left for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the experiment, the mad scientist quickly changed into a smart suit. He had a meeting with a high ranking government official to get his doughnut franchise spread around the world. After checking to make sure that Kitty was still in an eating trance and had enough doughnuts to make her full, he started to leave, only for a thick cloud of smoke to appear in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smoke clear, he saw it was five mutant teenagers, three of who he recognized from the month before when they broke into his shop. All five were very shocked to see Kitty fat and diapered while Kitty started on another doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Kitty's as big as a pig,\" Rogue remarked, looking at her obese teammate and best friend. \"Why did you make our friend fat?\" Scott asked, glaring at the mad scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your friend is just helping me with my plan to conquer the world,\" smirked the mad scientist as he unleashed a pink mist. However, he was left confused by the fact it didn't have any effect on the five teenagers. He was even more shocked by the effect it had on Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Like, where am I? What's goin' on?\" Kitty asked, looking around in confusion at her friends and the mad scientist. When she looked down, she couldn't see her feet. Just her big ole belly. \"Like, why am I so totally fat?!?!?\" She asked, shaking her belly and thus causing it to jiggle and bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vell explain later,\" Kurt said as he and the others began fighting the mad scientist. Despite their efforts, the man was quite slippery and managed to avoid their physical or telekinetic attacks. As he got near Kitty, she saw her chance and threw herself at him. Before he could move, Kitty belly flopped on him, knocking him out cold. Scott and Kurt quickly heaved her up while Jean and Spyke quickly tied up the mad scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys. So, like, what happened?\" Kitty asked, still getting used to her girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, you were used as a test subject by the scientist dude who wanted to make everybody fat so he could rule the world.\" Spyke explained, having been told of the man's plan by Scott, Jean and Kurt after the trio had returned to the mansion a month prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, okay,\" Kitty said, clearly still confused over the whole ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kitty... are ya wearin' a diaper?\" Rogue asked, trying and failing not to laugh at how silly Kitty looked in the extra large diaper. \"Like, I totally don't know why.\" Kitty said in embarrassment, her round cheeks blushing deep bright red as she poked the undergarment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure that out later,\" Kurt smiled as he teleported the gang home, leaving the mad scientist to the authorities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later found Kitty heading to Bayville Mall to hang with her friends. Though she had dropped most of the weight, returning her face, boobs, arms, feet, legs, butt, hands, toes and fingers to normal, she nevertheless sported a rather large belly that hugged her shirts and sweaters. She also retained her jumbo appetite as well. Despite this, she was happy this way and her friends knew and supported it. Kitty was still able to go on missions and was actually still fairly agile despite her remaining fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unknown to the other X-Kids, Kitty also still wore the thick, cleanable diaper she'd been introduced to by the mad scientist. She did so because she found it very comfy and it made her feel safe. </span></div></div>",

But then, on the other, 5 dollars was 5 dollars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that five dollars is totally mine!\" Kitty smirked back as she closed her menu. After waiting a few seconds after Scott got up to place their orders before returning to take his seat next to Jean. A few minutes later, a waitress arrived with five bowls of ice cream: mint for Jean, chocolate for Kurt, strawberry for Scott and two butter pecans for Rogue and Spyke. Then, she turned to Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bring your order in just a second,\" smiled the waitress as she went back, leaving Kitty to watch her friends eat their ice creams. A minute later, the waitress arrived and placed a massive sundae in front of Kitty. It had large scoops of ice cream, which were drenched in hot fudge sauce, a generous amount of whipped cream and a huge red cherry on top. Kitty's mouth was watering and her friends were shocked by the size of the sundae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! There's no way ya can eat all'a that!\" Rogue smirked, already gloating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, nope! That five dollars is totally mine!\" said Kitty, grabbing her spoon and digging in. Her taste buds exploded with flavor. She kept eating and eating until a half-hour later, the sundae was gone, leaving a very green looking Kitty clutching her bloated belly, her face filled with pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? Are you alright? You don't look so good.\" Kurt said with concern for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally fine...\" said Kitty. She was then interrupted by herself slapping her hand over her mouth as she felt bile raising in her throat while feeling herself starting to gag, making her cheeks puff up, but Kitty managed to swallow it down, releasing her hand and letting out a large burp. \"Excuse me.\" said Kitty and then she turned to Rogue. \"Like, pay up.\" Kitty said with a smug smile, despite her belly's pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah still can't believe ya managed ta eat it all,\" Rogue said, rolling her eyes as she forked over the money and Kurt and Scott helped Kitty out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yeah. But it totally tasted amazing! I have to, like, totally do this again,\" said Kitty as she followed her friends out of the shop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole week since the group of mutant teens went to the ice cream parlor and unbeknownst to the others, Kitty had been going back once a day to get a cup of ice cream, resulting in her putting on a little weight. Nothing major, just five pounds. None of her friends noticed this because they spend 99% of the time together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day the gang decided to visit the ice cream parlor again for another treat after a busy week as they took their seat in a booth. \"I still can't believe you managed to eat a whole sundae last week,\" Jean said with a giggle as she looked over the ice cream menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But it tasted totally amazing,\" Kitty said, licking her lips as she imagined the sundae despite the fact that she'd almost thrown up all over the table the last time she'd had it. Scott then had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. I'll bet you 40 dollars that you can't eat two of those sundaes,\" said Scott with a smug grin, remembering the state Kitty had been in after eating just one last week. Kitty thought about it. Two sundaes were a lot to eat, but her appetite had been increasing over the past week. Plus, she could use the 40 dollars to buy something. After a couple more seconds of thinking, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept your dare,\" Kitty said with a smirk. Jean went over and placed the order and returned a minute later. After ten minutes, two waitresses came to the table. One was holding the rest of the group's orders while the second held Kitty's two large sundaes similar to the one she'd ordered last time. After saying thanks to the duo, the rest of the group ate their ice creams while watching Kitty as she devoured the first sundae, getting hot fudge all over her face. But as she started the second one, she slowed down, starting to feel full. But she still ate and ate until the last sundae was gone, leaving Kitty looking very green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I lost 40 dollars,\" sighed Scott as he handed Kitty the money. Kitty was about to retort but she then felt bile raising in her throat. She quickly got up, grateful to have chosen to sit next to the booth's opening, and ran off to the bathroom surprisingly quick for being so bloated like she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the bathroom, she entered the nearest cubical and threw up straight into the toilet, brown liquid hitting the water. After a few minutes, Jean and Rogue entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Kitty?\" Jean asked, looking at her bloated friend bent over the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like, I totally think I got it all out of my system.\" Kitty said as Rogue helped her up and back to the rest of the group.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole month since Kitty had done her second sundae dare. Ever since that day, Kitty had been making multiple trips to the ice cream parlor daily, mainly getting ice cream cones. This had led to a massive change in her weight and appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly now hung over the waistband of her way too tight pants, her boobs had gone up at least two cup sizes while her face had gotten a bit rounder with chubby cheeks and a double chin coming in. All her friends had noticed Kitty's change in weight, but had decided against saying anything that might hurt their friend's feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something her friends didn't know. Due to having accidents in her pants, Kitty had resorted to wearing diapers, which had two benefits in her mind. One was she didn't have to stop eating when she needed to use the toilet plus it made her feel more comfortable. One day, Kitty was back in the parlor with her friends when Jean had a small smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. I bet you can't...\" Jean began, but was interrupted by Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, let me guess... you totally wanna bet that, like, I totally can't eat a whole sundae.\" Kitty said, rolling her eyes. Eating a whole sundae had become such an easy task for her at this point, she could probably finish two and still have room for at least one ice cream cone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was gonna bet you couldn't eat a whole banana split,\" Jean said, pointing to a picture on the menu, making Kitty drool slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, bring it on!\" said Kitty with a confident smirk as Scott went to place their order and returned to the group. After a few minutes, two waitresses carried the banana split over and placed it in front of Kitty, who was surprised by the size of it. It had three bananas, several scoops of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream, hot fudge and a big spray of whipped cream on top, complete with a cherry on top. Suddenly, Kitty didn't feel confident about eating it, but nevertheless, Kitty grabbed a spoon and started to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, Kitty had managed to eat half of the banana split before she started to rub her belly. Seeing that their friend needed help, Spyke and Rogue started cheering her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon K-girl! You can do it!\" Evan said encouragingly to Kitty. \"Listen ta him, Kit! Ya can't let that oversized dessert beat ya!\" Rogue agreed with an equally encouraging smile. Feeling a bit better and having freed up some room in her belly due to using her diaper, Kitty grabbed her spoon and started to eat the rest of the banana split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she leaned back, rubbing her belly with hot fudge sauce on her cheeks and bits of ice cream on her shirt and sweater. \"Wow. I can't believe you actually ate all that,\" Jean said, a little surprised by how much Kitty had eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just smirked, still rubbing her swollen belly and thinking that she was getting very good at this eating ice cream thing as Kurt helped her up from the booth and she waddled after her friends.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another three weeks had passed and Kitty had been visiting the ice cream parlor even more often than before and most of the time she would end up ordering a sundae maybe two if she was extra hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of changes had happened to Kitty. She put on even more weight. Her belly had grown bigger along with her boobs and butt and she had fully developed a double chin that wobbled as she talked and a third one was sneaking up on her. She also had to upgrade her wardrobe due to popping the button of her pants while eating one of her sundaes. She had also gotten a bigger sweater and t-shirt, but they still seemed very tight, highlighting her belly and love handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even had to get bigger diapers to contain her growing butt, though Kitty still seemed pretty oblivious to her massive weight gain. She thought it was only a few pounds at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was lying on the couch watching TV, the remote control laying on her belly when suddenly her belly let out a massive rumble. \"Wow. Like, I totally better grab something to eat. It's totally almost dinnertime.\" thought Kitty as she got up and waddled to the kitchen to start making herself dinner, even though it wasn't anywhere near dinnertime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with her visits to the ice cream parlor, her appetite at home had grown as well, making her eat more often and larger amounts. Kitty finished making her dinner, which looked like it could feed three people and started to eat it quite messily, with some of it getting on her clothes and face. Kurt walked past and rose an eyebrow, but didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Kitty was laying in bed, trying to sleep, but she was feeling too hungry to sleep. Rolling over, she saw that her clock read midnight. \"Hmm... Like, I totally guess a quick midnight snack totally couldn't hurt.\" Kitty thought as she got out of bed, her pink pajama t-shirt clinging to her belly and her matching shorts looking like they were going to burst at any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty waddled out of her room, going slow as possible to try and not wake anyone up. When she got to the kitchen, she started to make a sandwich with cheese, ham, tomato, lettuce, mayo, five pickles, lots of ketchup and an olive on top while also grabbing a carton of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was awakened by creaking floorboards and quickly jumped out of bed, following the sound and found a light in the kitchen. Peeking her head in, she saw Kitty gulping down her massive midnight snack and downing a carton of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. This is gettin' outta hand,\" Rogue said quietly, rolling her eyes as she left Kitty to enjoy her midnight snack. The next day, Rogue met her friends in the kitchen, except for Kitty, who was still sleeping. \"Hey. Is it me or is Kitty gettin' really fat lately?\" Rogue asked as she grabbed a cinnamon roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is getting pretty big. Yesterday I walked by and she was eating a meal that would feed three people,\" Kurt said, a little worried for his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' last night Ah saw her eatin' a large sandwich and downin' an entire carton of milk,\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we should say something?\" Jean asked  just as they heard the sound of creaking floorboards and a few minutes later, Kitty waddled in. \"Hey guys. Like, what're you talking about?\" She asked, waddling over to the fridge and opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, we need to talk to you about something...\" Scott started, trying to find a nice way to say that Kitty was getting fat, but was interrupted by Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, you're gettin' fat an' eatin' a ton,\" Rogue said, poking Kitty's belly, her finger sinking into Kitty's belly fat, which caused Kitty to slap her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you guys talking about? I'm totally not getting fat. I, like, only put on a few pounds at the most,\" Kitty said, in denial of her about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are getting fat and you've been eating everything. You really need to cut back,\" Kurt said, earning nods from the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you guys are totally just being mean,\" Kitty said, grabbing a bag of Cheetos and waddling away in a huff, leaving her friends very confused and all promising to help Kitty loose weight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole week since Kitty's friends had confronted her about her weight gain and her diet had taken an even bigger turn. Every day for breakfast, she would have a stack of pancakes covered in maple syrup and a whole box of doughnuts with mixed kinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually also had a bunch of snacks to tie her over until lunchtime where she had three PB&amp;J sandwiches, 12 chocolate chip cookies and a large soda to wash it all down. And when dinnertime arrived, Kitty usually ate fourths of whatever was being served except for fruits and vegetables, which she wouldn't touch. During one meal, Scott decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, you really need to cut back on the meals, plus all the junk food you've been eating.\" said Scott, causing Kitty to pause in the middle of eating her fourth plate of pasta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Scott. You really do need to cut back like we told you last week. You're getting even bigger.\" said Jean, who was sitting closest to Kitty and was poking her finger into Kitty's much bigger belly, her finger sinking into the flab. Kitty slapped her hand away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I'm, like, totally not fat and second of all, I'm totally not addicted to junk food.\" Kitty said, grabbing her plate of pasta and waddling away, eating her pasta as she did. As she reached her room, she was slightly out of breath. As she laid down on her bed, she noticed a leftover chocolate bar poking out of her underpants drawer. This gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, if my friends totally have a problem with me eating junk food, I'll just, like, totally hide it in my room.\" Kitty thought to herself as she started picking places to hide her junk food. She then waited until midnight when everybody was asleep and then waddled down to the kitchen, grabbed several types of junk food and then carried them back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the gang walked into Kitty's room while she was out. They were looking for a couple of study notes Kitty had agreed to let them look over for an upcoming test. After a couple of minutes looking, Rogue grew bored and decided to sit on Kitty's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her butt touched the bed, she felt something crumpling. She quickly jumped up and pulled the blankets back to reveal a smooshed banana cream pie. \"Okay. That's just plain gross,\" said Rogue, lifting the destroyed pie up to show the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Kitty's been hiding junk food?\" asked Kurt, raising an eyebrow. \"Looks like it. We can't let her keep it. We need to find the rest. Start looking.\" Scott ordered. Everybody started to look. After a few minutes, Jean found a massive stash. There was several types of junk food. Spyke grabbed a bag and started putting the junk food in the bin just as Kitty waddled in and saw her friends destroying her junk food supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you guys doing?!?!?!?\" Kitty shouted, shocking that her friends were doing. Kurt decided to speak up since he was the more diplomatic of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Kitty, ve are doing this for your own good. You've got a junk food problem and ve are just trying to help you.\" Kurt said in a calming tone, trying to get his friend to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO YOU'RE NOT! LIKE, YOU'RE DOING THIS TO HURT ME!\" Kitty screamed, stomping her foot and causing her whole body to jiggle like jelly. \"You know what? Forget you guys! Like, I'm totally going to school!\" Kitty screamed, waddling away to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty finally made it to school. It took a bit longer than usual because she had to keep stopping to catch her breath. When she got into the building, she waddled straight to her locker where she grabbed a package of cookies she'd been hiding in her locker and started to eat them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn't notice that most of the school had been looking at her. Everybody had noticed her weight gain by now. Most didn't care and went about their own business but some were laughing behind her back as the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty made her way to class, bumping into a few classmates with her huge belly, which she was completely oblivious too. When she got to class, she spent most of it sneaking bits of food from her bag. She did this for every class until lunchtime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, she got herself three trays of food from hamburgers to pizza slices to corn dogs and ate them, causing several of the students to stare in amazement at how much she was eating. After half an hour, Kitty had finally finished eating, leaving herself covered with sauce and bits of pepperoni and she had also used her diaper while she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, she always kept a few spare diapers in her bag. She was going to change once her bloating went down and she was starting to feel slightly sick. After ten minutes of rubbing her belly and trying not to throw up, two cheerleaders came up to the table with mean looks on their faces. Kitty noticed them. \"Hey.\" said Kitty, covering her mouth with her hand to stop a big burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Pryde. You've really turned into a fat pig, haven't you?\" said one of the cheerleaders, poking Kitty in her large squishy belly. Before Kitty could respond, the second cheerleader spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You've turned into a right whale,\" laughed the other cheerleader, causing the other one to laugh and Kitty to blush. \"Like, you guys are totally just mean,\" Kitty said, getting up and waddling away, the cheerleaders laughing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty made her way to the toilets where she spent another half hour sitting on a toilet seat before she finally felt like her food had digested enough for her to actually change her stinky diaper. Once she was changed, she suddenly got a craving for ice cream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of thinking it over, Kitty decided to give into her cravings. \"Like, I've totally only got two classes left away. Plus, I can, like, totally get notes from Jean and Kurt anyway.\" Kitty thought, wadding out of the toilets and down the quiet hallway to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of waddling, Kitty arrived at the ice cream parlor and ordered one of every flavor of ice cream cones and two sundaes. The waitress working there was shocked by the order for one person, but nevertheless, she told Kitty the first part of the order would be out in a couple of minutes. Kitty smiled, showing off her double chin and waddled off to one of the booths, where she squeezed herself into one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a waitress came up with a tray holding six different types of ice cream cones which Kitty instantly started to dig into, not caring that they were dripping onto her clothes. \"Like, oh well. They're totally already dirty from lunch,\" said Kitty, loudly licking a chocolate ice cream cone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, two waitresses walked over, carrying both sundaes. New ones with huge bananas, chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and mint ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream with a cherry on top. Kitty dug in with glee. Half an hour later, Kitty was left feeling sick with two empty sundae bowls in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was brought out of her thoughts by her friends showing up. \"Hey, Kitty. Are you alright? Ve heard about vat happened at school.\" said Kurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally fine.\" Kitty smiled. Then *GGGURGGGGLLLEEEEE* went her large belly. \"Like, oh poops. I so totally don't feel so go...\" Kitty said before throwing up all over her friends. \"Oops,\" Kitty blushed, seeing her friends covered with barf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get you home,\" Rogue said, rolling her eyes as she wiped Kitty's vomit out of her hair while Scott and Kurt helped Kitty up and then home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Kitty went for a midnight snack. When she saw some ice cream that was on the floor after eating a lot, she figured \"what the heck\" and licked it up. She was just starting to dip some chocolate into a pot of gravy she had made when her friends came inside.</span></div></div>",

For the first time, she realized just how big she really was. Kurt could see his friend was embarrassed by the whole thing and went over to help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, are you alright?\" He asked gently, helping Kitty to her feet, which was a challenge as Kitty was twice his size now. \"Ok. Like, I totally may've put on a little weight,\" admitted Kitty, only to be given a look by her friends. \"Okay. Like, maybe a ton of weight.\" Kitty said, looking down and making her double chins visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now admit ya've got a junk food problem.\" said Rogue, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I still don't have a junk food problem.\" Kitty insisted, crossing her bloated arms over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We literally just saw you licking ice cream off the floor.\" Jean said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.

We'll help you get through this.\" Scott said, earning nods from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night had happened a few months prior and Kitty's friends had helped her loose a great deal of weight, though she still retained a large belly that was visible through her shirts. Her junk food habit had been tough to break, but they managed to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one thing that hadn't changed was her usage of diapers. She was currently sitting on her bed in only a thick diaper and a red t-shirt. After a moment, she let out a giant fart as she pooped her diaper and smiled. \"Like, I totally love using my diaper.\" She giggled, laying on her back and poking her tummy, causing her burp loudly as she then enjoyed her sticky and smelly diaper rubbing it's poopy load against her still large behind.</span></div></div>",
