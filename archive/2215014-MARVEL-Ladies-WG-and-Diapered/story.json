New Mutants member Karma had been possessed by Xavier's old enemy Shadow King. During this time, his overindulging habits rendered Karma immobility obese. The X-Men and New Mutants had successfully rescued and brought Karma home. Now, Professor X and Fantastic Four member Reed Richards were trying to find a way to help Karma while the X-Men dealt with Shadow King's remaining forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, \"C'mon Kitty! What's the harm of one more bite?\" Karma was complaining as Kitty \"Shadowcat\" Pryde held a large slice of pizza away from her while her body was being partially phased in Karma's gut and one hand phased in her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the last four bites you took wiped out eight extra-extra large pizzas! I think that's enough snack time, Karma.\" Kitty explained gently. At that moment, Storm arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, the team is mobilizing to take on what's left of Shadow King's organization. I need you to stay here and look after Karma.\" She said. \"Easier said than done!\" Kitty retorted as she and Karma kept struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the others left, Karma stopped struggling. \"It's just not fair! I can't help it that I'm always hungry nowadays!\" She pointed out sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to find a way to curb your appetite somehow. I'm sure the Professor and Dr. Richards'll come up with a plan.\" Kitty said reassuringly as she walked away. Karma frowned in dismay as Kitty did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll never understand. I'll just have to make her understand!\" she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Biting her lip in concentration, Karma used her powers to implant some of her enormous hunger into Kitty. As this happened, Kitty froze, her eyes becoming purple in color, the way anyone's Karma used her powers on did. She then turned back to the fridge in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMM!! Let the snacking continue!\" She smiled, licking her lips as she grabbed a carton of ice cream and poured it into her mouth while grabbing another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma smirked as Kitty kept eating. Slowly, but surely, Kitty's belly started swelling up. As it got bigger and bigger, her costume's shirt started ripping open, exposing her jumbo belly. Her face also grew rounder as her body also bloated up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Karma's delight turned to fear as Kitty started hogging the foods and drinks for herself. After eating the second ice cream carton in the same manner as the previous one, Kitty started guzzling down a large bottle of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP* *GULP* *GULP* Kitty gulped very loudly, letting out a large burp after she finished. \"H-Hey! Save some for me!\" Karma wailed in alarm. Kitty grinned and, waddling slightly now, handed Karma some red velvet cake while keeping the rest to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's much better.\" Karma smiled as she ate her slices, growing bigger as well. Kitty just smiled and buried her face into the rest of the large cake, eating like a pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours seemed to just fly by as the duo ate and ate and ate and ate and ate. Finally, Karma was much bigger than before and Kitty was getting closer to being the same size as her friend. Karma, however, didn't want her too. She only wanted Kitty to know hunger and not end up immobile as her. \"I'd better take my hunger out of her otherwise she's gonna need help movin' around too.\" she decided as Kitty devoured an entire basket of large buttery biscuits in one go, her belly now hanging over the waistband of her tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

I'd better look in on her and Karma...\" Ororo decided as she headed for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, she couldn't believe it. Karma was now much larger and she wasn't the only fat one in the kitchen now. A very bloated Shadowcat was eating like crazy, her belly jiggling as she did so and she didn't even seem to notice her obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?!?!? Karma? What's happened to Kitty?!?!?\" Ororo demanded to know in disbelief as Kitty devoured an entire ham in just a few bites before loudly chugging more soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted Kitty to experience the same hunger I've been facing so I gave her some of mine. Don't worry. I'm gonna take it out of her right... now!\" Karma explained as she quickly pulled her hunger from Kitty. The second she did, Kitty let out a large burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUURRRRRRPPPPPP!!* Ugh... man, what happened?\" Kitty groaned, rubbing her head. Then, she noticed her very large, squishy, jiggly belly poking out of her costume's jacket. Her hips and butt were also bigger, her face was round and doughy, her boobs had gone up a few sizes, her arms, legs, feet, hands, fingers and toes were all plump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Karma?!?!? What happened to me?!?!?\" She asked, poking her large belly, causing it to gurgle loudly. \"Um... well... I kinda used my powers to give some of my hunger to you.\" Karma sheepishly explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?!? You brainwashed me to become fat!?!?!?\" Kitty shrieked, only to clutch her belly as it rumbled ominously. \"No! I-I just wanted you to understand the level of hunger I'm facing right now! I mean, you pack food away like crazy and don't seem to either gain a pound or even think about it!\" Karma protested. \"I am sure her intentions were noble, Kitten. Though they were a bit misguided.\" Ororo said gently. Kitty frowned, but then sighed and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, Ororo. Karma, I'm sorry if I didn't understand your hunger pains. Boy, I sure do now! *Brrraaaapppp!*\" She smiled, letting out another giant burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you seemed to enjoy our pig out.\" Karma smiled. \"Yeah. Somethin's tellin' me I'm gonna need to have a few extra Danger Room sessions to lose this blubber.\" Kitty giggled, poking her gurgling, rumbling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure they will only be for a few weeks, Kitten. Then you'll be slim and trim again.\" Storm smiled. \"Would you like to start now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Kitty smiled. But then, *RUMBLE* *GURGLE* GLOOORRRRRPPPP* *SLOSH* *GGGURRRRGGGGLLLLEEE* Her belly let out five alarming tummy noises. \"Uh, actually Ororo\u2026 could I take a raincheck? My tummy's got other plans!\" Kitty whimpered. \"Certainly.\" Ororo smiled as Kitty, despite being rather bloated, turned and raced for the bathroom where Storm and Karma heard her puking a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Storm's theory about Kitty's dieting and exercising worked and Kitty was back to her slim, trim fighting form within two weeks. Though Kitty's new larger appetite remained, she was careful not to extremely overdo it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, the entire X-Men outright objected such a forced notion, but it wasn't something that even the famed heroes could do a thing about, for it was the choice that Kitty's parents had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with sorrow in her heart, Kitty was left with little alternative but to say a saddened farewell to the people she fondly referred to as her \"second family\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Present Day ==<br>\r\n== Two Weeks Later ==<br>\r\n== England ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding just outside of the local airport, Kitty, dressed in an overcoat with a fashionable hat, holding her suitcase in both hands, as the stereotypical English rain downpour around her. The emotional baggage of unwillingly leaving the people she called family still fresh in her mind's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as to what brought here all the way to Jolly ol' England... Apparently, her parents received an invitation for their daughter to attend a rather prestigious school known as <i>\"The Academy of the Order of the Friars of Saint Francis of Wycombe\"</i>, or simply abbreviated as <i>\"The Wycombe Academy\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Kitty was initially reluctant to attend this new school, thinking that there was something shady about the whole thing, but she had to reluctantly comply at to her parents' behest to attend, which lands her in her current situation at present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen thirty minutes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally an hour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eventually, she was greeted by the arrival of a pristine antiquated limousine. It stopped only just a few feet away from her, to which the chauffeur promptly opened the rear door to allow it's passenger to exit the elegant vehicle.

Aren't you such an adorable cherub?\" She chirped, taking note of the young Pryde's adorably petite physique, a subtle twinkle in her sapphire blue eyes. Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, Kitty took a substantially long moment or two, gazing over the entire physical appearance of the woman standing before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the blonde woman had this air of <i>\"Nobility\"</i> and <i>\"Elegancy\"</i> to her, especially with her all-white ensemble and flowing ivory cape with the fur collar around her shoulders. However, in contrast to the woman's choice of attire, there was a far more notable aspect about her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight and overall size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Kitty would guess, the woman had to at least weigh in at approximately the four-hundred pound mark, with nary a sign of dimpling or unsavory blemish in sight. The woman had these wealthy plump breasts, which pressed against her corset-like one-piece clothing, which was only surpassed by the woman's substantial yet matronly boulder of a belly. However, Kitty couldn't help but feel like something felt...<i>off</i>, regarding what she was wearing underneath such expensive clothing, but it was a mere thought for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...E-Excuse me? Are...A-Are you Miss Emma Frost? The headmistress of the, um...\" Kitty stammered, looking back at the brochure to properly ascertain the school's full name then continued, \"...The Academy of the Order of the Friars of Saint Francis of Wycombe? ...I-I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> It is quite alright, my dear.\" Emma retorted, reassuring the younger woman of her shyness, to which she then performed a small curtsy and elaborated, \"...And to answer your question, I am indeed Emma Frost. Headmistress of Wycombe Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like a lioness circling it's prey, Emma Frost looked over Kitty  from nearly every angle with eyeing curiosity, to which she then asked, \"...And if I must wager a guess, you must be the lovely Katherine Pryde, are you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-Yes. Yes I am, Miss Frost. B-But...M-My friends call me \"Kitty Pryde\". If, um...I-If that's okay with you.\" She timidly answered, obviously feeling a little tense due to being examined in such a manner by a person she had no familiarity with. Of course, Emma Frost couldn't help but become quite amused with the young woman, to which she then reassured, \"Quite the adorable name, my dear. And please...You can call me \"Emma\", if it makes you feel more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...O-Okay.\" Kitty complied, and like a mother coddling her child, Emma Frost calmly and gently guided Kitty towards the limousine as she said, \"...Do not fret, my dear Kitty. I'm most certain you will be quite at home in Wycombe Academy. Now, what do you say we get out of the rain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I would like that.\" Kitty answered, being personally escorted by the rotund Emma Frost. However, she couldn't figure out what exactly was making all these <b>*rustling*</b> and <b>*crinkling*</b> noises, despite being in close proximity with said sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Emma Frost allowed Kitty to enter the vehicle first, only to then enter inside herself, making sure her elegant ivory cape was not caught when the door was closed. And with that, the chauffeur proceeded to return to the driver's seat to escort his charges back to the illustrious Wycombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Kitty couldn't believe how...extravagant, it was inside the limo. Looking at her interior surroundings, she soon noticed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though, it was there that Kitty Pryde soon caught a gaze at the newest individual in proximity within the luxury vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her appearance and vocal accent, Kitty could very easily tell that this person was undoubtedly Scottish, sporting a short mane of fiery red hair, as well as an equally heavyset physique, albeit not as vast as the headmistress, but enough to be distinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, instead of a lavish ensemble like Emma Frost, the Scottish redhead wore a one-piece schoolgirl-esque uniform, complete with a plaid skirt. Speaking of the lavishly dressed Emma Frost, she soon sat beside Kitty, just as the limousine began to move, to which the rotund blonde then quipped, \"Come now, Rahne. Surely, you haven't forgotten about the arrival of your new roommate already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roommate?\" Kitty questioned, initially flabbergasted at how she was going to have a roommate, only for the ivory-dressed woman to compensate, \"My sincerest apologies, Katherine! I should've told you sooner! Anywho, allow me to introduce you to your new roommate-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rahne Sinclair's me name! So...\" Rahne interjected, to which she then got really close to Kitty, whilst the sudden <b>*crinkling*</b> filled Kitty's hearing once more, as the feisty redhead then blurted, \"...Whit kinda d'you hae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\" She rebutted, becoming quite confused as to what exactly she was talking about. Meanwhile, Emma Frost couldn't help but chuckle some from Rahne's feisty curiosity, obviously finding amusement towards the Scot girl's child-like wonder. Of course, she soon stepped in and retorted, \"Again my apologies, Katherine. Though, to put it simply...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Emma Frost began to use her telepathic abilities to converse with Kitty, as she telepathically continued, \"...She is simply curious about your Mutant abilities is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reaction, Kitty was completely taken by surprise, quickly putting two and two together, which ultimately culminated in her gleefully yelping, \"You...Y-You're Mutants! You're just like me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> Indeed we are, Katherine.\" Emma replied, a plump gloved hand gesturing over towards Rahne, only for Kitty to bear witness to a surprising metamorphosis. In appearance, Rahne's body began to take on more lupine features, as reddish-brown fur began to grow and sprout from every part of her body, which gave her short fiery red hair to look more akin to an exaggerated wolven mane. Her teeth sharpened into a pair of lupine fangs, as her fingernails became a pair of claws on each hand, along with a short canine tail floofing out from behind, with her legs becoming digitgrade to cap it all off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Kitty couldn't help but be amazed by the sight before her, as Rahne mock howled at an imaginary moon to sell the look, to which Emma then coyly teased, \"Down, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever ye say, Teach!\" Rahne complied, just as swiftly reverting back to her human form, where it was soon Kitty Pryde's turn to speak, with only astonishment in her voice while she asked, \"This is amazing! But...I-I don't understand, Miss Frost. Are you like Professor Xavier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> ...In a way. I suppose you can say I am England's equivalent of Charles Xavier, my dear Katherine. Right down to being the proud owner and headmistress of an illustrious academy, no less. Now...\" She explained, laying the truth the bear before Kitty, to which she then presented a bountiful spread of cuisines before the brunette and politely asked, \"...Would you like something suitable to eat? I have a guess that the food provided to you on the plane wasn't as substantial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess it would be rude to refuse. Sure, I'll bite!\" Kitty chirped, grabbing a few steaming scones, taking a bite out of them one after the other. \"Mmm! These are pretty good!\" She chirped, her tastebuds soaking in the delectable taste of the scones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst Kitty was busy stuffing her gullet, Emma Frost watched as the baked treats began to slowly work on Kitty's systems, mentally noting to herself, <i>\"Hmm... She has begun to eat them. Excellent. And don't worry, my dear. I'm sure you'll become...\"acquainted\", with the new meat on your bones in due time, along with a surprise or three as well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Emma Frost blocked her mind off from having her agenda revealed to Kitty Pryde, who appeared as if she was in a gluttonous trance, scarfing down several handfuls of sweets at a near breakneck pace. Of course, such binging was bound to show itself on the young Pryde's physical form, as her stomach began to slowly but surely bloat and expand outwards, yet not enough to stick out a great deal to be conspicuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Emma contemplated how this school year will be quite...<i>\"unique\"</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wise men would say that <i>\"A lot can transpire in the span of a week\"</i>. Though, she certainly didn't expect THESE kinds of changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of it good, while some of it was legitimately bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first arrived at Wycombe Academy, the first thing she noticed right off the bat was how...<i>\"Substantially endowed\"</i> all the female students and some of the female staff were, along with unsubtle hints of what could be underneath their specifically designed attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't all bad. After all, she and Rahne quickly became fast friends, not just outside of class. Plus, Kitty soon found out that she was transferred into a school for Mutants, similar to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, but in England. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, much to her own personal shame, Kitty began to experience this bad case of bedwetting, always waking up with soaked bedsheets. At first, she tried to disguise this source of shame from her new best friend/roommate out of attempting to preserve her personal dignity. Of course, having the abilities of a wolf, Rahne was easily able to discover her bestie's wetting predicament. In fact, they made a deal regarding Kitty's \"issue\", as the young Pryde recalled her friend's words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look, Kitty. I understand the shame of wetting the bed, so I'm not going to judge ye. However, if it starts getting bad, we're gaunnae hae to blether this to Headmistress Frost aboot yer...\"issue\". Okay?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the bedwetting wasn't the only change in her daily regiment she had undergone, as Kitty stood before her pee-stained bedsheets, now sporting a somewhat chubbier physique, complete with a small but developing potbelly, fuller breasts, plumper butt, and the subtle beginnings of a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there in her nightgown, with her panties dampened some in the front. Suffice to say, it felt rather embarrassing for her. Fortunately, her new best friend was there to console her, to which the redheaded Scottish Mutant then asked, \"Dae ye want to head to Miss Frost's office, lassie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Headmistress Emma Frost's Office ==<br>\r\n== 10 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, within the bowels of her personal office, adorned with numerous trophies and shelves full of works of literature, Emma Frost was looking over some of the student records, inspecting to see if their educational grades were up to snuff, a plump gloved finger tapping against the mahogany oaken surface of her lavish study. That is until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Knock!*<br>\r\n*Knock!*<br>\r\n*Knock!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a series of rattling knocks at her double doors, to which she promptly answered, \"You may enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with such permission granted, Rahne and Kitty soon entered their Headmistress's proverbial lair, with Rahne hauling in the rolled-up bedsheet from Kitty's bed slung over her shoulder. From there, the duo swiftly closed the doors behind them to allow some privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Emma Frost soon diverted her full attention upon the two roommates, keenly gazing upon them with intent, to which she chirped, \"Ah, Miss Pryde and Miss Sinclair! To what do I owe the pleasure from you two lovely ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Teach... We hae to blether to ye aboot something. It's important.\" Rahne retorted, her Scottish slang prevalent as ever. From there, she then unfurled the bedsheet before the heavyset headmistress, thus revealing the full truth to the leader of Wycombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see your point, Miss Sinclair. I take it that this is your bedsheet, Katherine?\" Emma calmly hypothesized, to which Kitty reluctantly and timidly nodded her head in confirmation, obviously quite embarrassed by her current predicament, meekly uttering, \"...Y...Y-Yes, Miss Frost. I...I-I-I don't know wh-what's going on w-with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing her newest student feeling so ashamed of herself, Emma calmly stood up from her wheeled chair, waddled over towards the embarrassed Kitty, to which the <b>*crinkling*</b> sounds filled the air once more. From there, she placed her plump gloved hands upon Kitty's shoulders, then quickly pulled her into a matronly embrace, akin to a mother coddling her child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I am terribly sorry for this, my dear. You have my utmost sympathies.\" She caringly whispered, showing her sympathy towards the young girl. But then, as if it was preordained in her mindset, the bloated blonde, now with a reassuring smile across her lips, looked back at Kitty and said, \"...You know, I believe I may have a solution to your <i>predicament</i>, my dear. ...If you are willing to make a few necessary changes to your lifestyle, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, Kitty swiftly looked back at the headmistress, a glimmer of hope in her eyes, to which she instinctively hugged Emma Frost, despite her arms not fully reaching around the woman's body, and chirped, \"Thankyouthankyouthankyou!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, if it will allow you to be more at ease, please follow me.\" The larger woman quipped, to which Kitty followed suit, unaware of what the headmistress had in mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 5 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, after waiting out in her study, Rahne was soon re-greeted by the return of Emma Frost and Kitty Pryde. However, the Scottish redhead easily noticed what was newly different about her new bestie, as Kitty fidgeted a bit in her new puffy undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...M-Miss Frost? Are...A-Are you sure about these...<i>things</i>? They're very bulky.\" She asked, noting with clear clarity at how thick and padded the diaper she now wore actually was, as she could easily feel how the padding positioned between her legs forcibly pushed her legs apart some, giving her a semi-noticeable waddling gait, as well as making her butt appearing to have doubled in size.</span></div></div>",

However, becoming rather sympathetic towards the younger brunette's apprehension of the whole situation, Emma let out a empathetic sigh, then inevitably confessed, \"<b>*sigh*</b> ...Well, I suppose it won't do harm to tell you the truth, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...What are you talking about?\" She questioned, becoming rather confused as to what exactly Emma was going on about, only to then feel the bloated blonde waddle over to her to do up the button flap on her onesie-like uniform shirt. From there, while she carefully and properly dressed Kitty, Emma Frost then calmly elaborated, \"Now, I'm not entirely sure how to properly put this into words, but...Katherine; This school...has a curse attached to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cursed? Come on, Miss Frost. There are no such thing as curses.\" Kitty scoffed, as she felt the larger woman button up the diaper flap on her onesie-esque shirt, thinking that the headmistress was pulling her leg. However, it was Rahne's turn to chime in as she chirped, \"I'm afraid it's naw wee ghost story laddies and lassies tell each other around the campfire. What dae ye think we're wearing under our uniforms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing what her best friend and roommate just told her, Kitty was struck with a surprising revelation, her noting the crinkly bulges around the waistlines of both the headmistress and her bestie, hearing the enciting <b>*rustle*</b> and <b>*crinkle*</b> noises from the motions made by both individuals chafing about. Finding the right words to say to them, Kitty eventually spoke up and questioned, \"...H-How long has it been like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Emma looked back towards the diapered Kitty Pryde, to which she promptly responded to her question via plainly answering...</span></div></div>",

They've all had the same bedwetting incidents and whatnot as well.\" Emma admitted with concern. Kitty took a moment to digest this information as she played with her new uniform's collar. Finally, she looked at Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So is that why we gotta wear-\" she began, nodding to her thick diaper. Emma and Rahne both nodded. \"I'm afraid so, Katherine. Ever since new students arrived, we have been plagued by bedwetting and messing ourselves, myself included.\" Emma confessed gently, nodding to her large diaper. Kitty didn't say anything as she poked her diaper through her onesie uniform. Then, she turned to her roommate, classmate and bestie. \"R-Rhane, was it this bad for you?\" She asked. Rahne smiled and nodded gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye. I was barely here for two weeks a'fore me bladder stared actin' up. In fact, I wet meself five times in classes a'fore I came ta Miss. Frost here for help. I've been in these nappies for a year now since I started attendin' this school.\" Rahne confessed, her diaper crinkling loudly. Kitty just looked at the duo, clearly still trying to figure things out. While she still didn't fully believe in curses, she did know this one was apparently all too real. \"W-will it remain after I leave here?\" She finally asked. Emma and Rahne both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid so, Kitty. I thought when we leave for holidays and whatnot, it would fade away. But I was proven wrong after Christmas my first year here when the girls and teachers all revealed that they had wet and pooped themselves repeatedly, forcing them to keep their diapers on at all times, unless they managed to reach the loo or were already in it.\" Emma explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but curses can be broken, can't they? W-what if we learn how the curse came to be and if it can be destroyed?\" Kitty offered. But both Rahne and Emma shook their heads. \"I fear it would not work, Katherine. We have been trying for a year to figure out the curse and it's weaknesses, but have come up with nothing.\" Emma confessed gently. Kitty honestly felt like bawling her eyes out. She was just 13 and a half, she couldn't need diapers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Emma looked at the clock. \"And on that note, girls, I do believe it is time for breakfast. The cafeteria is making lots of good food and I cannot stand missing a meal.\" she smiled kindly, putting a hand on Kitty and Rahne's shoulders and steering them for the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goody. I'm so starved I could eat a horse!\" Rahne smiled eagerly. Kitty nodded in agreement, her potbelly gurgling in equal hunger. Though, secretly, Kitty was wondering about the curse and how worse it would get as she stayed at Wycombe.</span></div></div>",

I mean... I'm going to be turning fourteen. I shouldn't be needing to wear diapers. Why is this happening?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Earth to Kitty! C'mon lassie!\" Rahne chirped, quickly noticing how much her roommate was involuntarily spacing out, to which she responded by shapeshifting her hand into a lupine claw-like hand, using her now canine fingernails to emit an even louder finger snap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it was more than enough to easily snap the distracted Kitty Pryde back to terra firma, as the chubby diapered brunette instinctively blinked twice and thrice in initial confusion and stammered, \"Huh? Wha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye alright, Kitty? Ye were spacin' out on me.\" Rahne asked, showing obvious concern toward her bestie, placing a hand on the girl's shoulder. In response, with the audible <b>*crinkling*</b> noises emanating from her own bulky diaper filling her ears, Kitty blushed and ultimately confessed, \"...I-I'm sorry, Rahne. It's just that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-You're naw used to what's gonna happen? <b>*sigh*</b> Aye, I ken whit yer sayin', lassie. If it helps, ye willnae be alone when ye hae to gang.\" She answered, giving off a rather reassuring posture towards her friend, which seemed to be quite effective in putting Kitty at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you, Rahne.\" Kitty spoke, thanking her friend in the process, to which they wen on their merry way towards the Cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Wycombe Academy Cafeteria ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the Cafeteria, amongst the rabble and gossip of the other round pamper-wearing schoolgirls, one student sat by her lonesome, as if she was waiting for some friends of her's. In appearance, much like the headmistress herself, the teen girl sported a flowing mane of straight golden blonde hair, with shimmering blue eyes. However, much like the entire student body and school staff, she too wasn't spared from sporting a more chubbier physique and equally padded undergarments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she was in the midst of devouring a platter full of jelly-filled sprinkled donuts for breakfast, only to then hear an all too familiar voice, \"Oi! Illy! Yoo-Hoo!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few tables across from her, she easily became aware of a certain Scottish Mutant's greeting, to which she responded by turning her head briefly as if to non-verbally say, <i>\"Get over here.\"</i>, to which they complied with such an answer, waddling their way over to where she was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, they sat before the heavyset blonde, carrying their own assortment of sweets and edibles upon two trays for each of them. Of course, during her first week here at Wycombe, Rahne first introduced Kitty to one of her other friends, Illyana Rasputin. However, Kitty soon found out that Illyana was actually the younger sister of one of her friends back at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters; Peter Rasputin, also known as \"Colossus\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, upon hearing of this, Illyana was relieved to hear that her brother was doing quite well over in America, which garnered a great deal of respect towards the young Pryde. Obviously, Illyana gave off a warming smile towards Kitty, which showed how close they've became as friends, only to then resume her binge assault on the small hill of cuisines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to strike up a friendly conversation with her, Kitty spoke towards Illyana, taking a bite out of some blueberry pancakes as well, and said, \"So, Illyana...How's it going with your training? Learned any new skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not much, Kitty. Though, I did learn how to deflect energy blasts with my sword...\" She replied, bearing a thick Russian accent, which made Kitty feel a little nostalgic in regards to Colossus. After all, despite the man's Mutant abilities of Super Strength and being to turn his skin into a flexibly hard steel-like tissue, he was a rather \"Gentle Giant\" as it were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Kitty was actually surprised when she first saw Illyana's Mutant ability to harness and use magic, thus garnering her the now-famous nickname \"Magik\", with the word having a \"K\" instead of a \"C\" in it. Overall, much like her nickname's namesake, Kitty became rather curious with Illyana's more supernatural abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the trio conversed for about half an hour, including the part where Kitty was now in diapers just like them, to which Illyana offered her sincerest sympathies.

The three girls headed to the school's large gym where Betsy was waiting for them. Like most of the staff and girls, Miss. Braddock was rather obese, weighing in around 350 pounds, though she still had somewhat of a hourglass figure. She had purple hair and, like most of the staff, wore a thick diaper under her uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class. Today I've decided we would go for a mile jog around campus. Don't worry, I won't be keeping time so if you need to stop, you may and as long as you at least run most of the mile, you'll get your points.\" Betsy smiled as she grabbed her clipboard and led the girls out. Once they'd warmed up, Psylocke blew her whistle to start the mile. At first, Kitty did surprisingly well, despite her slightly cumbersome waddling run due to her new diaper. However, by the half mile mark, she was wheezing and panting heavily, sweat rolling down her face. By the time the mile was finished, Kitty was among only three girls to have made it all the way. The other two being Rahne and Illyana. The second they finished, the trio flopped onto the ground, gasping, panting and moaning in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha'... was... bloody... hell!\" Rahne gulped, her tongue lolling out like a wolf as she panted heavily. \"I... agree. I... wish... Miss. Braddock would... let me... just teleport with... my... portals.\" Illyana groaned, laying on her back. \"Man... I probably... shouldn't've eaten... those last... 10 blueberry... pancakes. My belly's killing me.\" Kitty moaned in agreement. Psylocke waddled over with a smile. \"Well done, lassies. You completed the mile in good time.\" She said. Then she turned to the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies. Tomorrow we'll take an off day as most of you did manage to do most of the mile today. Let's head back in and get ready for your next class!\" She called. Huffing, puffing and groaning, the girls all started waddling to the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it lunchtime yet?\" Rahne asked hopefully. Kitty looked at her watch. \"Nope. It's only 7:50, Rahne.\" Kitty confessed with a smile as Illyana laughed as they waddled after their classmates. \"Blast. I was hopin' ta sink me teeth into a juicy hamburger with cheese, pickles, ketchup, mustard, onion and bacon!\" Rahne groaned. Both Kitty and Illyana moaned in delight at the thought, their bellies rumbling in equal delight. \"Now you've done it, Rahne. How're we gonna focus on our next few lessons while we're waitin' for lunch?\" Kitty playfully teased her bestie as they changed into their uniforms, having reached the locker room. \"Sorry Kitty. It's jost that I'm starvin'. Runnin' a blasted mile does that to me belly.\" Rahne replied as her tummy rumbled in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting changed, the trio went to their second class, which was... </span></div></div>",

Nicknamed \"Domino\" due to her black and white hair and white face with a black spot over one eye, she was a fairly cool teacher in Kitty's eyes. Similar to Emma and Psylocke, Domino was obese and diaper clad. Unlike most of the teachers and students, she wore only a t-shirt and her thick diapers in class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, Rahne and Illyana all found their seats at the front of the class and Domino waited until the other girls were ready before beginning her lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning girls. Today we'll be covering basic geometry and algebra. Don't worry if you don't get it, I'll be happy to help you.\" she smiled kindly as she wrote a few problems on the board. The hour passed fairly quickly, with Kitty and the girls working on the problems Domino had written down for them. Finally, the bell rang and the girls got ready for their next class. \"Okay, remember girls, there'll be a quiz in two weeks so study hard!\" Domino called as they left with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty waddled with Illyana and Rahne to her next class, she let out a giant fart. \"Och! Kitty! That reeks!\" Rahne protested playfully, shoving her bestie's shoulder. Kitty blushed as she then froze, a look of pain on her face. \"Kitty? Are you alright?\" Illyana asked with concern. Kitty bent over, clutching her stomach as she squatted and started straining and grunting. A second later, with a very loud *POOOOOOOTTTTTTTTT!!!!* she pushed a large, hot, sticky and smelly load of poop into her diaper. After she finished, Kitty stood up and, upon noticing several girls looking at her aside from her besties, she went deep red. Without a word, she turned and raced away, tears of humiliation pouring down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn't stop running until she reached her and Rahne's dorm room and, not even bothering with her full diaper, flopped face first onto her bed and started bawling her eyes out with loud sobs. After a few minutes, there was a knock on the door. \"Katherine, may I come in?\" Emma Frost's voice asked gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty sniffled and sat up, whining as she felt her poop squish against her plumper butt. \"C-Come *hic* in, Miss. Frost.\" she hiccupped sadly. Emma slowly waddled inside and smiled gently as she saw Kitty's bulging, poopy diaper. \"W-what's wrong?\" Kitty asked. Emma smiled as she sat down next to Kitty. \"Miss. Sinclair and Miss. Rasputin just told me what happened on your way to your next class. Are you alright?\" she explained with concern. Kitty hiccupped again before shaking her head in dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. I'm s-so e-embarrassed! I-I haven't pooped my pants since I was three! And now I j-just took a major dump in- in front of e-everyone!\" Kitty sobbed, burying her face in her hands as she kept crying. Emma gently rubbed Kitty's back reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright, Kitten. Everybody here has had a similar accident in or before a class since this curse began. I actually anticipated you would poop your diaper before or during lunch today.\" She confessed. Kitty looked at her, tears still rolling down her chubby face. \"R-really?\" she asked with one more hiccup. Emma nodded and gently hugged Kitty like a mother would a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright, Kitty. According to Miss. Rasputin, everybody was only staring out of sympathy. Not amusement or anger at you.\" She revealed. Kitty smiled despite her teary eyes. It cheered her up that her friends weren't laughing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why don't you change your nappy and take a nap? Tonight, I would like to have you eat with me in my private quarters.\" Emma smiled. \"Okay.\" Kitty sniffled as she got up and took her full diaper off and started cleaning up. \"I will tell your next few teachers that you wanted to lay down after your accident. They will understand since, like I said, this has happened before.\" Emma said reassuringly as she waddled out. \"Thanks, Miss. Frost.\" Kitty said as she taped her new diapee on and got dressed again. She then sunk onto her bed and decided on following Emma's advice about taking a nap before dinnertime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, Rahne and Illyana came in to check on Kitty as she woke up. Rahne's diaper was bulging and smelly while Illyana's was soaking wet and bulging with poop as well. \"'Ow're ya doin' Kitty?\" Rahne asked her bestie. Kitty smiled at her friend's concern. \"I'm doing much better. Thanks.\" she smiled. \"Miss. Frost told us you were having dinner with her tonight so we should make sure you don't eat too much. She said she's having the chiefs make a really big dinner a'fore the two o' ya.\" Rahne added with a smile. Kitty grinned as she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was lunch?\" she asked, having slept through it. \"It was good. Turns out Rahne's prediction about it being hamburgers was right. She pretty much licked her tray clean and you can smell the result in her diaper!\" Illyana joked with a smile. Rahne smirked and stuck her tongue out. \"Well, at least I didn't flood me nappy with pee like you did after a-drinkin' four cans of lemonade and soda!\" she retorted. Illyana blushed slightly. \"Yeah, that might not have been a good idea.\" she agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just giggled at her two besties playful jeering of each other. \"When did Miss. Frost say I should head down for dinner?\" Kitty asked after a moment as her two besties started getting changed into cleaner diapers. \"She said ye could drop in at anytime, lass.\" Rahne smiled as she finished putting a clean diaper on. Kitty nodded and, upon looking at her alarm clock, saw it was 5:56 P.M. \"Guess I should probably go now.\" she smiled nervously as she stood up. Rahne and Illyana both smiled assuredly to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinna fast yerself, Kitty. We've both had dinner with teach a'fore an' it's actually very nice.\" Rahne said as she hugged Kitty, their diapers crinkling loudly as they were pressed together. Kitty nodded, waved goodbye and waddled off to meet Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Kitty took a deep breath and did so. There was Miss. Frost, already seated at a large oak table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss. Pryde. Glad to see that you could make it.\" said Emma with a grin. Kitty nervously sat down across from Emma, her face stating that she was clearly nervous. Emma just gently patted Kitty's hand with hers. \"It is alright, Katherine. I am not going to bite your head off. I have dined with students before.\" she pointed out. Kitty blushed and nodded sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Miss. Frost. I'm just a little jittery.\" Kitty apologized. \"Perfectly understandable, Kitty. Now, I hope you enjoy our dinner tonight.\" Emma smiled as the chiefs came out with several trays of food. Hamburgers, fried chicken, steak and lobster. As well as desserts such as cake, pie, doughnuts, eclairs and all kinds of yummy treats. Kitty was so hungry, she feared she was going to start drooling over the food. Emma giggled slightly at Kitty's reaction, causing the brunette to blush deeply again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's eat!\" Emma smiled as she grabbed a large plate and started piling food onto it. Kitty quickly did the same. Once she had loaded her plate to overflowing, she used her knife and fork to cut a piece of chicken. However, to her surprise, Emma was eating a drumstick with her hands, loudly tearing chunks of meat off the bone. Upon noticing Kitty's surprise, Miss. Frost swallowed and belched loudly before smiling kindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not hold you against eating like you normally do, Kitty. You must be hungry.\" Emma smiled sweetly. Kitty thought for a moment and then, dropping her fork and knife, grabbed her own drumstick and began tearing equally big chunks off it, sauce and grease smearing her face as she did. After that, she grabbed a large scone and crammed it into her mouth, chewing loudly as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it taste so far?\" Emma smiled. Kitty swallowed loudly before answering. \"This has gotta be the best meal I've ever had!\" She smiled truthfully. Unknown to the young girl, her belly was now beginning to expand more, slowly forming into a large potbelly. \"I am glad to hear it, Kitty. Now, let's eat it all before it gets cold.\" Emma smiled as she went back to stuffing her mouth with scones, burgers and other foods. Kitty nodded and quickly followed suit, cramming 3 cheeseburgers, four doughnuts and 6 scones into her mouth at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo didn't have speak anymore as they scarfed down the mountain of food like crazy. Manners were tossed out the window as they chugged, chomped, belched, hiccupped, slurped and licked their way ahead , slowly shrinking the feast down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the entire table was littered with empty plates, pie tins, pitchers and glasses. \"Well *BBBURRRRPPPP* that was a very fine meal.\" Emma smiled with a large burp as she rubbed her enormous tummy, which gurgled and sloshed happily. \"And how was your meal, Kitty?\" she asked the equally stuffed and happy 13 and a half year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPP* Definitely... really yummy... Emma...\" Kitty panted after letting out an even bigger burp than Emma just had. She gently poked her now genuine gut as it gurgled in delight at being so full. \"Do you feel better?\" Emma asked Kitty as, huffing and puffing, the duo managed to stand up, sweating slightly as they did. \"Yeah I do.\" Kitty grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo then slowly waddled to the door of Emma's office. \" You should probably get back to your dorm, Kitty. It's nearly curfew and I doubt you want to be in detention on your second week here.\" Emma smiled. \"Thanks *Buuuurrrraaaappp* again for the *hic* meal, Miss. Frost. It really was awesome!\" Kitty smiled with another loud burp, this time with a hiccup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm *urp* glad you *hic* enjoyed *burp* yourself Kitty *hiccup*. Now, head off to your dorm please.\" Emma smiled back, giving Kitty a fleeting hug before gently pushing Kitty towards the hallway. Kitty smiled, gave a wave, and waddled back to her dorm, burping loudly most of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRahne and Illyana were both waiting up for Kitty when she finally came in. \"Well, how'd it go, Kitty?\" Rahne asked kindly. \"It went really *uuuurrrrrpppp* well.\" Kitty smiled, unleashing another rumbling burp. \"We can see that.\" Illyana smirked, playfully poking her friend's tummy, causing poor Kitty to fart loudly again. \"Och! Seriously, Kitty. I think ya need ta see the nurse 'bout yon stinky booty!\" Rahne giggled teasingly. \"Maybe I should've passed on the baked bean burritos.\" Kitty agreed sheepishly, rubbing her belly as it gurgled and rumbled, happy to be full of such good food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio then talked for awhile before Illyana went to her dorm for the night. Rahne and Kitty got into their nightgowns, crawled into bed, bade each other goodnight and were soon sleeping soundly, Kitty often burping loudly in her sleep as she dreamed about food all night long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

A plate piled high with scones, a tray of doughnuts, a platter of pies, a giant platter of cinnamon rolls, a large chocolate cake, a tray of cupcakes and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... w-what is this, Miss. Frost?\" Kitty asked nervously as she eyed the banquet. Emma smiled as she sat down across from Kitty. \"This, my young lady, is a welcome present. I figured that that airplane food wouldn't be substantial. Would you like a bite?\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess it would be pretty rude to refuse. Sure, I'll bite!\" Kitty smiled, grabbing a few steaming scones. Upon tasting the first one, she started inhaling one after the other. \"Mmm! These're pretty good!\" Kitty chirped, her taste buds soaking in the delectable taste of the scones. Once she had licked the plate clean, she grabbed two chocolate glazed doughnuts and, ignoring Miss. Frost, shoved both into her mouth at once. With a rather loud gulp, she swallowed them almost whole before grabbing six more. Just as she started to inhale them, she noticed Emma watching with a smile. At this, Kitty blushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Um... I-I'm sorry, Miss. Frost. D-Do you w-want some?\" She asked sheepishly. Emma chuckled and shook her head. \"It is alright, Kitty. I already had lunch and I'm quite sure you can handle this banquet on your own.\" She smiled kindly. \"Okay.\" Kitty shrugged as she then stuffed the six doughnuts into her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Kitty, however, Emma Frost watched as the banquet started working on Kitty's systems, mentally noting to herself, \"Hmmm. She's begun to eat them. Excellent. And don't worry, my dear. I'm sure you'll become... 'acquainted' with the new weight on your bones in time. Along with a surprise or three as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, Emma had blocked her thoughts from having her agenda revealed to Kitty Pryde, who now seemed to be in a gluttonous trance, loudly scarfing down giant handfuls of sweets at a surprising pace. Of course, such binging was likely going to reveal itself on the young Pryde's physical form as her belly started to bloat and expand outward, not enough to stick out to be conspicuous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Emma anticipated this school year to be... \"interesting\". </span></div></div>",

Welcome to Doughnut Heaven. How may I help you?\" said the woman in a much too cheery tone for the job she had in Kitty's opinion. Kitty looked at the menu and took a few seconds before making her mind up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll have two gut punchers,\" Kitty said. The woman nodded and pulled two gut punchers out from the display case. Kitty was surprised by the size of them. They were as round as her head with pink and blue sprinkles on them. The woman put them into a to-go bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok miss, that'll be two dollars.\" said the woman in her cheery voice. Kitty was surprised by how cheap the doughnuts were given their size, but nevertheless handed over a ten and told the woman to keep the change. Once out of the shop, Kitty pulled one of the doughnuts out and took a bite. Her taste buds exploded, it was the best thing she'd ever tasted and she kept eating as she walked. By the time she got back to the mansion, she had finished both doughnuts and rubbing her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I totally need to go there again!\" Kitty said to herself, letting out a jumbo burp,still rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

I see you're in again,\" smiled the woman behind the counter. Kitty had been in the shop so often, she was on first name basis with most of the employees who were always cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Becky. Like, can I totally get my usual order?\" Kitty asked. Becky nodded and stuffed 12 doughnuts into a box. Three were of different kinds since Kitty's taste in doughnuts had greatly improved. she quickly thanked Becky and waddled out of the shop, her belly jiggling as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she'd reached the mansion, Kitty had eaten six of her 12 doughnuts, sprinkles and powdered sugar covering her mouth as she flopped onto the living room couch, making her belly jiggle as she laid on her back, using one hand to rub her belly and using the other to eat the rest of her doughnuts.</span></div></div>",

I think she's getting kind of...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jean could finish her sentence, there was a loud cracking sound. A second later, they saw Kitty waddling up to the door while using one hand to eat one of the doughnuts. But as she got up to the door and tried to go through, she found that she was stuck. Her big love handles pressed against the doorframe. She tried to free herself but couldn't. After a minute, she gave up, huffing and puffing and her round face slightly red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hey guys.

As she made herself comfortable, the other moved away to talk about her for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, Ah'm worried about Kitty.

Jean signaled for them to hide behind some barrels and they listened to the mad scientist talking to himself. \"Yes. My test subject is coming along perfectly, now that Miss. Pryde is growing huge. Soon, I will release my doughnuts around the world and everyone will be too fat to resist me taking over the world!\" laughed the mad scientist. The trio decided it was time to make their presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if we stop you,\" said Kurt as he, Jean and Scott revealed themselves. \"Ah, I see Kitty's little friends have come to put a stop to my plans.\" said the mad scientist with a huge smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will stop you,\" said Scott. But as soon as he stopped talking, a strange mist filled the room, making Scott, Jean and Kurt pass out. The scientist walked over to them smirking. \"Don't worry you will all wake up soon with a little soreness.\" He smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis current situation had put a big dent in his plans. He would need to put his off hand monitoring and take on a more practical approach. Grabbing a large bag of doughnuts, he left for the X-Mansion. Upon showing up, he saw Rogue and Spyke arguing over something in the kitchen while Kitty was still laying on the couch, holding an empty bag of doughnuts. Smirking, the mad scientist went to the front of the mansion and started saying through an open window, \"Come on, Kitty. Don't you want some tasty doughnuts?\" said the mad scientist, waving the large bag of doughnuts back and forth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doughnuts...\" Kitty said in an almost trance like state as she managed to get up and waddled to the door, turning sideways so she could get through. She then followed the mad scientist, with him feeding her doughnuts as he led her to his mansion, which took awhile to get to. Once there, the scientist helped Kitty onto a large king sized bed as she munched on her doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the scientist ran into a problem. Kitty seemed to have entered an eating trance, an unforeseen side effect of having nothing to eat but doughnuts, though the scientist didn't mind this side effect, it also brought out another side effect. Due to being in an eating trance, Kitty didn't noticed she was peeing and pooping her pants due to forgetting about going to the bathroom. The scientist struggled to find away to fix this before deciding on putting her in diapers to deal with the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of Kitty snoring softly, he put her in a large thick diaper, taking time to lovingly jiggle her big belly and love handles. This diaper wasn't like normal ones. It was able to be cleaned after each use, even the wettest pee or stickiest poop couldn't stain it and it never wore out. It wasn't long before this task was done and he went back to his main mission of spreading his doughnuts around the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a month since Kitty ended up in the mad scientist's care. Though Kitty didn't seem to notice the passing time since she spent most of it eating or sleeping or, in some occasions, sleep eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad scientist was quiet happy with how much Kitty had grown. Her belly was now so big, it hung over the waistband of her diaper while her face was like a blob of dough with a double chin, plus her arms and legs were squishy and flabby, her fingers, hands, feet and toes were all plump and her boobs had swollen considerably as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to see if Kitty was still mobile, the mad scientist did an experiment in which he had her waddle to the living room. He found that, though she was able to do so, Kitty was left very out of breath and was quite slow. She then started eating the very big doughnut left for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the experiment, the mad scientist quickly changed into a smart suit. He had a meeting with a high ranking government official to get his doughnut franchise spread around the world. After checking to make sure that Kitty was still in an eating trance and had enough doughnuts to make her full, he started to leave, only for a thick cloud of smoke to appear in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smoke clear, he saw it was five mutant teenagers, three of who he recognized from the month before when they broke into his shop. All five were very shocked to see Kitty fat and diapered while Kitty started on another doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Kitty's as big as a pig,\" Rogue remarked, looking at her obese teammate and best friend. \"Why did you make our friend fat?\" Scott asked, glaring at the mad scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your friend is just helping me with my plan to conquer the world,\" smirked the mad scientist as he unleashed a pink mist. However, he was left confused by the fact it didn't have any effect on the five teenagers. He was even more shocked by the effect it had on Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Like, where am I? What's goin' on?\" Kitty asked, looking around in confusion at her friends and the mad scientist. When she looked down, she couldn't see her feet. Just her big ole belly. \"Like, why am I so totally fat?!?!?\" She asked, shaking her belly and thus causing it to jiggle and bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vell explain later,\" Kurt said as he and the others began fighting the mad scientist. Despite their efforts, the man was quite slippery and managed to avoid their physical or telekinetic attacks. As he got near Kitty, she saw her chance and threw herself at him. Before he could move, Kitty belly flopped on him, knocking him out cold. Scott and Kurt quickly heaved her up while Jean and Spyke quickly tied up the mad scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys. So, like, what happened?\" Kitty asked, still getting used to her girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, you were used as a test subject by the scientist dude who wanted to make everybody fat so he could rule the world.\" Spyke explained, having been told of the man's plan by Scott, Jean and Kurt after the trio had returned to the mansion a month prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, okay,\" Kitty said, clearly still confused over the whole ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kitty... are ya wearin' a diaper?\" Rogue asked, trying and failing not to laugh at how silly Kitty looked in the extra large diaper. \"Like, I totally don't know why.\" Kitty said in embarrassment, her round cheeks blushing deep bright red as she poked the undergarment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure that out later,\" Kurt smiled as he teleported the gang home, leaving the mad scientist to the authorities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later found Kitty heading to Bayville Mall to hang with her friends. Though she had dropped most of the weight, returning her face, boobs, arms, feet, legs, butt, hands, toes and fingers to normal, she nevertheless sported a rather large belly that hugged her shirts and sweaters. She also retained her jumbo appetite as well. Despite this, she was happy this way and her friends knew and supported it. Kitty was still able to go on missions and was actually still fairly agile despite her remaining fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unknown to the other X-Kids, Kitty also still wore the thick, cleanable diaper she'd been introduced to by the mad scientist. She did so because she found it very comfy and it made her feel safe. </span></div></div>",

They'd decided it would be a nice treat to go get ice cream together. They were looking through the menus together, trying to decide on what each of them wanted. \"Wow. Like, these flavors look totally amazing!\" Kitty smiled, showing a picture of a bowl of strawberry ice cream with chocolate sauce, earning a hungry stare from the other X-Kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. Not to mention they have very large ice cream sundaes here. They look incredible.\" Scott agreed, showing the others, who licked their lips in hunger as they eyed the image. This gave Rogue an idea as she stared at the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. Ah dare ya to eat an entire sundae by yourself without any help from us. If ya do, Ah'll give ya 5 bucks.\" Rogue offered with a smirk. Kitty thought about it. On one hand, the picture made the sundae look massive. But then, on the other, 5 dollars was 5 dollars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that five dollars is totally mine!\" Kitty smirked back as she closed her menu. After waiting a few seconds after Scott got up to place their orders before returning to take his seat next to Jean. A few minutes later, a waitress arrived with five bowls of ice cream: mint for Jean, chocolate for Kurt, strawberry for Scott and two butter pecans for Rogue and Spyke. Then, she turned to Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bring your order in just a second,\" smiled the waitress as she went back, leaving Kitty to watch her friends eat their ice creams. A minute later, the waitress arrived and placed a massive sundae in front of Kitty. It had large scoops of ice cream, which were drenched in hot fudge sauce, a generous amount of whipped cream and a huge red cherry on top. Kitty's mouth was watering and her friends were shocked by the size of the sundae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! There's no way ya can eat all'a that!\" Rogue smirked, already gloating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, nope! That five dollars is totally mine!\" said Kitty, grabbing her spoon and digging in. Her taste buds exploded with flavor. She kept eating and eating until a half-hour later, the sundae was gone, leaving a very green looking Kitty clutching her bloated belly, her face filled with pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? Are you alright? You don't look so good.\" Kurt said with concern for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally fine...\" said Kitty. She was then interrupted by herself slapping her hand over her mouth as she felt bile raising in her throat while feeling herself starting to gag, making her cheeks puff up, but Kitty managed to swallow it down, releasing her hand and letting out a large burp. \"Excuse me.\" said Kitty and then she turned to Rogue. \"Like, pay up.\" Kitty said with a smug smile, despite her belly's pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah still can't believe ya managed ta eat it all,\" Rogue said, rolling her eyes as she forked over the money and Kurt and Scott helped Kitty out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yeah. But it totally tasted amazing! I have to, like, totally do this again,\" said Kitty as she followed her friends out of the shop.</span></div></div>",

Nothing major, just five pounds. None of her friends noticed this because they spend 99% of the time together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day the gang decided to visit the ice cream parlor again for another treat after a busy week as they took their seat in a booth. \"I still can't believe you managed to eat a whole sundae last week,\" Jean said with a giggle as she looked over the ice cream menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But it tasted totally amazing,\" Kitty said, licking her lips as she imagined the sundae despite the fact that she'd almost thrown up all over the table the last time she'd had it. Scott then had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. I'll bet you 40 dollars that you can't eat two of those sundaes,\" said Scott with a smug grin, remembering the state Kitty had been in after eating just one last week. Kitty thought about it. Two sundaes were a lot to eat, but her appetite had been increasing over the past week. Plus, she could use the 40 dollars to buy something. After a couple more seconds of thinking, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept your dare,\" Kitty said with a smirk. Jean went over and placed the order and returned a minute later. After ten minutes, two waitresses came to the table. One was holding the rest of the group's orders while the second held Kitty's two large sundaes similar to the one she'd ordered last time. After saying thanks to the duo, the rest of the group ate their ice creams while watching Kitty as she devoured the first sundae, getting hot fudge all over her face. But as she started the second one, she slowed down, starting to feel full. But she still ate and ate until the last sundae was gone, leaving Kitty looking very green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I lost 40 dollars,\" sighed Scott as he handed Kitty the money. Kitty was about to retort but she then felt bile raising in her throat. She quickly got up, grateful to have chosen to sit next to the booth's opening, and ran off to the bathroom surprisingly quick for being so bloated like she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the bathroom, she entered the nearest cubical and threw up straight into the toilet, brown liquid hitting the water. After a few minutes, Jean and Rogue entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Kitty?\" Jean asked, looking at her bloated friend bent over the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like, I totally think I got it all out of my system.\" Kitty said as Rogue helped her up and back to the rest of the group.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole month since Kitty had done her second sundae dare. Ever since that day, Kitty had been making multiple trips to the ice cream parlor daily, mainly getting ice cream cones. This had led to a massive change in her weight and appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly now hung over the waistband of her way too tight pants, her boobs had gone up at least two cup sizes while her face had gotten a bit rounder with chubby cheeks and a double chin coming in. All her friends had noticed Kitty's change in weight, but had decided against saying anything that might hurt their friend's feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something her friends didn't know. Due to having accidents in her pants, Kitty had resorted to wearing diapers, which had two benefits in her mind. One was she didn't have to stop eating when she needed to use the toilet plus it made her feel more comfortable. One day, Kitty was back in the parlor with her friends when Jean had a small smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. I bet you can't...\" Jean began, but was interrupted by Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, let me guess... you totally wanna bet that, like, I totally can't eat a whole sundae.\" Kitty said, rolling her eyes. Eating a whole sundae had become such an easy task for her at this point, she could probably finish two and still have room for at least one ice cream cone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was gonna bet you couldn't eat a whole banana split,\" Jean said, pointing to a picture on the menu, making Kitty drool slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, bring it on!\" said Kitty with a confident smirk as Scott went to place their order and returned to the group. After a few minutes, two waitresses carried the banana split over and placed it in front of Kitty, who was surprised by the size of it. It had three bananas, several scoops of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream, hot fudge and a big spray of whipped cream on top, complete with a cherry on top. Suddenly, Kitty didn't feel confident about eating it, but nevertheless, Kitty grabbed a spoon and started to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, Kitty had managed to eat half of the banana split before she started to rub her belly. Seeing that their friend needed help, Spyke and Rogue started cheering her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon K-girl! You can do it!\" Evan said encouragingly to Kitty. \"Listen ta him, Kit! Ya can't let that oversized dessert beat ya!\" Rogue agreed with an equally encouraging smile. Feeling a bit better and having freed up some room in her belly due to using her diaper, Kitty grabbed her spoon and started to eat the rest of the banana split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she leaned back, rubbing her belly with hot fudge sauce on her cheeks and bits of ice cream on her shirt and sweater. \"Wow. I can't believe you actually ate all that,\" Jean said, a little surprised by how much Kitty had eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just smirked, still rubbing her swollen belly and thinking that she was getting very good at this eating ice cream thing as Kurt helped her up from the booth and she waddled after her friends.</span></div></div>",

She put on even more weight. Her belly had grown bigger along with her boobs and butt and she had fully developed a double chin that wobbled as she talked and a third one was sneaking up on her. She also had to upgrade her wardrobe due to popping the button of her pants while eating one of her sundaes. She had also gotten a bigger sweater and t-shirt, but they still seemed very tight, highlighting her belly and love handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even had to get bigger diapers to contain her growing butt, though Kitty still seemed pretty oblivious to her massive weight gain. She thought it was only a few pounds at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was lying on the couch watching TV, the remote control laying on her belly when suddenly her belly let out a massive rumble. \"Wow. Like, I totally better grab something to eat. It's totally almost dinnertime.\" thought Kitty as she got up and waddled to the kitchen to start making herself dinner, even though it wasn't anywhere near dinnertime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with her visits to the ice cream parlor, her appetite at home had grown as well, making her eat more often and larger amounts. Kitty finished making her dinner, which looked like it could feed three people and started to eat it quite messily, with some of it getting on her clothes and face. Kurt walked past and rose an eyebrow, but didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Kitty was laying in bed, trying to sleep, but she was feeling too hungry to sleep. Rolling over, she saw that her clock read midnight. \"Hmm... Like, I totally guess a quick midnight snack totally couldn't hurt.\" Kitty thought as she got out of bed, her pink pajama t-shirt clinging to her belly and her matching shorts looking like they were going to burst at any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty waddled out of her room, going slow as possible to try and not wake anyone up. When she got to the kitchen, she started to make a sandwich with cheese, ham, tomato, lettuce, mayo, five pickles, lots of ketchup and an olive on top while also grabbing a carton of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was awakened by creaking floorboards and quickly jumped out of bed, following the sound and found a light in the kitchen. Peeking her head in, she saw Kitty gulping down her massive midnight snack and downing a carton of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. This is gettin' outta hand,\" Rogue said quietly, rolling her eyes as she left Kitty to enjoy her midnight snack. The next day, Rogue met her friends in the kitchen, except for Kitty, who was still sleeping. \"Hey. Is it me or is Kitty gettin' really fat lately?\" Rogue asked as she grabbed a cinnamon roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is getting pretty big. Yesterday I walked by and she was eating a meal that would feed three people,\" Kurt said, a little worried for his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' last night Ah saw her eatin' a large sandwich and downin' an entire carton of milk,\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we should say something?\" Jean asked  just as they heard the sound of creaking floorboards and a few minutes later, Kitty waddled in. \"Hey guys. Like, what're you talking about?\" She asked, waddling over to the fridge and opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, we need to talk to you about something...\" Scott started, trying to find a nice way to say that Kitty was getting fat, but was interrupted by Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, you're gettin' fat an' eatin' a ton,\" Rogue said, poking Kitty's belly, her finger sinking into Kitty's belly fat, which caused Kitty to slap her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you guys talking about? I'm totally not getting fat. I, like, only put on a few pounds at the most,\" Kitty said, in denial of her about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are getting fat and you've been eating everything. You really need to cut back,\" Kurt said, earning nods from the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you guys are totally just being mean,\" Kitty said, grabbing a bag of Cheetos and waddling away in a huff, leaving her friends very confused and all promising to help Kitty loose weight. </span></div></div>",

Every day for breakfast, she would have a stack of pancakes covered in maple syrup and a whole box of doughnuts with mixed kinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually also had a bunch of snacks to tie her over until lunchtime where she had three PB&amp;J sandwiches, 12 chocolate chip cookies and a large soda to wash it all down. And when dinnertime arrived, Kitty usually ate fourths of whatever was being served except for fruits and vegetables, which she wouldn't touch. During one meal, Scott decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, you really need to cut back on the meals, plus all the junk food you've been eating.\" said Scott, causing Kitty to pause in the middle of eating her fourth plate of pasta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Scott. You really do need to cut back like we told you last week. You're getting even bigger.\" said Jean, who was sitting closest to Kitty and was poking her finger into Kitty's much bigger belly, her finger sinking into the flab. Kitty slapped her hand away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I'm, like, totally not fat and second of all, I'm totally not addicted to junk food.\" Kitty said, grabbing her plate of pasta and waddling away, eating her pasta as she did. As she reached her room, she was slightly out of breath. As she laid down on her bed, she noticed a leftover chocolate bar poking out of her underpants drawer. This gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, if my friends totally have a problem with me eating junk food, I'll just, like, totally hide it in my room.\" Kitty thought to herself as she started picking places to hide her junk food. She then waited until midnight when everybody was asleep and then waddled down to the kitchen, grabbed several types of junk food and then carried them back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the gang walked into Kitty's room while she was out. They were looking for a couple of study notes Kitty had agreed to let them look over for an upcoming test. After a couple of minutes looking, Rogue grew bored and decided to sit on Kitty's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her butt touched the bed, she felt something crumpling. She quickly jumped up and pulled the blankets back to reveal a smooshed banana cream pie. \"Okay. That's just plain gross,\" said Rogue, lifting the destroyed pie up to show the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Kitty's been hiding junk food?\" asked Kurt, raising an eyebrow. \"Looks like it. We can't let her keep it. We need to find the rest. Start looking.\" Scott ordered. Everybody started to look. After a few minutes, Jean found a massive stash. There was several types of junk food. Spyke grabbed a bag and started putting the junk food in the bin just as Kitty waddled in and saw her friends destroying her junk food supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you guys doing?!?!?!?\" Kitty shouted, shocking that her friends were doing. Kurt decided to speak up since he was the more diplomatic of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Kitty, ve are doing this for your own good. You've got a junk food problem and ve are just trying to help you.\" Kurt said in a calming tone, trying to get his friend to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO YOU'RE NOT! LIKE, YOU'RE DOING THIS TO HURT ME!\" Kitty screamed, stomping her foot and causing her whole body to jiggle like jelly. \"You know what? Forget you guys! Like, I'm totally going to school!\" Kitty screamed, waddling away to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",
