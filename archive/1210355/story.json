In the city of Geonopolis a strange new invention is founded.  It has the power to rearrange matter to a small size and preserve it's functional aspects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a natural step on from Teleportation.  Teleportation allowed the transportation of matter between two points but now the Center for Research in Trade, based out of Genopolis University has discovered that it is extremely useful for the downsizing of containers used in sea, land and air post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe technology was being used well.  It was directly linked with the drop in price of imported goods and revolutionized storage facilities.  This was the case until a handful of rouge scientists (only known as The Rose Group) took the technology to use as their own.  The Goverment then took direct action by using the technology for it's secret services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in a world of uncertainty the citizens of Genopolis will have their lives changed forever by the The Rose Group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--//--</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> All storyline imports are now complete.

You'd been watching the show since it first came on TV, enjoying the way that it played on the minds of everyone in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the door and are offered a seat by a receptionist.  Not sitting down for long, you are soon invited into another office and offered another seat.  You are now sitting directly opposite the show's two hosts Stew and Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you at last Colin.\" Jackie smiled warmly.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the show mate!\" Stew came around and shakes your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're both in suits, Jackie in a smart cut suit for women and Stew in a hybrid of surfie and blue suit.  You felt a little under dressed in your t-shirt, trainers and track pants.  You would have changed but work kept you back a little longer this afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems you match all our criteria.\" Jackie said as she read through a heap of paper \"We contacted your work to make sure you were fit enough for the job, hope you don't mind.\" Before you could speak Stew started,<br>\r\n\"Colin, Big Brother needs something to spice it up each time around.  We've had just about everything now but recently we were approached by a group who offered to give us a new exciting twist!\" You can see by the look on his face that you are somehow going to be the twist \"It's called 'mouse in the house' and well buddy, you're the mouse.  Let me show you how that works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can protest Jackie hits a button under your desk and the chair vibrates slightly.  You yelp and fall on the floor with pain.  You wake up looking around.  You hear Stew's voice again,<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Colin, you're the first ever housemate to be one inch tall!\"<br>\r\nYou try to run but his huge hand picks you up by the shirt coller and lifts you to his face.<br>\r\n\"So seeing as how you're obviously going to be in alot of danger you get to pick the set of rules:<br>\r\n  A) you can be rewarded the one million dollars if you manage to stay unseen by the housemates for the whole month that they're in there or<br>\r\n  B) you can be discovered by the housemates and used as a form of communication between the two houses, oh yah, we've got a two house setup again\"<br>\r\nYou tremble as his hot, moist breath washes over you.

All you can remember is doing the exam, handing it in and waking up one inch tall on a lab bench. You were put in the care of a scientist who helped you adjust to your new size and have just been sold to a government intelligence organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Let the adventure begin!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The military intelligence woman puts you in a small but comfortable container. You feel exhausted from the stress of not even getting to say good bye to the only person you can ever remember knowing. You begin to sob and gently fall off to sleep.<br>\r\nYou wake up in a very fancy room on a large wooden desk. You stand up and look over to a small set of cloths arranged for you on the desk. A small label has been placed on them.<br>\r\n\"Please put these on and press the button next to your capsule.\"<br>\r\nYou look around and can't see anyone and change into the small suit. It fits perfectly. The black dress shoes are as far as you can tell miniaturised like you. You look inside them and see that they are a size 9 just like your shoes. The same is true with all the cloths. The suit is Hugo Boss! You put on the outfit without further delay and look at your reflection on the shiny silver surface of the capsule.<br>\r\nWith your fancy suit on you go and stand on the button and wait. Eventually the door to the room opens and you see the woman who purchased you and a man who is also wearing a suit. He stands in front of the desk as she sits down in the chair.<br>\r\n\"Now it is my understanding that you currently have no name\" The woman glares down at you<br>\r\n\"No, I don't.\"<br>\r\n\"Well the agent you are soon to be assigned to will give you a friendly name but you are now about to start training as a picoAgent. At one inch tall you are the perfect size to get in and gather information undetected.\" She pauses to let you take that in. \"Your agent code is P9 is that understood?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You say.<br>\r\nYou suddenly realise that you don't even have to raise your voice, they can both hear you.<br>\r\n\"This is agent 4. You have been assigned to assist him in future missions but for now he has six months dedicated to training you. Understood?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\"<br>\r\nAgent 4 now speaks.<br>\r\n\"H are you sure it is right for me to take this task on now?\" he sounds annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Yes it is and I never want to hear you speak without permission again.\" she snaps back.<br>\r\n\"P9 you will have noticed that we can hear you. You have in your suit some of the latest technology created and miniaturised by the same lab who brought you to us. We all have ear pieces in which allow us to communicate with one another. They are embedded deep in our ear canal so they remain unseen. All you need to do to talk to someone, even if they can't see you or are in the next room is think of them and speak, your suit will automatically rout the audio to the agent's earpiece. That's all you need to know for now. If you get into your capsule Agent 4 will take you to his quarters.\" She returns to her seat and looks over at her laptop as you get into the capsule and Agent 4 picks up the matchbox sized container, places it into his top pocket and exits.<br>\r\n-//5 minutes pass//-<br>\r\nYou feel yourself placed down onto a desk. You walk out and look at the huge agent. He would be about 25, only 4 years older than yourself.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you decide to break the silence \"I guess we should get to know each other\"</span></div></div>",

You reach a mountainous lounge. The room shakes as the bursts of a large group of men erupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognise the laughter as that of the footballers, one of whom is mark. You walk around the front of the lounge and gaze up at the legs of an enormous college student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab onto Tom's Jeans and crawl up the giants leg, unbeknownst to him. When you reach his leg, laughter erupts again.  Tom kicks his legs up, knocking you between Mark's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room at the others, all gigantic men with an army of empty beer bottles strewn across the room leading to their evident drunken behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one beside your giant lets out an enormous belch, shaking the room almost. Your footballer giant, laughing so hard, causes you to tumble down the lounge cushion and land with a thud on his tight package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of a drunk 20 year old who enjoys his beer flows over you. He booms to the room \"You thought that was loud?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe thigh beside you rises up as he lifts his leg, cocking it for a gunshot of a fart. The explosion shakes you to your core, knocking you over. You gag in its stench. The giant stands up, laughing waving his hand to futiley remove the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the open seat available, a number of giants vie for the prime position, where you are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark is the quickest of them all. To your horror he turns around. He is only in his singlet and low riding board shorts. He starts to sits down hard on top of you. The soft material of the shorts defining his ass. Tonnes of best mate now unknowingly bear down on you.</span></div></div>",

Trapped on the table you are eye level with his groin as he slowly pulls the zipper of the fly down with a series of metallic clanks which rip through your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gut wobbles as he drops the shorts to the floor, showing off his impressive cock straining in a state of half erectness beneath the shiny material of his satin boxers. He steps out of the shorts and closer to you, his smell filling your nostrils. He stands proudly, his hairy, flabby thighs bursting from their tiny boxers as you see a twitch from his hidden cock. One of his hands disappears behind him as he scratches his enormous arse crack. As the hand returns, the smell of his crevasse follows sickeningly. The same hand scratches his hairy scrotum from outside the satin, releasing another puff of disgusting stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRic's eyes transfix on you as he unknowingly scratches his groin, you begin to worry about what tonight will bring</span></div></div>",

It's Robbie, and he's huge! You walk out the door in the window to his giant face. Looking back you can see that the room is in under the scales.<br>\r\n\"Ok Em all you do now is get in that car and off you go to what's now 10 minutes ago. If that's a bit much just hop onto the red circle and you'll be changed back to normal\"<br>\r\nYou walk back in and get in the car then, snap, your looking at yourself watching Robbie going to get the time machine.

You pick it up and take it to your room. In setting it on the floor the thought strikes you. Why not just have a little look into James' life? See if he does work in the bank. You look out of the room and notice James getting up and going to the toilet. You close the door and once all is settled you set the machine to eight hours back so 3:14 and flick open the location panel and use the little GPS display to select the bank. You shrink down and just as you get into the car you hear a loud bang. A fault?<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nYou arrive at the bank and have half an hour to look for him. You search both floors and then notice a door marked as requiring a special pass. You wait around and who should come out but James. You zip in as the door closes and see a computer with two monitors and a progress bar. In your remaining five minutes you can see that he is downloading all the transactions off everyone in the country. He walks back in and you see him put his pass down. The logo it has on it is definite. James isn't a usual employee, James monitors the bank transactions of thousands to make sure that crooks can't transfer any and also keeps transactions between government agencies secret. You also see that there are a number of items marked as being in safe deposit.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nSnap! Your back. You run to the red circle and push the button. A red light comes on, \"Error 484, Regeneration platform blocked.\". You walk out and look up at James. His now huge dress shoe planted firmly on the top of the scales.

If you don't keep adding you will be bumped off the list (ie I'm trying to encourage consistency rather than quantity).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Newbies</i>, this is a good chance for exposure.  I am going to comment on your style and ideas<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will announce the winners on this page.  I will not limit wins in any way other than making sure that I don't go Giftprupt in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cGreen\">Last Update:</span>13/02/07<br>\r\n1 - <br>\r\n2 - <br>\r\n3 - <br>\r\n4 - <br>\r\n<span class=\"cBlue\">Bonus Key:</span><br>\r\n<b>O</b>riginal concepts.<br>\r\n<b>D</b>escriptive writer.<br>\r\n<b>S</b>tyle is generally good.<br>\r\n<b>T</b>ies in well with other story lines.<br>\r\n<b>F</b>ollow on choices allow for growth in the story.<br>\r\n<b>M</b>.
