Not Again!\" From seeing her sister's reaction to her own slowly altering physique, Cree began to show signs of concern out of her own sibling instincts, despite the clear fact that she and Numbuh 5 were enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Abigail? You okay there?\" Cree asked, cautiously approaching her younger sibling, unsure on what was happening at the moment. But suddenly, Numbuh 5 snapped at her older sibling, showing off signs of animalistic behavior, as she growled, \"Of course I'm not okay, Sis! I'm turning back into a Were-Dog!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? A Were-Dog?\" Cree scoffed, cocking an eyebrow while putting her hands on her hips, obviously thinking that Numbuh 5 was making up some sort of excuse for what was happening to her. However, unlike her younger sibling, Cree hasn't encountered something such as the infamous Were-Dog curse before, despite being familiar with the concept of Werewolves from numerous monster movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*canine-like growl* I'm not joking around, Cree! My teacher, Mrs. Thompson, was turned into a Were-Dog by some stupid curse. She managed to turn several other kids, including Valerie, into Were-Dogs. Heck, she even turned me into a Were-Dog just so she and her fellow mutts would eat my friends' homework! Dang it, I thought that Numbuh 4 and I stopped that curse!\" Numbuh 5 replied, letting out an angry dog-like growl when Cree didn't believe what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, Numbuh 5 felt a sudden surge of pain, causing her to scream and grunt in pain, as she fell onto her knees. Forced to watch the events unfold before her very eyes, Cree could only watch in shock and disbelief, as she saw her little sister's body go through another transformation, where Abigail's feet  grew and change  to look like the same feet she had in her Were-Dog form, tearing through her shoes with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, light brown fur began to sprout from Numbuh 5's canine feet, as the KND operative's lower body slowly but surely began to look more like her Were-Dog form, sprouting a tail in the process. However, from Cree's perspective, as much as she wanted the KND to fail, the teenager could see that her younger sister actually was right; Numbuh 5 was turning into a Were-Dog. </span></div></div>",

SHARING THIS DOCUMENT WITHOUT THE SOOPREME COMANDER\u2019S EXCPICT PERMISSION WILL MARK YOU AS A TRAITOR.<br>\r\nI\u2019M SORRY, BUT THE FILES OF THIS DOCUMENT ARE THAT IMPORTANT.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOperatives,<br>\r\nIf you are reading this, then you have been chosen for a mission that, depending on how it goes, will shape the fate of the world for people of all ages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nServeal years ago in Japan, a mysterious gas-like substance spread throughout Tokyo, and drove adults and children alike into a frenzy. While the KND was able to handle it with some help where the adults couldn\u2019t(to the credit of Japanese Cops, they were effective in rounding up the calmed down people), it wasn\u2019t just a simple supervillan plot. It was a odd occurrence, and our scientists set out to investigate it. They found out that the, for lack of a better term, gas, could be reproduced and purified into two things: a clean energy of sorts, and a super tough yet flexible material. This material and clean energy are used in all of our bases, and in [REDACTED].<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were fools to think we were the only ones to discover this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, it has come to our attention that group of evil adults called FAUST is aware of this gas, and is exploiting it for a much more sinister purpose: creating an army of Super Soldiers, referee to in their files as Kamen Riders. (Note: Kamen is Japanese for Masked) These Kamen Riders are immensely strong, more so then even an whole Squad of KND operatives, and have super-human level skills and powers. Worse, they are exploiting and harming children, teens and adults in their goals, and not every one of them makes it out alive. The horrible news, is that they are very very close to success. They already have several prototype Riders in use as field operatives, or ranking commanders. They\u2019ve gone after our squads in their local areas. They\u2019ve struck a deal with NAMBA Industrial Technology and Machines to mass produce the finished Kamen Riders, and plan to sell specificly designed Kamen Riders to the highest bidders. And they\u2019ve even got hands in the adult government to prevent and restrict them from interfering with FAUST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn essence, FAUST are warmongers, looking to revolutionise modern war, and place themselves at the top of the world while doing so. And they are very close to success If these Kamen Riders end up finished and massed produced, we will have a World War 4 that I doubt anything short of Recommising Grandfather will end, at least without significant causites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">WE CANNOT LET FAUST COMPLETE THEIR KAMEN RIDER PROJECT.</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mission, operatives, is to uttlerly destroy FAUST and all of it\u2019s work, and all it\u2019s ever stood for. Every base and lab must blown to bits, buried in enough rubble that adults won\u2019t even go near it. NAMBA\u2019s hand in this evil pie must be chopped off as well. Every single web that the spider of FAUST has spun must be burnt to ashes and the spider crushed beneath the boot of justice. For the sake of the Earth, children and all the innocent Teens and Adults, FAUST must be wiped off the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t back out of this. Failure of this mission will mean the destruction of everything you know and love. Report the Moon Base by 0530 hours. Failure to do so will mean your decommissioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSOOPREME COMMANDER<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNigel Uno grimmanced.

This includes candy, cake, soda, ice cream, and other sugary foods. Do not eat the unrecomended foods, which include onions, liver, asparagus, and a few other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.\tRemember, not every Adult is evil. In fact, some make useful, if unknowing and dimwitted, allies, as they are able to transport Operatives to mission destinations. Most Adults think that the KND is just a club of some sort, if they know anything of it. However, there are those who know otherwise. Examples of Evil Adults include Father, Mr. Boss, Crazy Old Cat Lady, Knightbrace, Count Spankulot, Fizz, and Ice Cream Men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are some more rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tI expect you to write your reports with the best spelling and grammar you can do.  I know very well that most of you can write better than Numbuh 4 can. HE has the WORST spelling I have EVER seen, and I have run this place for (Goes off on a tangent about how Numbuh 4\u2019s reports are the worst ever in the whole history of bad reports.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\tTry to use an acronym that sort of sums up the Operation.<br>\r\nExample: <b>W.H.A.T.I.F.</b><br>\r\n<b>W</b>hoever<br>\r\n<b>H</b>ad<br>\r\n<b>A</b>mazing<br>\r\n<b>T</b>hought<br>\r\n<b>I</b>s<br>\r\n<b>F</b>antastic<br>\r\n(Of course, if an acronym can\u2019t be thought up, use a mission title that tells what\u2019s going on.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.\tThanks to our safety devices, about the most damage you should receive from enemies are really big booboos, though full-body casts are not unheard of. Other injuries may occur of course, including getting Chickenpox, turned into the opposite gender, turned into animals, agified, zombified, being put under the curse that your teacher was placed under, getting spanked by Count Spankulot, and a few other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.\tBe on the lookout for KND operatives who are 13 or older who have not been Decommissioned, and had their memory erased.  These Teenagers are a serious threat to kids everywhere, as they know our secrets. Capture is a must.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, here are some of the Operatives you could encounter on your missions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSector V<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbuh 1: Aka, Nigel Uno. Leader of Sector V. Bald-headed, due to something that the Delightful Children From Down The Lane did to him, along with a bad haircut from his father. Is British-American. Can be paranoid at times, and has a habit of disregarding orders from his superiors, especially Numbuh 86\u2019s. Always tries to make sure his team is safe, and will do whatever it takes to help out other kids, even at the cost of having a personal life. His girlfriend, Lizzie Devine, often wishes that he\u2019d spend some time with her, instead of on KND duties. An only child, his father was once Numbuh 0, the first KND operative and creator of the organization (he has since long been decommissioned, though he was on two occasions briefly recommissioned). It was also recently discovered that Father is his uncle, and the Delightful Children From Down The Lane are his adoptive cousins (who were once KND operatives who were zapped by a delightfulizing device.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbuh 2: Aka, Hoagie P Gilligan. Team inventor and pilot. Chubby and has a habit of cracking puns, much to the annoyance of some of his teammates. Is interested in food much of the time, and is capable of taking Gramma Stuffum\u2019s food, which is highly unusual and disgusting, head on. Is very intelligent. Has something of a crush on Cree, Number 5\u2019s older, and evil, sister. Has a younger brother named Tommy, (Who was once an Operative, Numbuh T, but quit in order to save the whole KND from one of Father\u2019s attacks, and is now known as \u201cThe Tommy.\u201d)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbuh 3: Aka, Kuki Sanban. Japanese. Is very girly-girly. Has a large collection of Rainbow Monkeys, and is very knowledgeable of them. Is very friendly, but she can be very scary when she is angry (Turns into something like an oni (demon) and everyone runs away.) Has a younger sister who is cuter than her, but very cruel (She once transferred Count Spankulot\u2019s powers into a Rainbow Monkey to get revenge on Numbuh 2 for getting her grounded for life.) Has something of a crush on Numbuh 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbuh 4: Aka, Wallabee Beatles. Australian. Not the smartest tool in the shed. Has the WORST spelling and handwriting ever. Does poorly in every subject, except anything related to sports and fighting. Can be something of a bully at times, trying to force the others to do things his way when Numbuh 1 is not around. Has trouble swimming, to say the least (he can\u2019t swim and is afraid of the pool, though he did get over this fear to save his friends from their evil versions from an alternative universe.) He does not like anything girly-girly, though he does have a crush on Numbuh 3, but he has trouble explaining it. He also happens to be unlucky at times, such as when he snuck into the theater to see an R-movie, only to find out that it was a meeting for evil Adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbuh 5: Aka, Abigail Lincoln. Intelligent and laidback tomboy. Is of African American and French descent (Her mother only speaks in French, whenever she shows up. Her father sounds similar to Bill Cosby.) Is the Second-in-Command of Sector V. Tends to talk in the third person, saying things like, \u201cNumbuh 5 says we should just walk on in and ask for some ice cream.\u201d Is able to keep her head even in stressful situations, for the most part. Has an older evil sister named Cree, who was once a KND operative, whom Numbuh 5 looked up to. Was once put under a curse to become a were-poodle, and eat other kids\u2019 homework, but thanks to Numbuh 4 (and his bad homework) she was able to free herself of it. She is also something of a Candy Hunter, and will go on grand adventures to acquire it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you\u2019d best get going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, one more thing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kids Next Door- BATTLE STATIONS!</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, for more information, check out <br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Next_Door\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Next_Door</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://knd.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">http://knd.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a></td>",
