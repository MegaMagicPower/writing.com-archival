The twins are returning from the realm of the strange and surreal. They look at each other across their shared room. Smiling, they both get out of bed and put on some clothes. For Jale, he puts on the same outfit he always wears, a white shirt, blue jeans, black shoes, red frame glasses, and his gold/silver/ruby fox and sun amulet. Kazz on the other hand, adorns her person with a purple short-sleeve top, white jeans with a pink skirt, orange tennis shoes, and her bronze/platinum/sapphire wolf and moon talisman. Kazz turns to face her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good dream bro? All I got was a blank canvas. You?\" Kazz asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, nothing. Kinda weird though, we usually have tons of vivid dreams. And even though we both have eidetic memory, it appears we can't remember last night's dream. I wonder why.\" Jale replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a clue, but we can't let that little detail get us down. We'll be hanging out with Bit and Wren today after all.\" Kazz explains in an upbeat tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJale nods. And then...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hello everyone and welcome to my third interactive! This is a fun one that everyone can enjoy. Here is the gist of what is going one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJale and Kazz are brother and sister respectively. They are pretty normal. They're both smart, funny, kind, and fun loving. They hang out with their friends Bit and Wren a lot, playing video games, chatting, the usual. Normal right? That held true till now. Due to an unknown force, their dreams now become a reality. The effect only lasts a day and mental effects an be broken, but the possibilities of can happen are limitless. And you decide what happens. But first, lets meet the characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJale Unore: Male, 14, 6\" 7'. A nice guy, he strives to be his best in any respect. He has above average intellect and impressive strength. He has a nice relation ship with his sister, Kazz Unore. His best friends are Bit Dret and Wren Voz, and has a slight crush on Wren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazz Unore: Female, 14, 6\" 7'. A kind girl, she likes to help others when she can. She what you would call an out-of-the-box thinker and possesses impressive agility and reflexes. She has a great relationship with her brother, Jale Unore. Her best friends are Wren Voz and Bit Dret, and has a minor infatuation centered around Bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit Dret: Male, 14, 6\" 11'. A guy who likes to have fun and craves adventure, he is only happy when his friends are happy. He may have only average intellect, but he boasts nearly superhuman physical prowess. He likes to hang out with his best friends Wren, Jale, and Kazz, the latter of whom he loves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWren Voz: Female, 14, 6\" 2'. A sweet girl who never would harm a fly, she is a shy but fun kind of girl. She isn't that physically adept but she has a genius level intellect. Her best friends are Bit, Kazz, and Jale, the last of whom she admires greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with main four out of the way, let us get to.... The Rules!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nNo sex.<br>\r\nCursing allowed, but only when it makes sense and in moderation.<br>\r\nNo killing of any kind.<br>\r\nMake sure your grammar is in order.<br>\r\nAll changes to anyone or anything are strictly temporary. If you want it to last longer, it can last up to a few days in a row if it is a recurring dream, however each night the dream must differ from the one before it slightly.<br>\r\nVary what happens. Scenery changes, body changes, reality changes, all kinds. This story focuses on everything so try to keep it balanced.<br>\r\nKeep it original.<br>\r\nAny additional major characters must be ran by me and follow the same rules as everyone else.<br>\r\nAnything else, ask me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny break in these rules will be met with the appropriate response by me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I have a tendency to hand out gift points of varying amounts to those who make references, jokes, gags, and even fourth wall breaks. The amount all depends on how well put together they are and how funny they are. My humor I compasses all, so I'm not biased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, on with the story!</td>",
