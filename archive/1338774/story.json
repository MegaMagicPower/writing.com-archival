Where else can she do that without fearing extreme injury but here, with all the strange purple gems that let a person float?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so innocent. She was simply spreading her arms out, smiling as she was pushed up and defying gravity. She imagined flying over the ocean with no machine aiding her and nothing holding her back. She kept her eyes closed to make the near illusion more real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Gravity was mad someone was defying it. Maybe the gems gave of a type of radiation and had a side effect when a person was near them to long. Whatever the case, Blaze suddenly began to feel a strange warmth.

From under her fingers, she could feel her belly start to grow larger and tighter. Her eyes widened and she was stuck speechless. She felt her butt and it had began to grow too, as well as the space between her legs. Her back began to inflate and she started to round out, her legs and arms filling up slightly, but being pulled into her. Soon her cheeks swelled up, giving her face a chipmunk like look, though she could not blow the air or whatever it was filling her up out. Soon her body had become round and all it was doing was getting bigger,already passing the five foot mark, pulling her arms and legs in until only her feet, hands, and head were sticking out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, though a little afraid, was actually very relaxed and facinatind with her current change. As she grew, she felt more and more free with the world. She closed her eyes and smiled, enjoying herself even more than she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite nice...\" said Blaze to herself. \"I'm just a... balloon now. I have no worries now.

I feel good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young cat woman sighed and even started sleeping, as floating in the air was so peaceful. But she was too relaxed to realize that her inflation was actually not over : her body became even bigger and bigger, and soon, her hands and feet pulled back in, until only her head and huge body was left. She only realized that when her head inflated more than before. Blaze woke up, only to realize how huge her body now was, and that her cheeks were also getting bigger. She thought : <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?! I'm too big! Please, make it stop!

She stopped and backed up against a tree; it had been hours since she had last had something to eat and her stomach was begging for something, anything to devour. As luck would have it, her backing into tree caused a strange, apple like fruit to fall down. Blaze examined the fruit for a moment for she had never seen such a fruit before. Her stomach, once again began to beg and blaze now began to consider eating the fruit. However, having never seen the fruit before she was unsure of whether eating it was a good idea.  She picked up the fruit and sniffed it. It smelt amazing, like no over fruit she had ever come across. The temptation was too much and Blaze found herself sinking her teeth into it. It was delicious and sweet, the best thing she'd ever tasted by far. Her mouth watered as she proceeded to munch on the rest of the fruit. How had she never heard or come across this divinity before? <br>\r\n After eating the fruit, Blaze rubbed her belly. She noticed something odd, her belly stuck out a little bit. Blaze paused and wondered about how this was possible as she rubbed her belly more. Suddenly, her hunger returned and she picked more off the apple like fruit from the tree and began to chow down. Blaze's belly began to stick out more and form a cute little pot belly, her breasts began to swell as did her butt and thighs, however she remained completely unaware, her hunger and the fruit had become all that she could focus on. Soon, Blaze's clothes stated to strain against her new form. Blaze then snapped out of her trance. She looked around to make sure that no one had caught her gorging out like that, it would be so humiliating. Blaze then stared at herself in awe. What had she done to her body? She'd gotten huge. Her belly swelled out like a small beach ball, her breasts like melons, her butt was cushioned and her thighs had swelled by several inches. How would she explain this? How did this happen? Was it the fruit? Surely <i>fruit</i> couldn't do this to someone? <br>\r\n Blaze found it difficult to lift herself back up, her new weight made things difficult for her. She need to get help, perhaps the fox boy with the lab would be interested in this fruit? She takes a sample of the fruit and..</span></div></div>",

Lemme show you how to use some brute force around here...\" Hershey concluded, pressing her heavy belly down on Blaze's face to force it into several pies at once, Blaze sputtering as she swallowed several pies worth in one mouthful. \"*Mmmptth!*What the hell is- *Mmpth* Ohhh... *Gulp* Ooooooh... *BUUURRRPPP!\" The group slowly stepped back and admired their handiwork, watching as Blaze's eyes started to lose focus as <i>something</i> took its toll on her. There was a slight pause after her loud burp, with the girls anxiously watching as Blaze's head seemed to spin for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... More.\" She grabbed what remained of the several pies she has been force fed and devoured them with such ferocity that the tubby girl's eyes widened in amazement. \"More!\" Blaze grabbed another handful of pies, taking only a few bites to work her way through each fairly large dish. \"MORE!\" She got up on the table and started to scoop everything in reaching distance with her arms, lowering her head to maw her way through everything within her unsatisfiable mouth's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was the first to burst out laughing, reaching behind herself to reach a zip which undid the fat-suit she had been wearing. The others followed suit. \"This worked a little too well...\" Tikal pointed out as she revealed her normal slender frame, yet was quickly interrupted by Hershey. \"Nawww, we told her we had a <i>big</i> surprise for her birthday! Lets see how BIG that's gonna turn out to be!\" Mina approached Sally as she watched on with a mean smirk. \"This is fun and all Sal, but... Eh... Why'd we do this again?\"</span></div></div>",

The thought of such high places always made her feel a bit uncomfortable. She tried to shake it off by talking in a harsh voice: \"We don't have time for this! We must find the Sol Emeralds as fast as possible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Blaze.\" Sonic stretched his legs as he spoke, Blaze meanwhile taping impatiently on the ground. \"We have all time in the world.

They were standing at a place surrounded by water, a lot of pillars with unknown purpose spread across the place. Soon she was circling around the pillars, watching as Sonic quickly did some sit-ups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't we warm yet?\", she asked, mocking him. Suddenly, her foot touched something, and before she could react, the princess tripled over it. Struggling to keep balance, Blaze stumbled a few steps forward, head on, before she managed to stop. Sonic, interrupting his sit-ups, looked over at her, a grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\", he chuckled. \"Should we have warmed ourselves up earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\", Blaze yelled, quickly turning her head away.

A white ball was floating over its teardrop shaped head, the top of it being also white as well as the ends of its hands and feet. Two little blue wings spread from its back, flapping slowly as it sat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying it loud, Blaze had to admit it was kind of lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\", she asked, watching as it waggled its feet. \"It looks a bit like Cream's pet, Cheese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a chao.\", Sonic replied, walking over to it. \u201cThey need clean water and plants to live. I wonder why one is in a place like this?\u201d He lifted it up, holding the pink furball into the sun. \"Hey, little fella. What'cha doing here?\" It began to chirp, clapping with its tiny hands. Sonic started to tickle the chao. At first it only chuckled, but then burst out laughing after a while, the blue hedgehog quickly joining in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was getting annoyed. \"Leave it alone! We've got to search the emerald.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic sighed. \"All right, princess party pooper.\" He put the chao back on the ground, patting it on the head. \"Bye bye, little buddy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Blaze's turn to sigh. \"I wish you would finally grow up.\"</span></div></div>",

They synchronously jumped onto a platform, quickly hopping onto higher ground as it fell apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell next time, better watch where you are going.\u201d, he threw back, jumping over some spikes. A robot was a few feet ahead, some rings floating over him. It immediately shot when seeing the duo which evaded in different directions. While Blaze destroyed the enemy with a flame spin, Sonic jumped over his head, collecting the golden goods. Landing next to Blaze, they both activated their boost at the same time, accelerating as they entered a looping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re too soft.\u201d, Blaze sighed, gravity seemingly not affecting them as they ran upside down. After leaving the looping, they were send through the air by a bumper. Hand in hand, they performed some combo-tricks to build up boost energy, before they fell into a room. Immediately all exits closed, and the alarm went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnemy room!\u201d Two large hammer-robots fell from the celling, slowly moving towards our heroes. Standing back-to-back, Blaze and Sonic examined their surroundings. There were two platforms on each side of the room. Blaze glanced at Sonic and nodded, then both jumped onto the robots\u2019 heads. Immediately they bounced up again, narrowly escaping the swing of their hammers as they were flying through the air. Both landed on a platform while the hammers hit the ground, and they immediately jumped back again to get another hit. The robots\u2019 heads began to smoke, electricity surrounding their bodies as they pulled back their arms to prepare another strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a somersault, Blaze turned in mid-air, facing her robot again as she landed. She bent down, ready to deal the finishing blow, when she saw something pink a few feet in front of her. It was the chao, innocently crawling over the ground. Sitting up, it looked through the room with big, curious eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze wondered what it did here, she suddenly noticed a movement from the robot who was swinging his hammer again \u2013 this time however not at her, but the pink little chao! \u201cWatch out!\u201d she called, rushing forward. Just as the hammer was about to stomp it, Blaze grabbed the tiny creature at full speed, and jumped forward. She felt the shock-wave as the hammer hit the ground behind her, sending her flying through the robot\u2019s legs. Embracing the chao, the princess turned her back towards the wall, closing her eyes as she awaited the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBumping against the wall, Blaze fell to the ground, pain surging through her body. \u201cOuch\u2026\u201d she murmured. Just then, the robot turned around. It wanted to deal another blow when a blue ball of light dashed against its head. The colossus exploded, falling back with his hammer still raised up, landing right before its brother which shared the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic landed on his feet, looking back to make sure the robots were destroyed. Just then the alarm went off, and the door that led out opened. Sighing, he turned towards Blaze. \u201cSeriously, do I have to do all the work now?\u201d, he joked, a big grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnorting, Blaze sat up, leaning against the wall. \u201cWell look who followed us.\u201d, she said in an angry voice. The chao was lying in her arms, laughing as if nothing had happened. It was looking up towards Blaze\u2019s head with happy eyes, its arms stretched out as if to hug her. \u201cI told you you are too soft! Because you were so nice it followed us, and nearly got me killed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey, relax!\u201d, Sonic said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the little buddy wanted to hurt you! It\u2019s probably just lonely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we can\u2019t stay and play family with him! If I may remind you, we\u2019ve got an important mission to do: We must find the Sol Emeralds as fast as possible!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, the chao\u2019s little hands began to glow in a pink light, surprising the anthropomorphic duo. Blaze then felt a prickle in her chest, followed by a warm feeling that ran through her body. \u201cIs it getting warmer in here?\u201c, she wondered. Sonic shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if you ask me. But I\u2019m always very cool, so\u2026\u201d Blaze suddenly threw out a gasp, interrupting Sonic\u2019s joke. \u201cHey, are you all right?\u201d, he asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Her whole body was trembling, a load of adrenaline flowing though her veins. Blaze let the chao fall out of her arms. It floated around, the light in its hands forming a pink, shining sphere. Suddenly, it shot out from its hands, flying directly into Blaze\u2019s chest. She gasped again as another sensation hit her, and the warmth in her body intensified. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling was getting stronger. Looking down at it, Blaze was shocked to see her chest was moving outward. She couldn't really panic though as the hormones in her body went wild, hindering any kind of clear thought. Throwing her head into her neck, Blaze moaned as she felt her chest bulging out from her body. The sensitivity of her breasts grew along their size, sending waves of pleasure through the young girl. Her bra quickly got to small for her rising cup-size, pressing against her bosom, while the fabric of her jacket hearably stretched. Inside of it, two soft spheres of flesh were forming, surpassing tennis ball size while quickly heading for grapefruits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinding her teeth, Blaze felt both lust and pain as her growing breasts tightened her clothes. Their sensitivity nearly forced another moan out of Blaze, her will power almost breaking as her furred mammaries were pressing gainst each other. Her bra meanwhile was digging into her skin, visibly restraining her bust. Around the size of small coconuts, her breasts suddenly burst forward as the piece of underwear finally snapped, relieving the cat princess for a while. Soon another annoyance came up though as gravity was taking effect, dragging her new milk jugs downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, since she was no longer suffering from her bra, the pleasure of her growth was growing stronger now. Closing her eyes, Blaze tried to distract herself. But as her chest strained her jacket to an extent, not only her breasts got larger: On top of her hills, two nobs started to poke through the fabric, showing off Blaze\u2019s inner cravings to the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rising thirst for pleasure exhausted Blaze. Still sitting with her back against the wall, she looked down on her body: A pair of CD-sized breasts, still growing, blocked the view on her stomach. Her jacket was lying tightly on her body, her fur slightly visible through the stretched fabric. And reaching out at least an inch from her bosom, she saw nipples as thick as her fingers, erected like herself. She panted, looking up at the celling. Sweat was already dropping from her face, right onto her bosom. Just when she was about to faint her body finally registered no more pressing, and her body came to a rest. Forcing out a smile Blaze glanced down at her chest again, stroking her new endowments which were only slightly smaller than honeydew melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank goodness it\u2019s over\u2026\u201d, she moaned, enjoying the feeling of her hands on her breasts. Her nipples slightly grew again at the care her breasts received, her mind almost getting lost in naughty day dreams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 you havin\u2019 fun?\u201d She immediately snapped back to reality when hearing Sonic\u2019s voice. Blushing, Blaze quickly removed her hands from her body, the pleasurable feeling turning into shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m fine, th-thanks.\u201c, she hastily said. Putting her hands on the wall, she tried to stand up, but couldn\u2019t balance herself due to the new weight on her torso. After a few failed attempts, she let herself fall on her butt in frustration, her bust bouncing at the impact. Right in her sight, the chao was sitting on the ground, looking at her with an innocent face. \u201cStupid little thing.\u201d, she murmured, finding its smile more dull than friendly now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic cleared his throat. \u201cWell, that certainly was \u2013 unexpected.\u201d He seemed to be rather nervous in front of such a buxom lady, slightly blushing at Blaze's sight. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t blame the little guy for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe defaced me.\u201d, she said in a cold voice. Her eyes looked like those of a dead person, empty and lifeless. \u201cNow be quiet and help me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with Sonic\u2019s help they needed a while to get Blaze on her feet. And even as she stood, her stance was very unstable, her chest constantly trying to pull her forward. When leaning backwards to balance herself, the weight after a while nearly made her fall on her back. So she bend forward again after a few seconds, waving with her arms the entire time, permanently switching her centre of gravity this way. After she managed to find a relative stable pose, still slightly unsure on her legs, she began to worry about how she should jump and run like this. Before she thought further about this though, she looked down at where she presumed the chao \u2013 seeing him was no option from that ankle \u2013 , making an angry face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is all your fault, you little snort!\u201d, she yelled. Sonic looked away, not interfering. \u201cNow, if you would do me just one single favor, and GET THE HELL OUT OF MY SIGH-\u201c She paused, staring at her bosom. \u201cI mean, get lost and NEVER COME BACK!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic put an arm over Blaze\u2019s shoulder, and the two of them headed for the exit, leaving the pink furball alone.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, she had a strange electric feeling, as if someone had touched her breast with an electro shocker. In the next moment, the heat was so big she had to shiver all over her body, and as she looked down on her chest, she couldn't believe her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery slowly, her jacket was being pulled out by two little balls at the top of her torso. She also felt that her bra was getting tighter until it was painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boobs are... growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, she watched as her breasts grew to tennis ball, then orange size. The fabric of her jacket was stretched, while her bra sent more and more pain to her body, but they didn't stopped by then. Blaze leaned a bit forward due to the uncommon weight, making her bra push even more against her back. Finally, at the side of whirling CDs - or DVDs - , the heat vanished, and her breasts didn't expand further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze still breathed heavily, trying balance herself. As she managed to stand upright, she touched her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was... unusual... urgh!\" Her bra was still making trouble, so she decided to rip it off. She tried to open her jacket, but it took her a lot of effort to get the zipper over her \"hills\". Finally, it was on the other side of her boobs, over which her much to small bra was stretched like the thread of a loaded crossbow. She took it in her hands, trying to drag it out forcefully, and with a lout \"clap\", she was freed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Blaze sighed relieved. \"That is much better.\" With no more use for it, she threw the bra behind a pillar. After that, she went to the edge of a flooded area of the palace and looked at her reflection on the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were surely not the biggest in the world, but much larger than earlier. And the jacket was just so far opened that her boobs were slightly pressed against each other, making her cleavage very sexy. With a smile on her face, she softly stroked her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not bad at all! I wasn't ever unhappy about my cup-size, but this is way better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard again a noise behind her. She swung around, making her breasts bounce a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out or die!\" she yelled.</span></div></div>",

With a shocked face, he stared for a few more seconds at her, then shook his head and said \"Nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wandered between the pillars, looking at the shredded pieces of Eggman's robots. \"Seems like I missed a party, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it was a lame one.\" Blaze went over to the Sol Emerald, which was still laying on the ground, and picked it up. \"You think Eggman brought them here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. What about Nega?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in prison.\" she said, putting the gem into her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would be a great idea for Eggman. Anyway, Tails already suspected you found the Emerald, and detected the second one in leaf storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. By the way, what was that important thing you had to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed. \"Well, I had to get rid of Amy... you know, she's nice and all, but well... she can be really annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze smiled. Outside, Sonic always seemed to be the \"cool guy\", but inside, he was kind of shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure Eggman also detected the Emerald, so what's the fastest way to get to leaf storm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Sonic's turn to smile. \"By foot?\" he grinned, and then he was already running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shook her head, murmuring \"This hedgehog\", before she sprinted after him.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts didn't have much space to move in her jacket, but were still bouncing a bit what kind of annoyed her. She had once read somewhere that a bouncing chest jumped about 1.500 meters when it's owner ran 2km. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope we find the Sol Emeralds fast so I can go back to my dimension and buy a new one.' she thought. She didn't really worry about explaining her new cup-size since she could just say \"They grew while I was there\" and that would be it. But as she thought about going back, she remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic!\" she yelled. \"What about the Chaos Emeralds? When I return with the Sol Emeralds while the Chaos Emeralds are still there, we will have the same problem as when they stayed here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic turned his head to her. \"Don't worry!\" he shouted \"We sent Knuckles with the Emeralds so he can collect them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That red echidna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yepp. After all, he's a treasure hunter. When you're back, he will force the Chaos Emeralds to bring them back with help of the Master Emerald. That's the plan, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it'll work. I don't want to spent the last days of my life with this hot-head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic smiled. \"We're almost there. Tails is probably waiting for us with his Tornado machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen it before. Is it big, blue and has two wings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! How do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look up.\" About a hundred meters before and above them, the Tornado was chased by some of Eggman's jet-robots. Sonic stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" he shouted. Blaze ran past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rescue Tails and I see if there are other's on the ground!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger!\" He jumped on the top of a tree. \"Tails, come here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blaze was running towards the direction the robots had come from. She was glad to stay on the ground, since she got a little problem with heights. After a few seconds of sprinting, she found a big hammer-robot, holding the green emerald in his hand. The giant had his back turned towards Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't escape me!\" she shouted. The robot turned his head, but Blaze was already piercing through him with her flame tornado attack. She made his way through his mechanic guts, then came out on the other side of him and landed on the ground, looking right at her opponent, while her breasts were proudly shaking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant let first go of his hammer, then collapsed and fell on a tree, dropping the Sol Emerald in the act. It landed directly before Blaze's feet, she picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two down, five to go.\" But then, suddenly,...</span></div></div>",

Shocked, she felt how the heat returned and ran through her entire body, before once more concentrating in her breasts. As the electric feeling came to her chest and she began to breath heavily, she saw the tornado landing, and Sonic jumping off from one of its wings. \"Hey Blaze, done he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay where you are!\" she shouted while shivering. Sonic looked confused, as well as Tails who came out of his machine, but they widened their eyes as they saw what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts slowly began to grow out of Blaze's jacket. She tried to cover them. In little steps, her zipper moved downwards, revealing more and more of her flesh; she began to struggle due to its weight. One of her nipples began to lurk out, but the jacket was far too stretched as if she could pull it over, and soon her other nipple came out, too. She leaned more and more forward, while her breasts expanded like a football that's being pumped up. At the side of a volleyball, she couldn't bear the weight anymore and fell to her knees, while her tits kept getting larger. She expected a feeling of relief, but the gravity still dragged her boobs, sending waves of pain through her back. As each of her breasts arrived at basketball size, the heat finally vanished, and Blaze let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness it's over.\" Then she looked at Tails and Sonic, who stared at her, half shocked and half amazed. \"What are you waiting for? Stop standing their like perverts and help me get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey snapped out of their trance and ran to Blaze, then each of them took on of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What was that?\" Tails asked while he helped her slowly getting back on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, and I wondered if I had missed something when I saw you at Water Palace!\" Sonic yelled. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told them about her incident at Water Palace. \"But I don't know what happened this time. There was no energy beam from nobody, the emerald just started to shine and then it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails cleared his throat. \"Well, I've brought some instruments to study the Sol Emeralds. I think I can also use them to find out what's wrong with your chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then just do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails blushed. \"Well,\" he said, his voice getting smaller with every word \"to do so, I have to, um, examine, you know, your, um... your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the only problem.\" She freed her arm that Sonic held and searched her zipper with her hand. As she found it, she pushed it down and opened her jacket, beginning to take it off. Sonic shut his eyes and turned his head away, while Tails' face went very red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze pushed her zipper upwards as far as she could. Sonic and Tails had helped her to cover her nipples, but you could still see three quarters of her breast flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you should work on becoming less shy, Tails!\" she sighed \"This took us nearly two hours!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic smiled widely. \"I think his face will never get to its normal color again!\" And, if this was possible, Tails' head became even more red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's wrong with me, doc?\" Blaze asked, and Tails cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems the beam of the wizard created a new, unknown kind of energy as it hit the emerald. The Sol Emeralds were not made to hold such an energy, so it shot it to the nearest objects that can contain energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and the robot.\" she said, rubbing her right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"The metal of the robot absorbed it and molt, but it seems that flesh isn't able to absorb this energy. Unfortunately, the energy could also not leave your body because your flames blocked it. So, it took some energy from them and created two poles of a new energy, one in each of your breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why her breasts?\" Sonic asked. Tails lifted his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coincidence. Could have also been her shoulders or hands, just two things that had the same shape. You breasts, however, weren't big enough to hold the energy. Your body, which didn't want to explode because of some energy it couldn't hold, quickly produced a large number of breast growth hormones, just enough so they grew bit enough to contain the energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I got it this far.\" Blaze said, staring at her chest  \"But what about the green emerald?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails scratched his head. \"Well, I think the energy in your chest produces some kind of radiance which makes the Sol, maybe even the Chaos Emeralds, produce the energy that hit you in the first place. But they have a limit in doing this, and when they can't produce any more, it's shot out. The poles in your chest then react like magnets, drag the energy towards them, and... well, it repeats what I just explained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic rubbed his chin. \"So each time we find an emerald her breasts will get larger, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails nodded. \"Probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous!\" Blaze shouted \"My boobs got at least three times bigger this time! If this keeps up, they will be as big as a house when we found all the emeralds! Hey, you two, don't turn your heads away and blush, tell me what to do now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughtful, Sonic scratched his head. \"I dunno. Look for the other Emeralds while Tails searches for a way to shrink your breasts?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I could try to develop an energy which negates that one in your chest.\" Tails said. \"I just need an Emerald.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze nodded. \"Okay, but first, we've got to find new clothes for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic sighed. \"Oh, come on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious! I can barely stand, so how am I supposed to run or jump this way? And my back is killing me! I need a new bra and a jacket!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, well, guess you're right, but we shouldn't also forget about Eggman.\" He looked at Tails. \"What do you think we should do now?\"</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds, her head got clear again while her breasts started growing. Blaze then let go off Cream and stepped back to watch her friend \"develop\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream began to feel ticklish as her nipples pressed more and more against the fabric of her dress. She wasn't giggling though, she just stared amazed at her orange-seized breasts. Soon her dress lifted up from the rest of her body and pulled against her back, but she quickly forgot about the pain as she noticed her nipples getting longer too! They ripped two little holes in her dress which grew along with her expanding bust. Her breasts reached apple-size, but then slowed down due to the limited space in her dress.<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard a loud \"rip\" sound. A little tear appeared at the front side of her dress, and it seemed as if her boobs made a little growth jump. Her nipples meanwhile were completely free and enlarged some more, while her pushing bust carefully made the tear grow longer. In a loud burst, it finally tore the upper half of her dress in two, revealing a mighty cleavage, while her breasts made a final growth spurt before they stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream struggled, leaned forward, being completely shocked. Her breasts were each the size of a honeydew, while her nipples stood out at match-size, being thumb-thick.Tails blushed again, Sonic was already used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze giggled. \"Big enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream pushed her mountains together, still amazed. \"Thank you.\" she whispered, then smiled widely. \"THANK YOU, BLAZE!\" she yelled \"THANK YOU SO MUCH!\"</span></div></div>",

She wanted to put her arms around her neck, but their giant chests hindered her, so she just hugged Blaze's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CREAM!\" the others shouted, but she didn't hear them since she still yelled \"Thank you\". She didn't even recognize she was getting dizzy again, but as she felt her bosom pressed more against Blaze's, she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" she said, stepping back, while her already impressive nipples grew even longer and thicker. She heard a lot of ripping sounds, and at voleyball-size, her dress finally gave up. The upper part was torn to shreds completely. Cream was top-naked now, but even worse, her breasts had gotten far  too heavy for her. She collapsed under their enormous weight, while they still got larger. Sonic couldn't help but whistle, Tails head went - you guessed it - red again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you're going to explain this to your mother?\" Blaze wondered. But as Creams breasts were the same size as hers, Blaze felt dizzy, and before she knew what was going on, her boobs got heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?!\"  Her jacket slowly pushed aside. Both Cream's and Blaze's breasts expanded now, soon Blaze couldn't hide her nipples anymore. All four of them grew larger and larger, millimeter after millimeter, completely mute. The only sound came from Blaze's downgoing zipper. <br>\r\nThe first ones who stopped were Cream's, and shortly after that, Blaze's zipper finished moving at her navel. Each of their tits was now water melon-sized(not shaped). Blaze's nipples were as big as Cream's had been before, which were now as long as bottle openers, and much thicker. Blaze sighed. \"Just as I began to get used to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith four big-sized breasts around, now even Sonic had to blush again. Tails, his face tomatoe colored, closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It seem a-a-as the e-energy tries to-to-to balance th-the di-different charges in yo-your chests\" he stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream tried to get up again, while Blaze struggled with the weight. Sonic sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, what's going to happen next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Someone just needs to get me in the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" He took her arm slowly helped her getting up. \"By the way, have you any idea why her nipples are so large, Tails?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails cleared his throat. \"There's probably more energy in them as in Blaze's, I think. Well, if you don't need me anymore, I'm going to return to the lab and try to find out the location of the next emerald. And if I have time, I can examine the ones we already got so I can create an Anti-Energy for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Sonic said \"Just call us when you find anything out, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Tails responded. He went to his his machine, jumped in, and a few moments later, he was in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ladies!\" Sonic placed his arms under one of each girls breasts. \"This is going to be better than weightlifting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out, or the weight lands in your face.\" Blaze said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic grinned. \"Wouldn't mind it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sonic had brought them in Creams room and left, Cream began to work with the special material while Blaze looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice room you've got here.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! \" Cream smiled \"But I guess as a princess, you've got a much nicer one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sighed. \"For you maybe, but I don't like it. It's big, full of weird decorations and completely impractical! I prefer a more ordinary style. Not that your room is ordinary!\" she quickly added. Cream giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, the Bra's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wow, that was fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream rubbed her breasts. \"Oh, I could've made it in half the time, but these two hindered me a bit.\" She threw the large bra to Blaze who gladly put it on, then took another big piece of the elastic material. \"What do want to wear above it?\" </span></div></div>",

Aside from her outstanding bust line and the zipper that was placed at the right side of her jacket, she looked like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really look good.\" he said \"Good, work, Crea...\" He stopped talking as he saw the rabbit girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric didn't even reach for a real dress but something orange that looked much like a bikini. The front side was only hold by a little piece of fabric at the bottom of her breasts, thus showing a mighty cleavage, while the sides of her boobs were also visible. All in all, the \"shirt\" covered at most 20% of her boobs at the area around her mega nipples which seemed as if they were going to burst out at any moment. At a closer look, Sonic could see the threats of a bra beneath her top. \"Good thing we have a heating, or I'd be freezing now.\" Cream smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic swallowed \"Y-yeah. Um, anyway, as I said...\" he kept looking at Cream's boobs \"Tails located two Sol emeralds. One is at the mountains, the other one's directly south of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Blaze said \"We split up: You go to the mountains, and I'll go south!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger!\" Sonic said saluting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help, too?\" Cream asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Sonic grinned \"the best you can do is try to find an explanation why your mom needs to buy you a whole new set of clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll just say I had a growth spurt.\" she said happily. Sonic and Blaze smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them went outside. It was late afternoon.  \"Cream,\" Blaze said at the door \"sorry about what happened. I promise, when Tails finds a way to reverse this, you'll be the first one to get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Cream shouted. She pressed her breasts together. \"No matter what Tails finds out, I gonna keep them! They're wonderful! I'm so grateful you shared them with me, I want to hug you the whole day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please not!\" Blaze screamed \"I'm not in the mood to test how elastic this material really is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry, I won't be so careless again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to go.\" Sonic interrupted the two gals \"Thanks for everything, Cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to thank you! Good luck on finding the emeralds. And Blaze, please visit me again before you go back to your dimension, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" she smiled \"Goodbye!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and Blaze began to run, he north- and she southwards, while Cream waved at the doorstep.   </span></div></div>",

On the other hand, a normal person would probably not be blue or have tennis-shoes as his only clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic kept running with high speed while looking for Eggman's robots. With all the time he and his friends had wasted at Cream's, they had most likely already found the emerald, so Sonic only had to take it from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good thing Blaze and I split up, or my attention would lie on something different.' he thought. He didn't understand a bit what was going with all the energy, pole and magnetic stuff, but knew he didn't want to see any big-busted girls for at least one week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard a sound coming from behind him. As he stopped, he identified the sound as steps, then turned around and saw - nothing. He looked around carefully, but there wasn't anybody in sight. Scratching his head, he began to believe it was just paranoia, as someone's arms were put around him so tightly, it became hard to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got'cha!\" a female voice yelled happily while hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy!\" Sonic shouted while trying to escape her \"Let go off me!\" To his surprise, Amy did as she was told.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" He turned around and looked at his self-claimed girlfriend. \"Somethin' wrong or why do you do what I'm saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine, I just feel a bit... dizzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it started again what Sonic had hoped not to see again too soon: As Amy's head was clear again, she felt a strange pushing in her chest. First she and Sonic saw nothing, but then they noticed a slight stretching of her Dress' upper part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not again!\" Sonic sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? \" Amy asked hysterical, and Sonic began to explain what had happened to Cream and Blaze while her breasts kept growing. The color of her dress lightened up a bit since the fabric was stretched. Amy panicked more and more as her boobs blew up like a balloon to the size of eggs, tennis balls, oranges, pomegranates and finally stopped at whirling CD's. Her dress had made it without ripping, so her breasts stood out strongly, but no flesh was visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like I did absorb some energy as I touched them, 'though no parts of my body grew.\" Sonic said after finishing his explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TOUCHED THEM?!? YOU PERVERTED PIG!\" she screamed half angry, half afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're the only of us who believes to be in a relationship!\" Sonic said grumpy. Amy started to hyperventilate, but then calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, just that I got:\" she said slowly, looking at her huge bust-line \"Everytime I touch you my breasts will get bigger, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, don't get silly ideas!\" he shouted.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, she heard something coming from the left, so she stepped aside - just in time to see a rocket exploding where she just stood. The explosion, however, was so strong, she couldn't keep her feet on the ground and flew backwards. She screamed loud before landing on...</span></div></div>",

I feel dizzy again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, not that, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Sonic had managed to push Amy aside her breasts were already growing. He grabbed her arm and ran off with her while the rocks were coming down behind them. As they were out of range, he stopped immediately and let go of Amy. Her boobs were slightly bigger as before, but her dress seemed to reduce the speed of the growth just as Cream's did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I get for buying high quality.\" she moaned painfully. Her breasts pushed very strong against the fabric, but her dress still didn't give up, even as her chest was honeydew-sized. As Amy couldn't take it any more, she pulled her skirt down until finally the part on her shoulders ripped. Her boobs now made a huge growth spurt from honeydew- over football- to basketball size before stopping. Her dress was still there, held by her two milk jugs, just about covering her nipples. Her skirt was being lifted, so you could clearly see her panties. Sonic's nose was almost bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed, then looked at Sonic. \"Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic snapped out. \"Um, no... hey look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned around. Between the rocks was a gem lying, shining red in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Sol Emerald!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why the robots shot at the mountain. Speaking of which...\" Sonic looked at Eggman's minions who were flying towards the emerald. \"You're not getting away with this!\" he yelled while spurting at them. <br>\r\nAmy kept standing for a moment. Of course she wanted to help Sonic, but how was she supposed to swing her hammer like this? 'Maybe...' she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before one of the robots could take it, Sonic grabbed the emerald while sprinting. He turned around and stopped, looking at the five robots who seemed to prepare their rockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me everything you got!\" he shouted, but just as he wanted to jump at them, he heard someone shouting behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that!\" Amy screamed while she swung her maga-tits at one of the robots. He flew crashed in a rock and exploded. The other robots surrounded her now, so she spun around and destroyed three of them with her breasts. The fourth one pulled back, but Amy jumped at him and hit him with her boobs from left, then from right, and finally they slammed him in the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy landed on both feet, pushing her hair behind her ear while her breasts jiggled. Her dress had been pulled a bit down during the fight, so a bit of her nipples was visible now. Sonic's face went bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said \"looks these aren't that useless, or what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, um, you're... r-r-r-whoa, behind you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy jumped forward - which surprised Sonic since her breasts had to be extremely heavy - , just in time to avoid another rocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did this come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From him!\" Sonic pointed his finger at a giant battle robot. He looked like Eggman's ordinary hammer guys, only he was much, much larger, at least half the size of one of the mountains(around them, not Amy's). Also, he had a rocket launcher placed at his chest which now fired a dozen rockets at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Sonic began to load up his spin dash, then fired himself at the giant. The rockets didn't hurt him when he hit them, but as he hit the giant, he just popped off. He flew back, landing next to Amy and not very softly on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic!\" Amy screamed \"Are you all right?\" She wanted to help him up, but decided it was better not to touch him again. He stood up again panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright. This thing seems to be less fragile than his little brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now, Sonic?\" Amy asked scarred while looking at the battle robot who prepared another pack of rockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not much to do about this.\" Sonic said and stepped behind her. He grabbed her... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any better ideas?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt dizzy again and could already feel the growth, but because she really couldn't think of anything and the robot had shot his next dozen of rockets, she took his hands an layed them directly on her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just did this to show him she supported his idea, she didn't image what this would cause. Just as his hands touched her nipples, she instantly felt electrified on her entire body, so she quickly pushed Sonic's hands away. The surprised hedgehog went a few steps back. \"Amy, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I...\" she moaned, her voice getting higher and higher. Shortly before the rockets reached them, her dress was ripped off in an instant by her rapidly growing breasts. In less then a second, they were as big as herself, but didn't stop there and grew on to the size of a small car. The rockets just popped off them and fell into the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed out loud, then a smile came up on her face. \"Yes, Sonic, I'm allright.\" Then, without warning, she just jumped with her mega tits up to the robot's head, and  gave him a \"little\" smack with her boobs. The coloss lost balance and fell onto a mountain, but Amy wasn't done yet: She spun around in the air, creating a giant spin dash with her breasts, then shot herself right into the machine's stomach. A huge explosion shook the earth, causing some avalanches, while pieces of metal flew through the air. Sonic, who still had to compensate Amy's immense boob size and now had witnessed her enormous power, just stood there open-mouthed as the pink hedgehog landed right in front of him(well, not quite right in front of him since she didn't want to burry him under her chest). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy... you... how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still smiling, stroking her assets as to reward them. They were at least as wide as Big was tall, with nipples as large as her breasts before he touched her nipples. Some pieces of her dress were stuck in her cleavage, while her skirt surprisingly had survived the growth spurt. But Sonic didn't notice this, his eyes were focused on another part of Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cuckled. \"Well, Sonic, time to go, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other Sol emeralds, silly. Has Tails figured out where the next one is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Um, wait, I check.\" He put out his handy, still having an eye on Amy. There was a message from Tails which said the next emerald was at Attitude Limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Amy said as Sonic read it out loud. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you can walk with... these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it.\" she giggled.

He tried to banish the thought of Amy's breasts out of his mind, but they repeadly pushed him from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amy, could you stop this?\" he asked half annoyed, half impressed she was able to keep up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Sonic, but you slow me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Come on, you can't be faster than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Suddenly, he felt Amy's hills touch him again, but this time they swallowed him into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy!\" he yelled \"Let me out!

Trying to attack a lady from behind... You've been hanging out with that Echidna too much Fox boy!\" Rouge mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge! Hand over the Emeralds!\" Tails ordered, ignoring her teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you get your facts straight, I only have one Emerald, I just got the other gem as a bonus for being a good little G.U.N. Agent!\" Rouge spun the Chaos Emerald on her finger as she spoke, \"But if you're willing to make a bet... I'm sure we can arrange something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! If I win, you hand over both the Emeralds!\" Tails said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But if I win, you must give me your Emerald radar, along with any Emeralds you already have!\" Rouge demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. But I warn you, I'm not just a side-kick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two flew back a few paces before flying at eachother, Tails spun in mid air but Rouge was too quick, grabbing his tails she slammed both legs down onto his back, sending him flying into a nearby slot machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails came out brandishing two boxing gloves on wierd mechanical devices, he swung one at Rouge but she dodged ever so slightly and chopped the end of with an axe-kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other punch however was alot more complex, spiraling around in a curvy pattern Rouge had no idea how to combat it, so she didn't, flying above and out of reach she screw-kicked right at Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails dodged but barely, luckily for him though, she had gotten her foot caught in the Slot machine's metal bars, Tails grabbed one of his Chu2 bombs and threw it right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge stopped struggling and sliced the bars with her free foot, then back-flipped, kicking the bomb right back at Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough?\" Rouge asked mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was covered in soot and was severely weakened, he then saw Blaze, standing behind the slots watching, her left breast slid to the side too much and she fell down on top of it... This gave Tails an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rest of his strength he flew right at Rouge, Rouge made a large arcing kick, but Tails had accended, now dropping like a stone, the Fox grabbed Rouge in a hug pushing as much of himself onto her bare skin as he could, most of her bare skin being her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Rouge got annoyed at the suddenly perverted Fox but before she could kick him off, she felt a wierd dizziness, she then realised that she was feeling heavier, she could fly with the Fox attached but this new weight was beggining to drag her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly recognised the weight, when she first began developing she found herself being pulled down by her breasts all the time until she got used to it, she looked down, sure enough her Breasts were no longer he Ds she was so proud of, but HHs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dizzy, she attempted to pull the Fox off, but she couldn't concentrate enough physical energy into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Sol Emerald with her began to glow, the growth speed suddenly double, the strain on her Breast plate was too much, it popped off and was held on only by Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, and with breasts half the size of the giant metal balls in the casino her wings had given up, she began to plummet, Tails jumped off, watching as she fell right onto a ring container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the capsule's bounce stopped her fall, it caused the Emeralds to slip out of her cleavage and land near Blaze's feet, Tails flew down, Rouge was unconcious and her Breasts were on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work Tails!\" Blaze said and went to pick up the Emeralds.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sure enough when she picked up the Sol emerald it began to glow again, and Blaze prepared for another growth spurt. Instead of firing an energy bolt at her however the Sol emerald shot it energy at the Chaos emerald, startling both Tails and Blaze. Before they could think about it though the Chaos emerald suddenly fired a ray of lightning at Blaze itself, hitting the purple feline in her chest. The impact made her watermelon-sized breasts shake violently while Blaze gasped, feeling a familiar prickle build up inside her. Closing her eyes she waited until the fabric of her new jacket began to stretch around her ballooning bust, filling the cups of the giant bra she wore. The super-elastic material lived up to its name as it \u201cgrew\u201d around her massing mammaries, her furry sweater meat flowing into the fabric. Getting rounder and bigger her breasts reached out to all sides, blocking a rising amount of Blaze\u2019s sight. She put her arms around her humongous bosom as far as she could, pressing them softly into her firm flesh. The rising sensitivity made her moan in a low voice, while she pressed her back against one of the giant slot machines. To suppress her hysteria she gently began to stroke her giant meat buns while they curved out, pressing tightly against each other inside her jacket. Each move she made showed on her growing assets as they jiggled slightly, but the bra Cream made for her kept the bouncing at a endurable level. Between pants Blaze sighed in relief. Slowly, she was getting used to these growth spurts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her breasts outgrew big medicine balls however she suddenly gasped in shock, feeling a tingle inside her butt. Her eyes almost popped out of her head as she heard the seams of her white trousers were beginning to stretch loudly, and felt her butt pressing against the metal slot machine behind her. Alongside her giant bust her rear had also started to swell, tightening the already form-fitting fabric of her pants. Her white panties that were lying plainly around her flat butt steadily slid between her butt cheeks as they became rounder and fuller, forming a small, firm bum. Because her butt occupied so much space her trousers began to feel too small on her legs as well, hurting Blaze a little. Her breasts were getting larger than car wheels, but the fabric of her pants was feeling much tighter than her jacket. When her butt reached the point where her curves would have reached beyond her waist her hips suddenly began to flare out to the sides, keeping her rear in a firm form. The sound of popping seams reached her cat-ears, while her purple fur began to shine through the widened stiches of her pants. It was only slightly, but Blaze could feel as her growing butt added some millimeters to her height as it formed a pair of stout hemispheres. While her previously plain posterior grew into a heart-shaped bubble butt her breasts pulled down the collar of her jacket a little, giving insight to just a hunch of cleavage. Blaze\u2019s arms gently rubbed her swelling meat, feeling their sensitivity through the tight rubber. With a deep blush in her face she moaned and gasped in pleasure, while her fingers gave her breasts a keen grope, wrapping the fabric around them. At the same time she was rubbing her growing butt over the slot machine, feeling her juicy meat splay against the metal. She curled her tail as tingling sensations overwhelmed the cat-girl, while through her moans one could hear her purr in delight. Tails long ago had shut his eyes and turned away from her, but hearing Blaze as she enjoyed herself was enough to make the shy boy blush. As her breasts reached the size of giant beach balls and each of her butt cheeks was as big as a volley ball\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually Blaze\u2019s jacket stopped stretching, and the feline was very glad as she didn\u2019t feel any more growth in her breasts. Both were the size of a car wheel, hanging firmly on her body like a giant balloon filled with air. When looking down the only thing Blaze could see was purple fabric, her breasts even blocking her sight when she just stared straight in front of her. Her massive bra was holding her assets quite nicely, the weight dragging the princess only a little forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer short moment of joy quickly turned into horror again however as she could still feel her rump pressing against the slot machine behind her, squishing her firm meat while getting ever bigger. Shocked and scared Blaze couldn\u2019t do anything as the seams of her pants popped one by one, stretching loudly around her swelling butt. Her hips were growing beyond the width of her shoulders, forging a soft, yet steep curve with her slender waist. She felt her pants sliding below her waist, showing a small amount of butt cleavage and a part of her pink panties as they slowly sunk into her butt gap. Feeling her rear spread over the metal of the slot machine Blaze made a step forward, allowing her meat to bound back into its round form. Her ass was as big as a basketball, showing no signs of stopping as it grew into a steadily firmer and bigger form. To make matters even worse Blaze could feel that her thighs were starting to grow as well, blowing to a pair of stout and thick stacks of flesh. Her bosom wobbled a little as she was rising into the air, her filling hips, thighs and rear increasing her height millimeter by millimeter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh my god, do something Tails!\u201d, Blaze screamed. The yellow fox however couldn\u2019t do much though except blushing even deeper as the two heard a loud rip coming from Blaze\u2019s backside. The cat-girl shrieked, quickly putting her hands on the big rift in her pants. She could feel some of her fur as her underwear was only slightly covering her butt anymore, and under her palms it was sinking even deeper between her buttocks. The situation got even more embarrassing as two more rifts were torn into the sides of her pants, giving inside to her furry and firm legs. Her hips formed a very wide curve with her waist and thighs, the latter starting to press against each other a little. The low tingling in her butt was steadily increasing, almost getting as sensitive as her breasts when they were not growing. Blaze felt the pleasure inside her shooting up again, making her swallow while she closed her eyes. She tried to resist, but eventually groped her firm butt with her hands, feeling the furry flesh between her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach cheek of her rump was as big as a medicine ball, and looking just as stout and round. Rip after rip appeared on her pants, her flesh steadily pushing through the holes as it tried to break through the confines of her clothes. When the fabric was about to burst into little pieces she finally felt the growth coming to a halt, and no more flesh was swelling into her hands. The cat-girl sighed in relief, while at the same time however she didn\u2019t dare to move a single inch as she was afraid her pants would break. With an impossible hourglass figure the young princess stood in front of the slot machine, her massive bust blocking the sight on the deeply blushing fox-boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Tails\u201d, Blaze said after a while, trying to sound calm as her body was still flooded with sensations. Her pants were nothing but patchwork, while her panties were pinching into her body. \u201cTake t-the Tornado and g-go to the next clothes store you can find. A-ask for the l-largest pair of p-p-pants and panties they\u2019ve g-got. And p-please, h-hurry!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There didn't seem to be any Eggman robots around, so she ran (well, fast-walked) towards the emerald. Suddenly, 8 Egg-Drones jumped out from various hiding places, and surrounded her! She unleashed her flames with an unbelivable stength. \"Corner a kitty, and you'll get scratched!\" she said, taking on the drones. She finished the last one off with a triple spin kick, let her flames die down, and called Tails. \"Tails! I found the emerald, come get it! Why?

On the way back, Tails tripped on something, and the emerald flew out of his hands! \"No! Blaze! Catch it!\" \"Why me?\" she asked herself as she jumped for the emerald. She caught it, and the effects came afterward. She felt dizzy again, and when she looked down, her breasts were growing. Soon they were the size of small beachballs!

Just be careful he doesn't snack too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did anything happen while I was gone?\", she asked, hearing as Cream came down - with unusually heavy steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream jumped over the last stairs, the ground shaking a little from the impact. \"Blaze came by, together with Sonic and Tails!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that lovely cat-girl?\", Vanilla asked, searching through the basket. She pulled out a bottle of milk from it, turning towards her daughter. \"I brought you a bottle of fresh milk, sweetie! It's very important in your ag-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped mid-sentence, staring open-mouthed at her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his mistress Cheese happily flew over to Cream, seemingly oblivious to her changes. \u201cThanks mom!\u201d, Cream smiled, hopping on her feet. Vanilla watched as her daughter\u2019s breasts swayed up and down, the massive melons almost slipping out of their light cover. \u201cI know it's very important to drink much milk in my age -  I'm still in the middle of growing need to drink, after all!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla dropped the bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCream!\u201d, she screamed, staring at her precious little daughter in horror. \u201cWh-what happened to you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her mother in puzzlement. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla watched as Cheese dropped himself into Cream\u2019s cleavage, the young rabbit girl giggling as he made himself comfortable. \u201cY-your breasts!\u201d, she yelled. \u201cThey are-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, Blaze infected me with her growth spurt.\u201d Cream noted as if it was the most natural thing in the world. While she patted her new meat buns, Cheese slightly wobbling between them, an idea struck her mind. \u201cHey, maybe it\u2019ll rub off on you too! Shall we try?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla...</span></div></div>",

I'll call a doctor immediately.\" Quickly Vanilla hasted over to the telephone, throwing a pitiful glance at her daughter as she typed in the number. \"Poor child! Your back must hurt miserably!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware to her mother's worries Cream sat down on the couch, her hands still on her bosom. \"Actually, I'm wearing a quite comfortable bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receiver on her ear, Vanilla closely examined the bikini-like top Cream wore. \"Underneath that thing? I can't imagine something so small could hold you well!\" After a while, she put the telephone down again. \"Wrong number\", she murmured, trying again. Cream meanwhile was pushing her breasts together, squeezing the little Chao who was still resting between her breasts. Enjoying his position Cheese began flail with his arms, the rabbit girl laughing as he rubbed on her breasts. Vanilla gulped as she saw the monstrous nipples of her daughter grow ever larger, when someone picked on the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Is this the doctor... I'm Vanilla the rabbit. Please, you have to come over immediately!... No, I'm fine, but you\u2019ve got to inspect my daughter! Her breasts are suddenly huge!... How old she is? Six, why?... What? Early bloomer? What are you talking about?... No, her chest didn't grow over-night, she grew while I was shopping!... Of course that's not normal! Why do you think I'm calling a doctor?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her mother panicked on the phone, Cream continued to play around with her breasts. Using all force she pressed her mighty mounds together, pushing them up into her face. Cheese felt the flesh tightly embracing him, resisting as it tried to press him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see who of us is stronger!\u201d, Cream offered, increasing the push on her bosom. Promptly the clever pet got the rules of the game its mistress had just made up, and tried to dig himself deeper into her cleavage. Their tug of war lasted a few seconds, until Cream finally kicked the little Chao out of her breasts. Thrown out with immense pressure Cheese flew through the room, before landing directly on Vanilla\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d, the mother rabbit shrieked. She felt Cheese sliding down her head and grabbing on of her ears, hanging on her like an ear ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daughter meanwhile released the grip on her breasts, which caused them to jiggle in every direction, their movements growing even wilder as Cream jumped up from the couch. \u201cYeah, I win!\u201d, she exclaimed, her top getting slightly out of place as she jumped around in joy. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stumbling around she hold herself onto the nearest object, sensing a head-ache was about to come. \"I just feel a little... dizzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it was a normal metabolic disorder - she was getting in the years after all - Vanilla was suddenly hit by a strong sensation, her body prickling all over. Dropping the phone the rabbit-woman let out a gasp, holding herself with both hands now as she leaned backwards.  \"Wh-what's going on?\", she asked into the room. Feeling a rising heat inside her Vanilla began to pant hysterically, sweat forming on her entire body. As her breath grew ever harder she felt a growing tingle in her chest, feeling like it was electrically charged. Looking down on herself she tried to detect something, when another sensation forced a second gasp out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her head into her neck Vanilla felt the fabric of her dress tighten around her bosom, before spotting two enlarging bulges beneath it. Slowly, her average bustline crawled forward, rising to a pair of firm domes as they rounded out to all sides. As her furry meat balls pressed against each other in her bra, Vanilla felt a plush creeping into her face, being unable to do anything but pant. Under her red-orange scarf the buttons on her dress began to drift apart from each other, small gaps appearing between them. New hairs continued to sprout out from her chest as it blew up, her feminine curvature already quite remarkable despite being far away of her own daughter\u2019s. Blooming into full spheres Vanilla\u2019s breasts slightly fell on her rips as gravity took hold on them, the weight dragging a little on her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla watched in horror as she obtained a pair of  healthy double D\u2019s, torturing her and her clothes: With a loud snap the lock of her bra broke apart, her chest jutting a few inches forward while bouncing a little. Free from all support her rack still remained a firm hold, though her aching back found it could be a little firmer. Each breast had roughly the diameter of a CD by then - the exact size was hard to guess since her heavy breathing made her chest go up and down at a fast pace. Her face bright red Vanilla moaned, she could feel each square of her chest press against her dress. Putting a hand on her bosom she squeezed herself a little, the firm flesh growing into her palm. Vanilla\u2019s mouth was getting dry, her head tilting to the side as she let out another moan. Strained by her groping hand one of her dress\u2019s buttons popped off, creating a small hole on her front covered by her scarf. Jumping another inch larger her breasts burst off another button, extending the gap. Some of her furry cleavage looked out at the edges of her scarf, Vanilla feeling her dress was just about to break apart. But she was unable to control herself, so she continued to fondle her breast, grinding her teeth Vanilla grasped into it. She felt the flesh pulsating between her fingers, the fabric of her dress getting stretched further, and further, until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll buttons on her chest flew off, her hand getting tossed off as the held back piles of breast surged forward. Exploding into volleyballs her meat buns sucked up the scarf, her broken white bra meanwhile falling uselessly to the ground. With a V-neck going down her entire bust, showing a her milkjugs tightly hugging each other, Vanilla\u2019s jiggling breasts caused her to stumble backwards, each bounce sounding like a bass drum. Panting even stronger now Vanilla pressed her back against the nearest wall, closing her eyes as she waited for this nightmare to finally end. Her breasts continued to grow, looking a little bigger after each leap, while pushing on her blown-up dress. Just as they were about to push the cover from their most intimate area, the growth abruptly ended, leaving her a few cup-sizes beneath Cream\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Vanilla\u2019s breath began to stabilize, her whole body calming down. Swallowing hard she looked down into her cleavage, seeing it still wobbled slightly from the outburst. Right in front it Cheese was flying, looking with curious eyes into her breast gap. She was at loss for words. \u201cWhat\u2026 how\u2026 why\u2026?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay, mommy got super-boobs too!\u201d Looking to the side Vanilla saw her daughter jumping on the couch, her eyes only following the up and down of her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s cool, isn\u2019t it?\u201d, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla stared back at her own body, putting a hand on her full, furry bosom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cheese followed her eyes, and thinking it would be troublesome for the buxom bunny to duck for it the little Chao picked it up, flying up to her face with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks\", Vanilla stuttered, putting the receiver back on her ear. \"H-hello, doctor? Are you still there?... Yes, I'm fine again, I just felt a little dizzy... No no, that happens a lot, don't worry, I\u2019ve already seen another doctor about it\u2026 My daughter?... Oh no, she\u2019s all right! It was, um, just a prank - yeah, she put watermelons into her shirt... Yep, that's just how kids are.\" She faked a laugh. \"Sorry to have bothered you... Thanks, you too. Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla waited until she heard the dial tone, then put the receiver back on its place. Focusing her glance back on her cleavage she put her hands around her breasts , a bright smile growing on her face as she cupped them inside her palms. Cream watched her mother from the couch, also grinning from ear to ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Vanilla looked up to her daughter, still pressing her hands into her firm assets. \"Cream, you said this breast growth comes from Blaze?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded. \"Yep! I wanted to measure her breasts, when I suddenly started growing. Then she hugged me, I hugged her, and both of us ended up like this\", she said, sticking out her ample bosom at the last remark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla was staring into her d\u00e9coll\u00e9te again, gently brushing her hands over her female roundings. \u201cShe came over so you could measure her chest?\u201d, she questioned her daughter further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wanted me to make new clothes for her, from this super elastic material you gave me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you still have some of it left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, sorry.

She didn\u2019t know why, but just as he had touched her, she had suddenly started growing too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that knowledge at hand, what will Vanilla do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her dear Cream was undoubtedly unique, special, and worth encouraging. \"Well I think we should experiment with this, don't you think dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experiment?\" Cream tilted her head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla simply nodded. \"Come here Cheese!\" The woman's call distracted Cheese from the phone he was playing with, and the little blue creature flew over to hover between the two rabbits. \"Let's play that game again, only this time, I'll play too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm.\" Vanilla nodded again. \"We're gonna push against each other with Cheese in the middle...and whoever's breasts get him pushed in-between them is the one who loses.

Sonic eagerly groped the cat's massive, semi-nude boobs, running his hands all over them, squeezing and massaging the purple orbs.

While she was sleeping a white light flashed in to hr window, gently picking Blaze out of her bed and carreing her outsied.\"Mmmm...\" she said as she began to wake up, unsure of what this bright light was flashing in her face. \"Mrar....moorning already?\" Before Blaze could understand what was going on a white flash happened with her ending up on what looked like some surgery tabel, dressed only in her night gown. Her Night gown was alittle showy, but it was alright as she sletp alone. She soon began to wake and see that she was in this light. \"Wh-wha?\" she said. No responce came from the darkness or wheever Blaze was, just then foot steps were heared as two creatrues appeared. One looked like a mix between a fox and a dragon, while the other looked like a mix between a lynx and a lizard. The creatures eyed Blaze, as the fox creature slowly trailed his hand across Blazes leg  \"Who are you?!\" she said as she began to freak alittle, soon feeling her leg beign rubbed as she recoiled it, \"Hey! Easy there!\" The creatures whispered to each other somethin' in a iwerd language. They then noded, and the fox creatured rolled Blazes night gown, exposing her bare stomach and parts. While the lynx creatured pulled out what looked like a remot an pushed a button on it.  She blushed red as she saw herself exposed like that, her thin silk panties also beign exposed. \"Don-nt get me any more aggrivated!\" she said, almost about ready to set them both on fire. The creatures again didn' pay attention to her words, meanwhile from above a wierd tube like device lowered, with a drill like device at the end, as the setteled down and drilled in to Blaze's navel \"EEK!\" she yelled out as she tried to get off the table, \"NO! STop!\" she said as her hands began to burst with fire, as she readied to defend herself. The fox creature slowly walked to Blaze an gently rubbed her forehead, trying to calm her down, whiel trough the tube, almosty crystal like liquid was being poured trough it an going in Blaze's gut. She was goign to torch him for touching again, but soon she began to rest and calm down, murring alittle as her flames disappeared, she let out a ep as she felt the goop enter her gut. The fox again rubbed Blaze's forehead, while the goop was entering her, Blaze felt a wierd feeling in her gut, that she felt bloated or something, and in truth her once slim stomach was growing and rising. She was just feeling normal when suddenly she felt her belly began to grow, which took her quite by surprise. The two creatures smiled at what they saw. The lynx walked to Blaze's growing girth an gently rubbed it, an poked it in different places as it grew an filled up. While the fox kept rubbing Blaze's forehead. Strangely enough, even though she knew she had been abducted...she couldnt help but feel so pampered. It was like she was a queen to them. The lynx rubbed Blaze's belly abit more wich was now the size of a beachball. He then pulled out the remot and pushed the button, the goop stopped flowing, while the hose device pulled out of Blazes girth and disappeared in to the ceiling \"Ooh...wha..what did you do to me?\" she said as she looked up to the too, still in bliss. The creature didn' respon, but a responce came from Blazes belly, a small kick to be exact. She felt it, and she blushed like crazy. \"Did they just...impregnant me!?\" she said in her own mind, as she could feel it more now. The fox creature smiled, slowly bending down and whispering softly to Blaze's ear \"Thank you for your help, future queen\" after that a bright flash happened, with Blaze ending up in her bed, with the morning sun rising. Her eyes blinked as she tried to figure out if what she experienced was a dream. \"That...was...such a strange..dream?\" she said as she looked to her belly.But it wasn;t a dream. Blaze's once flat stomach was now the size ofa beachball, her night gown rolled back, showing her purple naked gut. She amlost let out a shriek seeing this. But she didn't, she put her two hands on her belly, and began to softly rub it. At the responce kicks an movement came from gut. Showing that Blaze was trully careing life in her. Though this was so sudden, she felt no reason to panic. She in fact felt so very loving of the life she was caring now, as she smiled, rubbing her belly. Just then as if on que \"Blaze, are ya here?\" A voice came from behined the door, followed by really loud knocks on it.</span></div></div>",

Before she could say, a strange flash occurred, as she felt something traveling into her. When the flash died down, everything seemed fine, but the emeralds looked a little dim in color. Blinking again, Blaze looked around and then saw herself. Which drew her eyes was her chest, which was usually flat and yet now actually showed up a little, not to mention she noticed that her arms toned up and bulked up a little, the indication of that being that her blouse was a little ripped up, exposing her purple fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-What in the world...\" She whispered, her eyes wider as saucers as she flexed her bicep a little.</span></div></div>",

She was amazed because the felt like rocks, but were warm for she is a cat after all. <br>\r\n She couldn't help but wonder what this was all about, but she did like it. She knew now that she would have to get used to her new found strength and so she decided to do some basic training. She went outside and set up some targets.<br>\r\n First she wanted to see if she could still shoot fire, she shot a fireball at a robot shaped target and it reacted as expected. She shrugged and put out the fire before it burned other things. Next she wanted to test her fighting skills.<br>\r\n She set up some moving targets and started to kick them. A couple broke like normal, but some flew across the room and got stuck in the wall. She stopped when this happened and pulled out. It was surprisingly easy for her to do as she would normally struggle with the task. She decided to test her new limit of strength.<br>\r\n She went to her weight room. The bar was already set higher than normal, for she always liked to push herself, but she set the weight even higher to see if she could do it. She pushed up the bar and it was really easy for her to do. She was probably as strong as Knuckles at this point and put the bar at his level.<br>\r\n She struggled a little but managed to push the bar up about ten times before becoming tired.

As princess, she had a lot of responsibilities on her own world that required her attension, and would only leave if there was some sort of emergency. And in that regard, she hadn't broken her record, this was certainly an emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe issue was that she never left at all. At least, not of her own accord. One moment she was falling asleep at her desk, working on continued relief efforts after Captain Whiskers' rampage, and the next thing she knew she was being woken up by a concerned human, asking what she was doing unconscious on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Blaze had been learning that friends were a gift and not a burden, she was certainly happy no one she knew had seen her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, after waving off the human, getting her bearings, and enduring a long train ride, she found herself in Mystic Ruins. Tired, humiliated, and a bit shaken, she pushed through the dense foliage, following a faded dirt path that she hoped lead to Tails' Workshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an annoying amount of maze-like turns, a mine-cart ride to nowhere, and a completely accidental but surprisingly pleasant visit with Big the Cat, Blaze finally pushed past the verdure to find a large clearing, where she spotted...</span></div></div>",

From where she stood, the ground sloped downward before hitting a large plot of ground that had been made unnaturally flat. Steel walkways and conveyer belts jutted out at sharp angles from a large, round building that was very clearly modeled to look like Robotnik's face. Peppered around the perimeter were a number of thin metallic spires, tesla coils at the top. Blaze found herself tempted to personally track down the Doctor and smack him once she realized that these spires were clearly designed to resemble egg cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was clearly abandoned. Rust had begun to seep in from seams and crevasses in the metal plating where erosion and time allowed for rain to pool within. Stray Egg-Pawns scattered about the area stood frozen in place where they had once idly patrolled before running out of fuel, paint chipped off in random sporadic patterns. As Blaze strolled forward, she heard no sirens, no alarms, just the ambience noise of the jungle and her heels clacking against the steel floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something unsettling about this place. While it was true that Eggman rarely cleaned up after himself, leaving bases empty and robot viscera for someone else to deal with, the bases he left behind were often gutted, if not by raiders then by the man himself not wanting to give up all of his stuff. Leaving behind badniks that presumably were functioning just fine simply seemed wasteful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd beyond this was the way the jungle itself seemed repelled by the structure. While bits of grass and roots seeped into the edges of the ground, there seemed to be no real attempt for nature to reclaim the area. No flowers growing up through cracks in the metal, no signs of animal life nesting within, no signs of life whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze drew closer to the main building, she began to sense some sort of energy from within. It felt like nothing of this world, nor of her own world. It felt strange and dark. And Blaze found herself drawn to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, she enters the base, following this energy to its source. What is causing this strange power?</span></div></div>",

This is a story, not a frickin' porno site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk fine. You can include the other characters, but Blaze also must be featured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright folks, let's get this thing going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew weeks after release: Due to some dude emailing me, I'm including a link to a website. Ya know, just for those wishing to add chapters without knowing what the story is. Ok, beginning the search now........it's working.......working..........working......working....working.....wwoorrkkiiiiinnnggg......Nah, hell with it. You want info, go to Youtube. Everyone does it these days.<br>\r\nSee you next time I decide to return here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven futher past release: Yikes, it's been quite a while. Anyways, I guess now would be a good time as any to add some things from the sequel 'Sonic Rush Adventure. Ya know, such as adding Marine as an expandable character and also giving senarios and locations from that game. These will be released shortly, till then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15/12/09: I've decided to be a bit more lenient with this story, popping is now allowed... within reason. I have also allieviated the rule against n00bs which now seems a bit harsh and have also added a chapter in myself. I hope many more may follow.</td>",
