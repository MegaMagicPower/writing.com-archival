Someone who could help others and save them with a smile like his idol All Might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is most people who want to be a hero are of a average height. Izuku was short, verrrry short. The ankle socks you put on, he's shorter then the hem, the tingling you feel under your foot is probably him when you accidentally stepped on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in another universe Izuku is quirkless and gains a quirk through training, here the boy is born with a quirk. One that makes the people in his life giants. The quirk made Izuku an inch in height and made him super tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having a quirk life as a tiny was tough. Izuku had to avoid the feet of giants and deal with the teasing of his childhood friend. Still when he saw the giant figure of All Might on his wall Izuku knew he could become a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, where do we start?</span></div></div>",

He knew that at his size, he wouldn't be facing off in the heat of battle like his hero, but he would be needed for much more delicate operations. And while it may not be the dream hero work he imagined, the fact that what he would be doing would help in a way no one else could... That was a dream in its own entirety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with the thousands of scholarship applications, the one containing the details and description of Izuku Midoriya reached the head offices of the committee of UA. There were arguments, concepts, worries about this one student. This one student, however small he may be, took up more time in that meeting than any other. It was Nezu, the principal, who finally brought the room to silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter how big. No matter how small. No matter how odd. Everyone has a way they can be a hero. Izuku Midoriya is special and with the right guidance; he could be the key to have that extra edge. He would need different training than the others, but... If we train him right. He could be exponentially detrimental to the side of evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy sat, watching TV quietly on the couch arm. Before a shrill of excitement nearly knocked him off onto the floor. The sight of his mother rushing into the room startled the small green-haired boy. But the words that escaped her lips push any fear away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU GOT THE SCHOLARSHIP!\" His mother shouted, a wide smile brightening her tired face. And while worry still clouded her mind, she knew better than to derail the good news. To which Izuku replied with many times the enthusiasm as his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car rolled up to the parking lot and parked quietly, the breeze bringing a welcome chill the rather warm morning. It was a bittersweet goodbye for Izuku's mother, while her joy and excitement ran through her, proud of her young boy. The worry for his safety consumed her mind, shrouding it in a saddened haze. But she would push it aside to support the one she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay safe, and listen to your teachers, and be nice to the other students, and eat your lunch, drink water-\" The micro cut the woman off by hugging her nose, as he had been held to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you mum.\" He stated, an excited smile greeting his lips to which the woman couldn't help but copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Izuku was placed carefully in front of the gates to the school, the mother being warned she was not to enter and the micro happily darted in. Eyes wide and full of joy as he speeds across the pavement...</span></div></div>",

He held great, he definitely would be the no.1 hero with this kinda quirk. That's what he thought then some stupid villain had to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain shrunk the boy down, intending to take him hostage. Bakugou fought with fury and even blinded one of the villains eyes. In the end however the villain got in a accident and passed, leaving Bakugou at a inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way to reverse the quirk, ot seems Bakugou would be stuck at an inch tall. Just like that all the fake people in his life started showing their true colors, his classmates took to teasing him. But Bakugou didn't back down if anyone wanted to fight he wouldn't hesitate to blast their faces in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou luckily had his family and childhood friend to help him.

As he reached the class, there was a sudden loud noise and a few of his classmates came running out over dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenette blinked in surprise but felt a lightbulb go off in his head when he saw a burned hole in the fleeing student's shirt. Walking into the class sure enough there was a growling speck on his desk with smoke coming out of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou clenched his teeth as his hands were still heated from blasting the giant fucker. Thought it be funny to come by and treat him like a doll, well he had another thing fucking coming! A shadow loomed over and looking up Bakugou saw the looming figure of Izuku worriedly looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kacchan are you ok?!\", the booming voice hit him and nearly knocked him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi I'm fine Deku, i told you if any extra besides you tries to touch me their getting their ass blasted!\", the blond crossed his arms still peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku worriedly tapped his fingers together. His little friend was pretty mad, how could he calm him down? An idea hit the freckled  boy which had him grinning. \"Do you wanna climb my feet Kacchan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou smirked as he stretched. \"Hell yeah, i gotta train to show those fuckers who's top here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku chuckled as he took a seat at the desk, reaching down to his large red shoes. With a grunt Izuku felt the shoe start to slip as it seems his socks adhear to the insoles from how sweaty his feet were and how much the plump soles stomped the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a <b>POP</b> the foot dislodged from the shoe, soon Izuku began to peel the socks off his plump soles a peeling sound emitted as his sweaty sole was revealed. Izuku flushed as he leaned back and propped both his large soles before his tiny friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry if the smells strong! I didn't have time to shower and i accidentally wore my used socks....\", the freckled boy rubbed his head sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou blinked as he stared up at the towering sole, trails of sweat dripping down. The smell being emitted was another, a chessy foot stench from Izuku's feet baking in his clunky shoes. While he wouldn't say it out loud the ash blond did have a fondness for his friend's feet, the bittersweet cheddar was oddly...alluring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch whatever i never complained about it before!\" , Bakugou yelled trying to cover up the mushy feeling he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou began to climb up the large foot, starting by probing himself up on the firm heel before trekking up the soft sole, getting a more potent aura of Izuku's rank foot odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku giggled at his friend's tiny hands climbing up his plump sole. He often did help the tiny with his training rather it be having him climb his body or squish him somehow. It did make the freckled boy a little embarrassed but he was happy to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon during his foot climb...</span></div></div>",

Now the two were walking through a hot, muggy forest and sweating up a storm..which made both boys cranky and itching to snap at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we're going the right way, Flame-Brain?\" Gray wiped the sweat from his naked torso. Natsu grit his teeth and yelled back, \"Of course I'm sure! Just shut up and put some clothes on Ice Stripper!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you call me?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called you a weirdo ice stripper!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were interrupted by the growling of Natsu's stomach. The awkwardness of the situation caused them to back off and Gray to scoff: \"You're hungry at a time like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-shut up!\" Natsu blushed, on cue Gray's stomach gurgled also. \"You're one to talk! I hear that stomach of yours!\" Natsu pointed a finger accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fine! Let's split up for now and go find some food!\" Gray blushed and yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea..for once!\" Natsu charged to the right, yelling that he was going to find a pig to roast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray rolled his eyes and of course went the opposite direction. After what seemed like forever he came upon some sort of ancient altar with a heavy bronze idol on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird...must be from some old civilization. But I've never heard of anyone living out this way.\" Gray murmured as he strode up to the strange altar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe altar was covered in moss and overgrown with vines, it had clearly been there for a long time. Squatting before the ancient thing, he brushed some of the moss and dirt off to reveal letters he'd never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords he didn't understand and couldn't read were before his eyes, he scowled. \"What is this crap?\" Standing back up, he reached towards the idol and picked it up to inspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the eyes of the small statue glowed and its mouth opened via some mechanism. A mist poured out and surrounded Gray, causing him to cough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes grew heavy, and he knew no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of earth shaking booms startled the ice make wizard awake. It was close to midday now, how long had he been out?! \"GRAAAAY!\" A booming voice that seemed to come from the sky itself rattled his ear drums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" Gray covered his ears as the ground quaked once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ICE STRIPPER! PERVERT! GET OUT HERE!\" The booming voice demanded, growing closer with each series of earthquakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...those are Natsu's annoying nicknames for me..\" Gray finally gained his bearings and looked around. \"No..way..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything, from the leaves to the smalles stone was ENORMOUS to him now! Looking up, he saw that damn altar and the idol laying before him, the size of a mountain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did that stupid thing shrink me?!\" Gray shrieked before two massive quakes shook his bones and two big feet clad in black sandals were placed on either side of him.</span></div></div>",

Only for them to commit one of the greatest alchemy taboos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human transmutation attempt not only failed at bringing their mother back, but it brought a terrifying change. The two were together when they saw the mysterious white figure, how he grinned before suddenly stretching into the sky and looking down at them as if they were ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis truth showed horror as upon coming to in their house the brothers now were only a inch in height! The furniture like mountains and the suit of armor like a goliath solider looming over. The Elric brother's punishment for attempting human transmutation was to be stuck at the size of mere ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the end however as after recovering the brothers were essentially taken in by the military. Ed was livid believing that they wanted them just as some sort of item. But they were made wards of Colonel Roy mustang and were allowed to study and practice alchemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked out for the tiny boys keeping them safe. Still he did find teasing the elder Elric fun, almost stepping on him with his boots or mocking the sensitive topic of Ed's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl would often research being grateful for all the help. Though being treated like a doll did get old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were the brothers today?</span></div></div>",

The cultists watched as darkness surrounded the arcane circle surrounding the altar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"KILL THEM KILL THEM KILL THEM KILL THEM!!!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe emerged from the darkness, a shadow which drove many of the cultist's mad in the instant before their gory deaths. The ritual chamber was tinged scarlet from the slaughter at this point. Not a single cultist remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the shadow emerged a red eyed young man, with shoulder length scarlet hair that matched the blood in the room almost too well. Ciel scrambled away from the approaching figure, his eyebrows rose when he saw how miniscule the 'creature' was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fee to cross the river has already been paid, and what is lost can never be regained. At least that's what they tell me...\" The young man was a lot..smaller than Ciel anticipated for what he'd just done to the cultists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lad in the cage's eye twitched, what the hell was this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you....a demon?\" Ciel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, impressive ain't I?\" The demon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel didn't say anything, but it was clear he was in disbelief...though whether it was from how tiny and pathetic the demon was...or the fact he was conversing with a demon wasn't clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...I suppose. Are you here to help me?\" Ciel inquired, he was malnourished and had been treated worse than an animal for over a week..he didn't care whether you were tiny..he wanted out of here and to get his vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a poof of smoke the demon was gone and reappeared inside the cage with the giant and clearly dirty lad. \"Y'know you're pretty lucky that it was me who showed up. The other demons only accept payment in human souls!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel gulped, \"S-so what do you accept payment in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I haven't gotten out in a century or two, so it'll be nice to experience the human world for a change of pace. I suppose what I'm saying is, if you make a deal with me...I'll follow your every order, and once you have your revenge or whatever on these folks...I'll stick around for a bit because Hell is boring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be a joke, this sounded too good to be true! Ciel would get to keep his soul AND wield the power of a demon to wreak vengeance upon his enemies and anyone who crossed him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Ciel nodded firmly. \"Alright, just so you know, the more visible the spot where the contract seal is, the more control you'll have over me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place it anywhere you wish.\" Ciel said, accepting the final part of the deal. \"Okay, this is gonna hurt.\" Snapping his fingers, the demon sent a blast of magic into Ciel's right eye. The child screamed in pain as blood poured from the socket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n\"Master?

However, unlike a normal footrub Asteral twitch his fingers imitating that of a tickle. The toes began to wiggle more and Ciel's body shifted. Asteral grinned as he continued to tickle the toe. The feet even shifted, rising slightly to show the sweaty sole, Asteral rubbed the sole as well to try and wake Ciel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon....</span></div></div>",

Needless to say he certainly worked up a sweat on that mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were so cool out there Killua!\", a tiny voice squeked out. Killua chuckled as he looked up, though he couldn't see his forehead the Zoldyck knew a tiny greenette was peeking over his hairline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up, Killua lightly plucked up Gon before setting him on his large palm. The boy smiled amused as Gon gave one of his toothy grins. \"Thanks Gon, those losers were nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gon was certainly a headstrong boy, even with his shocking inch tall he wanted to become a Hunter and meet his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exam already proved difficult even before it began!

Sighing out of breath, Gon stopped for a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta keep going, I'll beat this big or small!\", pumping his fist rejuvenated Gon's energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a loud noise approached, like that of a train track. However a sudden large breeze hit Gon as the train turned out to be a giant skateboard, luckily the wheels weren't in Gon's path and stopped right before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground then shook as a large purple sneaker dropped from the board. Gon shook his head to get his bearings before a booming sound came from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Since when do bugs wear clothes?\", Gon looked up as a shadow covered the area around. All Gon saw a palm approaching him before he was shrouded in warm darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua rose an eyebrow as he opened his palm and saw a tiny boy around his age. The boy's bright intimating eyes were locked with Gon's as he loomed above like a mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>POKE</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon laughed as Killua lightly poked his stomach with his finger. \"Haha hey stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua grinned. \"Your a little short to be attempting the hunter exam shrimp.\", the tiny ceased his laughing as he looked up determined. \"I might be little but I'm not gonna give up this easily!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zoldyck was quiet before suddenly setting Gon on his shoulder. The greenete blinked before looking at the giant grinning amused as he kicked up his board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, how i give you a lift then?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua let out a relaxed sigh as he flopped down on the bed, setting Gon on his chest. Gon smiled as he laid down, around him a aura of sweaty fumes were emitted from Killua's damp shirt. B.o usually made noses turn but Gon found some comfort in it, reminding him how strong and....safe his giant friend was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired boy put his arms behind his head, letting loose a more sour odor from the caverns of his pits. Killua tapped his shoes, feeling his squishy and sweaty soles press against the insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua chuckled as he looked at Gon relaxing. \"Sorry about the smell Gon, you don't mind right?\", Killua teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon flushed, Killua certainly knew about his fondness of his friend's stench. All the times he looked at Killua's huge feet or sniffed his odor, the Zoldyck noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no Killua your smell's strong just like you!\", Gon grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning Killua leaned his head up. \"Well if that's the case....</span></div></div>",

He squatted down over Yato, his grey jeans hugging his ass nicely. \"Whoa, what the heck did you do to yourself? You're such a screwup of a god that I don't doubt this was something you were gonna use on me?\" Yukine boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?! No!

Your choice, but I gotta warn you...tomorrow is supposed to be pretty hot.\" Yukine chuckled evilly, his wicked thoughts affecting Yato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYato's nose was in hell, Yukine's toe lint and grime smelled like a concentrated version of his foot odor mixed with a heavy dose of vinegar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods...how could you do THAT stuff to me?!\" Yato's head was filled with images of horrifically disgusting things Yukine was thinking of doing to him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Yato's screams only earned him a taste of the slimy funk!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His toes crept closer and closer, feeling around for their prey and giving the panicking Yato a good glimpse of the linty funk between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they found their mark as the sock was pulled on tighter.

The lint gunk between Yukine's toes had melted and became gooey. Not only was the funky stench stuck to the god but jam was smeared on his dark clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shinki soon dozed off, smiling as he wiggled his toes. Yato cringed as the large toes rubbed him up and down while shoving more cheese in his nostrils. The odor was not only putrid but also hot and made him feel like gagging from the sweaty and gunky crevice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom rubbing his toes together, Yukine's toes began to pull the tiny god down to the sole. Yato furiously tried to pull himself from getting pull under the sole as he felt his legs getting smooshed by the plump sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"NO I DON'T WANNA GET SQUISHED BY HIS STINKY FEET!\"</i>, Yato thought over dramatically as he soon sank and was enveloped in the ball of Yukine's soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shinki stirred in his sleep pushing his feet out. Making contact with the wall, Yato was stomped into the plump sole. The god felt his bulging eyes burn from the salty sweat and chessy odor he breathed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing squished between the plump sole and insole of the sneaker had Yato trapped in a heavy, chessy blanket breathing in the sweaty stench from Yukine's feet cooking in the ratty socks.

Of course all of that came crashing down when he brought home a cat that turned out to be a vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the young boy was in a contract with the vampire he named Kuro. Having to fight against the new threats he faces. What's more is recently he had a bad run in with one of Tsubaki's subclasses, this one being able to shrink people down. Luckily Kuro was there to save him but now he was stuck at a inch tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Kuro said it was very troublesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nMahiru blinked the sleepiness out of his eyes as he woke up. The brunette boy stretched his limbs, sitting up from the soft ground and yawning. The ground beneath him rose and fell, a strange low booming noise made him wonder how he managed to get sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed the boy was sleeping on wasn't actually a bed at all. It turns out his Servamp Kuro was actually snoozing and Mahiru was sleeping on the vast chest of the vampire. Kuro had wanted to keep him close so without any second thought the blue haired male set his tiny eve on his chest and was off to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru stood up, wobbling slightly from the booming snores and rising chest of Kuro. \"Ne Kuro come on wake up!\", the boy shouted only for the vampire to continue snoozing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Mahiru began a long trek to the face of his Servamp. Along the way Mahiru felt his nose crinkle as a musky scent filled his nostrils. As it turned out there was a heat wave going on, yet Kuro refused to not wear his fluffy jacket even if it had him sweating not to mention he was as lazy as ever and didn't bother washing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru grunted as he started climbing the warm neck of Kuro soon climbing onto the cliff that was his chin. The boy covered his ears as the booming snores blasted him, not to mention opened up the wide mouth with fangs made Mahiru a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some manoeuvring, Mahiru made it to Kuro's eye. The eve sighed before tapping the eyelid. \"Kuro come on we can't spend the whole day sleeping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru suddenly felt the back of his shirt get plucked and he was brought into the air. Kuro's red eye opened and stared lazily at the speck between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm Mahiru what is it?\", the vampire said in a tired voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuro you need to get up, it's already noon and it'll be night before we-woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru suddenly let out a yelp as Kuro moved him away from his face, soon down to the crook of his neck. Mahiru was placed laying against the warm skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still tired we can get up in 5...hours.\", Kuro said closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eve felt a tick mark grow on his head. \"That's way too late! Come on we there's stuff to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro yawned before....</span></div></div>",

Even though you dislike the thought of it, we have to stay indoors till night.\" The giant vampire rubbed his eyes with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuro, I know that! But take a look around! My apartment looks like a dumpster! There are empty cans, ramen cups and chips bags everywhere, the sight of it drives me crazy.. yet alone the thought of not being able to clean all of this mess up. You can't just throw your trash everywhere, it starts to smell! And while we're at it, you should take a bath at some point, because the trash isn't the only thing that starts to smell around here.\"<br>\r\nKuro just rolled his eyes at the outburst of his Eve. He was annoyed about the fact that Mahiru wanted him to clean up, he was still tiered, on the other hand the tiny boy was right, the apartment did start to develop an unpleasant smell. This annoyed the giant just more- with a big sigh the Vampire stood up and placed Mahiru on the table.<br>\r\n\"Fine, you won. I'll clean up, but after that you'll let me sleep in peace, ok?\"<br>\r\n\"No, because by the time you're done it'll be night!\" the tiny Eve was outraged again, he couldn't believe the Servamp. All he does is sleep and eat during the day time, and during the night he does look for a way to bring him back to normal size, but complains about how troublesome it is the whole time through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mahiru's words of anger didn't even reach his Servamp's ears, luckily. Because if they did, Kuro would've most likely stopped cleaning up and would've gone back to bed.<br>\r\nKuro managed to surprise his tiny Eve, not only did he clean up fairly well, it took Kuro just about an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done Kuro, I'm amazed!\"<br>\r\nKuro nodded \"Well then, I'll go back to sleep.\"<br>\r\n\"No! If you go to sleep now, god knows how long it'll take me to wake you up! Just stay awake.\"<br>\r\n\"But I did what you asked for, just a quick nap- 3-6 hours should do the trick. By the way, I didn't see you do anything.\"<br>\r\n\"That is because I can't do anything at this size! If there would be something I could clean up, I would be more than happy to do so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave Kuro an idea. \"Alright, so you would clean anything, without complaints and be happy about it?\"<br>\r\nMahiru nodded. It was pure torture for him to be stuck at this height. He was used to doing everything by himself, he didn't need any help, nor did he want any help. He enjoyed the work, but now at this size the was literary nothing to do for him.<br>\r\n\"You promise?\" Mahiru nodded again.<br>\r\n\"I've got something to do for you. You can clean it and in the meantime I can take a nap. Deal?\" the cat couldn't help but giggle.<br>\r\n\"And what do you have for me?\"<br>\r\n\"Just wait and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro leaned down and undid the laces of his right boot and started to take it off. It required some force to do so, the sweat created by the temperatures glued it to his foot. Finally it came off with a *plub* sound and revealed Kuro's bare, pale, sweat drenched foot.<br>\r\nHe sat the boot on the ground and picked the brown haired tiny up.<br>\r\n\"Wait Kuro, you can't be serious! I can smell it from here! Please, you can go back to sleep- but I don't want to clean the inside of your boot.\"<br>\r\nBut the Servamp ignored the pleads of his Eve, after all he said he would do anything right now, as long as he would have something to do. And with that he let go off Mahiru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny was released and fell down the entrance of the boot, the deeper he got, the darker it became, before it face-first dropped into the moist and worn out insole of the boot.<br>\r\n\"Oh god, when was the last time he took those off?\"<br>\r\nKuro looked onto Mahiru's tiny form and decided to...</span></div></div>",

It being because in this story the ones who are tiny are the anime characters themselves. Now you could put yourself into this story tiny as well if you wish to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this interactive is about a anime character being tiny and going throughout their life. Now you could go the classic route where somehow a character mysteriously shrinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could do something cool called a Tiny AU ( tiny alternate universe ). This basically is an au where a character is tiny and it's somewhat natural, for instance they may have been born tiny or a incident before their story shrunk them down for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExample: Izuku could actually have a quirk that made him tiny his whole life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething like that. You can have the other characters either be oblivious to the tiny or full aware of their tiny presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you can put yourself into the story as the one who gets shrunk, though the choices of the characters themselves will be put up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk onto the rules<br>\r\n- Keep giant content M/M<br>\r\n- The tiny in question can have high durability or some kind of boost while being small.<br>\r\n- Pretty much everything except for piss or scat is allowed <br>\r\n- Keep explicit content to the older characters.<br>\r\n- If you add anything besides a choice chapter,  please make it at least 500 words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, enjoy and enjoy the tiny lives of some anime dudes~</td>",
