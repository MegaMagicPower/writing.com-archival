            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been years since the destruction of the D-Reaper, and life had become much simpler since then, at least for Renamon, the other Digimon...and well just about everyone.  Tamers and Digimon alike had taken to a life of ease, and the whole lot of them were much more relaxed.  Each day only brought the pairs closer to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite this new closeness, it didn't amount to much.  There were no longer any epic struggles that called for their expertese, and the days began to grow long and lazy.  At least that's how it was for Renamon.  Renamon had been thoroughly satisfied with her fighting, action packed life style; living an the edge really, become stronger.  But it wasn't until recently that she had enjoyed the luxury of true relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, many of the Digimon were now able to enjoy pleasure that normally they paid no heed to.  One of these pleasures, was food.  Food had always been pure neccisity to some, and unneccesary indulgence to others.  Now however, most of the Digimon truely did experiance how wonderful food could really be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon knew this all to well, as often she found herself overindulging.  Quite recently, Renamon had become aware that she was gaining a bit of weight.  The slim vixen had developed the tiniest layer of flab that covered her entire body.  Renamon let out a sigh, patting this new fat.  With a second paw, she continued to polish off a burger she had just recently been given, thanks to Rika of course.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the thought of weight gain did cause Renamon some discomfort at first, she wasn't too worred.  She thought for sure Rika would be quite displeased, but her trainer's reaction was quite the opposite.  When Renamon first approached Rika, she laughed, and told Renamon it wasn't a problem, as long as she didn't find herself obese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, Renamon's thoughts turned to Guilmon.  Now there was a real glutton she thought, smiling to herself.  Takato couldn't help but indulge his friends heavy appetite, and Guilmon couldn't help but be a glutton.  Because of this, Guilmon had grown to become quite fat, a large belly spilled out from underneath a pair of meaty breasts.  But he was happy, and as long as it stayed that way, nobody took to much interest.  Besides, it wasn't like they needed to be in shape for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note however, Renamon remembered she was supposed to find Rika.  Renamon was sitting alone in Rika's room, completly forgetting that Rika was waiting for her.  You see, Rika had recently found a job.  It wasn't anything too glamerous or anything, but currently, she was working at...</span></div></div>",

Her bust had swollen slightly and her limbs had gained new weight to them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal had become altogether chubby, and was definatly in no mood to try and stop it.  Blinking her eyes a bit, she looked about her room with a tiny grin - remnants of food everywhere - all of it was packed tightly inside her swollen gut.  She patted her stomach gently and let out a sudden belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing truely made her happy like a nice binge, which of course however, had obvious sideffects of fatnes.  Not that she altogether minded, but others certainly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit harder to find work ever since, as not many places wanted to show of her new flabby body.

She knew just the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorneria was home to some of the finest cuisine, and \"The Flagship\" was no exception.  Slightly humorous and adequately corny, \"The Flagship\" was a restaurant designed to mock or perhaps acknowledge the fine world of pilots, mercenaries, and other space warriors in the plight of fine dining.  Some may be taken aback by the theme of the place, but all together, \"The Flagship\" had some very good reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh how many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing slightly, Krystal replied \"Just one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host looked slightly surprised but thinking nothing of it, brought her to a cozy seat in the corner.  The atmosphere was pleasant but the fake ships hanging from the ceiling reminded Krystal of Fox.  She frowned to herself - perhaps this wasn't the right place.  But it was too late and after being served a drink, Krystal looked over the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBudget wise, this was place was going to eat her money very fast.  She couldn't even afford some of the really spendy cuisine.  This defiantly seemed like a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Krystal's stomach desired pure and expensive foods and that's just what she was going to get.  Maybe she could pit-pocket somebody.  She could ditch the bill.  Or she could whoo somebody over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were momentarily interrupted by the returning waiter and expecting him to take her order, Krystal opened her mouth to speak, but only to meet further interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\" said the dignified hare, \"but it appears the man over there\" and pointing across several tables to a darkened table, \"\\ would like to have a word, and if, the madam would allow, would like to buy you dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer surprise must have shown on her face, as the waiter began again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I decline his offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no,\" replied Krystal hastily.  Raising his eyebrow slightly, the hare gave Krystal an almost snobbish look.  Ignoring him, Krystal began to think.  A free meal at such an expensive restaurant? There has to be a catch.  It's just too easy! Then again, food is food, catch or not. But why dine with a complete stranger? Unless, I know the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled as if on que.

Though she did not she got a few looks every now and then, she certainly hadn't been asked to dinner by anyone...well, anyone other then Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox. Just his name stirred unwanted feelings in her and Krystal suddenly became aware she was grinding her teeth disturbingly loud.  Apparently a few others noticed as well, giving Krystal a few disrespectful looks.  Quickly regaining her composure, Krystal pretended to cough, and drinking frantically from a glass of water, smiled as the she set the glass down.  But before she had the chance to do anything else embarrassing, Krystal looked up to find the waiter standing patiently beside her table.  He cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" said Krystal impatiently.  The hare sighed as if it caused him great difficulty to express the man's reply,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He says, he's an old friend.\"  Krystal looked at the waiter as if expecting more, this thought was quickly put to rest as the hare added quickly, \"And that is all.\"  Krystal was at a loss again, and the waiter gave a look of great impatience.  Krystal however had already decided to accept this man's offer; she was getting very, very hungry.  Giving a nod to the waiter, she followed the impressive hare to the table.

But her thoughts were not given the chance to wander to far, interrupted as they were by her new host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Names 'Colonal Claw'\" said the jolly lizard, extending his hand to Krystal.  The reluctant vixen managed a weak smile before shaking his hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least that's what they used to call me back in my prime,\" the Colonal burst into a fit of merry laughter before continuing.  \"Real names Cray though, believe it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was lost for words.  Why would an underling of Scales want to invite her to dinner?  His southern drawl was heavy, and his uniform was tattered.  Who was this idiot?  Sensing her confusion however, Claw continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now before you get any strange ideas, let me explain.  I'm not here ta instigate ya.  Think of it more as an apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"APOLOGY,\" Blurted Krystal, as if that was the biggest understatement she'd ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now just listen.  Here's the thing,\" Began Claw in a sudden serious tone, \"I was never part of Scales little uprising ya see?  Believe it or not, Sauria had it's own military system before he came along.  That's why I told ya, I was Colonal.  As soon as Scales took power, he named himself General and liquidated the powers of all other ranks.  Don't you worry miss, I was against him from the start. Had me detained for a looong time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal relaxed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't even bother about all that Sauria stuff.  You have my apologies for that damned Scales, but lets just have ourselves a good time.  My words don't mean much but hopefully the food will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoning a banquet, several waiters began to place a wide assortment of foods before the two guests.  There was good reason this Colonal was so fat thought Krystal.  It wasn't like her to freeload off somebody, especially not someone who could be a potential enemy.  Yet sensing no threat, Krystal dug in wholeheartedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, still true to her initial intuition, Krystal made sure to watch the lizard very carefully.</span></div></div>",

She often went around in a flannel shirt tied off at her belly button, a white straw hat resting atop her head, with chocolate brown hair gently blowing in the wind as she walked with a sexual hip sway. <br>\r\n      One day while she was milking the cows, gently caressing the cow's utters with long, thin  fingers, a loud bang could be heard on the distance. This spooked the cow into running away, accidental trampling the poor girl and knocking her unconscious.<br>\r\n       Allyson awoke hours later with a serious migraine. Other than the migraine, Allyson felt different in... Other ways. For whatever reason, her bra felt tighte! Due to said uncomfortableness, our heroine saw no choice but to take her bra off, but something still felt off. Thinking that she needed to refresh herself and headed to the bathroom, and that's when she saw the change.<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",
