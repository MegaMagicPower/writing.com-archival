He had hoped that his boyfriend Tom would be present for the test. But Tom had cancelled at the last moment. Well, if this worked, Tom could be present at other tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...4...3...2...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strident \"ZAP!\" sounded in his ears just as a bright green flash momentarily blinded and disoriented him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose effects were only fleeting.

His device had worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the huge laboratory. His lab equipment towered above him like. The control panel's console of dials, buttons and gauges loomed far overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done it!\" Eric shouted in triumph. He was startled by the strange, high-pitched tone of his voice at his reduced size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe estimated he was only about six inches tall. That had been the reduction he had programmed into the console panel. He was excited that not only could his device shrink things, but it could also be programmed to shrink them to a specific size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood in the center of the elevated platform. He had programmed the device to reverse the shrinking automatically. He only needed to wait a few seconds and then he would be back to normal and able to carry out more tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device began to hum \u2014 a much louder noise than he recalled. The sudden pyrotechnics of showering sparks erupted from the focusing lens of his device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Eric shouted in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sparks flew overhead. Then, instead of building to a steady glow, the beam's lens simply went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric experienced a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had gone wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stared up at the distance control panel. To reach the controls would be a challenge equal if not surpassing the scaling of a tall wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered himself over the edge of the elevated platform and dropped onto the floor. He sprinted across the floor and stopped at the base of the control console unit. He saw no way of scaling the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a visitor arrived in the laboratory.</span></div></div>",

Don, Eric's assistant, didn't seem to <br>\r\nknow much about Eric's whereabouts either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like Eric to stand him up. Whatever <br>\r\ncame up must have been important. Besides, <br>\r\nhe thought, Eric could always call him on his <br>\r\ncell phone whenever he got back. There were <br>\r\ncertainly worse ways to pass the time than by <br>\r\nsharing a few drinks with Eric's assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Tom brightened. \"How about that <br>\r\ncorner bar just across campus -- the one right <br>\r\nacross from the dorms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon rubbed the back of his neck and looked <br>\r\nup from the darkened console of Eric's device. <br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he answered again. \"We can walk from <br>\r\nhere, I you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's eyes settled again on Don's <br>\r\nwell-formed ass and he smiled wider. \"Lead <br>\r\nthe way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the scene from under the platform, <br>\r\nEric seethed. He started after the giants, <br>\r\nsprinting across the wide expanse of floor as <br>\r\nhis boyfriend and his lab assistant reached <br>\r\nthe door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!!\" He shouted up angrily at the two <br>\r\nenormous figures as they walked through the <br>\r\ndoorway. \"God damn it! Where the fuck do you <br>\r\ntwo think you're going?!\" Eric yelled at the two <br>\r\ngiants, briefly losing sight of his predicament <br>\r\nin his anger at what he had just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom and Don were out into the hallway by the <br>\r\ntime Eric reached the door, seemingly <br>\r\noblivious to the tiny shouts. Eric had barely <br>\r\nenough time to slip through the doorway <br>\r\nbefore the massive wooden door clicked shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's lab coat flapped wildly as he raced <br>\r\ndown the expanse of the hallway toward the <br>\r\ntwo giants, who were rapidly gaining distance <br>\r\non him. Even as he ran, Eric was beginning to <br>\r\nrealize the full scale of his surroundings. Tom <br>\r\nand Don were almost at the end of the hall, <br>\r\nbut Eric had only reached the base of the next <br>\r\ndoorway down the hall. They rounded the <br>\r\ncorner, talking in the distance as they left his <br>\r\nview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stopped to catch his breath next to an <br>\r\nenormously tall object -- a waste receptacle, <br>\r\nhe realized absently. He steadied himself <br>\r\nagainst it. The cool plastic felt strange against <br>\r\nhis tiny hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would never be able to keep up with the <br>\r\ntwo giants, even at their relatively leisurely <br>\r\npace. He looked around, shuddering at how <br>\r\ntiny he felt in the enormous hallway. At this <br>\r\nsize, each linoleum tile was almost twice as <br>\r\nwide as his height. Further, bits of dust, dirt <br>\r\nand trash had become magnified into small <br>\r\npieces of rubble strewn about his path. It was <br>\r\nfortunate that it was late enough that most <br>\r\nstudents and even staff members had left for <br>\r\nthe evening, or he'd have to contend with them <br>\r\nas well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had this thought registered in <br>\r\nEric's mind than he suddenly heard the <br>\r\nsqueak of footsteps approaching from the <br>\r\nhallway behind him. Eric whirled around to <br>\r\nsee an enormous athletic giant enter the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott, a promising ball player but less <br>\r\npromising science student who was currently <br>\r\nfailing Eric's class, rounded the corner and <br>\r\ncame into view. He seemed to be in a hurry, <br>\r\nand zeroed in on Eric's lab. He opened the <br>\r\ndoor enough to poke his head into the lab <br>\r\nroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Brevard? You here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Scott closed the door again and <br>\r\ncontinued down the hall toward Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily frozen, Eric hid behind the waste <br>\r\nreceptacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott reached the door next to Eric, pushed it <br>\r\nopen, and stepped inside. The door swung <br>\r\nshut before Eric could reach it, but he noticed <br>\r\nthat the gap under the door was wide enough <br>\r\nthat he could probably squeeze underneath <br>\r\nwith little effort. In fact, all the doors in the <br>\r\nhallway (with the probable exception of the <br>\r\noutside doors) seemed to be similarly <br>\r\nconstructed.</span></div></div>",

Down here!\" Eric called up to the <br>\r\nmuscular giant. He heard a snap and a <br>\r\nmetallic zip as Scott unfasted his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric darted closer, between his student's feet. <br>\r\nThere was a sudden torrent of liquid as Scott's <br>\r\npiss stream hit the back of the urinal, <br>\r\nspattering and cascading down the porcelain <br>\r\nto pool and whirl around the slotted, domed <br>\r\ndrain grate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott! Listen, Scott! I'm down--!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's foot slipped in a spot of water on the <br>\r\nslick tile. With a small, surprised yelp, the tiny <br>\r\nscientist skidded over the edge of the urinal, <br>\r\ndropping about four inches (but what seemed <br>\r\nto him to be about four feet) to the catch basin <br>\r\nbelow. Hot urine splashed and swirled all <br>\r\naround him, drenching him as he sprawled <br>\r\nacross the slick, smooth, rounded surface. <br>\r\nThe acrid stuff stung his eyes and splashed in <br>\r\nhis mouth and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlailing and coughing, Eric grabbed at one of <br>\r\nthe holes in the dome of the drain grating to <br>\r\nsteady himself. The torrent of urine was <br>\r\nslowing, and Eric was able to regain his <br>\r\nfooting on the smooth surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Scott! I'm down here! P-Please--!!\" Eric <br>\r\nsputtered up, waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was reaching for the flushing lever as he <br>\r\nspotted the movement and heard a tiny sound <br>\r\nbelow. His mouth opened wordlessly, and he <br>\r\ncrouched slowly, looming over the tiny figure <br>\r\nflailing in the urinal basin below. Recognition <br>\r\ncame slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor?\" Scott mouthed the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gasped to regain his breath and his <br>\r\ncomposure, struggling under the added <br>\r\nweight of his soaked clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...! Yeah, it's me...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's eyes widened. \"I was just looking for <br>\r\nyou,\" he stammered, trying to process what he <br>\r\nwas seeing. \"What -- what happened? You're <br>\r\nso -- LITTLE...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stood upright, looking as much like a <br>\r\ndrenched animal as a tiny man in a lab coat <br>\r\ncan look. He considered the looming <br>\r\nbehemoth above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it's a -- it's a long story. My experiment <br>\r\nwent a little off course. Would you help me <br>\r\nback to my lab, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott blinked. The giant's upper body was <br>\r\nespecially huge and powerful. His biceps <br>\r\nstrained in the sleeves of his tight T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lab? Sure.... Oh, that reminds me -- I <br>\r\nhave to talk to you about changing my <br>\r\ngrade....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's huge hand reached down toward the <br>\r\nminiature drenched man, apparently <br>\r\nconsidering no option other than pick him up. <br>\r\nHuge, thick fingers wrapped around the <br>\r\ntoy-sized body, lifting Eric off the smooth wet <br>\r\nporcelain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, Professor -- you're a mess... Sorry <br>\r\nabout --\" Scott trailed off, trying to bite back the <br>\r\nhumor he found in the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott carried Eric to the sink, ran some water, <br>\r\nand lowered the tiny man into the flow. \"Better <br>\r\nget you cleaned up first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, Eric found himself on slick <br>\r\nporcelain under a strong torrent. But gratefully, <br>\r\nhe rinsed himself in the powerful shower of <br>\r\nwarm water. The force ripped at his loose <br>\r\njacket and knocked him down, but at least he <br>\r\nfelt cleaner. He pulled his arms out of his lab <br>\r\ncoat and cast it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott closed the faucet and reached down for <br>\r\nhis minuscule professor again. Before Eric <br>\r\ncould stop it, he saw his jacket carried by the <br>\r\nreceding water down the drainhole. In the next <br>\r\nmoment, Scott's thick fingers again closed <br>\r\naround him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott lifted the dripping figure to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, I really need to talk to you about my <br>\r\ngrade....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's face had paled as he watched his lab <br>\r\ncoat washed down the drain. He looked up at <br>\r\nScott's enormous expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can talk over anything you want once I get <br>\r\nmy device back online.\" Eric's response <br>\r\nsounded almost automatic. All he could focus <br>\r\non was ending this strange nightmare. He <br>\r\nrested his tiny fingers and hands over the <br>\r\nedge of one of Scott's enclosing fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott turned to the bathroom door, pressing <br>\r\nhis case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you see, if I don't pass this class, <br>\r\nI'll be ineligible for the game.... Hell, they'll <br>\r\nprobably cut me off the team.... You've gotta <br>\r\nchange my grade...

His soaked shirt and trousers <br>\r\nclung to his skin, making him feel even more <br>\r\nentangled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, there's not much time to turn things <br>\r\naround now. The semester's nearly over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was insistant. \"Even an incomplete -- I <br>\r\ncan make that up during the break.

I need a pass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd help if I could...\" Eric looked up at the <br>\r\nhandsome young face. He was genuinely <br>\r\nbeginning to wish he could bend the rules, but <br>\r\neven in his current predicament, it went <br>\r\nagainst everything he believed as an <br>\r\ninstructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can! Jesus, you're the professor! You're <br>\r\nsaying you won't even give me a fucking <br>\r\nincomplete?\" Scott's voice grew angrier with <br>\r\ndesparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, just take me back to the lab. We'll do <br>\r\nsomething about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's grasp constricted again. The pressure <br>\r\naround Eric grew intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you back to the lab, alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott slammed open the door with his free <br>\r\nhand. If anyone had happened to be in the <br>\r\nhalls, they might have been startled by the <br>\r\nsight of the angry young athlete carrying an <br>\r\nincredibly life-like doll of a professor, but no <br>\r\none was there to witness it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stormed back to the lab room. He <br>\r\ngrabbed the doorknob, and slammed open <br>\r\nthe door. The world seemed to whiz past <br>\r\nEric's view at breakneck speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott charged into the room toward the desk. <br>\r\nHe paused at the shrink ray device. <br>\r\nSomething clicked inside Scott, and his eyes <br>\r\nnarrowed toward the tiny figure in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the damn device that did this to you?\" <br>\r\nHe held Eric up to his scowling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yes...\" Eric managed to gasp. \"But it's <br>\r\ngot some bug in the system....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna have a hell of a lot more than THAT <br>\r\nwrong with it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stepped toward the device and gave it a <br>\r\nsideways kick. It skidded and toppled over <br>\r\nsideways, crashing to the hard floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric screamed. \"NO!! What the hell are you <br>\r\ndoing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stomped on the main body of the device <br>\r\nwith powerful drives of his massive feet. Bits <br>\r\nof metal, plastic and glass shattered and <br>\r\ntwisted. Months and months of work were <br>\r\ndestroyed in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting where he was, Eric screamed at <br>\r\nthe giant. \"You moron! What have you done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wouldn't even give me a fucking BREAK!\" <br>\r\nScott was out of control as he turned from the <br>\r\nremains of the device and started rifling <br>\r\nthrough papers on his professor's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this now! Scott, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the goddamn gradebook?!\" Scott <br>\r\nransacked the desk, pulling a drawer out of its <br>\r\ntrack and digging angrily through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was losing his composure as well. \"I <br>\r\ndon't even have the gradebook. My assistant <br>\r\nhas it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying! Why would he have it?\" Scott <br>\r\npulled out another drawer and scattered its <br>\r\ncontents on the desktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does all the paper work. I need the time to <br>\r\nwork on my experiments.\"  Now, he realized, <br>\r\nhe'd need more time than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott backed away from the desk and turned <br>\r\nhis attention back to the minuscule professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'll get it later. All I wanted was a god <br>\r\ndamned fucking break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that next semester we can try <br>\r\nagain...\" Eric tried to sound reassuring, but the <br>\r\nterror in his small voice betrayed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm not goin' a whole fucking semester <br>\r\nwithout playing. My game would be screwed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason seemed to be slowly catching up with <br>\r\nScott. He took a deep breath, and considered <br>\r\nthe situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, without that thing you were workin' on, you <br>\r\ncan't get big again, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure it can be repaired. It may take <br>\r\nsome time.\" Eric looked at the shattered <br>\r\nremains of his device, and wondered who he <br>\r\nwas really trying to convince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott, too, looked back at the shattered device, <br>\r\nthen back down at Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way I can leave you here now, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could call someone to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked around the room again. The <br>\r\nreality of the trouble he was in began to dawn <br>\r\non him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No one can ever find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, let's be reasonable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott breathed through barely parted lips as <br>\r\nhe considered his moves.

I have to keep you somewhere until --\"<br>\r\nScott glanced around again, then he looked <br>\r\ndown at his pockets. At six inches tall, his <br>\r\ncaptive would really be too big to be concealed <br>\r\nthere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look, just leave me here,\" Eric pleaded. <br>\r\n\"We'll forget all about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you won't.\" Scott's voice was cold. <br>\r\n\"Everyone says you're gay. It's true, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched Scott's eyes, not answering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. Let's see what you can do in here, ya <br>\r\nlittle homo! In you go....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott snickered and opened his jeans, pulling <br>\r\nopen his briefs. Eric caught a quick glimpse of <br>\r\nthick, dark pubic hair surrounding a <br>\r\nmagnificently thick, powerful shaft, before he <br>\r\nwas dropped suddenly into the midst of them. <br>\r\nA pungent scent of Scott's odor surrounded <br>\r\nEric, moist and strange as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's briefs snapped closed over Eric. The <br>\r\nfabric pulled tightly, pressing him against <br>\r\nScott's thick penis and wiry pubic fur. Some <br>\r\nfumbled motions from outside, a quick zip, <br>\r\nand he was secured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott paused before moving. Muffled by the <br>\r\nfabric, Eric could hear his words: \"Not even a <br>\r\nfucking break...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott walked toward the door, kicking the <br>\r\ndebris of the shattered ray device as he <br>\r\npassed it. Even in his snug concealment, Eric <br>\r\nheard the clatter of the debris rattling against <br>\r\nthe floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step, the motions of Scott's <br>\r\npowerful thighs ground Eric against the huge, <br>\r\nthick shaft. He felt it swell and stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's mind reeled: Oh God! I'm causing him to <br>\r\nget an erection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to scramble away from the shaft, but it <br>\r\nwas difficult to make any progress, as <br>\r\ncramped and tight as the space was. Indeed, <br>\r\nEric's struggles only seemed to worsen <br>\r\nmatters. The more he moved, and the more <br>\r\nScott moved, the more the motions seemed to <br>\r\nbe stimulating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel in there, Prof? You feel as <br>\r\nsmall as you look? I bet my fuckin' cock is <br>\r\nbigger'n you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he couldn't see it in the darkness, <br>\r\nEric could feel Scott's gigantic penis swelling <br>\r\nand growing. He judged that Scott was <br>\r\nprobably right in his assumption -- the penis <br>\r\nwas bigger than Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jesus, Prof! What're you doin' in there?\" Scott <br>\r\ntaunted, poking Eric through the tight fabric. <br>\r\n\"You're wakin' the monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out! Dammit! We can discuss this like <br>\r\nmen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott laughed, and Eric could feel the sudden <br>\r\nmovement of Scott's diaphragm through his <br>\r\nabdominal muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like men? Like man and mouse, maybe!\"<br>\r\nHis hand rubbed at Eric again through his <br>\r\npants. \"Keep working it, little mouse-man! It <br>\r\nfeels good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Eric realized something else; the <br>\r\nfear, the forced physical contact -- Eric was <br>\r\nsporting his own erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt a slight, sudden chill through the <br>\r\nfabric of Scotts pants, telling him that they <br>\r\nwere outside. Scott's pace slowed somewhat <br>\r\nas his erection grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of Scott's engorged penis made <br>\r\nmovement extremely difficult inside Eric's <br>\r\nprison. The musky smell permeated <br>\r\neverything in his confinement. Despite <br>\r\nhimself, Eric absently rubbed his own erection <br>\r\nagainst the tight fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly heard Scott's footsteps fall on a <br>\r\nhard surface, they seemed to be going up a <br>\r\nset of stairs. The jarring of his feet on each <br>\r\nstep knocked Eric against his hard shaft even <br>\r\nmore rhythmically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's pace picked up again as he reached <br>\r\nthe top of the stairs. A door opened, then <br>\r\nclosed, and Eric felt Scott's body change <br>\r\nposition dramatically. Scott threw himself to a <br>\r\nreclining position, his body cushioned by <br>\r\nsomething.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could feel Scott's massive hands <br>\r\nfumbling outside his pants again. With a zip, <br>\r\nlight flooded in once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's eyes squinted in the light, adjusting to <br>\r\nsee one of Scott's huge hand reaching in. <br>\r\nThick fingers pinched around Eric's chest, and <br>\r\nthey pulled his head and upper body through <br>\r\nhis fly. But Scott released his grip and left his <br>\r\ncaptive nestled in his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Eric gathered that he was <br>\r\nnow in a bedroom, perhaps a dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, Professor,\" Scott's voice <br>\r\nboomed over Eric. \"Home sweet home. <br>\r\nOmega Chi. You'll stay with me until I figure <br>\r\nout what to do with you. Until then -- you might <br>\r\nas well keep doin' what you were doin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's eyes narrowed again, and he looked <br>\r\ndown at Eric expectingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt another rumble from Scott's cock <br>\r\nbelow him.</span></div></div>",

After spending the past couple of weeks inside his new home, tiny Eric knew every inch of the large glass prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside the glass tank, he could look out at the large screen of a television, a plush sofa and some recliners and an air hockey table. Sometimes, he got to watch a couple of diverting hours of television, but the mindless MTV fare and sports programming preferred by his captors did little to relieve the monotony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, upon entering the room, a giant would pay homage to him by tapping on the glass and making snide remarks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only left the cage if one of the giant frat jocks wanted to have \"a little fun\" with the house \"pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continually ignored his requests for some clothing to cover himself. He no longer felt as conscious about spending his life naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, when you live in a fish tank and service the needs of more than a dozen horny titans, clothing recedes among your list of priorities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to think of a way to outwit his hulking captors. He might no longer have his size, but he tried to take solace in the certainty he surpassed their collective brain power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the good it did him. Eric's every bid for escape ended in failure, and those were the schemes he managed to even attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Eric sat in a huge hamster wheel the jocks had provided as a big joke, telling him he needed his exercise in order to stay fit for his nearly daily encounters with his huge, powerful captors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the tank-sized water bottle attached to the inside wall of the cage. He felt thirsty, but he didn't have the energy to walk over to his water source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus, the tallest of the frat giants at 6'5\", found him still in the hamster wheel when he entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gym freak, he worked constantly to maintain his huge muscles. Little Eric gazed up at him and saw the familiar, malevolent leering grin as Marcus looked down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about you all day, you little runt,\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched in horror as Marcus lowered a huge, beefy fist into the cage. He wanted to flee, but he knew the futility of the effort. The giant knocked over the exercise wheel in his haste to remove his tiny pet from the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric kicked and squirmed to try to get comfortable in the giant's grasp. Marcus ignored his puny struggles, leaving the rec room to return to the privacy of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant put Eric on a desktop. \"I'll be with you in a moment, runt,\" Marcus said. \"Gotta take care of some business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't question the temporary reprieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man looked around the desktop, surprised to see an active computer screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's logged on!\" Eric exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis braining leaping into overdrive, Eric began to think of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant jock's messenger program of choice remained active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God! I can log on to my screen name,\" Eric said. As his shaky hands began to work the crate-sized keys on the keyboard, he prayed someone among his online contacts would be logged on at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to activate his account. He scrolled the list on the theater-sized screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost no one online, he realized with a sinking feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil he saw wild4u99.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chad!\" Eric exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some cosmic lucky break, he had never gotten around to deleting the account of his ex-boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric noticed something else. \"He has audio capability!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric worked feverishly to open a dialog box. He punched in four letters: H,E,L and P. He trotted to the edge of the keyboard and pushed down as hard as he could on the enter key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw his message form on the screen. He moved closer to the computer's internal microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of sending back a text message, Chad chose to utilize his audio capability. \"Eric! Are you out there, big guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric refused to dwell on the absurdity of being called \"big guy\" at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chad! Thank God. Please, you have got to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, what's wrong? I can barely hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric heard a door open and close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

They keep me in a cage and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little shit!\" Marcus growled as he slammed his hand down onto the keyboard and ended the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked up at the very displeased face of Marcus. </span></div></div>",

He walked into a carpet of wiry pubic hair and made his way to the base of the towering cock, which looked nearly nine feet tall to the shrunken man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out and embraced the shaft with a hug. He squeezed as hard as he could with his arms wrapped around its girth. He could barely reach around the huge cock. His squeeze caused a large vein running the length of the shaft to bulge slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the grunts of reaction from giant Marcus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus tended to get impatient with his little pet, and this occasion wasn't an exception. As he got close, he reached down and squashed Eric's tiny body in his fist while at the same time grasping his huge cock. He began to slide Eric's body back and forth along the shaft. Eric's face brushed over the side of the cock. He felt Marcus's fingers tighten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus groaned mightily, a prelude to the coming eruption. Eric tensed in the crushing grasp, but he had no way of avoiding the gushing from the huge cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus shot a huge load, squeezing even harder during the process. The hot cum splashed down on his fingers and drenched his tiny toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as his massive body relaxed, Marcus didn't lessen his grasp on the shrunken professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt the huge jock rise to his feet and stagger across the room. Without any ceremony whatsoever, Marcus dumped Eric back inside the tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, recovering from the intense squeeze in the giant's fist, rested on hands and knees on the floor of the cage, his body covered with cum from Marcus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks again, little man,\" Marcus said. \"Catch you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus laughed after taking one last glance at the cum-soaked toy-sized man and left Eric in the huge tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe summoned some strength and walked to the large water bottle attached to the side of his glass prison.

He noted Eric's shabby state and the lack of any amenities within the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe they've kept you like this,\" Chad said with an unmistakable trace of irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's heart beat faster. \"I don't care. I'm so glad to see you. Please, get me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad lowered his large hand into the cage. Eric approached eagerly, but Chad withdrew his hand slightly. \"I don't want to hurt you,\" he said. \"You're so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" Eric reassured him, standing and waiting for the return of Chad's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, he welcomed the feeling of massive fingers wrapping around his six-inch-long body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad lifted him out of the cage. \"Don't worry. You'll be safe soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric relaxed in Chad's gentle grasp, knowing his huge protector would solve everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an intense light startled the tiny man. Blinded, Eric struggled to see.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He winked down at him and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, I wouldn't do this in front of some other guy,\" Tim lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Eric said, not certain how to finish... and then he saw Tim push down on the front of the briefs. He gasped in shock when the giant freed an enormous erection from the confining cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, seeing that it turns you on,\" Tim said, shooting his hand into the drawer to grasp the little man. Too shocked to react, Eric feels the crushing grip as the fist wraps around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim walked over to the bed and took a seat on the edge of the mattress. He then moved his fist closer to his erection, which is now pointing toward the ceiling. Slowly, releasing the tiny man right at the base of the shaft, he let go of Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stumbled forward clumsily, bumping against the shaft and realizing that it is considerably bigger than him. Tim seemed to look expectantly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the hold-up, little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't expect me to...\" Eric's protest dwindled away as he saw Tim nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo give him some encouragement, Tim moved his curved hand behind the little guy and pushed him forward. Eric threw open his arms and managed to give the huge, warm organ a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim moaned appreciatively. \"That's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prevent any pause in the sensational feelings, Tim grabs both the little man and his hard cock in his hand for a few vigorous strokes. The little man sputtered in outrage, but his anger soon diminishes as his own hard-on grinds against the massive trunk-sized shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything's a blur as Eric gets caught up in the action as Tim uses him as a jerk-off toy, At the moment of truth, Tim crushes him painfully as a white geyser erupts from the huge cock. Much of the explosion ends up coating the little man's face and upper body. Fully spent, Tim falls back onto the bed, his fist slowly releasing Eric, who still hasn't quite been able to pull off his own climax... although he is now desperately horny. </span></div></div>",

The dog stood almost 30 feet tall. He recognized them. The guard's name was Andy. The dog's name was Prowler. Eric had spoken to Andy on occasion when the young man and his dog made their nightly patrol through the science building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor?\" Andy called out. \"Anyone in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy reached down and unleashed Prowler.

It's nose was leading it toward the shrinking ray platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I heard something going on in here,\" Andy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked around desperately as the large dog came closer. That's when he spied the jagged crevice in the baseboard of a nearby wall. He could take shelter there. He dashed toward the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't make much noise, but the dog's ears were quite sensitive. The dog growled and raced toward him. Only by a fraction did Eric make it inside the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get as far inside the wall as he could. The entrance, however, was actually the widest part of the hollow crevice within the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he heard Andy's voice. \"What's that you've got pinned in there, Prowler? Got a mouse? Did you chase a mouse into its hole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Andy pushed his huge nightstick into the hole. \"Let's see if we can't flush it out, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric screamed in pain as the stick rammed him in the stomach. He fell back, deeper into the crevice, out of reach of Andy's nightstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you are out of luck, boy,\" Andy said. \"You let that one get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his hiding place, Eric, nursing his painful bruise, listened as Andy and the scary dog left the laboratory.</span></div></div>",

His face was shaved except for patchy sideburns and the start of a soul patch, youthful experiments that bemused Eric. In a normal situation, the lanky and bespectacled Tom stood a couple of inches taller than Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had decided to pay an impromptu visit after the professor of his evening class had dismissed early. He had seen Eric's car in the parking lot, so he knew that his workaholic boyfriend and former professor was still in his lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, finding the room empty surprised him. Thinking Eric had stepped out to the restroom or vending machine, he walked toward his desk to have a seat and wait. His path took him near the silvery platform beneath the rather steampunkian-looking ray-gun descending on a tangle of wires and cables from the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping his eye on Tom's denim-draped legs, Eric ran toward the edge of the platform. \"Tom! Down here!\" He added energetic waves to his pitiful, squeaky shouts in hope of attracting Tom's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom pulled out Eric's swivel desk chair and had a seat behind his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! He didn't hear me,\" the tiny man said aloud. With Tom on the other side of the desk, the tiny man's view of his huge boyfriend was effectively blocked. He stood, puzzling over his next course of action, when he felt a vibration in the pocket of his white lab jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god! My phone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe retrieved the phone, exulted to see Tom's number flashing. \"Tom, thank god!\" He answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom heard a voice that blinked with bursts of static. \"Eric? Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhone in hand, Eric continued running toward the building-sized desk. \"Down here,\" he shouted into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis communication was lost as the connection wavered between the phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric heard Tom's voice overhead, loud and rumbling, and the more synthetic version in his ear from his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, you've got to help me!\" The scientist blurted out. \"I've shrunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he heard \"help me\" the rest of the words cut out. Alarmed, Tom pushed the chair back from the desk and stood. He moved around the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, this connection is shit,\" he said, walking around the desk. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric screamed as his boyfriend's massive sneakers slapped the floor as he left his seat and moved around the desk. In fright, he ducked beneath the desk just ahead of a shocking footfall of one of Tom's sneakers mere inches away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric?\" Tom's voice came through the line without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! Be careful!\" A shaken Eric screamed into his phone. \"You nearly stepped on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of shrill squeaks were almost muffled by the static on the line. \"I'll call you back,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's heart sank as the line went dead. He saw a dropped gum wrapper and, with a sudden inspiration, emerged from beneath the desk. Waving the wrapper like a banner, he raced across the floor, bravely hazarding Tom's huge footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look down here!\" Eric cried again. \"Tom, I'm down here!

Needless to say, Eric was relieved when the fist unfurled a few moments later. Gasping fresh air, he saw the small cardboard specimen boxes stacked on the table in the lab. Each individual cardboard box had tiny perforations \u2014 holes to allow specimens within the box to breathe fresh air \u2014 and a small handle at the top for easy carrying.

The holes in the cardboard walls, besides allowing air, also provided him a means of peeking at the outside world, although everything rushed past in such a blur that he soon began to feel quite queasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was uneventful except for Tom's choice of loud music. The volume was turned so high that Eric's protests went quite unheard after Tom began driving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears were still ringing fifteen minutes later when Tom pulled to the curb in front of Eric's house. He started to lift the box when he remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, I don't have a key to your place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt almost the same instant, Eric felt his tiny shrunken keys in his pants pocket. He felt like slapping his own forehead. He had been considering giving his boyfriend a key, but he'd never gotten around to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a spare key hidden somewhere?\" Tom asked. \"Under the welcome mat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" a dispirited little Eric answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, cheer up,\" Tom said. \"We'll just go to my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really would rather stay here....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tom had already started the car, and the loud music assaulted his ears again. Eric didn't like Tom's little apartment. It was   not in the best shape, Tom never bothered with much in the way of cleaning, and most of his friends felt free to come and go without even asking Tom's permission. He told himself that it was only for the night. Tomorrow, they could concentrate on getting the shrink ray up and running again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, his usual complaint \u2014 the smallness of the untidy apartment \u2014 probably no longer truly applied to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll stop and grab some food in a drive-through,\" Tom spoke over the volume of the music. He tapped the roof of the small box. \"You need anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to yell louder. \"Could you turn down the damn music?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom cut the volume. \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked chagrined. \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just have a few scraps of whatever I get,\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he didn't like the indication that he was relegated to table scraps, Eric realized that even a drive-through kid's meal would be much more food than he could handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSulking in a corner in the cardboard box, he just groused at his big boyfriend. \"Let's just get to your place, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It happened shortly after they arrived at Tom's apartment, but even looking back Eric was not sure whether he slipped or was pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, he thought, he should back up the story. They arrived and, like he anticipated, Tom's apartment was in its usual state of cluttered chaos. Tom put the cardboard specimen box on the kitchen counter and, with two immense hands, pulled apart the \"roof\" of the box, letting the bright artificial light pour into the gloomy cardboard chamber. Eric was just glad to be out of the box, but his relief didn't last too longer after he was placed on a greasy countertop at the edge of Tom's kitchen sink with a view of dirty dishes stacked haphazardly in the deep basin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom moved toward the kitchen table with the bag of food he had purchased on the drive home. Eric's thoughts were focused on his invention, trying to analyze the unexpected break-down in the shrink ray. As a result, Eric didn't even hear Tom's return, although he definitely felt his enormous fingertip on a shoulder, accompanied by the words, \"Hungry, Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing startled and standing on a greasy counter combined in a much efficient manner to cause what happened next. Eric felt himself falling, even as he twisted in midair in a delayed attempt to keep his balance. He landed in a deep saucepan still holding the days-old leftover marinara sauce for Tom's quick pasta meal. The two-inch-deep swamp of red sauce provided a soft impact, but the tiny man stood and shouted in fury at finding himself completely soaked with the acidic pulverized tomatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's face, decently concerned, loomed over the saucepan as the tiny man struggled to stand in the chest-deep pool of sauce. Eric's suspicions were not dampened when Tom voiced the innocent question, \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Eric parroted back in a furious tone, made worse when Tom smiled in evident amusement. \"Get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom did, lifting a very sorry looking little man from the pan, dropping him in an open palm for the short trip to the kitchen table. Tom straddled a kitchen chair and looked down at his bedraggled boyfriend. \"You should get out of those filthy clothes, Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn't disagree, but even as he peeled off the sauce-soaked clothing, he realized how the process made him feel much more vulnerable in front of his fully-clothed, younger boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom laughed when Eric stopped after removing his shoes, pants, shirt, and lab coat. \"What's the matter? There's nothing I haven't already seen.\" Tom's voice was somewhat bemused, which grated Eric even as he pulled off his boxers and tossed them on the heap of clothes on the tabletop near his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's get you cleaned up,\" Eric said. He walked the short distance from table back to the sink. He reached into the overhead cabinets and removed a large white bowl. Eric heard water running from the faucets. A moment later, Tom returned with a large bowl of warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bath time,\" he announced, putting the bowl onto the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realized with dismay that the bowl was too steep for him to easily enter. A boost from Tom was required, which resulted in contact with a naked Eric and Tom's fingers, each larger than his boyfriend's entire shrunken form. As he eased into the warm water, however, his unease melted away with an unexpected sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels good?\" Tom inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit the warm water felt wonderful. He felt somewhat disloyal to think that he had suspected Tom might have deliberately pushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Tom spoke again. \"That's how I like you best,\" he joked as he stared down at his naked, tiny boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how?\" Eric squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's index finger stirred the water. \"Naked, silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Eric said, watching Tom's huge finger stir eddies in the surface of the water in the pool-sized bowl. He felt his tiny dick go hard in an instant.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom lifted a dripping finger from the bowl of water. His grin took on the elements of a full-fledged smirk as he stood from his seat in the chair. \"Almost forgot,\" he said before he walked to the counter and retrieved his fast-food meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned quickly, settling into the chair again before he removed the contents of the large paper bag. Immersed up to his neck in the bowl of warm water, Eric watched in awe as a grilled chicken sandwich began disappearing into his boyfriend's mouth and down his throat. Between bites of the sandwich, fries as long as Eric's body also went into Tom's huge mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he watched the meal vanish, the more Eric squirmed in the water. The distracted little man had to expend considerable effort to keep his hands away from his hard dick, its current state fueled by Eric's sudden complete realization of the new differences in his respective status and Tom's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Tom interrupted the scene by suddenly plunging a single fry near Eric's head. \"You want something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric inhaled the aroma of hot grease, salt and crispy, seasoned potato. \"Go ahead. Take a bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to open his mouth wide, taking a bite that looked like a mouse's nibble from the enormous stick of fried potato, all under the rapt attention of his huge boyfriend. He chewed slowly and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Eric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom pushed back the discarded wrappers from his hastily devoured meal. \"You ready to come out of the water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom lifted a hand over the bowl, but he left it hover. Eric was forced to raise his arms, like some child seeking a lift from a parent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's large fingers squeezed him during the removal from the water and placed him, dripping, on the kitchen table. Without missing a beat, Tom reached to a wicker container and removed a paper napkin, dropping it next to his shrunken boyfriend. Eric took up the blanket-sized napkin and began using it to remove water from his naked body. With his boyfriend's eyes fastened on his every move, he felt his dick twitching. He wanted to use the napkin as makeshift clothing, but the paper began to fall apart as it soaked up the water from his bath in a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why I never thought to ask exactly what you were researching,\" Tom stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his face redden. He had been evasive whenever Tom had inquired of the nature of his experiments. \"I just wanted to be sure it worked,\" Eric offered as explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Tom reached out and brushed a fingertip against his boyfriend's hard, little dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Eric squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his face redden again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's fingers returned, this time taking Eric's tiny dick between large, blunt fingertips. Tom rubbed the fingertips together, squeezing his boyfriend's tiny dick. He heard Eric's strangled gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that?\" Tom asked, increasing his attentions on the tiny dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's arms flailed as he pounded his tiny hands on Tom's fingers. \"Oh...stop...please...ohhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother squeeze and Tom observed the impressive (relatively speaking) expulsion of pent-up cum from Eric's tiny dick. As he kept working it, Tom saw Eric slump over his fingers, begging for him to stop. Tom released the dick, which gave another spasm as it released a final pearl of cum. His own fingers and Eric's tiny abs glistened with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to need another bath,\" Tom joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was too weak to even stand and slumped into a crouching stance. \"That was incredible,\" he whispered, realizing it might have, for him, been the best sex of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His very well-endowed boyfriend, as he well knew. Tom  was a good eight inches hard, not that Eric obsessed on such details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what do you want me to do?\" Eric asked with trepidation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure out something,\" Tom predicted confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, arms and legs hugging tightly at the sides, shrunken Eric sprawled over the top of Tom's fully erect cock, which jutted out from his boyfriend's crotch a good sixty feet above the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom,\" Eric pleaded, \"I don't like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom lowered a hand and plucked his boyfriend off his cock. \"I forgot how you hate heights,\" he said by way of apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should wait until....whoa...\" Eric screamed as Tom sprawled in his living room recliner and dropped Eric between his thighs. The huge cock now towered over the shrunken scientist, resembling a 15-foot-tall obelisk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hug it,\" Tom ordered. \"See if I can feel you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether from fear of disobeying or from a renewed sense of adventure, Eric hugged the huge cock. He felt the organ's warmth and felt a spasm of sensation that thrummed through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited, Tom lowered a fist, encircled his cock and began to pump it with vigor. In no time, he blew a load, much of which rained down as warm, heavy blots to smash against the naked, shrunken scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom roared with laughter. \"Now you're really going to need another bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, dazed and sticky, realized he had gone from a boyfriend of a peer and equal to little more than a passive sex toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped it was only a passing moment of unleashed excitement.</span></div></div>",

I've always wanted a pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pet!\" said Eric angrily, but Scott couldn't here him over the sound of him unzipping his bag. \"When I came here to talk about my grade, I figured you'd say no, so I planned to work out to calm down. You get to take a ride in my gym bag, and we'll see if that doesn't change your mind.\" The smell from the bag wafted out, and Eric tried to hold his nose as Scott dangled him over the bag. The giant used one hand to open up the entrance to his gym sock, and dropped the indignant professor inside. Eric took in a breath and was assaulted by the smell of the sock around him, as well as the various other gym clothes in the bag. He looked up to see Scott tie the entrance into a knot, sealing Eric up. Eric was trapped in the sweaty bag, feeling sick from the smell and the motion as Scott left the building, heading to...</span></div></div>",

James, a 26-year-old guy, worked as a evening security officer in the university's science building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked along the corridor where some of the private laboratories used by university professors were located. A few moments earlier he had heard some strange noises coming from one of the labs. The best James could tell, the noise had sounded like a loud crackling noise like some sort of electric equipment shorting out. He had even heard a strange popping noise, sort of like a punctuation, and then nothing but silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrateful for a change in his nightly routine, James decided to investigate. He paused at the door to the laboratory and scanned a sign that read \"Macro-Physics.\" The description didn't mean much to James, who pushed open the door and moved his 190-pound, 6'2\" tall body into the laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" James called out. His voice echoed through the large laboratory. \"Anyone working in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReceiving no answer, James looked around at the strange equipment located within the laboratory. He saw a desk, the standard cabinets and shelves, but he focused his attention on the unusual device in the center of the lab. James thought it sort of looked like some sort of transporter out of \"Star Trek.\" A round metal platform even rose from the floor directly beneath the dome-like structure connected by various cables and wires to a central control panel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, standing in the center of the raised platform beneath his shrinking ray, stood paralyzed as the giant entered the laboratory. The man wore a campus security uniform. A badge on the man's jacket identified him only as \"J. Patterson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt truly small in the presence of the good-looking guy who loomed above him like some 150-foot-tall giant. Eric felt torn between taking flight or standing his ground and asking the approaching giant to help him cope with his unfortunate situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very instant, the giant locked his gaze on the tiny figure standing below on the platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric heard the man's excited, loud voice as the guard exclaimed, \"What the hell?\"</span></div></div>",

He hopped onto the hand, assuming that Eric was taking him with him to the closet to get the necessary supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, James took Eric over to the desk.

It was unbelievable how utterly massive he looked, and the man's bulge alone outsized him. The professor felt suddenly very aware of how very small and how very helpless he was; even if the man weren't muscular and built like a tank, he could still do literally anything to him. Some darker, more primitive part of Eric's mind told him that he should be terrified or begging for anything right now. But he knew better, damn it! He was a professor with a doctorate, and the size didn't change the fact that he clearly outranked this guard in pay grade and intelligence. He stamped his little foot on the counter, folded his arms, and looked way, way up at the guard's face. \"What are you talking about? Take me to the machine so we can fix this right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad James not been in an annoyed and frustrated mood, he likely would have found the professor's outburst to be more than a little humorous. The little man was smaller than most children's toys, and he was still acting all high and mighty like the world was beneath him. His voice was quiet and almost squeaky, and the guard was finding it very hard to treat the man with any respect at all, especially since he continued to insist on talking down to him - in an entirely metaphorical sense, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"No, I don't think so. You've been nothing but condescending to me, and I don't appreciate that from a normal person. The way you are now, you ought to be grateful I even noticed you! So if you want me to even think about helping you, you're gonna have to help me first.\" He moved his hips forward, actually bumping Eric back a step with the bulge of his groin. No room for misinterpretation there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man nearly fell back onto his ass as the guard's crotch slammed against him with the force of a football player.

A few weeks later, the younger man moved into Eric's apartment. That had been four months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was impressed by Eric's intelligence and his status as a college professor. He understood that Eric also conducted scientific research, but he had never delved very deeply into the focus of Eric's experiments. Science, math and such subjects somewhat intimidated him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Tom looked unbelievably huge. He stepped into the lab, walking directly toward Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Eric knew that he needed help to regain his size, Eric cowered in the presence of Tom's mountainous presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom strode into the lab. \"Eric?\" Tom shouted. \"I got away after all! So, where's this experiment? Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sprinted across the floor and approached Tom's  huge sneakers. They looked more than 65 feet long and 20 feet wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Eric realized that Tom could be his destruction instead of salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom! Help!\" Eric shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom stood still for a moment. Eric ran closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tom began moving again. One of his huge sneakers lifted. Its shadow fell over Eric.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Good deed done, Tom returned his attention to his own world and matters. A soft-heart for any living thing, he was still human and the significance of the tiny insect had been such that he'd already forgotten about it as he headed across the grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved greeting at a sweaty man wearing coveralls and was crouched down, weeding. The man nodded back at him, grinning. He had a nice face, rough (and dirt-covered) but friendly. Tom felt a rush of desire inside him -- he was undoubtedly stuck on Eric, but something about \"working\" men made him sort of melt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better call Eric and see what he's up, too\" he said softly, entering the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNary another thought went to the relocated insect he left behind, returned to the safe world of the outdoors, nor did he even consider the friendly gardener's presence might pose a threat to that world and its safety. He didn't bother with such trifles. Instead, Tom returned to the lab to look around some more before he called Eric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom! Tom! Honey, don't do this!\" Eric shrieked, as he fell to a terrifying world far below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit thankfully soft soil, moistened by regular automated sprinklers, and resumed screaming. \"No! Please, Tom, you big sap! I'm not some bug, I'm me -- Eric! Don't leave me-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's last plea cut off abruptly as his \"kind-hearted\" boyfriend's massive sneaker lifted over and above. Dirt and grit picked up in the rugged treads from stomping around the campus fell free from the vast tread pattern. Eric had a single moment to react as this enormity capable of great destruction descended and crash landed dangerously close. He screamed, feeling his entire body jolt from the concussive impact. It was like a bomb going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Eric could barely see anything but the vast wall of stained, discolored rubber making up the sole of his oblivious boyfriend's gigantic sneaker. He could barely believe that Tom would think himself so gentle and merciful to release an insect outside, but not think for a moment about the creature's fate once it fell from his lofty grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant boom was felt and heard. The other sneaker landing far in the unseeable world. Suddenly, Eric lurched defensively as the mass of rubber looming before him groaned, pressed into the moist earth with unfathomable weight and power, and lifted abruptly off the ground. He couldn't let this happen. \"Honey, please! For chrissakes, don't leave me here!\" Eric cried. The enormous tread became visible as the sneaker soared away, clumps of dirt and pebbles falling free to the jungle of weeds below. Eric paused his screaming, standing agape as he truly appreciated the sheer enormity of the footwear. He wondered how many \"saved\" insects Tom had inadvertently flattened before or without ever even noticing them. It sent a shiver down Eric's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom seemed less boyfriend now and more like some kind of vast entity from another world. He was fucking huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with tremendous steps to match that huge size, Tom became a towering figure on the horizon before quickly vanishing from view altogether. Eric merely sat in dejection, tiny and forsaken. An outcast among even insects. Afraid and defenseless in a seemingly prehistoric jungle of massive weeds and plants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...what do I do now? I have no idea where I even am!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo idea and no plan. Eric hugged himself, looking around anxiously. What would become of him in this terrifying environment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric had allowed himself to wander. No direction, even less so since he was a naturally bad navigator, and much less in the state he was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom...oh, Tom!\" he whined, still hugging himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted his boyfriend. Normal and not huge. As hot and unbelievable as Tom was at this size, Eric wanted nothing more than a normal-sized Tom to comfort him and keep him safe. Shrinking wasn't at all what he expected. It made him feel alone...traumatized. Tom had been scarier than anything Eric had ever experienced. He had felt like a pet fish headed for the toilet. That wasn't right. Tom was a kind-hearted, normally gentle and thoughtful guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this size, all he seemed like was a careless, dismissive monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shuddered remembering the many times Tom had taken ugly bugs and spiders from their home. Often on his behest. He simply had no idea what they went through at Tom's massive hands and feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have been worse, Eric thought as he wandered. He could have encountered someone else and that thought frightened him more. Eric stumbled forward, clutching himself tighter and completely lost in distressed thought. Not for a moment did it occur to him that he might be jinxing himself. He heard a commotion that made him look to the skies. Spiny leaves and massive dandelion heads blocked most of his view, but he saw flitting shapes against the clear sky beyond. Flitting shapes that he quickly identified as flying insects. Small and large, some he knew immediately while others he didn't. They seemed to be vacating the area in a hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the land insects -- or monsters, as Eric saw them. Some ants quickly rushed passed. Eric shrieking loudly at each one as they utterly ignored his presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Oh my God! Tom! Help me! Tooom!\" he screamed to nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Eric could think about was the horrible realization that this already frightening jungle was populated by so many terrible creatures. That he had not even considered their presence, much less noticed it until now. Then he froze. His mind immediately forgetting the sporadic onslaught of rushing bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he gaped upwards as the sky was obscured, light dimmed, and something huge lowered from the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPillars was what he thought at first. Great, huge, massive columns that should be towering alongside cliffs or mountains. They pushed through the massive plants looming above, displacing the great stems and leaves with the ease of mother nature. Eric stumbled back as they nearly scrapped against the ground but instead wrapped their immense towers around one gigantic plant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he knew. As the plant that outsized one of the campus buildings was crushed and pulled, Eric suddenly knew what he was seeing. Fingers. Just like earlier with Tom, but these were thicker, rougher, hairy, and lined with dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath his tiny feet the ground seemed to roar with deep, muffled anger. Cracks appeared in the soft dirt, quickly widening and rifting before pulling apart. Eric inexplicably realized it was the sound of massive roots snapping and breaking as they were uprooted. The calamity was seemingly violent enough to resembled a building being leveled. And by all means, it appeared as such to the minuscule scientist who could only stare wide-eyed as the building-sized monster of a weed was rended from the earth and lifted into the skies. Debris fell in the wake. Clods of dirt like boulders crashed down, huge log-sized twigs and rocks. Larger than a redwood came down a huge dandelion stalk and flower in the wake. It nearly demolished Eric who retreated from the gaping devastation left behind by the weed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, he saw something that made his heart beat faster. A looming shape, revealed by the removal of the massive foliage and back-lit like something mythical by the sky beyond. It was a god, he thought. He was a rational person by any means, but Eric couldn't help but jump to conclusions. This had to be a god come to destroy the world and tiny Eric with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered Tom and all that happened. Gaping upwards at the gargantuan figure, he realized one more thing. Gods didn't normally wear baseball caps and sunglasses. This was a man. Somebody Eric did not immediately recognize as he beheld the massive visage that seemed to hover high above his tiny world like an orbiting planet. The giant face was slightly turned, looking off to where he presumably was depositing that once mighty plant. With those massive sunglasses, Eric could only appreciate the behemoth's wide Roman nose framed by a broad, oblong jaw coated in dark stubble. This meeting wasn't like Tom at all. Eric was filled with a cocktail surge of emotion, most of which was awe. Large beads of sweat, mixed with dirt and oily, dotted the giant's face. They fell at random, some vanishing from view while some fell close enough that their impact was noticeable and their size comparable to Eric's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slow motion, the face rotated and seemed to direct itself at the tiny man's general vicinity. Blue-ish hue and highly reflective, Eric couldn't discern anything in that massive polarized glare. A grace period seemed to set in for a moment: Eric staring upwards as if in religious adoration and the humongous man hunkered and looming, colossal and enigmatic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the shrunken scientist's eyes fell upon the lofty dome of the main's head. A logo was spread across the dirt, grimy surface of the cap and Eric immediately recognized it as belonging to a landscaping company. With sickening clarity, the pieces clicked together: this man was one of the gardener's contracted by the campus to care for the grounds. He was weeding. That tree-plant was just one of many weeds this gargantuan guy had torn from the ground. Light darkened again as that massive hand soared overhead. Eric screamed while air roared as the hand lowered in the distance, followed immediately by a similar sound of snapping, rumbling destruction. Panicked insects fled that horizon, buzzing over and away as chunks of dirt and debris fell and the mammoth appendage lifted into view with yet another huge weed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gigantic gaze followed, shifting slightly and informing Eric that this monstrosity of a gardener failed to even notice him. Eric probably looked like an ant, if not a chunk of dirt. Was it even possible to attract this titan's attention? Unlike Tom, it seemed unlikely despite the crouched proximity, this man likely glossed over any and all tiny, moving specks on the ground. Earbuds were evident in the man's massive ears, effectively obscuring the already impossibly chance that he would detect Eric's feeble shouts. Plus, would he even want to attract this behemoth's attention? Very unlike Tom, this man looked rough, swarthy, and listless. He seemed like a nice enough guy normally, but with his strong, grimly-set jaw and emotionless visage, he didn't exactly look like the type of guy to care about the welfare of any tiny bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thundering woosh, the man's massive hand swept through the air before his large face to remove the pesky presence of a few teeny, buzzing, and displaced insects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, he seemed like the type of guy Eric did NOT want to meet as a bug -- noticed or unnoticed. This dude was just doing his job, not keeping an eye out for stupid bugs that got in his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had not only almost killed him after \"saving\" Eric, but he dropped him into a world that was effectively about to be destroyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get out of here before I get crushed or buried!\" Eric said, running towards the nearest cover.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His entire massive body moved with startling swiftness for something so immense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric screamed as the giant huge work boots, each more than 130 feet long and at least 50 feet wide, stomped onto the floor near him. A gush of air whipped his body about in a maelstrom that tossed him about like a speck of dust drifting in air currents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell!\" Eric exclaimed.

It was a tight fit though, and Eric became wedged in the treads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric became worried he might fall out and really get squashed if he wasnt careful.  There was some movement from above and Eric watched as the darkness he was in, changed to light.  Sam was walking out of the room with his brother.  It became a fearful ride for Eric as each time Sam took a step, he came crashing down into darkness coming mere inches from the ground where Sams foot fell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movements became too much afer awhile, and were making Eric dizzy.  He didnt know how much more of it he could take.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched the surroundings each time Sam brought his shoe up as he walked.  They were only a blur as it seemed Sam was walking extremely fast.  Eric also noticed that the gournd beneath him turned from tile floor, to pavement and cement.  Tom and Sam must have walked out of the building and were now outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was hoping that Sam would stop soon, so he could try and attempt get himself out from under the sneaker sole.  The smell of rubber was all around him, and he hoped his temporary prison would keep him safe for a little while longer at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric got into the rythym of each footstep, and became transfixed on the upcoming pavement going beneath him and the sneaker.  Up ahead a few foot steps, he noticed something green on the sidewalk.  He couldnt make it out.  Two more steps and he was close enough to realize it was a piece of gum spit out on the sidewalk.  At this rate, Sam was headed right toward it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched the next step, and then the next step and he figured it was too late.  Sam took another step, bringing his sole down on the piece of gum.  Unfortunately for Eric, it was good aim.  As the sole came down squashing the gum, it was right beneath him.  He felt himself covered in the sticky gum as it oozed around him and into the treads.  Sam brought his foot up, and some of the gum became stringy sticking to the sole and still to the sidewalk.  It quickly let loose and Sam continued his step, bringing his foot up and then down again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was really stuck now into the treads covered completely in the gum.  He couldnt believe this was happening.  Sam came to a stop, and Eric felt himself quickly thrust into the air.

Walking over to it he sat down and began to stretch his leg, bringing it over his other knee so that he was staring at the sole. The effort he was forced to use was great, and he grunted with the exertion, but at last Sam was staring at the sole of his shoe, and more importantly the piece of gum that had gotten itself stuck there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, staring at the gum, did a double take, and had to wipe his eyes and shake his head to clear away the mist that obviously was fogging up his mind. He'd though for a moment, just a moment, that something under the gum had moved. What's more it had not only moved, showing that it was alive, but he had thought it looked human. Chuckling at the image a little Sam rummaged through his pocket before pulling out a coin, and then began scrapping at the pink, sticky gum under which Eric was still trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric by this time was just begin to recollect his wits from the horrific roller coaster ride he'd just been through. A ride that seemed to have at last come to an end, and then become a jerking affair in which he was raised much higher than he had been when Sam was walking. Looking past the gum Eric found that he was staring right into Sam's face, and tried his best to move, shout, or in some way make his presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he managed to do though was wave his arm a little and emit a pathetic squeak, things which the titan dismissed as his overactive imagination. Without much hope Eric watched the titan turn away, and felt the bounces as he obviously dug in his pocket for something. The something became obvious when Eric saw a shadow pass over him, and looked up at the giant face of an Native American woman cast in gold and with a small, well small to normal people anyway, year 2000 stamp next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric once again begins screaming and yelling, but over the natural sounds of the outside world, the chirping of birds, the soft crush of grass under the hooves of a deer, and the sweet rustle of wind through the trees(Ok in all reality it was the honking horns and cars passing by that drowned him out more, but I'm trying to be a naturalist here), his voice was just another meaningless babel to the titan, who began to pull at the gum, ripping it off his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then saw an opportunity. If he was quick enough he could grab the coin just after it got the gum off him, then Sam was sure to notice him. Of course he might just slap him like a bug, crushing is tiny, vulnerable body. It might be safer to just get thrown away with the gum and try someone else. Looking back at the coin Eric makes his decision. He...</span></div></div>",

Holding his arms out he grabs for the tiny raised edge of the gold dollar, and then has to swing his feet so that his literally clinging to the coin so that the titan doesn't knock him off with the motion of the coin scraping the gum off the bottom of his shoe. Luckily the gum doesn't struggle much longer and pops free, flying into the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow normally someone would notice a half inch high bug clinging to a coin they just used to scrape gum off the bottom of their shoe, but Sam, still a little doubting of his senses from the humanoid bug that he had thought might be under the gum, ignores the tickling sensation on the end of his fingers, and roughly shoves the gold dollar back into his pocket, hoping that he's just having a really off day, and that it will get better with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric is not amused by the titan's lack of belief, as he feels his arms try to rip themselves out of their sockets as he is pushed with great force into Sam's pocket. The miniature scientist is then forced to scramble as the gargantuan Sam stands up, causing the change in his pocket to shift, and nearly sandwiching Eric between a quarter and the gold dollar with enough force to easily reduce the little man to a greasy smear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of luck, a small amount of gymnastics, and one move he saw in a James Bond movie staring Pierce B. Eric is able to escape a very messy end, only to feel his whole world rattle and roll as Sam continues on his way, to where Eric has no idea, though he hopes it's somewhere private. His luck however, is terrible in that instead of heading home, his youthful, unknowing captor, headed for a place where he could get a drink. Being under twenty one would usually have been a deterrent from such a course, but Sam knew the bar's owner, and so he got it without much hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the place was packed. Not unusual considering that this place was one of the few places in the county where they asked few questions, and gave fewer answers. Walking up to the bar Sam looked around. He had lost his brother a while back, and hoped he would be able to stay lost long enough to get a quick drink, to erase the little men from his imagination. Tapping on the bar made the bartender look towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme my usual Joe,\" he told the man, who appeared to be only slightly older than the one ordering the drink, though the youthful appearance was actually caused by the eyes and face, which would have probably put Adonis to shame. Nodding at the order Joe grabs a bottle from the counter behind him and a small glass and pours Sam his usual. Sliding the glass over Joe puts his hand on the table and Sam reaches into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, the little passenger inside Sam's pocket, was well aware of where they were, and was of the opinion that he would have to have a long talk to his boyfriend about his kid brother's behavior. This bar was not one of the best places for the young man, and though Tom and he both frequented the place, Eric felt that Sam was just a little too young for some of the things going on in the place. He was so absorbed by his thoughts that Eric didn't even notice the titan's hand until it grabbed him, and a load of loose change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithdrawing his hand from is pocket Sam basically threw the coins at Joe, who was less than amused by the childish antics of his customer. Grumbling about kids today he leaned down to pick up a stray coin, and Sam was so intent on watching him that neither notice the unusual happening on the bar. Eric had gone flying with the rest of the pocket change, and was sitting on a quarter that was perched on a dime so that it wobbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was brushing himself off and checking for injuries when another shadow feel over him. He panics as another coin sailed from out of the sky, and in a display of luck that was hard to match the coin hit at the exact edge of the quarter, a piece of the dime, and sent the coin, and the scientist back into the air, this time at the one who had thrown them. The quarter was lucky enough to slide to a stop on the bar, Eric however continued flying, and with a splash found himself in a place he did not want to be, Sam's drink, which was slowly being raised skyward, towards Sam's ever widening maw.</span></div></div>",

Eric, with nothing fueling him but panic, and already far beyond rational thought, begins to swim against the current which threatens to take him into that slick cavern, and the pit of acid within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam at that moment, spots his brother, and with a speed that most drinks would applaud, he downs the whole mug with only three chugs. He is perplexed by a small piece that seems out of place, like a tickle traveling down his throat. He dismisses the feeling a moment later as he dodges through the crowd, hoping he can get out without being seen. Obviously he can't make it, as the crowd literally parted as his brother strode through it right to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how much trouble you can get yourself, and Joe into by coming in here and getting a drink?\" demands Tom of his eighteen year old brother. Sam decides very quickly that not speaking is the best option, and so just hangs his head, hoping his brother will avoid a public scene for right now. His instincts prove correct as Tom looks around for a moment before grabbing his brother by the scruff of his neck and hauling him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later a still fuming Tom and a Sam who seems to be trying to curl up in on himself enter a local McDonald's. With a glance at his brother Tom orders two burgers and then the two set off towards the back of the practically empty fast food restaurant. Siting in the shadows Tom begins to berate his brother about how irresponsible he is, and how he should at least try and fly right, for Mom's sake if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving heard it all before Sam blocks it out. He has other problems besides being an under aged drinker. Obviously there was something bad in that beer, and he had half a mind to go back and tell joe so, but with Tom next to him he realized he couldn't It came again, a light tickling on the inside of his stomach, like an ulcer or something. Looking down at his burger he decided to drown his stomach pain with food, and so unwrapped it and took a huge bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his stomach Eric feels his strength beginning to wane. He'd been shouting like a mad man for Tom, Sam, anyone to get him out of this. With every breath he felt his lungs were burning, but luckily he had fallen into a mostly dry stomach, and was no pressed against a wall, trying to avoid the sloshing sounds which marked the acid, while at the same time pounding on Sam's stomach lining for all he was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem to be having much effect beyond making his hands burn as the acid seeped from the walls, but he kept at it. He was a scientist, a respected one. He couldn't die like this, as a bit of meat inside a teenagers stomach. Suddenly the sounds outside change, and then Eric hear's what might be some heavy machinery in the distance as it ground gravel into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a gulp the sound stopped, and just before the chewed up burger entered the stomach Eric realized that he'd been hearing Sam eating, not machinery. With a splash the masticated goo lands in the stomach, followed by still more. Eric can't stand it, and starts to redouble his attack on Sam's stomach, though he can hear the sloshing acid getting higher, and he feels the walls are beginning to move and churn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Tom is looking at Sam with a grave expression on his face. Tom knew his brother had been blocking him out, but as a good brother he felt it was his duty to at least try and instruct the boy. If only he could be a little more like Eric, or have a little piece of him inside him. That would set Sam straight(Well you know what I mean).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been listening to me at all?\" Tom demands of his little brother, who shoves the last of his burger into his mouth and swallows it whole. Looking at him with a serious face Sam stares deep into his brother's eyes and leans closer. When his face is only an inch away he let's out a terrific belch. As Tom pulls back holding his nose Sam points at him laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really bro, but listen to me, we have got to come back here more often. They obviously improved the meat,\" comments Sam as he gets up to get another burger while patting his stomach. That little tickle had gone away, but for some reason he felt empty inside without it, like it had been something important. Brushing off the feeling he decides to fill this new void in him with several burgers, thinking they probably equal about the same.</span></div></div>",

The silence was deafening as all eyes, including Eric's, turn to where the shot came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the ridged pane of glass that surrounded his world Eric can make out a man, one who he didn't know the name of, but had seen more than once around the bar. The man was staggering to his feet, and slowly he brought his hand up to his chest, and pulling it away Eric could see that his palm was red with blood. As if in slow motion the man slumped to the floor, and then fell face first into a pool of his own blood mixed with his spilled beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from the man, and holding her still smoking gun in a death grip was a woman of no more than twenty five years of age, a large difference from the man who she'd just killed, who was at the very least fifty, if not more.

Holding the gun aloft she swung it around at the patrons of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WANT A PIECE OF THIS?!\" she shouted at everyone, and most just stood dead still for a moment, before a general panic broke out. Screams erupted from everywhere, and no one was sure what to do. In his own panic Sam downed his beer in one go and then began to run for the door. Eric, having been stunned by the shooting in his favorite bar, was just bobbing in the beer like a cork when Sam drank it all in one pull, but was lucky enough to be in one of the drops that missed Sam's mouth, and instead fell into the boy's pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning outside, screaming at people to hurry up or get out of his way, Sam was one of the first to the bar's back door, and was the first to actually stumble out into the alley behind it. Not missing a beat he just kept running, with Eric jostling in his pocket, unable to even move at the moment because of the movements of his current transporter. Without any real course of action open to him Eric just began to hold onto the shirt fibers around him, and hoped Sam would stop soon.

It had all been so fast that he had little time to think about it, yet he was amazed that even when he was afraid for his own life he had enough thought left to drain a beer he had gotten illegally. Laughing at his own foolishness Sam begins to search through the house, hoping no one is home to ask what it was he had been running from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily no one is home, and Sam, with a sigh of relief, goes up the stairs to his room, and jumps into his bed. His heart is beating fast, from both the fright in the bar, and the three mile dash that got him back home. Hopefully no one saw him at the bar besides Joe, and Joe was just as likely to tell the police off after he made his statement about the shooting. No one should have any idea that Sam was there when it happened, and so he was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric on the other hand was far from it. His ride through the town had left him beaten and battered. He was pretty sure he'd sprained his wrist coming down into the pocket, and it felt like some force had tried to rip his legs out of their sockets. Still he was alive, and several miles from the location where he'd been shrunk, something that had seemed impossible at the beginning of this \u2018little' misadventure he was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his relocation had gotten him nothing as yet. He still hadn't contacted anyone, though he was now in the home of the most likely person on the planet to help him. That wasn't exactly a goof thing though, as the only person home right now had almost drunk him with a beer, which he wasn't old enough for.

He had really expected everything to be moving slower than it usually did because of his smaller size, like the giants in the stories and shows he'd read and watched. Instead everything seemed to be moving faster, though that could have just been an illusion based off the fact that even very small motions by normal sized people could have deadly consequences for our little hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts moved quickly through the mind of the tiny scientist, who, with a snap idea, decided to jump up so that the hand hit him, rather than smearing him over Sam's chest. For once the good doctor's ideas came off exactly as he had planed, and he was thrown into the air by the young man's hand, though really that was a bad place for someone who's less than an inch tall to be, as even a three foot drop could easily turn him into an amorphous blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck was on his side this time, or rather Sam's bad habits were, as Eric flew straight and true, right into the shirt he'd just fallen out of a minute ago, which now rested gently on Sam's dresser. Eric, after getting tangled for a moment in a loose thread, pulled himself out of the cloth confines of the giant piece of apparel, and gazed across the vast landscape before him. The view, such as it was, looked like something out of a scifi novel, with a giant, shirtless eighteen-year old as its centerpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince very little in this room would help him get back to normal size, Eric's attention became focused on the only other human in his view, which was becoming very depressing indeed. Across the monumental gap between the dresser and his bed, Eric could see Sam pull some headphones on, and then he was forced to cover his ears as the huge burst of what Sam apparently called music began to stream forth from the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sam completely shut off from the world thanks to his music, and a bit of paper than looked like a billboard to the little scientist, but was probably really just a comic book, Eric was forced to concede that it was very unlikely that he could get Sam to notice him. Sitting on his dresser, among what was probably a month's worth of laundry, Eric was forced to make a very difficult decision, stay with Sam and hope for the best or get down from the dresser and go to another room in the house.</span></div></div>",

Still sticky from his early experiences, he stuck easily to Sam's hand, and was pushed and shoved as Sam kept rubbinghis stomach, then abdomen, getting lower and lower. Seeing where this was going, Eric tried to shout for Sam's attention, but to no avail.<br>\r\nIt was at this point that he found out what Sam was reading. Sam brought his hand up again to turn the page, and Eric caught a glimpse and realised Sam WAS gay, although this did little for his circumstances. <br>\r\nSam brought his hand deown again and slowly undid the buttons on his Levis, revealing gray tented briefs and a very worrying turn of events. He started rubbing his tented briefs, not hearing Eric's tiny cries for help. He pushed his hand under his briefs and started stroking his enormous shaft, pushing Eric futher and further up it's length before caressing its head and touching the slit.<br>\r\nEric shouted and cried out as he was pushed further and further up the cock's length, and then screamed as he landed haphazardly on the piss-slit, one of his legs landing in it with a squelch. The length of the shaft was increasing as Sam continued and Eric could hear his moans of pleasure, oblivious to Eric being in such a dangerous position.<br>\r\n\"Sam! Hey, down-!\" Sam's hand came over the top of the shaft and squashed him further into his cock, so that Eric started to be pulled in by the dick's own strength.<br>\r\nWith a final jerk, Eric dissappeared from view, and was sliding down the shaft's length, well aware of what lay at the bottom.<br>\r\n****<br>\r\nSam was almost ready to cum, and could feel his dick jerking and swelling, when there was a knock at the door. He stopped hurriedly and pulled up his brieds.<br>\r\nThe door opened. It was Tom.<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam. I'm gonna go and look for Eric again. He should have been at the lab, and I'm a bit concerned. Get us some Pizza for when we come back ok?\"<br>\r\nSam considered for a moment.

He didn't apply any labels to himself yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really liked guys, but he had hooked up with more than a few girls.

He's not sure why, but he doesn't quite trust Sam, probably an aftereffect of him almost drinking the tiny man with a beer he shouldn't have been drinking in the first place. Looking over the edge he has no idea how he's going to get down, but begins searching around for a way. He finds it in the loose thread that had trapped him before, which was now a lifeline to the ground far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding down the dresser proved easy with his lifeline, which he had to tug at several times to cause more of it to unravel from the shirt. With a bit of acrobatics, which he was finding he was very good at, Eric made his way down, at last reaching the wooden floor. His brain played with the idea of staying with the string, as even an unobservant teenager like Sam was bound to notice it, but Eric was still of the opinion that he wanted Tommy to find him rather than Sam, and so began to make his way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning as fast as he could, Eric was surprised to find that the distance between him and the door was easily traversed, despite what certain novels and movies had led him to suspect. Apparently he was moving faster than usual, as he turned back when he reached the door and found that the space between was like a football field to him. Then he turned back and faced his next challenge. Sam's door, which was bolted on the inside to insure the boy's privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little obstacle proved less than challenging, though for reasons that left Eric feeling like he should just curl up into a ball and wait for death. With a slight moment of difficulty the miniature man was able to shimmy under the door, proving to him that he was as small as a bug. Eric had, until that moment, believed that he was easily visible, and that Sam was just dulled by TV and such, but he was able to wriggle through a gap he had barely noticed was there when he was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Eric was no quitter. This was just going to be a little more difficult than he had expected, but nothing was impossible to a man of his mental capacity. After all how many people believed that shrinking an object was a scientific impossibility. Yet here he was, living, though probably not for long, proof that his theories worked, and that you really could reduce the space an object took up. If he could ever get bigger than this new ray of his would make him rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst though he was faced with yet another choice, which was yet again one he'd really rather not have to make. This choice involved once again where he wanted to go. He was now standing on the landing of the upper floor of Tommy's house, which held only two rooms, the one he'd just escaped from, and the guest room across the way. People rarely went into the guest room, but maybe Tommy would for some reason. Eric's only other option besides the guest room was to attempt the stairs, a proposition which did not amuse him in the slightest. So what does he do?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately he seemed to have less courage than he would have liked, and looking down the stairs made him nearly run towards the other option which was the guestroom. Taking five slow deep breathes Eric beat down that voice that was telling him to remain upstairs and took his first step towards the long drop that was his only way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got no farther though as he heard a grinding sound far below, and stared over the edge of the stairs at the front door of Tommy's house. The sound was the turning of the knob, which even when he had been big was quite loud due to the fact that it hadn't been oiled in almost seven years, since Tommy's parents died in a car accident and he took over the house. That fact was something Eric had pointed out, but when he had tried to oil the knob Sam had stopped him, saying that their dad had said he'd do it when he got back from the store. So it had remained all this time, a testament to a father's last promise to his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering his ears as all this passed through his mind Eric looked down stairs to see who had entered the house of his boyfriend. At first he couldn't tell as the figure stood outlined in the light of the outside world, which threatened to blind the tiny man who's eyes had been adjusted to the near pitch blackness of the stairwell but moments before, but after a few seconds of spots before his eyes, Eric's vision finally cleared and he saw that the person at the bottom of the stairs was...</span></div></div>",

He was still Eric's assistant, and he had never been more in need of assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting that  Don looked more than 800 feet tall, Eric lowered himself over the edge of the platform and slid to the floor.

He was surrounded by an enormous circular wall, and he noticed a putrid, pungent odor surrounded him. The bug-sized Professor could hardly breath.  He glanced up on one side of the strange wall and saw a giant number 13 with a half fraction next to it, all encased in a circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it dawned on him.  Eric had fallen into one of Zac's colossal sneakers.  The soft bottom of the sneaker had cushioned his fall and saved him.  But he was trapped.  The enormous walls of the sneaker were 70 feet high, and very smooth.

These extra few seconds gave Eric the time he needed to escape the peanut trap.  He had to get to shelter.  He began to run for bottom indented space of the counter.  It would be a good place to hide and catch his breath.

He stood up and angrily walked over the entrance of the living room in only a few short steps.  To Eric, each of Zac's powerful steps felt like a massive earthquake.  The tiny Professor cowered as he looked skyward at his skyscraping younger brother.  Somehow, he had to contact his brother and try to get some help.  Without being first stomped on like a common bug.  Eric was in his own apartment, but was overwhelmed with helplessness.  \"Where did that damn bug go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where there's one, there's got to be a lot more,\"  Zac said to himself.  He walked over to the coffee-table and picked up the phone.  He looked down at the base of the phone at several numbers that had been written there for convenience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\"  Zac said as he dialed a number.  \"Yeah, this is Brevard in 212-A.  I've got a bug problem here that something needs to be done about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear began to set in as Eric listened attentively to his king-sized brother.  \"Oh God, what is he doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great,\"  Zac replied into the phone and then hung it up.  He looked around the room wondering where that little bug was hiding.  \"Live it up while you can little bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac plopped down on the couch and propped his feet on the coffee-table, satisfied with the thought of how happy his brother would be that he was taking care of the bug problem.  Zac watched about twenty minutes of a Seinfeld rerun when suddenly:</span></div></div>",

Zac was laughing hysterically at the Seinfeld episode, causing tiny Eric to cringe with each laugh.  \"No soup for you!\"  Zac repeated the line from the infamous \"Soup Nazi\" episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric pondered the thought of walking out into the open and trying to get Zac to notice him.  But when he looked up and saw Zac's mammoth socked feet rising skyward, he decided against it.  He was just too damn small.  Unless someone took a very close look at him, to a giant, he would appear as an insignificant insect.  And Eric feared that most people would just as soon step on and crush an insect instead of looking real close at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was suddenly startled and quickly stood up.  The door-bell had rung.  \"Who the hell could that be?\"  Zac sprung up from the couch and went to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched fearfully as Zac opened the door.  When the door opened,  Eric gasped as the giant man came into his view.  In the vast distance, the bug-sized man was overwhelmed at the sight of this massive human.  The man was big, thick and muscular, and towered over Zac.  He wore a flannel shirt and blue work-pants.  When Eric looked straight ahead at the giant man's work-boots, he almost fainted.  They were gigantic.  Eric listened curiously as the magnificent God of a man began to speak in a deep husky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, my name is Carlos.  I am the exterminator for this apartment complex.  I heard you have a bug problem,\"  the awe-inspiring Hispanic man asked Zac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was fast!\"  Zac said with amazement.  \"Come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was already here spraying another apartment,\"  the exterminator explained as he picked up a massive metal canister and lugged it into the apartment.  \"Where have you seen the bugs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kitchen and the living room,\"  Zac replied.  \"I know there is a bug in here right now.  I saw it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carlos walked into the living room and moved closer to the owner of the apartment, cowering pitifully behind a house-plant,  Eric felt the entire apartment shake from the power of the gigantic man's footsteps.  When Carlos set his canister of toxic spray down on the floor, the shock-wave caused tiny Eric to fall to his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have to leave while I spray,\"  the hulking man told Zac as he pulled out a mask.  \"This is extremely powerful stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.  I am outta here,\"  Zac replied.  \"Take your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in an instant, Eric's younger brother Zac was gone.  He was now all alone with a gigantic menacing exterminator that was about to spray some deadly poison in his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"  Eric shrieked as he witnessed the hulking man don his mask and lift the canister of deadly poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll start in here,\"  the giant exterminator said to himself and gazed around the living room.  \"Ready or not little bugs, here I come.\"</span></div></div>",

Eric unzipped his trousers and pulled out his own tiny but hard cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric crept closer and stood in the shadow cast by giant Carlos and watched the young guy's huge hands in action. One hand cradling his massive sack, the other sliding steadily up and down the huge shaft of a mammoth erection.

The intensity was more than he had experienced in a very long time.  Eric just stood there, motionless and overwhelmed, for a few seconds.  His eyes were transfixed on the lake-sized mess from the giant that had violently splattered on the side of his coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bug-sized man realized his curiosity and lust had placed him in a frightfully precarious position.  He had ventured dangerously close to this imposing behemoth of a man.  Eric\u2019s position left him defenseless, completely out in the open.  He had to figure out an escape route before he was spotted by the colossus that sat before him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the monstrosity of a man shifted his position and began to stand.  Eric shuttered in fear as one of the giant\u2019s work-boots lifted slightly and quickly lowered back to the floor.  The shockwave of the enormous boot nearly 170 feet long knocked the bug-sized man to his butt.  Eric quickly jumped to his feet and tried to assess his daunting situation.  To his right was a canister of poison nearly the size of the Washington monument.  Standing directly in front of him stood a megalith of a man over 900 feet tall.  Eric could barely see to the top of the surreal, God-like titan of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric\u2019s attention quickly shifted back to the giant\u2019s enormous work-boots.

Zac was completely unaware of his minuscule older brother stowing away in the foul smelling toe of one of his sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh, did you reserve us a room at the Hilton?\" Zac kiddingly asked.  \"And it better be ocean front, none of that ocean view crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mr. Kennedy, the Hilton was all booked, so you'll just have to settle for a \"deluxe\" room at the Sand Flea Hotel,\" Josh replied and then broke out in uncontrollable laughter.  \"And just three briar patch rows back from the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the Sand Flea Hotel,\"  Kevin cried.  \"That place is a rat hole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think any respectable rats would be caught dead in that hotel,\"  James said.  \"Somebody hand me a brew-ha-ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No brew-ha-ha for you, you're driving,\"  Kevin said as he open a beer and downed  half the can in one swallow.  \"You can have all you want after we get to the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin, Josh, and Zac began to drink the beer, James noticeably peeved about not being able to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty minutes into the trip, Zac decided to remove his sneakers, to the relief of his tiny brother trapped inside the god-awful smelling shoe.  Zac propped his smelly feet up between the two front seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, your feet stink,\"  Kevin exclaimed.  \"Get those putrid things away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that's bad, just wait,\" Zac exclaimed as he removed his socks and placed one in each sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was relieved when his giant brother removed his enormous foot from his sneaker.  The bug-sized man was truly afraid he was going to suffocate.  But Eric realized his relief was premature when any means of escape from the smelly shoe was quickly erased by the entrance of one of Zac's gargantuan white socks.  Even though the tiny Professor could breath a little better and was not as cramped, he was still trapped in his little brother's gigantic sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three hours, James and three drunken passengers arrived at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decide:</span></div></div>",

Tall weeds lined the front of the place, and the swimming pool was half full of dirty water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I am glad we are only sleeping here,\" Zak said as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the truck, Zak grabbed for his sneakers.  He pulled his socks out and stuffed them into his pocket.  Eric was relieved to see the sunlight again, and get rid of that horrible smell that had been his world for the past three hours.  His happiness was short lived, as the NB sneaker began to tilt.  Outside, Zak proceeded to put the sneakers on his bare feet.  As his world was being turned upside down inside, Eric used all his strength to run back to the toe area.  He had made it just in time as Zak's foot came to rest, and his toes came within just inches of crushing Eric.  Eric stared at the toes of his giant brother.  They wiggled just a bit, as if to mock him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak hopped out of the truck and went to the back to help unload the bags, still oblivous to the stowaway passenger inside his sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys still a little buzzed from all the drinking were trying their best to get all their bags out.  It was a hot day, and Eric knew this all too well as his giant brothers foot began to sweat.  Having endured the smell from the sock stuffed in by him, this was ten times worse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a strap to one of the bags, James went flying backward to the ground on his ass as the strap broke off.  The guys all laughed at him, sprawled out on the pavement holding the broken strap in his hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that by your hand,\" Kevin asked speaking to James.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames glanced down to his hand on the pavement and just a few inches away was a small roach sitting there.  Kevin ran over, and after raising his leg into the air, brought the sole of his Adidas Shelltoe sneaker down on top of the bug with a loud crunch.  He twisted his foot, and then drug his sneaker backwards, just leaving a stain on the pavement of what was left of the bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate those damn things,\" Kevin yelled out.  \"Damn you show no mercy dude,\" Zak replied.  \"They are just pests, and need to be dealt with,\" Kevin answered.  \"At least we know who to call on if we run into anymore,\" James said as he got back up to his feet.  \"Yea, the Adidas of Doom,\" Josh chuckled.  They all began to laugh at that comment.  Kevin finished up wiping his sole on the pavement, getting off anything that was left attached.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey collected all of their things and began heading for the motel office.  Inside his brothers sneaker, Eric had no idea what had just happend, or that the wet spot on the pavement that he and his brothers sneaker had just stepped on, could be him if he was not too careful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the key at the office, they headed to their room to put their stuff away and get ready for the beach.  The room wasnt so bad, but they got what they payed for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im ready for the beach,\" Zak said as he opened his bag looking for his bathing suit.    \" I think we all are Zak,\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak pulled out his suit, and proceeded to kick of his sneakers to put it on.  Not anticipating the sudden movement, Eric lost his balance and fell ontop of his brothers sweaty toes.  As Zaks foot began to slide out of the shoe, the sweat had made Eric stick. So now he had no choice but to go along for the ride.  Eric's tiny heart began to beat fast.  He didnt know what to do.  As luck would have it, just as Zak's foot went past the tongue of the sneaker, it caught hold of Eric leaving him to drop to the cushioned bottom of the shoe. It was a bumpy ride, that wasnt over just yet.  As Zak's foot came out of his New Balance, it dropped to the floor on its side with a thud.  Eric bounced around, coming to rest on the inside fabric of the overturned shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta stop taking those things off in front of us Zak,\" Kevin said as he held his nose.  \"Yea, it smells like something died in them,\" Josh replied.  \"Look at is this way Zak,\" James chimed in.  \"We'll just leave your sneakers out while we are gone, and if there are anymore critters around I am sure the smell will do them in!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting his bearings and getting to his feet, Eric could hear the laughter from oustide.  Something about smell, and do them in.  He was sure they were talking about his brothers foot odor again.  He just couldnt imagine where in their family genes, did his brother get it from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric began walking slowly along the inside of the shoe.  He was headed to the opening where bright light was filtering in.  He got there and slowly peered out to see where he was. Looking out he could see old brown shag carpeting.  Probably a good idea, to hide all the many years of dirt ground into it.  He could also the the legs of his brother, and his friends.  Looking out there, and then looking back into the darkness of the sneaker, he wasnt sure if he should<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Taking in his surroundings, and wondering what he should do when his brother and friends return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he heard the door unlock and it began to open.  It swung open, and standing in the doorway was Kevin.  Dressed in his bathing suit, t-shirt, and his Adidas with no socks.  Little did Eric know the event that took place earlier out in the parking lot, and that he could be in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did Zak say he put it,\" Kevin muttered as he walked in the door.  Eric was over near one of the beds, and he began to see Kevin and his large sneakers heading his way.  This could be his opportunity, so Eric began waving his hands and jumping up and down.  Trying to get Kevin's attention.  Kevin got closer and closer to Eric.  Eric began to worry that he would get crushed.  Kevin was scanning the room, and didnt even notice small Eric on the floor trying to get his attention.  Just as Eric was ready to dive out of the way, Kevins Adidas stopped a few inches from him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him find it himself,\" Kevin muttered to himself again.  \"I drank too much, I need to crash a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the massive sneaker staring him right in the face, Eric was relieved when it made a retreat as Kevin walked to the side of the bed and plopped himself down.  At the foot of the bed high above where Eric was, he could see Kevins Adidas hanging over the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stood debating if he should wait for the other guys, or try to get on the bed and get Kevins attention.  Movement from above made Eric look up.  The sneakers were moving.  Kevin began to use his one foot to pry off his shoe from the other.  It was like slow motion for Eric.  He saw Kevins foot slowly slide out, and as it did the sneaker began to tumble down to the floor.  Eric watched its decent, too stunned to move.  It was heading right for him.  Finally just before it hit the floor, he dove out of the way.  The sneaker landed with a boom.  The force caused Eric to bounce a little bit more across the floor.  Eric started to get back to his feet when the force of the second sneaker dropping, knocked him back down to the ground again.  This sneaker bounced and landed right in front of Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric thought to himself he could have been killed if one of those landed on him.  Eric looked up to the bed again, looking now at Kevins feet hanging over the bed.  His toes wiggling a bit.  Oblivous to what could have just happend.  Something got his attention, and he looked back down to the sneaker that was in front of him.  The odor coming out was even worse than his brothers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's attention was quickly diverted when he heard voices, and the door squeak open again. In came the rest of the guys.  Eric thought to himself as he watched a few sets of giant feet heading toward him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was torn between.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The minuscule professor felt as if he were traversing a dense jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the strenuous journey just to make it to the foot of the bed Kevin had plopped down on, and narrowly avoiding a crushing death by one of the giant's monster-sized Adidas sneakers, the tiny man needed to rest for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's brief rest was interrupted by the return of  Zac, James, and Josh.  The bug-sized Professor looked up in awe and terror at the sight of the colossal young men.  But the most intimidating feature of the giants were their gargantuan feet.  Eric had to avoid being stepped on and squashed to death by one of those powerful monstrosities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was horrified as he watched James walk in his direction.  In a panic, the tiny Professor ran into the opening of Kevin's sour smelling Adidas sneaker.  The air felt almost thick with the hideous smell.  Eric thought for sure he would pass out.  The last place Eric wanted to be was in another giant shoe, but he had no other choice for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook as James' massive foot crashed down right next to the Adidas sneaker little Eric was hiding in.  His foot came in contact with the sneaker just enough so that it righted itself.  Eric tumbled down onto the bottom of the sneaker.

Any light that Eric saw was now blocked by Kevin's massive foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guys left to the store, leaving Kevin alone in the room.  Still half asleep, Kevin sat their debating what he should do in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Adidas, Eric made his way to the heel area.  He looked up to see the massive sole that was blocking the opening.  He was trying to figure a means of escape when the shoe began to shake back and fourth violently.  Above, Kevin had begun to bounce his foot up and down on top of the sneaker.  Eric lost his balance and fell down.  As he looked up, he saw Kevins foot stomping up and down on the sneaker.  Every time the foot came in contact with the outside of the sneaker, Eric's whole world shook sending a tremor and loud thud through the sneaker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric remembered that in his pocket he had a screwdriver.  He came up with the idea that if he could poke Kevins foot with the sharp tool, he might be able to make Kevin stop.  He dug out the screwdriver from his pocket.  He got to his feet in between stomps, reached up into the opening just as Kevins foot came down, and he could hear Kevin above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch....dammit....what the hell was that,\" Kevin said as his foot stopped bouncing.  Sunlight finally flooded in to Eric as Kevin removed his foot off the sneaker.  Kevin reached down and grabbed the sneaker.  Eric could feel himself going up at a high rate of speed.  The next thing he saw were huge fingers entering the opening of the sneaker.  They were feeling around inside, just inches from Eric.  Kevin was inspecting his shoe for the object that might have poked his foot.  Feeling the fabric and insides for any sharp object.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched Kevins fingers probing around and it gave him an idea.  It could be risky, but he might be able to latch on to one of Kevins fingers and get the chance to be saved if he is noticed.  On the other hand, that might be a bad idea and it would just be safer to keep hiding in Kevin's smelly sneaker.  His choice was to....</span></div></div>",

The shrunken man decided that he was better off in the giant smelly shoe than to be powerless in Kevin's massive hand.  Eric had made the right choice for the moment, without even knowing about how freaked out Kevin got when he saw any kind of small bug.  If Kevin saw what he believed was a bug in his hand, he would have probably squashed it to a pulp or slung it to a violent death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin turned his Adidas  in every direction, all the while feeling around inside of the shoe trying to find the sharp object that had stuck his foot.  Eric lodged himself as tight as he could in the foul smelling toe of the sneaker and held on the best he could.  Somehow, he managed to remain undetected by Kevin's probing fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, I know something in there stuck my foot.  Where is it?\"  Kevin mumbled to himself.  \"I guess it fell out onto the nasty carpet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much thought, Kevin ended his search for the sharp object and tossed his sneaker against the wall.  He picked up the remote and tried to turn the TV on.  He pointed the remote and pressed the \"power\" button.  Nothing happened.  He turned the remote over and discovered the back cover was missing along with the batteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin damn shit hole,\"  Kevin grumbled as he walked over to the television set and turned it on himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's channel-surfing revealed only two channels clear enough to watch.  CNN and the Home Shopping Network.  Kevin left the television set tuned to CNN and turned the volume down.  He grabbed a pack of cigarettes from a tote-bag and sat down on the bed to have a smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuny little Eric had been knocked unconscious and thrown violently from the adidas sneaker when it had been thrown against the wall.  He lay next to the giant sneaker in a vast jungle of grungy brown shag carpet.  Kevin sat on the bed in a daze watching CNN without the sound, smoking and wishing the guys would get back with some more beers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac and the other guys returned, each with a bag in hand full of beer, potato-chips, Oreos and other essentials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time you guys got back, I've been bored to tears,\" Kevin told the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have went with us lazy,\" James said, and looked over at the television.  \"When the hell did you start watching CNN?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that or freakin Home Shopping Network.  It won't pick up anything else,\"  Kevin said with frustration.  \"Hey, I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh reached into his bag, pulled out a bag of Double-Stuff Oreos and tossed the entire bag to Kevin.  Josh and the other guys then dumped their bags of goodies down on a table.  Zac began to load up the ice chest with as many cans of beer he could pack inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool, Double-Stuff, my favorite,\"  Kevin said with a big satisfied smile.  \"Hey Zac, throw me a brew.\"<br>\r\n\"Oreos and beer, now that's living the high life,\" Josh joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny unconscious Eric lay precariously next to the wall of the room, vulnerable to any of the giants that might happen to casually walk his way and accidentally stomp out his meager existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No HBO or MTV, what the hell kind of motel is this?\"  Kevin complained.  \"I'm going to miss \"Jackass\" tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is not going to be no time for TV you freak,\"  James replied.  \"We'll either be baking on the beach, or drunk as hell, or both.  Besides, CNN is just what you need to expand your horizons a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of CNN, Zac looked over at the television set and was startled to see a picture of his older brother put up next to the news anchor.  Zac immediately turned up the volume and asked the other guys to keep it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, thats your nerdy brother, ain't it?\" Josh asked.  \"What's he on the news for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shut up and lets find out,\" Zac replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys listened with great interest to the news story apparently concerning Zac's older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------\"...University Professor and brilliant inventor Eric Brevard has been declared missing by University officials and local authorities.

He was sort of a slacker and never held the same job for long, but he had quite a buff body due to his intense outdoor activities such as skate-boarding, snow-boarding, and water-skiing.  High strung but easy to get along with, Josh lived for the moment.  He could be ready for any adventure at  moments notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypical was not the first word that came to mind when Eric looked up in awe at the gigantic young man sitting on the hotel bed.  Josh was as big as a freaking skyscraper to the half-inch tall man.  And Eric knew the other giant currently out of sight on the other bed was just as huge and incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric started to become fascinated with giant Josh.  He wanted to make contact and explore every inch of the young giant.  Except for maybe the feet.  The shrunken man did not want to have anything to do with any more menacing giant smelly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was so mesmerized by the giant youth as he watched T.V. from the enormous hotel bed, he failed to notice a hideous creature lurking near by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt three inches, the giant cockroach was about six times bigger than tiny Eric.  And this roach was pissed that little Eric was infringing on its territory.  The gruesome bug crept up on Eric and silently prepared to destroy the unwanted trespasser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Eric heard a faint rumble nearby in the shag carpet and looked behind him.  He was horrified by the monstrous creature rapidly approaching him.  In complete terror, Eric began to run as fast as he could through the bulky shag carpeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way Eric could outrun the beast.  He tripped.  The monster was almost on him.  It was big and it was nasty.  Its horrible antenna was bigger than he was.  Eric screamed with all of his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me, please help me,\"  Eric screamed and looked away from the horrible creature toward Josh.  \"Josh, please help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was coincidence, super-human hearing, or a psychic miracle, it really did not matter.  Josh looked over and saw the unusually large roach.  Eric was hidden within the dirty brown carpeting, inches away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, Josh jumped up from the bed and within two giant steps, he was on top of the ugly roach.  Kevin was startled by Josh's sudden movement and glanced over to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God a roach,\"  Kevin exclaimed with a grimace.  \"Stomp it fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh did just that.  His gigantic shoe came down on the doomed roach and crushed it instantly.  He twisted his shoe and ground the unlucky bug deep into the carpet.  Eric stood in complete shock just inches away from Josh's massive shoe.  Eric was disgusted as some of the roach remains splattered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the biggest damn roach I ever saw,\" Josh said with a sense of satisfaction from stomping it out of existence.  \"I wonder if there are any more of them around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hope not.  I can't stand fuckin roaches,\"  Kevin said with disgust.  \"Oh Yuck Josh, there is another smaller roach right next to your foot.  Hurry and stomp it before it gets away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  I am not a roach,\"  Eric screamed up at Josh as he witnessed Josh's gigantic shoe begin to lift into the air in preparations for another gratifying stomp.  \"Josh, please don't kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at the tiny \"roach\" as he position his shoe over it and:</span></div></div>",

Kevin was as excited as a little kid getting a new toy.  Eric did not think Kevin would hurt him, but he was quite uneasy as he looked up into Kevin's enormous eyes.  Kevin was mesmerized by the little man in his hand.  He looked the little guy over while Josh tried to make contact with Zac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so small?\"  Kevin asked the bug-sized man standing in the palm of his hand.  \"And how in the world did you end up here with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's breath was a fierce combination of stale beer and Oreo cookies.  And his voice rumbled like thunder.  Eric covered his ears as the gigantic young man tried to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry little fellow,\"  Kevin whispered as he noticed Eric cover his ears in pain when he spoke.  \"Are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was starved.  He nodded his head and screamed yes at the young giant, and Kevin seemed to understand.  Kevin grabbed a piece of Oreo cookie and placed it in his hand next to Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric reached over to the piece of Oreo cookie that was almost as big as he was and scooped up a handful of creamy center.  Kevin softly laughed as he watched the tiny man eat the cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zac, man we found your brother in the motel room, and he's like shrunk.  He is as small as a bug,\"  Josh tried to explain to Zac over the telephone.  \"You and James better get back here quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you're joking at a time like this,\"  Zac replied in a pissed manner.  \"Are you guys high or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds crazy, but I promise it's true,\"  Josh tried to convince Zac.  \"Your brother is in Kevin's hand, here in the room.

Eric felt Kevin's enormous hand tense up and slightly cup in an effort to protect the tiny man.  Eric was horrified as he looked up and saw Kevin's gigantic cavernous mouth slowly open wide while his eyes tightly shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin sneezed.  Who would have thought a simple sneeze could be so traumatic?  But to the insect-sized man cowering in Kevin's mammoth hand, it was spectacular and terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as a reflex, Kevin let the sneeze go right into his hand.  Right into the hand where measly little Eric was trapped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was instantly pummeled by the thunderous force of Kevin's breath.  It threw him down in Kevin's massive hand.  And just as quickly as it came, Kevin's hurricane sneeze was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was repulsed as he found himself covered with Kevin's saliva and snot.  It was gross and disgusting.  He wiped some of the horrible sticky substance from his face and looked up at the giant with a defeated and pitiful expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that was a monster sneeze,\"  Kevin expressed with pride, but then looked down into his cupped hand with concern.  \"I am sooooo sorry little fellow.  Are you O.K.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded his head.  \"I guess it depends on your definition of the word O.K.,\" Eric pondered to himself with the last bit of humor he could muster.  Eric was still alive but far from O.K.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, did you have to sneeze right on him?\"  Josh declared as he rushed over to check on Zac's tiny brother.  \"Oh gross man, he's covered with your snot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Josh, but he looks like he survived it,\"  Kevin said, trying hard not to laugh.  It should not have been funny, but it just was.  \"We are going to have to clean this little guy up before Zac gets back.  Go find something we can wash him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh located a dirty glass ashtray.  He took it to the bathroom and cleaned it thoroughly.  Josh adjusted the water ever so carefully in an effort to get a comfortable temperature for Eric, and slightly filled the ashtray with warm water.  Josh carefully carried the ashtray and set it down on the night-stand.  Kevin began to lower little Eric to the ashtray and said,  \"you're gettin a bath little fellow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin gently placed Zac's tiny brother on the edge of the ashtray and said in a mocking tone, \"Now don't be shy, we are all guys here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt the warmth of the refreshing clean water within the ashtray and jumped right in, clothes and all.  The warm clean water was invigorating.  The water was about neck level.  The bug-sized man submerged his body in an effort to remove all of Kevin's remaining fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny half-inch tall man removed his clothes and set them on the ledge of the ashtray, temporarily oblivious to the fascinated giants looming far above, observing his every move.

Next, he gasped as he fell a small distance onto a giant Kleenex that Kevin had placed in the palm of his hand.  He regained his balance, stood up and reached out for what seemed like a towel Kevin was holding out for him.  It was sort of thick, but it worked just fine.  Eric was happy to be clean again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, put the little fella down, I'm sure he is getting a little tired of you holding him so much,\"  Josh said as he returned with Eric's now dry clothes.  \"How about some clean, dry stuff to wear little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man look at how tiny his shoes are,\"  Kevin said with fascination as he reluctantly put Zac's tiny brother on the night-stand.  \"I don't think he minds me holding him.  I just think he is so cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zac and James should be back soon,\"  Josh said with a sigh.  \"Do you think you can keep from sneezing on the little guy until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny asshole,\"  Kevin replied.  \"When this is all over, I think I will get Zac's brother to shrink you Josh.  I need a new pet to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so my friend,\"  Josh said with a laugh.  \"But it would be cool to be shrunk for a while.  Snow-boarding down that hill in my back yard would be like snow-boarding down Mt. Everest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kevin and Josh pondered the thought of being shrunk, tiny Eric got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen,</span></div></div>",

For the first time, the shrunken Professor felt a sense of hope that this nightmare would turn out O.K. after all.  Kevin and Josh knew who he was, and they seemed intent on looking out after him.  The teeny man just had to wait for his brother to return, and Zac would take him back to the University so he could use his shrink-ray to return to normal size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric noticed the two giants had temporarily neglected him to discuss the prospects of being shrunk.  They had become extremely intrigued by the idea.  Eric was happy not to be focus of all their attention anymore.  He decided to explore the table-top to pass the time a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you trust me to take care of you while you were shrunk?\"  Kevin asked Josh.  \"You could really try some extreme sports at that size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, that is really tiny.  You could accidentally squish me and not even know it,\"  Josh answered.  \"And besides, I wouldn't want you to hold me so much like you were doing to Zac's brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I promise I would not let anything happen to you buddy,\"  Kevin replied.  Kevin was really getting off on the idea of having a tiny Josh in his control.  \"Except maybe if you were bad, I might have to put you in my shoe or something.  You know, just to let you know who's boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\"  Josh said with a laugh.  \"That would kill me.  There is no way I'll be shrunk where you could get your hands on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will see about that,\"  Kevin mumbled under his breath as he looked down to check on Eric.  <br>\r\n\"Hey, where do you think you're going little fellow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin reached down and put his hand next to the tiny man, blocking any further exploration.  He then pinched Eric by his shirt, lifted him and put him back in his original spot on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man felt a little mad and frustrated that anything he did had to be with giant Kevin's permission.  Then Eric jumped back as Kevin's enormous hand reached for him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better just hold you till Zac gets back,\"  Kevin said with a smile as he returned the bug-sized man to his palm.  Josh just rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock slightly startled everyone in the room.  Zac and James had returned.  Josh let them in while Kevin remained sitting on the bed with his little captive secure in his giant hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K., where is my tiny brother,\"  Zac said with a sarcastic tone.  \"Or should I say where's the bag of weed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin has him in his hand,\"  Josh answered, pointing at Kevin.  \"Go look for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\"  Zac exclaimed as he looked into Kevin's hand at his minuscule big brother.  \"What the hell happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was relieved when he saw his brother's giant face, but the boom in his voice knocked him on his back.  Luckily Kevin's massive palm was soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud,\"  Kevin said.  \"You are scaring the little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as we can tell, he was shrunk by one of his inventions, and got here by hitching a ride in one of our shoes,\"  Josh explained.  \"And he is pretty lucky,  I saved him just before a big ole roach got a hold of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, he must have gotten in my shoe when I went to look for him at his office,\"  Zac thought aloud.  \"And I did notice a strange machine and a lot of computer equipment in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be it. He is nodding his head,\" Kevin told everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to get him back there and return him to normal size,\"  Zac said with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\"  James said, still amazed.  \"Let's pack up the Tracker and get the hell out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where can we put him for the trip?\"  Zac asked with concern.  \"He is so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll hold on to him,\"  Kevin answered.  \"Besides, I think he trusts me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew better but decided not to make a big deal about it.  Zac agreed to the idea and the guys left without even checking out,  Kevin carefully holding Zac's tiny brother in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get away from this guy,\"  the tiny man thought to himself, totally in the control of Kevin's huge hand.  \"Oh well, it should be over soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You will just wake him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the one who save him from that fucking roach,\"  Josh exclaimed.  \"And you just wanted me to stomp on him like some bug.  I hate to imagine what would have happened if the little fellow got anywhere near your freaking feet.  You would have thought he was a horrible bug and squashed him just like all those other bugs you obliterated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off, you guys,\"  Zac broke in.  \"What's important now is that we get back to that machine and see if we can return my brother to his old size.  Anyway he is my brother.  Hand him over to me.  I have not had a real good look at him yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin seemed to pout for a second, and then reluctantly turned over his little captive to Zac.  Tiny Eric fell into his giant brother's hand and looked up into his enormous face.  The minuscule man stood up waved with both hands at his king-sized younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac saw his tiny brother waving at him from the palm of his hand and smiled.  \"Don't worry bro, we are going to get you fixed up.\"  Zac was fascinated as he studied the truly tiny features of his shrunken brother.  \"So, if we get you back to the machine in your office, can we turn you back to normal size?\"  Eric nodded his head frantically to confirm Zac's statement.  \"Cool,\"  Zac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Authorities still have no leads in the mysterious disappearance of Eric Brevard.  An intense search has been going on for hours, and plans are for it to continue long into the night.  As you might remember, Professor Brevard was the inventor of the controversial vector-chip, which allowed government satellites the ability to track anyone on earth with pin-point accuracy.  Confidential sources tell us that Professor Brevard was on the verge of a break-through discovery, and was in negotiations to sell his invention to the reclusive billionaire H. R. Grumble.  Back to you Connie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any information on the nature of the new invention?\"  Connie Chung questioned the on-site reporter.  \"I mean just between you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as of yet, Connie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please keep us informed......And up next.....The Adkins diet for your pet.  Dr. Adkins will be here with his latest diet for pets.  So stay tuned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was dim, illuminated entirely from the lights of a vast array of computers.  Several large screen plasma monitors adorned one of the walls.  A lone man sat in a comfortable chair behind an expensive desk, and stared out without emotion.  He picked up his phone and pressed one button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see there has been a leak.  You know I don't like leaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I don't know how it happened.  It was not from our end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen the device?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a glimpse.  Cops are swarming all around the place.  And this has become a media event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want the government getting involved in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, may I ask, what does the device do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The device will change the world as we know it.  That is all I can say over the phone.  Has the team arrived?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the Professor has not turned up in 24 hours, revert to plan B.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, you can count on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nH. R. Grumble ended the call, put his hand to his face and pondered with an evil grin,  \"King of Earth, that has a nice ring to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, there are cops everywhere,\"  James blurted out as he pulled into the parking lot adjacent to the science building.  \"How are we going to get into your brother's office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The computer lab is open 24 hours,\"  Zac answered.  \"We will sneak in from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, this is going to be a blast,\"  Josh exclaimed, excited at the thought of the upcoming adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac gently placed his tiny brother in his shirt pocket.  \"Eric, you will be safe in here until we get to your office.

There is shattered glass all over the floor,\"  Kevin informed Zac as he continued his examination of the fascinating device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac had taken his brother out of his pocket and carefully placed him on a counter.  He looked down at his half-inch tall brother and noticed him pointing to a cabinet.  \"Hey Josh, my brother is pointing to that cabinet.  Check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" Josh said and opened the cabinet.  He reached in and pulled out a shiny circular glass object.  \"Look what I found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome Josh, now see if you can place that on the machine in the right place,\"  Zac instructed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went over to the shrink ray, and attempted to insert the focusing lens.  \"Hey, it screws right in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now stand back.  I'm going to crank this sucker up,\"  Zac said with heavy anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three guys and Eric held their breath as Zac hit the power button on the console.  Zac let out a gasp as the control panel lit up and the device made a low humming sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Password?\"  Josh exclaimed, his eyes glued to the monitor above the control panel.  \"Your brother is way too small to tell us the password.  We can't hear a single word he says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\"  Zac replied with a satisfied grin.  \"My brother has used the same password since sixth grade. Just type in 3.14159.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Pi?\"  Josh asked as he entered the numbers on the keyboard.  \"That is a lame password.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stared at the young giants in disbelief.  They were a lot smarter than he gave them credit for.  And his younger brother was really coming through for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac looked at the monitor and noticed;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPTION 2:  REVERSE LAST PROCESS<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is way too easy,\"  Zac thought with a bit of relief.  \"Kevin, put my brother on the platform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one last time in Kevin's hand.  Thank God,\"  the tiny Professor mumbled to himself as Kevin's gigantic hand effortlessly reached for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes!\"  Zac said as he held his breath and squinted his eyes.  Kevin and Josh looked on in amazement.  Zac pressed the enter button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room filled with bright green light, and a light smoke filled the room.  The smoke cleared within seconds and Zac looked over at the platform and his brother.  He had been restored to normal size.  Zac, Kevin, and Josh stood motionless, in complete disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of dizziness, Eric looked around the room and his normal surroundings.  He pumped his fist and let out an intense \"YEAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric saw his speechless brother at the console and gave him a great big smile.  He then ran over and grabbed hold of Zac and gave him a bear-hug that lasted for well over a minute.  Eric was nearly in tears.  \"You really came through for me little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how about some love over here,\"  Josh said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric reached over and gave Josh and Kevin a firm hand shake.  \"Thanks, you guys are the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin could not believe this was the same man he had held in his hand just moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to my apartment.  I've got a couple six packs in the fridge and I owe you guys a drink,\"  Eric told the guys.  \"Plus I need to think about things for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all need to chill for a while,\" Kevin agreed.  \"Let's go.  James is waiting for us outside in his Tracker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the men entered the stairwell,  Kevin noticed a police officer headed in the direction of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on guys, I'll catch up in a minute.  I left something in the office,\"  Kevin told the guys already headed down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hurry up,\"  Zac said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin walked right up to the young rookie cop.  He looked like he was fresh out of the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\"  Kevin asked the cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am checking this building out for just the hundredth time in search of that Professor guy.  What are you doing here?\"  the young rookie cop questioned Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he is one of my Professors.  I am just hanging out to see what's up,\"  Kevin answered.  \"Hey man, have you seen the secret invention everyone has been talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what is that all about anyway?\" the police officer asked with curiosity.  \"Everybody seems to think it is a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in here and I will show it to you,\"  Kevin said with a big mischievous grin.  \"Just be real quiet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" the cop replied with hesitation.  \"Oh, all right, but just for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just close that door behind you,\"  Kevin instructed the policeman as he walked over to the control panel, shaking with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry Kevin, let's go!\"  Josh said.  Kevin got in the Tracker with the rest of the guys and they took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am exhausted, just let me off at my house,\"  Kevin told the guys as he felt a tiny movement from the bottom of his shirt pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now you don't want to hang out with me since I'm normal size,\"  Eric asked Kevin while giving him a pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that Professor, I am just tired,\"  Kevin said as convincingly as possible.  \"You are still cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys dropped Kevin off at his house and continued to Eric's apartment.  As Eric and the other guys approached the door to his apartment, none them noticed a man in a black suit emerge from a parked car and walk towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Brevard, a lot of people have been looking for you,\"  the man in the dark suit said, startling Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"  Eric replied in a semi-scared tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been instructed by Mr. Grumble to give you this,\" the mysterious man said as he reached into his jacket pocket, and pulled out a check.  \"And all I need in return is a handshake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked at the check as Zac peered over his shoulder.  It read, \"ten million dollars\".  Eric's heart began to beat faster and he reached out his hand to the stranger.  Zac thought to himself, \"I just saved my brother's life, and now he is rich.  Life could not be any better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He accepted the offer Sir, we have a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, now tie up any loose ends and return to the complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin reached into his pocket and let the tiny uniformed man tumble softly onto his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny young rookie cop was overwhelmed with horror as he looked up at the intimidating giant looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to have a great time together,\"  Kevin said softly to the terrified shrunken man now entirely in his control.

The boys put on their best behavior, however, and managed to receive no more than a warning from the highway patrol officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time, especially when Josh, his companion in the back seat of the tracker, went to sleep, Kevin would unfurl his fist and stare at Zac's tiny brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Eric would, if anyone had bother to consult him, have much preferred to make the trip in his brother's hands, but Zac called shotgun and sat in the front passenger seat of James' tracker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys rushed through the corridors of the science building until they reached Eric's laboratory.

Within an instant, Eric returned to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazed at witnessing his older brother's growth, Zac lunged forward and hugged Eric. \"Good to have you back with the big guys,\" Zac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to be back,\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go back to your place and celebrate,\" Zac suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers, along with James, left the lab, talking excitedly as Eric recounted his adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stopped to tie his shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look at that,\" Kevin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh straightened and looked toward his friend. \"Look at what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there!\" Kevin pointed toward the platform. \"Down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked toward the platform and bent down for a closer look. \"I don't see anything,\" he said as he turned toward Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw two things\u2014 a sudden flash of light and Kevin's eager grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sorry  bas........\" Josh started to yell. His curse dwindled away to nothing as the young man rapidly lost stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin caught up with his friends in the parking lot outside the science building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you guys been?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had to stop at the restroom,\" Kevin answered, one hand shoved in a pocket of his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Josh?\" Zac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he felt a little tired,\" Kevin said. \"He's going to go home and crash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one thought to question Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Kevin said. \"I think I'm beat, too. James, just drop me off at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" James said as they all piled back into the tracker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin, in the back seat with Eric, turned and grinned. \"I sort of miss keeping you in the palm of my hand,\" Kevin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't say that I miss it,\" Eric replied, although he tried to remain gracious. \"But I am thankful for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't mention it,\" Kevin said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then lowered his three-inch-tall friend to his stomach. \"Now, you can get me off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh, standing unsteadily on Kevin's stomach, felt too powerless to refuse his giant friend, so he clambered along Kevin's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait,\" Kevin said. He reached in and plucked up Josh again. As his tiny friend kicked his tiny legs, Kevin reached up and pulled off his tiny boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then replaced the now totally naked Josh closer to his crotch. He noticed with satisfaction that Josh sported his own tiny erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" Kevin urged, and he pushed Josh forward until he was standing near his hard dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, get me off little man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You best think of something,\" Kevin said. He poked his little friend in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh doubled over. \"Okay! Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh moved closer to the huge cock. It looked twice his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do this, you have got to take me back to the lab and grow me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it,\" was the extent of Kevin's agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized he shouldn't have made such an idle threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, his last delaying tactic utilized, the little man began to rub against the giant\u2019s shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin groaned from the immense pleasurable sensation. As Josh continued his work, he noticed how hard his own dick had gotten. Now, straddling Kevin's huge cock, he stretched out and continue to massage it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried to gain a good grasp, but Kevin surprised him sooner than expected with an eruption of white cum. Josh found himself drenched in the warm liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin, immensely satisfied, looked down at his spent friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good, little man. Really good. In fact, I think I could get used to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt his heart sink. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Disobey me and\u2026\u201d He presses his thumb into Josh hard for a second, then lets up. \u2018Disobey me and I will make you smaller than you can even imagine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls Josh into one hand and then picks him up with the fingers from the other hand. Josh finds himself hanging in front of Kevin\u2019s face. \u2018Do you want to be smaller?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just hangs there, stunned. The giant fingers shake him a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Do you want to be smaller??\u2019 Josh quickly shakes his head, no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin nods. \u2018Do you understand what has happened?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Josh just hangs there, stunned. Again, the giant fingers shake him a little bit. Josh nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What has happened?\u2019 the giant asks, his giant teeth glistening, the giant handsome face serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I..you\u2026\u2019 Josh falters, hanging, afraid. The giant fingers shake him again, bringing Josh closer to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You shrunk me!\u2019 Josh blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That\u2019s right\u2019 the giant mouth says. \u2018What are you, now?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh, scared, is quiet. The giant tongue licks the giant lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019m yours.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant smile. \u2018That\u2019s right. That\u2019s all you are, anymore. You\u2019re mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other giant hand comes up and wraps around the hanging Josh. He finds himself held, enclosed in a giant fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018From now on, you are mine. We\u2019ll go slow. We\u2019ll take the rules a day at a time. I\u2019ll make sure you understand so you can be treated well, if you choose. I\u2019ll rename you and keep you and take care of you. Just understand\u2026from this day forward, you are mine, Josh is gone, Kevin is gone, there is only a toy and a Master. I own you totally and you are mine.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh knew he should have listened to the nagging inner voice that had told him not to agree to Kevin's crazy scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts scattered when he heard a loud sigh from Kevin, who had leaned back on the sofa, his legs spread fall apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had placed little Josh on the floor before taking his seat on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at his giant friend's mountainous body, all exposed except for the vast stretch of fabric comprising Kevin's boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin lifted one of his legs and moved a huge foot closer to his tiny toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh steeled himself not to flee at the approach of the foot. He didn't want to give Kevin that satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin chuckled at Josh. \"Not afraid of my big foot, little guy?\" Kevin asked in a booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up and shook his head defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you like my big foot?\" Kevin speculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't like the sound of Kevin's laughter. \"That must be it,\" Kevin said. \"You like how you look so small next to my foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, you've got to stop this,\" Josh squeaked, losing his patience and resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your back,\" Kevin commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh stared dumbly, Kevin's bare foot surged forward, knocking him unceremoniously onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could scramble back to his feet, Josh felt Kevin's bare sole settle over his three-inch-long body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin controlled the descent of his foot over his tiny friend's prone body. He felt an electric charge as Josh struggled and squirmed beneath his bare foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin!\" Josh tried to scream. His mouth opened and closed over the bare skin of his giant friend's dirty sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin glided his foot slowly, back and forth, over his tiny man's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt his fear subside slowly when he realized Kevin, probably, didn't mean to crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Kevin seemed to enjoy himself, or that was the impression his loud, satisfied groans gave to Josh, who found himself almost overwhelmed by the fact any of his friend's toes dwarfed his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh, forced to take a deep breath, smelled the powerful scent of Kevin's foot sweat. The powerful aroma filled the little man's nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in his booming voice, Kevin demanded another service from the tiny man trapped under his foot. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kevin liked the feeling of being a giant controlling the little man. Kevin felt such a power surge from the experience and he wanted more. Kevin thought up an idea for his tiny slave to do and he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Josh, as your new master now I command you to lick my foot,\" Kevin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laid there taking in the odor of his new master. Kevin was really enjoying this but Josh hated it. When Josh heard his command he couldn't believe it.

The sweat and gunk from his feet collected on Josh's tongue causing a foul taste in Josh's mouth. He kept licking all he could at his fixed position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Kevin was moaning even more. The excitement was too much, the power was coursing through his body and he couldn't hold it in anymore. Kevin moved his foot to expose his giant member to Josh, the one he was stroking while Josh was licking his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stroked his member once more and released his load. It shot onto the floor and Kevin was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh man, that was the best,\" Kevin said, then he looked Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood up and began to run but Kevin slammed his foot down on him.

Kevin can't believe how amazing this feels, and how much he is getting off on the power.  Everything suddenly feels right in the world, for him. He now owns a man, he can do anything he wants with him, Josh...no, not Josh. He reminds himself that Josh is gone and is surprised how easily he can change the way he views his former friend. Just thinking these things causes Kevin to subconsciously squeeze his fist a little more, which causes the little man to cry out. Kevin relaxes his grip, just a touch, and thinks about what to do. He so wants to play with his toy, and explain more about the new toy's life, but he realizes the little man must need time to think, to adjust. And Kevin needs to go buy some things he now needs to keep a small, live possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stands up, his giant naked body stretching. He lowers his fist to his side. Josh hangs at his side, trying to struggle in the fist but he cannot move, the Giant - Kevin, he has to keep thinking of him as Kevin, so he can talk to his friend - has too firm a hold on him.  But it is all so overwhelming! The giant fist around his body is warm and tight, and Josh still has his friend's cum all over him. It is all he can smell, the Giant...Kevin.  And now he hangs, horizontal, at the side of the giant. Kevin\u2019s giant thigh takes up most of his view, but he can also see part of the giant dick hanging between Kevin\u2019s legs. Even soft it is larger than Josh. He squirms again, afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin feels the little man squirm again, or try to, and he smiles, at his power. He walks across the room to the place on the floor where his clothes are in a pile. With his free hand he picks up his white briefs, and uses them to clean the cum from his groin. He then lifts his fist back towards his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I have a few errands to run. And I imagine you need some time to think about what has happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begins to wrap the little man in his now cum soaked briefs, talking to him the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018While I am gone, I want you to think about what has happened. And what you are. You are no longer Josh, little man. You\u2019re not even a man, really. Just a little toy. Think about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finishes wrapping Josh inside his briefs.  Josh is totally inside them, gone from view. Kevin tucks the last flap in, immobilizing the little toy. He then walks to his dresser and open a large drawer filled with his boxers and briefs. He lifts them up and places the wrapped briefs at the bottom of the drawer, then places the clean briefs and boxers back over them, then shuts the drawer. He then quickly gets dressed, grabs his keys, and heads out to get what he needs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He walked around and faced the tip of the huge shaft, seeing the slit open as wide as a crevice into a long, deep tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust seeing the tiny man so close to his dig was the only fuel Kevin needed to maintain his raging erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you look like a bug, professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt like one, too, but he remained speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if you could fit inside?\" Kevin speculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, stunned, began to back away, but Kevin's hand lowered down. The giant poked him with a huge finger, forcing him closer to the wide slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Eric screamed, but Kevin was too far into his fantasy to stop now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan's body shuddered as he pushed the shrunken man into the slit. He shuddered again when he felt the tiny man squirming about an inch deep into his nine and a half inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" Kevin cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could not believe the sudden turn of events as Kevin used a massive finger to push him through the slit of the enormous dick. He had tried to back out, but the finger pushed him deeper, and he fell. Then, he had to crawl forward, surrounded by thick, muscled walls that suddenly contracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin squeezed the head of his cock. \"Oh god!\" He moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard the key in the door that signaled Josh's return. He pulled up his pants and let his boxer-briefs snap back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was all innocent as Josh entered with bags of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the little professor?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin felt the squirming intensify in his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh'in the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bathroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get him,\" Kevin said, rushing from the room and slamming the bathroom door closed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind closed doors, he pulled down pants and underwear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come out now, professor,\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, the squirming sensation seemed to be working itself deeper into his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, wrong way, tiny dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knocked on the door. \"Everything's OK, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin squeezed his cock and moaned. \"Just fine, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin would not be cool with this.

Shooting out the itty-bitty professor with his load willy-nilly might be quite dangerous for such a tiny guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he reached into his bunched-up jeans to fish out his wallet.

I would be here to make sure nothing happens to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh deliberated on Kevin's offer. \"I don't think we should mess with that shrink ray,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin sighed. \"What's wrong, Josh? Don't you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wondered if the surge was an aftereffect of being shrunk by Professor Brevard's device or, more likely, simply his unrestrained excitement at finding himself plunged into a strange, alien and, above all else, huge world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recalled stepping onto the platform and waiting for Kevin to trigger the device. After a brilliant flash of light, everything \u2014 the walls, the lab equipment and even Kevin \u2014 seemed to grow bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the disorienting process stopped, Josh found himself reduced to the puny height of barely quarter of an inch tall. He gazed up and saw Kevin, now transformed into some unreal man-mountain hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA! LOOK AT YOU!\" Kevin exclaimed. \"COOL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud!\" Josh protested as Kevin's words rang in his tiny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kevin lifted one foot off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin! Stop! What the hell are you doing?\" Josh screamed as he saw the huge sneaker rise over the horizon at the edge of the platform. In a quick motion, the shoe dropped onto the round platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the shoe impacted more than half the length of the platform away from him, tiny Josh had been certain that the colossal shoe was coming down on top of him. Now, realizing that Kevin had been having fun at his expense, Josh shouted unheard curses at his titanic friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he happened to gaze toward the shoe. The old sneaker looked incredibly worn. The laces showed myriad frays and even the shoe's canvas walls exhibited dozens of minor imperfections. Josh imagined trying to climb the enormous structure, searching for one handhold after another in his valiant ascent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin, at the same time, looked down and enjoyed seeing how much his shoe dwarfed his shrunken friend. He could only imagine what Josh might be feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm ready for you to grow me back now,\" Josh shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin, however, stepped away and walked across the lab.

He imagined he would be able to have all this kind of fun in a giant and extreme world. Unfortunately, he didn't realize Kevin had his own ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched his friend take a huge glass beaker in hand, Josh began to feel his nerve fail him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, we should discuss this!\" Josh shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's enormous fingers closed the gap. \"Kevin! Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he has had some time to think this over, Josh regrets his haste in letting his friend shrink him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being transported to Kevin's apartment in the huge glass beaker, Josh found himself transferred into a colossal glass tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could adjust to his new surroundings, Kevin mysteriously left him alone in the big glass tank on a small table about three feet off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Where the hell are you going?\" Josh shouted as Kevin walked toward the door. \"Don't leave me here! Kevin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone, he found his mind filled more with doubts about the wisdom in entrusting himself into Kevin's care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tank is bare for now. It's like being stranded inside a huge glass arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh looks around the place, he remembers how Kevin keeps his apartment in a shabby  state. He can see lots of clothes strewn on the floor. T-shirts, underwear and even a pair of his sneakers are dropped haphazardly on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh has been awake and alone for more than an hour. He didn't know where Kevin had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had been in Kevin's apartment  several times in the past and always used to think that the place was small and cramped.   Since the tank holding him is in the middle of the room, and the walls are glass, he spent some time looking out at the rest of the apartment. It's just a total disaster.   Kevin has dirty clothes all over the floor, empty, or possibly not quite empty, pizza boxes tossed on tables and on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can also see some discarded fast food cartons and empty soda and beer cans. He even saw a pair of Kevin's really ratty old sneakers near the door. Josh knew that Kevin always wears his sneakers till they fall apart, and they always smell pretty bad. Josh remembered how he and other friends used to kid Kevin about the smell. He can't imagine what they would smell like now!     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I knew he was a slob, but from this perspective, he's a disaster!\" Josh said aloud.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and under the coffee table are old food containers from a bunch of fast food restaurants, along with empty beer and pop cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Josh tries to get a better look at anything he pushes into the glass, which only reminds him of just where he is and how small he is. A single aluminum can now resembles some huge industrial storage silo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuff that Josh used to take for granted, now take on all different proportions.   A simple beer can isn't just a beer can anymore \u2014 it's a massive structure that could probably hold everyone in his whole apartment building comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh feels the knowledge sink into his brain of how small he has become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe know that without Kevin's assistance, he will never leave this huge apartment. For all practical purpose, his buddy's apartment is now his universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the thickness of the glass walls compared to his body, Josh decided he must only be about  a quarter of an inch tall.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I can get out of here on my own,\" Josh said aloud. \"I don't have a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, Kevin \u2014 the jerk, Josh thought \u2014 is probably the only chance he has of getting out of this mess.  He can't believe how stupid he was to let Kevin of all people shrink him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I  guess my acting without thinking things through really got me this time!\" Josh exclaimed as he paced the floor of the huge cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has racing thoughts. Where is Kevin anyway? Why would he just drop me in here and leave?  He seemed to interested in me shrinking and now has just left me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to be patient and tough it out. Kevin will grow him back eventually...hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from the far side of the apartment, you hear a loud noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door the size of a mountain swings in to admit a titan. It's Kevin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin walked into his apartment, carrying a small brown paper bag in one hand. He tossed some keys into a bowl on a stand near the door and looked across the room toward the fish tank. It looks empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh remains paralyzed on his feet. There's a massive loud bang and another one. The tiny man felt vibrations in the floor of this tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin is only walking from the door through the apartment!    Josh can't believe how big his friend looks. It's so unreal!   He could not even judge how big his friend must be!   He tried, but he could not even focus on his whole body at the same time.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, he's walking this way....\" Josh whispered nervously when Kevin turned his attention toward the tank.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did you think I'd be?\" Josh wanted to ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of his friend's voice sounded loud but distorted and boomed in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Not so loud!\" Josh screamed as Kevin's thunderous voice roared over him. He placed his hands to his ears to try to stop the ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin tapped on the glass pane at the front. \"How's it going, little buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gazed up at Kevin's  giant face, way up above the top of the tank. His friend was smiling down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin moved his hand to the front of the tank, and hit it with a finger causing huge bangs. He laughed as his shrunken buddy got tossed on his butt from the vibrations!     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how's everything going?\" Kevin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stayed seated, not wanting to get bowled over again. He yelled as loudly as he could.  \"Kevin!   What's going on?   You said you'd make me bigger after just a little while!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! I should have looked for a magnifying glass while I was at the lab.\" Kevin said with a grin as he stared through the glass pane. \"I can barely see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh covered his ears again as he felt pummelled by Kevin's loud voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, you're too loud!\" Josh tried to communicate to his giant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to stand on his two legs again. Unfortunately, standing did little to increase his height at all in comparison with Kevin's immense stature.  Josh looked up at Kevin from below, and realized he looks so much different than anytime he had ever seen him all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin realized with pride and pleasure that he must look absolutely huge to his shrunken friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gazed at Kevin as if he was some monumental tribute to the male form, but instead of being made of stone, Kevin remained very much flesh and blood. And every single move made by his giant friend is accomplished with stunning swiftness, leaving Josh to wonder how someone so huge can move so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh could not quite figure out his motivation, but he kept staring at Kevin.   The two guys have been friends for years, and they have even wrestled and done a lot of play fighting with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith startling clarity, Josh recognized that they had never settled which of them was stronger than the other \u2014 a moot point now, Josh realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Kevin seemed content at the moment just to stare at his tiny friend on the other side of the glass, making Josh feel nervous like he is no more than a test subject.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's huge eyes just keep looking over his buddy's tiny body.   And there's nowhere at all for Josh to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get over how tiny you are,\" Kevin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started waving his arms to see if he can communicate, \"Kevin, can you hear me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Josh, his voice sounds loud, but Kevin's head and ears seem so far from him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin dropped a paper bag into the tank. \"Go ahead.\" I haven't even noticed your attempts at communication. \"Look in the bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag, dropped in the middle of the tank, looks the size of an arena-sized brown tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked across the floor of the tank toward the bag, still occasionally looking up at Kevin's unreal mountainous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh entered the open bag and found all sorts of stuff inside at normal size. He needed about three seconds to realize the items are not normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's shrunk this stuff to my size,\" Josh said aloud.  \"That's where he must have been all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh found so many different items \u2014 a scuba tank and a weird backpack-shaped thing.    After examining it, he realized it's a parachute!     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found an old skateboard he used to use a few years ago and realizes Kevin must have been in his apartment to get all these items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped outside the bag, \"Kevin! What were you thinking, shrinking all this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to thinking...\" Kevin said as he leaned over the top of the tank, now looking down inside at his buddy's tiny form.  \"...if you want to really get maximum benefit from shrinking, you'll need some fun supplies. So, I went back to the lab and borrowed Zac's brother's shrink ray again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He answered me!\" Josh exclaimed in surprise.  \"He can hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, his surprise is followed almost immediately by disappointment when he realizes Kevin is only telling him what he was going to say anyway.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin didn't hear him after all!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what did he say?\" Josh said aloud.  \"Getting maximum benefit from shrinking? He's not serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at Kevin's huge form again and yelled.  \"Kevin, come on, the joke's over! Take me back to the lab and grow me back! I'm not going to get mad at you! I swear. Just take me back!\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, observing his giant friend, Josh realizes Kevin isn't even listening, although his grin is getting wider as he observes the tiny gear at his little friend's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stares at one of Kevin's massive hands rest at the top edge of the tank. \"What do you wanna play with first, little guy? Pick out something.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh shook, but managed to stay up. He wasn't going to let Kevin push him around, just because he wasn't as large as he was. He wasn't a pet. He was a human being. He yelled a stream of swear words up into the sky, where Kevin proudly and arrogantly smiled down at Josh like a billboard. \"Have you chosen yet?\" he asked, smugly, not hearing a thing but getting the message from Josh hopping around in circles like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a ticked-off insect, Kevin established.

The glittering dark eyes fastened on his insignificant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Josh cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin hadn't heard, but he did want something.

Or, he suddenly thought, having an epiphany, maybe he does. And this is why he\u2019s doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd never been mean to Kevin. Sometimes, Josh admitted, he was a sore winner, but that was because he rarely lost. He enjoyed sports and especially winning. He loved rubbing it in his friends' faces that he was the most athletic and talented, but who didn't like to show off? However, he'd never meant to make Kevin feel inferior! As inferior as he felt now, dwarfed by Kevin's hand atop the jar. It was about a foot in height, but that was equal to 300 feet to Josh. The only way he ever would exit, he knew, was with Kevin's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Kevin would be just happy to let his friend rely on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, you have a choice yet?\" Kevin asked, letting Josh know with his tone that if he didn\u2019t choose soon, he would choose for him.

The vibrations caused by Kevin's habit knocked Josh off his feet. When he tried to stand up again, to face the sky that had become Kevin's face, he fell again. What kind of message was Kevin trying to send? That he couldn't even stand without his permission?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was scared. Scared of the power his irresponsible, and possibly vengeful, friend now had over him. Scared of the number of ways in which he could be hurt, purposefully or accidentally. Scared of remaining this size for the rest of his life. He had to appease Kevin, he knew. It would be the only way. Seeing all of his equipment in front of him, he couldn't figure out which he would feel safest using at this minuscule height. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This wasn't a time to play around with Zac's brother's science equipment. And then Kevin suddenly turned, Josh aware of how huge Kevin was. He was over 1800 feet tall, his mere shoe 120 feet high and over 300 feet long. And that's when Josh realized that he wasn't going to grow back to his former height soon or, he feared at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin!\" He yelled up. \"Kevin?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden impact near Josh threw off his balance, and he fell hard onto the cold metal of the platform. He clutched his leg, which was bruised, and looked up...to an awe and fear inspiring sight. Kevin's ratty sneaker rose up like a skyscraper, showing off even minute details which used to be insignificant. Josh had a sudden moment, in the shadow of Kevin's footwear, in which he felt significant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'RE GOING TO ENJOY THIS, JOSH...OR AT LEAST, I AM.\" Kevin couldn't help but crack a huge grin at his tiny friend's predicament. And swiftly, he set the test tube on its side like a cave to Josh. And then with his fingertip, he nudged Josh gently in. To Josh, however, he was struck by a huge force. He flew not only through the opening but into the very end of the tunnel. He struck his head hard, and felt disoriented. The last thing he could remember before becoming unconscious was feeling like he was flying, transparent glass all around, and he rose into the air...and into the pocket of Kevin's jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He found a chair in the corner of the room and he grabbed it, pulling it in front of the cage. And then he put his hand into the cage, reaching around for Josh. Josh seemed to immediately go into a state of panic, racing in circles to avoid Kevin's hand. Kevin allowed Josh to play the game for a couple of minutes, enjoying it himself. Once Kevin had sufficiently tired Josh out, he easily grabbed him between his thumb and index finger. He couldn't believe how weak and puny he was, the size of a grain of rice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin!\" Josh screamed, \"You're hurting me, man! Stop this stupid game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU AGREED THAT YOU WOULD SHRINK AND PLAY SOME GAMES, RIGHT JOSH? WE'RE PLAYING A GAME RIGHT NOW. THIS IS AN ENDURANCE TEST, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.\" Kevin untied and removed his Adidas sneaker and began to grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was clueless, but too busy trying to free himself from Kevin's fingers. He felt his surroundings changing quickly, dropping. And then Josh realized there was no more pressure on him. He was free-falling through the air. Suddenly, he became very afraid. \"Kevin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he hit the ground, he was relieved. He wasn't dead, for one thing. He was on a bouncy, felt-like surface. \"Where am I?\" he wondered. And more importantly, where was Kevin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned, seeing sight of something on one of the huge walls. It was a \"14,\" in a bright circle. \"Fourteen?\" That's...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up with a sudden revelation, seeing Kevin above him. \"No! C'mon, Kev! No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SORRY JOSHY. IT WAS YOUR CHOICE. MY SOCKS SMELL PRETTY BAD THOUGH, MAN...SO JUST FOR YOU...I'M TAKING THEM OFF.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe removed his sweat-soaked white athletic socks and without another word, slid his foot into the shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh began to scream when everything went dark. He saw Kevin's huge foot enter, and then realized it wasn't his foot. It was only his big toe. It struck him violently, throwing him deep into the cave. He rolled, bouncing on the sweat-inundated surface, until he reached the toe of the shoe. Immediately, like a gear or machinry going into place, Kevin's foot slid over him, his toes like claws over him. He wasn't stuck - there was room to move - but why would he? There was no nowhere to go, and the scent was beginning to make him lightheaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin leaned close to his leg, shouting so Josh would hear him. \"JOSH, YOU'RE SO TINY.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh fell through the air for a moment, and hit the soft ice cream.   His legs were almost completly embedded in the frozen mound before he stopped.  Before he could even get his bearings, he felt an intense cold from the ice cream all around his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the ice cream was just starting to melt, there was a thick liquid at freezing temperature all around his legs, that felt like thousands of needles stabbing into his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instinctively tried to pull his legs out of the sticky cold mess as fast as he could, but couldn't get any leverage.  The ice cream just wasn't solid enough, and all he ended up doing was covering his hands and arms in it as well.  He heard something loud and looked up to see Kevins enourmous face grinning down at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was chuckling to himself while watching poor tiny Josh struggle in the mound of Kevin's ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt a combination of anger at Kevin and fear seeing him at this angle, and realizing the situation he was in.   As he started to feel his legs go numb, all the while Kevin just grinned down at him, he yelled up to the giant \"Kevin, PLEASE let me out of this! We can talk about this later okay?\" but he wasn't even sure Kevin heard him, or if Kevin was even listening.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kevin boomed down to him, \"SORRY I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING YOU CAN USE AS A SNOWBOARD BUT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU EXPERIENCE A RIDE THERE\" and before Josh could even think of what Kevin might mean, he saw Kevin reach out one of his massive hands, and stretch out his index finger..   the massive fingertip slowly came towards him, and Josh thought Kevin might mean to just push him under the surface, but the fingertip hit him in his back and pushed him away from his little trap, but kept pushing him even when his legs got free..   Kevin was pushing him down and around the mound of ice cream, as if he was skiing or boarding down it himself.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't hurt him, which surprised him, and as the speed increased, he began to feel almost like he was on some kind of amusement park ride.  If only the ice cream wasn't so cold and sticky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh began to wonder just why he was having those thoughts.  That wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was playing with him, and this just wasn't right.   He shouldn't feel like he's having fun, he should be totally ticked at Kevin.  As he struggled with his conflicting feelings, Kevin stopped pushing him.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked way up into Kevin's face, and Kevin was now just smiling down at him.  \"WASN'T THAT FUN LITTLE GUY?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh seemed to lose the feeling of fun that he was having when he heard Kevin use the term \"Little Guy\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wanted to yell up at him in anger, but then felt himself rising.   He was shocked, and looking at Kevin, realized Kevin was just as surprised.  As Kevin went to remove his finger, found that Josh was stuck to the tip of it from the sticky ice cream.   Kevin suddenly erupted with laughter at this unexpected surprise at Josh's expense, but to poor Josh, the laughter was a thunderous roar, that was deafening to him. \"Kevin.... Please!!\" he pleaded, but his own pleas were drowned out by the giants laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Kevin stopped laughing, but kept a huge grin on his face as he held the pathetic-looking speck sized Josh in front of his face.  Josh still covered in ice cream, stuck to his giant friend's fingertip, was beginning to feel better as the body heat from Kevin's finger and Kevin's warm breath washing over his tiny body, began to warm him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, YOU ARE QUITE A MESS AREN'T YOU?   LOOKS LIKE ITS TIME FOR YOU TO GET WASHED UP NOW\" Kevin spoke down to Josh, who by now was too exhausted to even try to argue with the giant.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin used his other hand to grab Josh and drop him into his giant palm, then began to think of the best way to get Josh cleaned up. </span></div></div>",

When Josh and friends got back to town, Eric contacted them. \"Josh, I heard a little of your conversation with Kevin, enough to know your interested in being shrunk but you're afraid. I'd like to have you be a guinea pig for future experiments and I can give you two assurances to calm your fears. First, I won't shrink you as small as I was. Second, Zac, James and anyone else you wish may know about this so we can hold each other accountable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, Josh, Zac, James and Kevin gathered in the lab. Josh said, \"I invited Kevin because he has great ideas most of the time.

His friends were more than twenty times taller than him. They were like sky scrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric picked Josh up. This was a change of perspective for him, his first time to hold a human in his hands. His desire to have a closer look grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at the floor that looked about two thousand feet away. Josh felt afraid of being held at this height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric said, \"Now I need to examine you to make sure there are no side effects. Please remove your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh protested but Eric persuaded the friends to his side. Kevin said, \"Come on, Josh, don't be such a wuss.\" Kevin grabbed Josh's clothes and helped him strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh covered his privates. He felt intimidated by his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac had thoughts about how Josh was like a pet. Zac hadn't been responsible enough for a pet but he wanted a pet. He thought about how easy it would be to care for Josh as his pet since Josh could do some things for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had thoughts about how Josh was like a doll or toy. James kept a few of his childhood toys as keepsakes. He felt nostalgic looking at toy sized Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's thoughts were more about the power he had over Josh while Eric's thoughts were more sexual in nature. \"Alright, Josh, stop covering yourself. I have to examine your genitals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric lifted Josh's hands above his head. Josh's cock was huge for Josh's current size. \"Are you normally this hung or was there a glitch in the shrinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am normally this hung.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric finished the examination and Josh asked, \"Grow me back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm concerned about your genital size. I can't risk growing you back until I confirm it's not a glitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac, James and Kevin walked down the sidewalk chatting.

Still passed out on the floor, Eric was suddenly awakened as Zak and James walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and saw Kevin and Josh sitting on the bed.  He wondered where his brother and James had gone.  The tv caught his attention because he could here his name being mentioned numerous times.  He could then also hear Josh asking Kevin where his other sneaker had gone.  Kevin explained the situation with the phantom sharp object he felt and couldnt find, and how he threw it across the room in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was out in the open, and noticed a half eaten bag of potato chips on the floor.  Kevin got up off the bed and was headed in Eric's direction.  Eric quickly dove into the bag for cover.  He could hear Kevin getting closer and closer by his footfalls.  He stopped just short of the bag, and Eric could feel him standing over the bag.  Kevin had come to collect his sneaker.  He slipped it on and to his suprise, there was no sharp object remaining.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get out of here,\" Kevin told Josh.  \"Like they said, no sense in us wasting our time in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Josh said. \"Lets leave this dump for awhile.  You better pick that bag of chips up though, or more of those damn roaches are gonna be in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw those dirty pieces of crap,\" Kevin yelled.  \"Let them show themeselves, and this is whats gonna happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bag, Eric did not like where this was going.  Kevin raised his Adidas high above the potato chip bag.  It got quiet and Eric wondered what was going on.  Not having a chance to blink an eye, the walls around Eric flattened and he was immediately crushed.  The last think he heard was CRUUUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Kevin's shoe loomed for a quick second in the air.  In an instant it came crashing down toward the bag.  There was a loud crunch as the bag of chips flattened under his sole.  Any idea that Eric had been in there was useless, as the sound of the chips being pulverized into the floor covered up the sound of Eric's bones being mashed along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" Kevin said as he then lifted his foot off the bag and kicked it across the floor.  \"You dont cross my path and live to tell about it.  Even if you are just a bag of chips.  You get turned into dust under my sole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed and they headed for the door.  The bag of chips and remains of Eric had landed in front of the door.  Kevin made a point to step down on it as he walked over, giving it a twist. He felt another small crunching sound under his sole, which this time happend to be what was left of Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dust I tell ya,\" Kevin laughed.  Josh followed behind Kevin out the door.  He just couldnt pass up the opportunity, so he timed his step to bring his Nike down right on top of the bag as well.  The remaining chips gave way under Josh with a crackle.  He drug the bag under his sole out the door and to the sidewalk.  Leaving the bag there, the guys continued on to the beach.  The bag was left to be trampled a few more times by passing guests at the motel.  It was later picked up by the cleaning crew and tossed in the trash.</span></div></div>",

He jumped up and attached himself to the finger.  His arms and legs wrapped around tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the....,\" Eric heard Kevin say from outside the sneaker.  Going along for the ride, Eric held on for dear life as the fingers retracted from inside the shoe.  Kevin brought his hand up to his face to see a small insect like creature attached to his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another nasty parasite,\" he yelled out as he tried to shake it free of his hand.  \"Time for you to die bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was screaming for his life, but Kevin had no way of hearing him.  He was loosing his grip from the finger as Kevin continued trying to shake him off.  Finally Eric lost his grip and went flying across the room landing on the rug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin got off the bed and headed toward the bug on the floor with his sneaker in hand.  Eric layed on the rug half in a daze.  He could see a large shadow headed toward him.  His vision returned in time to see Kevin kneeling over him.  His sneaker in his hand held high over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should teach you not to mess with me you little piece of crap,\" Kevin said as gripped tigher around his sneaker.  \"Let me introduce you to my sneaker again,\" he said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked up in horror as the heel of the sneaker came barreling down toward him, and a look of satisfaction on Kevin's face.  The last thing he saw was the Adidas logo on the sole as he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin brought his shoe to the floor with a thomp.  It was a great pleasure to him to see the lifeless insect laying there as he raised his sneaker up.  He enjoyed the power of ending the life of something so insignificant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now its time for me to go have more fun,\" Kevin said outloud.  \"You stay right there, and I'll get you later before the guys come back,\" he laughed as he talked to his little victim on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped on his Adidas and walked out of the room to the beach.  About a half hour later, Eric still laying on the floor, began to move.  He was groaning and in great pain. The sneaker hadnt killed him, just knocked him unconcious.  It was hard for him to move at all.  He just looked around in confusion.  The room was dark, and he couldnt do a thing at the moment to help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door unlocked, and he could hear voices.  The door opened and in came a figure that he couldn't make out.  It was coming right toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have at least turned the light on when you came in Josh,\" Eric heard his brother Zak say.  It was good to hear his voice.  In that instant, Zak flipped the light on and to Eric's dismay he saw Josh walking above him.  Josh was wearing a pair of Nike Shox.  As Eric lay stunned, he watched in slow motion as Josh's left sneaker raised in the air targeting to fall right where Eric was. Eric watched the sneaker sole get closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh continued to walk into the room, his sneaker came down with a loud crunch on top of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what happens,\" Zak said.  \"What did you step on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned around and looked at the floor.  There was a small pile of goo stuck in the rug.  He lifted his Nike and looked at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww...gross,\" he said.  \"It was only a bug, and its guts are all stuck in my treads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it was nothing important,\" Zak said.  \"Yea it could have been a bottle of beer,\" James chuckled.  \"Kevin is gonna be pissed though that you got it and he didnt,\" Zak said as they all started to laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked outside and began wiping his sole on the ground.  Whatever was left of Eric, fell off from the treads and into the grass.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He opened the top drawer and overturned his sneaker.  Eric came toppling out, but had a soft landing as this drawer contained Kevins socks and underwear.  He came to rest on a pair of Kevins giant socks. He looked up to see his brothers face, and the faces of his friends looking down at him.  He felt the ground moving below him, and the light was quickly disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, stuck in there with your socks and underwear,\" Zak said.  \"Good thing you are gonna put it out of its misery later, I cant think of a worse place to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking Zak,\" James retorted.  \"The rank smell in your sneakers is enough to kill a damn horse, let alone that little thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all started to laugh as Eric was closed up inside the dresser.  He put his other shoe back on and they walked out of the room to get their beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sat in the dark drawer on top of the sock.  Contemplating how he was going to get out of this and remain alive to hopefully return himself to normal.  As his eyes adjusted to the dark, Eric looked around at his surroundings.  A few pairs of Kevins socks were on the left, where he was at the moment, and over on the other side looked to be some boxers.  Behind the boxers, Eric noticed a small patch of light coming through.  He made his way off the sock and stood in front of the boxers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boxers were nearly ten times his size.  Being so close to them was making Eric think of his boyfriend Tom.  He truly missed him at this moment, and hoped he would survive this to see him again.  Then he snapped back to the situation at hand.  Investigating that bit of light he had seen.  It was behind the boxers that laid before him.  It seemed the only way to reach his destination was to travel thru the boxers to the back of the drawer.  He picked a piece of the fabric near the leg hole and crawled in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even darker in here, and he could smell the musty scent of a man everywhere.  He countinued his journey along the fabric trail, until he finally ended up where he wanted to be.  He poked his head out of the waistband, and right in front of him was a small hole in the back of the dresser.  He didnt know how it got there, but it was big enough for him so squeeze thru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he had made his discovery, he heard noises and voices from outside.  He didnt know what to do.  Should he squeeze thru the hole and see about getting saved without getting squashed. Or should he try to hide in one of Kevins socks or boxers in the hopes that his brothers friend would think his next victim got away?</span></div></div>",

He prayed the roach trap would as least shelter him from a lethal amount of the dreaded poison.  The aroma from the sticky surface Eric was trapped in emitted a nauseating slightly sweet smell, no doubt to lure unsuspecting roaches to their doom.  Eric was exhausted, but he had to avoid laying down and becoming even more stuck.  Eric had an excellent view of the bathroom from the opening in the box.  He noticed another roach trap had been placed a couple feet away from the one he was in.  Eric was horrified as the deadly liquid covering the baseboard almost seemed to sizzle.

The half-inch tall man yelled at the roach in a futile attempt to scare it away, but the roach had no fear of the puny little man that was about a third its size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filthy roach crawled into the roach trap and became stuck right at the edge.  As the roach tried to break free, the entire box shook violently.  Eric held his hands up in disgust as roach whiskers brushed against him.  After a couple minutes, the roach broke free and fled the bug trap, leaving tiny Eric the sole prisoner of this horrible device.  No other roaches approached the roach trap.  Eric guessed that the roach had told all his friends of the danger.  Eric held his head down in despair as he realized he was punier than a common roach.  Eric heard the shuffling of the horrible roaches outside the box.  The poison seemed to have no effect on them.  Eric was helplessly trapped until the giants returned.

The nauseating ride in the giant exterminator's pocket had been quite traumatic for the trapped half-inch tall college Professor.  The terrifying gaze from that gargantuan eye of the mammoth exterminator haunted Eric's thoughts.  If only the giant had looked closer in the roach trap.  Or if only Eric had not gotten stuck on his back.  Maybe the exterminator would have noticed him, and not mistook him for a little roach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or hell, if only I had not jumped into this god-awful roach trap in the first place!\"  the meager man thought to himself.  \"I have got to....oh....yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had freed one of his arms from the sticky surface.  The stickiness of the surface of the trap was losing some of its potency.  Eric struggled with all his might, and lifted his other arm from the horrible glue-like substance.  Then he managed to sit up.  But as hard as the tiny man tried, he could not budge his legs from the gluey bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric very carefully slid out of his pants, trying desperately not to allow his bare skin to come in contact with the sticky bottom.  He was unstuck.  He stood on his pants, and looked at the opening of the trap that now seemed so far away.  He had to jump, but the tiny man would only get one chance.  If he did not clear the opening,  he would fall head-first onto the floor of the hideous roach-box.  There, he would be trapped until he was disposed of by a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric held his breath, got the tiniest of head starts, and jumped.  He landed with a thud just outside the roach trap.  He was free of the horrible cardboard bug prison.  But where was he?  Eric realized he was underneath some massive object.  The floor was dirty and greasy.  A plethora of noises filled the air.  He cautiously walked up and looked out from his relatively safe hiding place and gasped.  Eric was in the kitchen of a restaurant.  A very busy restaurant.  Eric stepped back as a giant busboy walked past him headed for the dish-washer.  And then another giant walked past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's stomach growled.  He was very hungry.  Maybe he would try to contact a giant for help later, but now he had to find nourishment.  He looked over and gazed at a food cart relatively close by.  The bottom shelf was full of different pies and cakes.  It would be difficult, but definitely possible to climb to the bottom shelf of the cart.  His mouth watered as he looked at the jumbo-sized deserts.  Without even watching for a giant, the tiny Professor sprinted for the desert-cart.  Eric stopped to catch his breath at the base of the cart, and then began his climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only about twenty minutes,  Eric made it to the bottom shelf containing the incredible pies and cakes.  He walked up in awe and was overwhelmed as he stood in front of a truly colossal chocolate pie.  He scaled the side of the massive pie and stood in triumph on the edge.  The bug-sized man bent over and scooped up a handful of luscious whipped cream mixed with a little chocolate.  Then a sudden jolt caused him to lose his balance, and he fell right into the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Suzie, how's about a piece of that delicious chocolate pie of yours?\"  the gruff looking construction worker asked the waitress.  \"And bring a couple slices for my buddies too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the mix proved to be similar to quick sand in the more that Eric struggled the more he sank. Before getting a chance to change his plan Eric felt a lurching movement, saw his slice fly skyward and land on a vast white landscape. \"If I can manage to pull myself over the edge...\" Eric began pulling himself towards the edge of his slice as the world started moving again he screamed figuring this pie wasn't going to have much longer to survive and he was now waist deep in the thick mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie after having quickly cut up the pie a regular named Jon and his friends had ordered carried the slices of the pie out to the three good looking' (in a rough neck sort of a way) construction workers and placed down the slices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hun.\" Jon's buddies Carl grinned at the waitress. <br>\r\n\"No problem Sug.\" She blushed placing down a very special slice in front of Jon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the construction workers around him talking now Eric continued to scream as he saw a fork raise sky high and descend towards the pie.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't be a permanent hiding place, but it would do for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake was turning to leave, his cell phone rang. It was one of his suppliers, calling to confirm an order of materials. Jake paced idly, kicking at loose stones as he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny lizard, a baby, barely an inch long clung to the wall of bricks, on the lookout for prey. It spotted the tiny professor scurrying towards the bricks and quickly left it's vantage point, wriggling its way across the hard dirt towards the tiny man, which would be barely a mouthful, but nourishing nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was nearing the safe refuge of the wall of bricks and feeling some relief when he saw a lizard, looking to him like a dragon hurl itself from the bricks and come writhing towards him. Eric stopped in his tracks and turned to run away, but the lizard grew closer and eventually snapped its mouth around him. Its tiny teeth held him tight with a painful pressure, but did not cut him. \"Oh God, this is the end,\" Eric thought, and then the lizard began to thrash its head from side to side to dispatch its prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile talking, Jake noticed the tiny scurrying lizard on the ground. He regarded any creature small enough to fit under his massive size 16s as a bug, and fit only to be pulverized, and this lizard's fate was no different. Without any thought, his steel-toed boot slammed down on the tiny creature, mashing it into a tiny bloodied mess which stuck to the sole of his boot. The phone call ended, and Jake put his phone in his pocket and strode off, without a further thought to the lizard under his heavy tread, and completely unaware of the tiny man he had just killed as well. A few steps later, and the lizard's corpse was left on the hard dirt, its guts ruptured out of its side and its mouth, its scales shining in the hot sun. Unnoticeable in the tiny spot of mess was the miniscule professor, flattened and caught up in entrails of the lizard.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each time he was jarred as the whole sandwich shook, accompanied by the crunch and smack of another bite taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after much squirming and a number of bites, Eric heard the loudest, and nearest, crunch yet. He froze and gasped as a wall of white appeared right in front of him. It pulled away and Eric could see he was right in front of the giant's lips. Every now and then the giant's lips would part and he would see the bite being tossed about and chewed to a pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the giant's jaw stopped its rhythmic movement. The lips tightened and Eric heard a gulp as the giant sent his food on its way. Eric cried out for help, expecting the burger to move forward. Instead a massive fry, as wide as an airplane's cabin, appeared from beneath his horizon. The ketchup dipped strip hovered near the mouth for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips parted and the tongue extended forward, as if nervous the food might escape. Eric could see chewed bits of bread, burger, and lettuce clinging to the tongue's surface. The fry was shoved forward and the entire length of it was forced inside the mouth, disappearing behind the lips effortlessly. Again Eric witnessed something so large be obliterated easily. He nearly peed his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett chewed thoughtfully on the fry.

Currently his possibilities were to be eaten by one giant or the other. Neither were good, and he had no control over the outcome anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cries out as the giant holding the burger raises him back up to his mouth. Obviously a decision has been made!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouth gapes open. Soggy bits of bread and burger mingle with piles of pale potato mush all over the tongue. The teeth glint in the light, contrasting well with the dark behind them. This only makes their sharp edges more obvious to Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" he wails as he moves towards this horrible scene. But the giant above, whom he does not even known, pays no heed to his meal. He doesn't notice the screams of this tiny extra topping. Nor does he think to check for a tiny person in his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric passes through the lips he is hit with a wall of stench and humidity, truly bringing home that he is inside a human mouth, about to be eaten. A wordless scream erupts from him, but it's too late as the teeth come together and Eric, along with the bite of burger are sealed from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant chews quickly. Eric is unable to do anything but scream as he is flung about, relying on dub luck to remain intact. He feels himself hit sharp edges, but always bounces away to have more food rained onto him and continuously be tortured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally everything stops. Before Eric can even move, the mushy pile of food is pushed to the back of the mouth. Eric barely discerns the uvula above as he passes it. He gasps to start screaming, but it gets caught in his throat as he violently entered Brett's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett swallows his burger. He is starting to feel full and will probably need a box. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he thinks \u201cthis will make a fantastic lunch tomorrow.\u201d He then focuses on Roger\u2019s story about a stray dog as he absently eats his fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric lands in the stomach after a rough ride down the esophagus. He is shocked. He is terrified. He is going to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last statement repeats through his mind. He will die at the hands (or more literally the stomach) of some random man enjoying a meaningless lunch. The thought angers the tiny professor. How could someone of his stature, of his intelligence meet such an insignificant and unnoticed end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you not notice me!? You ate a person, you complete oblivious idiot!!\u201d Eric yelled in frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me!!\u201d he screams as tears spring to his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo wrapped is Eric in his raging emotions, he doesn\u2019t notice the sounds of the giant around him chewing the fries. The sound of the gulp enters his subconscious and he stops yelling. He feels a sense of dread but is unsure why. Suddenly with a squelch he hears some fries from above entering the stomach. But the stomach had shifted and he watches the pile fall from above to rest nearby. He is stunned into silence, there is nothing more he can do but wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt defeated, it was his own fault. His determination and arrogance to beat science was the reason for being here. Some things weren\u2019t meant to be messed with. With that he leaned back and did his best to be comfortable for his last moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett finished eating his fries, boxed up his burger, and after saying good bye to Roger walked back to work. He didn\u2019t know that the motion of his walk buried Eric in his chewed food. He didn\u2019t think about the piles of soggy burger and fries sitting inside awaiting the acids. The feeling of fullness gave him the energy he needed to finish an important presentation he would give tomorrow. He paid no mind to the gurgles emitting from his gut as his stomach churned and broke his food down. As Brett drove home, he dreamed of a possible promotion if the presentation went well, oblivious that his lunch had almost all moved into his intestines to be further digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he thought about the lunch he had had, he didn\u2019t think of the burger. No, he thought about the conversation with Roger, or the friendly and cute waitress who usually served him there. Nothing terribly special about that afternoon. Or so he thought. No, Brett would remain unaware of what he had done by merely eating his lunch that day. His life went on like it always had, because for him, nothing had changed. But unfortunately for Eric, there was nothing left to change.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'After all this fighting, I'm still being eaten' is the only thought that crosses his mind. Ahead he can see the white teeth towering overhead and beyond them the pink tongue illuminated by the outside light. This only serves to make the bits of bread, lettuce, and beef spread across the tongue from the burger more apparent. \"NOOOOO!!!\" Eric cries out from instinctual fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the part of the sandwich he is riding enters the mouth, the light begins to fade quickly as Roger takes his next bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a brilliant scientist!!\" he wails in frustration when the light completely fades. \"Why is this happening?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can get any answer Roger starts to chew, throwing Eric's world into chaos. He screams as he is tossed about, no different from the hundreds and thousands of other crumbs trapped with him inside the giant's mouth. Though he bounces of molars a couple of times Eric is lucky enough to still be in one piece as Roger stops chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment of hesitation, in one swift movement Roger moves the clump of chewed food into his throat and easily swallows it. As Eric descends the esophagus with the food his mind simply cannot process what is happening. He simply stares and does nothing as he stares off reflecting on his life and loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food lands with a splat atop the chewed remains of what Roger had already swallowed, Eric suddenly focuses on the situation he is in. He starts screaming and runs off hoping to find a stomach wall to beat on. He needed to find a way out, there was no way he would end his life in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had enjoyed the burger, Roger decided he preferred his sandwich. He looked down and picked up the last piece. He was only halfway conscious of the food as he chewed and swallowed it. He put his hand over his extended stomach that now contained his entire sandwich and fries (as well as an unnoticed passenger). He enjoyed these lunches with his friend, whom he rarely saw otherwise due to their conflicting schedules. He said goodbye to Brett and got into his car to return to work. He vaguely wondered about the tickle he had felt in his stomach halfway through lunch that had stopped suddenly after he had swallowed another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it stopped, so it's obviously no big deal\" he said out-loud to himself. His stomach gurgled loudly. Roger smiled \"You agree!\" he laughed patting his comfortably full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was happy, and very satisfied with his life at that moment. It was a good thing he was unaware of the unconscious man trapped in a pile of chewed turkey and lettuce in his stomach. Such a realization would have horrified and disgusted Roger. But he had no way of knowing, no way to even suspect such a horrible thing had happened. He was pretty lucky that he was so ignorant of the goings on in his gut, because otherwise he wouldn't be smiling.</span></div></div>",

It almost looked hungry! What did exterminator's usually do with captured bugs? He screamed as suddenly the walls surronding him imploded into itself.

Eric stop struggling and prepared to wait it out when suddenly the black surface lit up and a horrible loud noise began playing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric covered his ears at the deafing noise played, and sceamed when the bag he was thrown in opened up revealing the masked face peering in at him. Suddenly a massive, strong gloved hand flew into the short space, and Eric felt his life get shorter as it rummaged around, almost throwing things into the air! Finally it reached the phone and an inch away from Eric's head a massive gloved wall of flesh crushed anything between it! However his luck finally ran out and the hand reached around and Eric saw a shadow as a massive hand wrapped around Eric...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the end...\" Thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the hand wrapped around his body but left his head exposed! The viscous goo had formed a sort of pressure cushion for Eric which stopped his body being quickly crushed, however he still felt intense pressure on his body and had to take shallow breaths. He felt himself rise hundreds of kilometers in the air and saw the imposing figure of the exterminator approach. Now that he wasn't in sudden danger he began taking in the deafing noise playing. It sounded like a ringtone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he was pressed against the tinted mask. He could still barely see anything, and it was quite intimidating having no idea what your captor looks like, however the hand backed away from the mask and the other flipped the visor up! Eric got a brief glimpse of the exterminator and he wasn't bad looking, not great and mostly average. Thick messy hair, a partially kept goatee and he had an almost natural sneer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he was forced moving into the exterminator's face and felt himself pressed against the rough goatee of the exterminator. Slobbers of spit struck Eric and he felt the dirty unkeep beard hair's scratch him. Thankfully he stayed stuck to the phone screen and watched the exterminator desperate to catch his attention. With a click the call ended and Eric thought he would be returned to the bag, however an eye suddenly was looking at him! Eric gasped in joy but was quickly shocked as a gloved hand wiped him off! He was stuck to the gloved hand! Wherever the exterminator touched next he would be deposited to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exterminator fumbled around for his phone, finally spotting it he grabbed it and answered it was his mate James! He wanted a drink at the pub and he happily accepted. Ending the call he noticed how dirty the screen of his phone was! He gave it a quick wipe and finally pulled into his home. Getting an itch he scratched...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were partly relieved, as it least it gave you a chance to focus rather than be distracted staring at the hairy titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around. The clothes were laid out neatly on the toilet, with the jeans drooping onto the ground. Perfect for climbing. If you could get onto the collar of his shirt - a long-sleeved polo shirt that looked spacious and comfortable - you might be able to get to his ear provided you kept a good grip.

The giant would be sure to brush his teeth eventually, even if he didn't do it right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Eric began the arduous climb up the giant's laid-out jeans. It was laughably easy to do, even as a novice climber, because the handholds were so plentiful and easy to find. Imagine, if you will, climbing a giant blanket. As the giant's huge voice and the roar of the shower continued, Eric reached the toilet lid. He made haste to the shirt, which was laid out on the back of the toilet and would allow him to climb to the top of it. He moved quickly, economically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the shower stopped. The room shook slightly as the giant stepped out, whistling a tune. Eric looked around and saw the enormous, hairy, handsome naked body in all its glory. A soft yet meaty dick hung between two large, toned thighs. The tiny scientist stopped, transfixed for a moment, before eventually snapping out of it as the god reached for the nearby towel. He could grab this shirt at any moment and shake Eric loose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric scrambled up to the top of the shirt and onto the shelf that ran along the wall of the bathroom, before sprinting across it, not wanting to look at the giant's movements lest he be transfixed again. Upon reaching the sink, Eric saw exactly what he wanted - the giant's toothbrush, lying right next to the tap. Manual. Eric praised this appropriately tiny stroke of luck and made for the toothbrush, the bristle section of which was twice as long as Eric was tall; a sobering reminder of just how miniscule he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to simply sit down on the toothbrush and wait. He made for the bristles and sat, facing the giant, willing the giant to brush his teeth after the long journey he'd had. In the time Eric had been running and jumping and sitting, the giant had dried off, replaced the towel and was just now pulling on the polo shirt to cover that magnificently hairy, forest-esque chest and torso up. There was a little pang of disappointment as you realized you'd missed the show - what was <i>wrong</i> with you? You shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the moment of truth. The giant put one magnificent hand to his face and blew into it before quickly breathing in with his nose. He was checking his own breath!</span></div></div>",

But Eric held on firm and tight, trying not to chicken out even when he saw the giant standing directly over him, the powerful gut at eye level. A huge, hairy and muscular arm reached over Eric and onto the shelf behind you, where he grabbed the toothpaste with one hand. With the other, the giant reached out for the toothbrush. Eric yelped again as that enormous, rough, muscular hand gripped the toothbrush and pulled it into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric almost immediately went flying off the toothbrush but was able to desperately grab the bristles as the brush reached up higher and higher and higher into the sky. \"HELP!\" Eric screamed out. \"HEEEEEEEELP!\" It felt completely futile, but if it helped even a little bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext would come the toothpaste.

He appreciated the contact and the care, even though being petted as if he were some tiny animal or curiosity was a little bit worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will help,\" he said, and suddenly the hand was - slowly, but still terrifyingly - on the move. The giant curled it around so Eric tumbled into the exact centre of the palm, a protective manoeuvre - or so Eric hoped. Before Eric could get his bearings he was being tipped - into the giant's ear! It was very clean having just been washed, so Eric grabbed one of the small hairs growing inside and yanked himself inside. It was big enough for him to feel securely lodged in and he could really see far into the cavernous appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, try now,\" breathed the giant.<br>\r\n\"CAN YOU HEAR ME?\"<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" came the sudden roar. \"I mean...yes. Speak quieter, though.\"<br>\r\nNot wanting to displease this god, Eric spoke at his normal voice and the giant could hear him fine. Eric told him everything that had happened, right up to getting stuck with the family at the motel and ending up here. In the meantime, the giant slowly moved onto his bed and lay down on it. \"Wow. That's quite a story, little man. You've really been through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tone of the giant had been friendly and understanding until now, but then he asked a question that chilled the little man to his very core.<br>\r\n\"So nobody else knows you're like this?\"<br>\r\nAn instinct screamed at you to lie, but that would contradict your story so far and this guy seemed sharp...and you were a little too in awe of him to lie anyway. So you went with the truth. \"No...they know I'm missing, maybe, but not like this.\"</span></div></div>",

Just want to talk a bit more first...not often you meet a cute little man sitting on your toothbrush,\" he said, and you could hear the wink in his voice.<br>\r\nDespite everything, Eric had to blush. \"You think I'm cute?\" he said into the cavernous ear.<br>\r\n\"Well you're such a little thing,\" said the giant. \"It'd be hard not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric laughed at this, the first time he'd done so since shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Don by the way.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, my assistant at the lab is called Don too! Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n\"You too, Eric.\" Don paused for a second, carefully considering his next question. \"So...how much did you see?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Eric, knowing exactly what he meant.<br>\r\n\"Before you got my attention...how much did you see?\"<br>\r\nAwkward. \"Well...I mean, I saw you. You're hard to miss. I saw your body, it's quite the jungle...and I saw the magazine...it nearly killed me actually!\"<br>\r\nDon chuckled, but it was obligatory - there was no actual humour in the laugh. \"So you know?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's OK, I am too.\"<br>\r\n\"You are? Cool. So you know about why I keep it a secret and-\"<br>\r\nIt was so odd to reassure such a titanic figure, but that's what Eric was doing. \"Don't worry...I don't even know your last name. Who am I ever going to tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon laughed. \"That is true...you're a good little man, you know that?\"<br>\r\n\"Well you're a good giant,\" you said with a broad smile. <br>\r\n\"Haha.

You're definitely the biggest.\"<br>\r\nDon gave a little laugh. \"That's nice to know, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground around Eric moved and shook as Don stretched out. Eric grabbed at the skin inside the ear to make sure he didn't fall, and Don yelped \"ow!\"<br>\r\nTurned out Eric had pinched the sensitive skin. \"Sorry!\" Eric said.<br>\r\nDon just laughed again. \"It's OK, I should be a bit more careful with you, little man. Mind if I take you out of there to have a proper look at you?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Eric was a bit nervous about being in that gigantic hand again, but he didn't think refusing this guy was very smart. \"Sure. Just be careful please.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Don.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the world turned upside down as Don moved his head to the side, and Eric - totally unprepared for such a sudden movement - fell out of the ear. He screamed for a split second, out of sheer surprise more than anything, before he found himself landing once again in the soft palm. He sighed with relief as Don gave that deep chuckle once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, little guy, I've got you.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly the hand began to move and Eric struggled to maintain his balance. Before he knew it he was standing on the hand staring straight into a big, beautiful brown eye, which was mere inches away from him. Eric could see every single detail, every imperfection, every fleck of black among the brown, the deep iris, the deep black pupil. In a way, it was a horrifying sight. But it was also strangely beautiful. \"Wow,\" Eric said to himself. <br>\r\nDon must have actually heard this, or was at least able to lipread it, because he replied, \"Wow to you. You really are the cutest thing I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\nEric blushed furiously and shouted. \"Oh, please, you wouldn't say that if it wasn't for the shrink ray.\"<br>\r\nClearly he was now used to the tone and pitch of the tiny voice as he was now able to just about hear Eric without having to put the tiny scientist in his ear. \"Maybe I would,\" Don said quietly. <br>\r\nEric blushed even more. \"Well, I can't say I'd use the word \"cute\" to describe you,\" he yelled.<br>\r\nThe eye narrowed slightly as Don laughed. \"No, I suppose not.\"<br>\r\n\"But handsome...I can say that instead.\"<br>\r\nNow Don blushed. Eric couldn't believe it, couldn't believe that he was eliciting this reaction from a figure a hundred times or more bigger than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared at each other for a moment, Eric looking into the brown eye and Don squinting, trying to read Eric's tiny face. Ultimately, though, Don prided himself as a man of action so he decided to take command of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like we both think the other one is pretty hot!\" he said, breaking the ice a little. \"So what do you want to do about it?\"<br>\r\nEric bit his lip. Don couldn't be thinking...that...could he? \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you're cute and brave. All things I look for. You obviously like me too... so what are we gonna do about it?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I-\"<br>\r\n\"Way I see it, we've got two choices,\" Don cut through Eric's stumbling. \"We could do something about it right now, but that might be a bit dangerous for you, and then when we're done I'll go get you fixed and we'll see where things go after that...or I can just go get you fixed right now. And <i>then</i>...we'll see where things go after that.\"<br>\r\nEric bit his lip even harder. There was a primal instinct urging him to pick a certain one of those two options.<br>\r\n\"What could I even do? I'm so small,\" Eric shouted, trying to combat his urges with some rationality.<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Don laughed deeply, even a little darkly, and that made Eric shudder with a combination of fear and excitement. \"I can think of a few things... but the choice is yours, Eric. Honestly. You want to get back to normal size right now, we can do it. But this feels like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to me.\"</span></div></div>",

You could do whatever you want,\" Eric pointed out.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" came the reply, and the simple acknowledgement of his own massive power sent an aroused shiver up Eric's spine. \"But where's the fun in that? You've got to want it too.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess. Anyway, yes, it's a yes...what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge gust of air came from beneath you as Don gave a huge sigh of anticipation, like he was mentally preparing himself. \"This is going to be fun, little man... hold on a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the hand moved again, the sequoia-esque fingers curling around Eric to protect him. Before Eric could situate himself the hand was tilting and Eric helplessly slid off it, landing hard on...something solid. The solid wood bedside table. Eric looked up at Don to find the giant dad squinting at him, checking he was OK, so Eric responded with a thumbs up rather than attempting speech. Don nodded and got out of bed, causing a great gust of wind that Eric struggled to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Don was stood over him, staring down at Eric with an intensity that made him flinch. Don removed the polo shirt, exposing once again the gloriously hairy torso, and then his jeans. In no time at all he was stood over Eric, looming over him, wearing nothing but a pair of boxer shorts. Don took a step forward so he was standing directly over Eric, completely dominating the tiny man. Eric tried to take it all in but it was impossible, the behemoth was all-encompassing. Eric revelled in the big thighs and the shape of the large, meaty dick that could clearly be made out through the boxers - helped by the fact that it was beginning to grow. He stared up at Don. What would Don do first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don's hairy, muscular gut was almost directly over him and he almost whimpered in fear, completely overwhelmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment was over in a flash, though, as Don began to move carefully back onto the bed, lying flat on his back. You struggled to resist the air currents his gigantic form created as he got comfortable. You turned to stare at him quizzically, not bothering to say anything as there was no chance he'd hear you from this distance. From out of nowhere, his hand shot past Eric and landed behind him. He turned to stare at it, taking in every groove, every line, every whorl on the skin. The hand itself was the size of a townhouse itself, and it suddenly moved towards Eric, who yelled out. The movement was gentle and slow, however, and the little man felt no pain as he was swept from the bedside table like a piece of lint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have time to realize he'd reached the edge of the desk before he fell off it and right into Don's other meaty paw, which closed around him almost instantly. Eric was trapped in the centre of the palm again, with no idea where he was going. It was a very short trip. The hand opened and tilted, with Eric again helplessly sliding off and falling into...a forest. A forest that was moving up and down very slowly. A forest with an unmistakable heartbeat. A forest which was warm to the touch and solid, almost solid as a rock. Eric was standing on Don's gigantic pecs, near the left nipple, the chest hairs nestling in around him to the point the tiny scientist wondered if he was even visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation was now completely out of Eric's control, but he was OK with that. It never really had been in his control in the first place. Suddenly light shone all around him, as Don used one of the enormous hands to flick on the bedside lamp. Eric craned his neck up to see Don looking down at the chest as best he could. They made eye contact, but Eric wondered if it was real eye contact - if Don could even see that Eric was looking right at him. Then he spoke in a low, excited whisper, and Eric actually felt the voice vibrate powerfully through the diaphragm. It was awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be able to hear a peep from you, little man. I can barely even feel you right now. So it's better if you just do exactly what I say. Alright? Jump once for yes, twice for no.\"<br>\r\nEric jumped, brushing through the thick bush of chest hairs and landing on the chest with a hard thud. He did not jump a second time. There was a small chuckle, which nearly caused Eric to fall over.<br>\r\n\"Alright, I felt that...kind of,\" Don whispered. \"Have some fun on my big, beautiful, hairy body, little man. Play with my nipples, with anything you like. I'll give you...15 minutes.\" He reached for his phone and set a timer. \"Once the timer goes off, I'll give you 5 minutes to get into my bellybutton and we'll do something else. Jump once if you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgog at the commanding tone Don had adopted, Eric jumped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. And oh...\" Don added, with a sly, domineering smile. \"You'd better make that 15 minutes good for me, too...little man.\" He moved his arms behind his head, exposing his pits - nice and clean after his shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thrill of fear ran through the tiny scientist yet again. Eric wasn't sure if this was just Don getting into role or if he was actually starting to enjoy the power a bit too much. He supposed that was part of the appeal, and it was certainly working. It made Eric more aroused than ever...and more determined to impress the giant Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he had 15 minutes. Where did he start?</span></div></div>",

He immediately rubbed it, massaged it, but the booming voice overhead said, \"you'll have to try harder than that,\" before giving a chuckle that nearly shook Eric clean off the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist upped the ante, rubbing harder, and a small \"mmmmm\", vibrating through the giant diaphragm, told Eric that it was working. Then he bit the nipple, which was the same size as he was, and Don gave a short, sharp gasp. \"Oh man,\" breathed the giant. \"That's a shock...do that again.\" So Eric nipped it even harder. Don's legs audibly kicked up into the air, a combination of sharp pain and arrival coursing through him. Now Eric rubbed his entire body into the nipple, really going to town on it, and Don's heartbeat accelerated as he breathed harder and harder, enjoying the power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're good at this, little man...really good,\" boomed the voice again as Eric stopped, nipping the nipple one more time before crossing to the other one and repeating the process. Don shivered in excitement. Eric was just about done when a loud phone alarm filled the room.

You were brought inexorably towards it, but slowly - Don clearly knew that too much centrifugal force would throw you off, even if his saliva did serve as a powerful adhesive to you. You were moved slowly over his body, giving you an almost bird's-eye view of the forest of hair you had been in a moment ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked ahead and marvelled at the enormous dick, a tower in a thick bush of hair. Even in proportion to a giant, it was a huge thing, uncut and standing to rigid attention, not far from the navel you had just inhabited. You took a deep breath, allowing yourself to take in this moment of anticipation and excitement. All you could smell, almost feel, was Don's natural masculine scent. This was going to be a quasi-religious experience. It already was, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Don's other hand appeared out of nowhere and grasped the fleshy tower hard, pumping it up and down a little. He let go for a moment and your eyes widened as you saw it grow even larger, which you had thought was impossible. You didn't want to guess as to its size but it was like a skyscraper, a tower, to you. Maybe it was 7 or 8 inches, but you didn't know or care for precise measurements. The other hand of god returned, holding it completely upright. You felt Don give a short, excited sigh behind you as your journey finally drew to a close. Delicately you were brought right up to the pink, fleshy tip of the dick, which emanated heat and the most unbelievable smell you had ever known. Your own dick - which you were pretty sure Don couldn't even see - was pulsating, rock hard without you even needing to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger went just past the head and stopped, so the middle of it was resting on the head, near the slit, and then slowly, gently, dragged back. Inevitably you were caught in it and before you knew it you were ON it, brushed onto the pink, fleshy mountain that itself was the size of a small house. You were flat, lying prone on it, pressed right into the soft surface. You licked it and took in the scent, hugging the salty skin tightly both in reverence and to ensure you didn't lose your place atop this erotic mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" boomed Don from miles away. \"That feels incredible, little man.\" His voice reverberated around the room and you gave a squirm of pleasure as you felt, <i>heard</i>, blood rushing through the dick. The heat emanating from the member was unreal, like being in a sauna, but you were fine with that. It couldn't possibly be as hot as you were feeling inside. You pulled yourself towards the slit, which was almost like the source of the smell, and put your arms on either side of the opening, dangled your feet over the far side and lowered yourself half-in. Your arms and legs kept you inside, but your back and ass were sinking into the abyss beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Don watching you studiously,  staring, then a movement - Don was grabbing his phone from his bedside table. Without moving the dick - still held fast by his other hand - Don brought the phone close to you. You could no longer see Don, instead you could see the camera of the gigantic phone. \"Just zooming in so I can see ya,\" Don growled. You were impressed - why hadn't you thought of that before? \"You look just perfect there.\" You felt his whole body shudder in excitement as you waved at the camera, which moved away. \"Perfect,\" he growled again, staring at you with lustful eyes. Your surroundings suddenly grew dark, then suddenly light again, then dark - shadow cast by the foreskin, which rose to surround you and then withdrew, rose and withdrew, rose and withdrew in a perfect rhythm. Don was pumping his cock again, slowly so as not to disturb you too much. He exhaled hugely. \"Fuck,\" he growled. You were completely at Don't mercy, obviously, but now that seemed insufficient. You felt almost beneath the mercy of this being in its entirety. You were at the mercy of his dick. Don himself was beyond such petty matters. You felt like you could only be at the mercy of individual parts of this god, not his entire being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon's other hand moved towards the tool. Another body part to be at the mercy of. What was his plan?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think I know just where to put you to keep you safe,\" Don said in a voice so husky that you weren't at all convinced that your \"safety\" was a priority for him. But it was too late for second thoughts now! Don's enormous finger from his other hand approached you with exquisite care and gently touched your back. You followed his lead and pulled yourself up and out of his slit. You briefly tumbled down the fleshy head before the combination of precum, sweat and saliva stuck you fast to it. You lay there, almost upright but completely adhere to the cockhead, staring straight ahead at the giant who well and truly controlled your fate. The finger returned, this time gently pushing you down the warm cockhead until you reached its bottom edge. You thought you would fall, but before you dropped off it the huge hand stretched the thick foreskin out and way from the head, creating a hot, sweaty basket for you to fall directly into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did, and in doing so fell into another dimension. You were now stuck in the between the giant's massive, sweaty cockhead and the giant's massive, sweaty foreskin. You felt a finger press down on the skin above you, pushing you right into the head. You couldn't even speak; the process had been so quick, so efficient, that you were caught in a whirlwind of arousal and bodily fluids that amounted to an intense out of body experience impossible to describe. Suddenly the temperature rose even further as Don gave an omnipotent moan of arousal and began to gently pump the dick up and down. You were now adhered to the foreskin itself, so you simply rolled back and forth over the giant's cockhead, a thumb keeping you in place as he growled. Such was the speed of movement and the arousal and knowledge of where you were, you couldn't help but explode with cum - plentifully and aggressively, though you doubted Don would even notice compared to the volcanic eruption he was about to set forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck YEAH!\" he called as he gripped his dick more harshly, loving every second of the power he was feeling. He could actually feel you squirming, licking, moving against his foreskin and cockhead and it was sending him crazy. With his other hand now free he gripped the bedsheets so hard his knuckles turned white, as he wanted to make this feeling last for as long as possible. The pumping grew more aggressive, then less aggressive. You realised that Don was starting to lose focus on your safety as the thumb threatened to squash you into a red paste on his foreskin. You wondered if he would even care. It was just starting to get really painful when the rushing noises you could hear inside his dick reached a fever pitch as a new substance surged up through the middle. You couldn't really look up due to what was going on, but for a moment the penis reached a new level of hardness before softening slightly as cum exploded out of the dick, shooting straight up and well above you. You wondered if it would even hit the ceiling, such was the totality of Don's orgasm. He gave a roar of satisfaction as he exploded and you wondered if it was just a roar to you or if he was actually about to wake both his neighbors as well as the other occupants of the house. Regardless, Don kept pumping for several seconds after the explosion and the cum kept flowing, albeit slower. But slower meant it didn't travel as far and, eventually, it only barely escaped, sliding down towards you. Don laughed as he manipulated the dick one more time, rolling you up onto the pink head and, as a result, rolling you in his thick seed. Despite your recent orgasm you revelled in it a little, licking up some, aware that this was a unique opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Don removed his hand from the dick, letting it and you hurtle towards his hairy belly, which was dotted here and there with pools of the white stuff. You rolled off and into a patch of hairs, before rolling into his navel where you rested. \"Get to the navel...\" Don whispered almost listlessly, as if practical matters were not something at that moment he was interested in. It was sweet, you supposed, that even in a state of apparently total satisfaction and euphoria that Don cared about your well-being. \"I'll fish you out in a minute,\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you climbed into the giant navel, which was harder than last time as it was now heaving up and down aggressively due to the giant's exertions. But you soon tumbled inside and closed your eyes, surrounded by the giant's thunderous panting and the warmth of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon - though longer than a minute - the finger returned, adhering you to the tip one more time and carrying you effortlessly to his face. You hurtled through the air until confronted with the bearded visage of Don, your new god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, that was unbelievable,\" he breathed. \"That was the best sex I ever had. Hands down. I didn't realise I would enjoy being a giant so much but the way you squirmed against my head was fucking <i>incredible</i>, little man.\"<br>\r\nExhausted, you simply gave him a thumbs up in agreement and he laughed.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess that took more out of you than it did me, huh?\"<br>\r\nYou gave another thumbs up in agreement.<br>\r\n\"Well...\" he said.</span></div></div>",

Eric landed safely, however, in the hand of the gigantic man, which suddenly moved so Eric was staring at the face, which seemed almost planet-sized as it leered down at the tiny scientist with a huge, excited grin.<br>\r\n\"You're mine, little man. A little pet human? Nobody else in the world could have something like that. And you thought I'd want to change you back?\" his smile grew even wider. \"No. You're <i>mine</i>,\" he repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, Eric was hyperventilating in sheer panic. The fist had closed around him, trapping him in darkness as the huge dad stomped around the house, preparing a tiny prison in the form of a small tupperware container that he taped the lid of before punching air holes in the side. Now they were back in the bedroom, with Eric rattling helplessly around inside as the giant stood over his bed, staring into the container with that same, almost maniacal grin. \"I think you'll be at home in there,\" he  said quietly. \"You'd better be, you'll be there a long time...\" there was a quiver of excitement in the voice as it decided your fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he carried the container - and Eric - into bed with him. \"I'm gonna take a nap, little Eric. Maybe when I wake up we'll talk about the future. Can't wait,\" he said as he yawned hugely.  He held the container to his chest, giving Eric an extremely close-up, almost worm's-eye view of the hairy forest that spread over his abs and pecs.  \"The name's Don, by the way,\" came the voice one last time before the lights went out. The tupperware was on its side and Eric approached the lid, but it was pointless. He wasn't strong enough to prise open the taped lid, and he wasn't even small enough to get through the air holes. He was well and truly trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting this guy's attention had been a very bad decision. </span></div></div>",

He looked up to see Dan coming back his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan walked back to the washing machine.  He had forgotten his cell phone on the shelf above.  Down below,  his skater sneaker came inches away from crushing Eric.  After his close call, Eric stood there looking at Dan's massive sneaker in front of him.  Dan grabbed his phone and was ready to leave the room.  In that instant, Eric decided to take a leap of faith and jumped ontop of Dan's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan started walking away. Eric latched onto the shoelace near the tongue, and held on tight for the ride of his life.  Keeping his grip he was bounced around on the top of the sneaker as Dan continued walking.  Dan walked into a room and shut the door.  Eric guessed this was his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stood there for a few minutes looking for something.  This gave Eric the opportunity to relax his grip and start moving a little closer to Dan.  He made it up to Dan's sock, when Dan suddenly decided to kick off his sneaks.  Eric tried to hold onto the fabric, but it was too late.  He began to slide down into the depths of Dan's sneaker as his foot slid out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric landed with a bump on the warm insole of the sneaker.  Having already had his fill of being stuck in smelly sneakers, the smell inside a teenagers shoe was much worse.  Outside, Dan plopped onto his bed with his phone and called his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the smelly skate shoe, Eric began to wonder what he was going to do next.  Just then, he heard the door swing open and another voice.  It was Frank.  Dan began yelling at Frank that he was on the phone and to get out.  Frank was asking if he could borrow his brothers sneakers.  They happend to wear the same size, and usually borrowed from each other every so often.  Paying little attention, Dan agreed and continued talking to his girlfriend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt footsteps coming his way, and watched as fingers entered inside the shoe.  He lost his balance as they began to move up and he rolled down to the toe section, as they were tilted back.  Eric was bounced around again inside the shoe.  Eventually the movement stopped and he felt the shoe lower down and come to rest on the floor.  He was just about ready to head toward the back of the shoe, when it became dark and he saw a sock clad foot moving his way.  He ran again to the front of the shoe.  He went as far up as he could, and turned around.  Just in time to come face to face, or as the case may be, face to Frank's foot as it pinned him in place.  Frank's foot came to rest, and he flexed his toes.  The fabric from the sock rubbed up and down Eric's face.  Eric thought to himself what next?</span></div></div>",

He lowered his massive sneaker to the floor and quickly tilted the opening upside down in an effort to dump out the unwanted pest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was terrified as he was thrown violently about the massive sneaker by some unknown giant friend of his brother Zac.  The meager little man's frantic screams for help went unnoticed by the four gargantuan young men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac held up his last can of beer in order to guzzle down the few remaining drops, unaware of the gruesome fate about the befall his older brother at the foot of one of his buddies.  Though irresponsible and sometimes lazy, Zac loved his older brother.  His brother had gotten Zac out of a lot of jams in the past.  But how was Zac to know his shrunken brother had stowed away in his shoe all the way to the beach and was now about to be dumped out of his buddy Kevin's shoe and squashed to death like an insignificant little bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's Adidas sneaker lurched upside down and Eric fell to the dirty tile floor.  The bug-sized man was briefly stunned by the considerable fall, but when he looked up at the sinister expression of giant Kevin, Eric was shocked back into his nightmarish reality.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny Professor continued his cries for help.  He waved his arms at the titanic young man standing in front of him and pleaded for his life.  He saw his little brother Zac outside the bathroom and screamed for help.  But Eric's faint screams were indiscernible to the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn bug,\"  Kevin mumbled under his breath as he reached over to turn the bathroom light on.  \"I'm going to take care of you.  You won't be crawling in no shoes no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin flicked the switch and nothing.  The light had burned out.  Only the dim lights of the hotel room carried slightly into the bathroom.  \"Fucking rat-hole,\"  Kevin exclaimed as he toggled the switch a few times.  The other guys just laughed at Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stomp that damn bug and let's go,\" pleaded James.  \"We'll stop by the office and tell them about the burned out light before we head to the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin looked down with disgust at the bug sized shadowy creature below him, and then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eric saw this, he sensed his impending doom and stopped screaming and waving at the giant.  The little man quickly looked around and surveyed the darkened room in an effort to plan an escape route.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Eric was horrified as Kevin raised his enormous sneaker directly over him and hesitated for just a second.  Eric ran for his life.  The hideously large sneaker crashed down on the bathroom floor with a violent crash.  A combination of the slight darkness and Kevin's small hesitation enabled the bug-sized Professor to narrowly escape a revolting death.  But Kevin was relentless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I missed,\" Kevin said in disappointment as he saw the small shadowy creature running in the direction of the darkest end of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stomped again, and missed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see shit in here,\"  exclaimed Kevin as he stood and continued to stomp with his Adidas sneaker on one foot, and holding the other sneaker in his hand.  \"I'm not staying in this room with a damn bug running around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now, we'll take care of the bug when we get back,\" Zac demanded and then looked over and whispered to Josh,  \"It's probably not the only bug in this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled and nodded in agreement.  Kevin gave in and ended his pursuit of the obnoxious bug.  He put on his remaining sneaker, and headed out with the guys.  He was visibly pissed about not killing the bug.  He just silently fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric breathed a sigh of relief as he watched monster-like Kevin and the other hulking young men leave the hotel room.  But his fight for his very life left him completely exhausted.  Back in the darkened bathroom he laid down on the tiled floor and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac stopped at the office and informed the clerk of the burned out light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We will see ya when we get back.  If that bug should happen to show itself, save it.  We have a little unfinished business\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bug?,\" the clerk broke into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I found it in my shoe back in the room,\" Kevin said.  \"Im gonna take care of it though.  But you should really get someone into this dump to spray for those pests.  I really hate them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys walked out of the office.  Kevin, James, and Josh, went to the truck.  Zak headed back to the room preparing to replace the bulb in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak got back to the room and walked into the dark bathroom.  Eric still passed out on the floor didnt hear or notice his younger brother come in.  The light was just a little too high, so Zak went into the other room to get a chair to stand on.  As he drug the chair in, the loud noise on the tile floor startled Eric out of his sleep.  There was just enough light coming in from the other room that when Eric jumped to his feet, a large letter N was staring him in the face.  He recognized it immediately as his brothers New Balance sneaker.  He went to reach for it, but just as he did it raised up into the air out of sight.  He looked way up into the darkness and was barely able to make out the silhouette of his brother standing on a chair high above.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realized he must be replacing the light that didnt work before when Kevin was trying to squash him.  With a few twists, Zak had the old bulb out and the new one in.  Eric just stood in awe looking at his brother high above.  Maybe since he was alone without crazy Kevin around, he could get his brothers attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak finished up, but instead of stepping off the chair he jumped down.  He landed on the floor with a thump.  The impact caused a tremor on the floor for Eric, that knocked him off his feet.  He was getting back to his feet, when he was suddenly blinded by the bathroom light.  Zak had walked over and turned it on.  Eric put his hands up to try and block it, but it didnt help.  After a few seconds he lowered his hands and his eyes adjusted.  He was standing near one of the legs of the chair.  He looked up to see his younger brother towering above.  Zak walked over and took hold of the chair.  He started to move it and happend to glance down at the floor when he did.  Eric saw this and began yelling and waving his hands.  Zak moved in a little closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there you are you little bugger,\" he said. \"Stay right where you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric continued trying to get his brothers attention.  He was just too small to hear his screams for help.  He watched his brother walk over to the sink and pick something up.  Eric was just too intent on getting to his brother he didnt realize what was going on.  Zak grabbed a cup off the sink and was coming back over to Eric.  To his dismay, Zak lowered the cup over top of Eric and trapped him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin will be happy I found you little bug,\" Zak said.  \"We would not have heard the end of it if he missed the chance to finally squash you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak lowered himself to look inside the cup at Eric.  Eric was beating on the cup. The nightmare that was happening was making him go hysterical.  He didnt wanna die.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, you are a strange looking little thing,\" Zak said inspecting his little prisoner inside the cup.  \"I feel sorry for ya little guy.  Kevin is not gonna show you any mercy.  I guarantee it will be quick though, so it shouldnt be too bad I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric just looked into his brothers eyes thru the cup. \"Its me Zak, Eric,\" he pleaded.  \"Dont let me die....please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you stay put little guy,\" Zak said in a semi sweet kind of way.  \"They will be back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thing that Eric wanted to hear.  He watched his brother get to his feet and exit the bathroom, turning off the light.  Eric just sat there, waiting his impending fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later, Eric heard voices from the other room.  They were back.  He could hear Zak saying something to the effect of I found it.  Then he could hear Kevin asking where, as he heard footsteps coming his way.  The light came on, and he saw his brother first.  His huge New Balance sneakers passing by Eric and his small prison.  Next came Kevin.  For added effect, Kevin stomped down hard with each step he took.<br>\r\nThe two other guys stood in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it after I changed the light bulb,\" Zak said to Kevin.  \"I trapped it under the cup for you to take care of.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing you did,\" Kevin said.  \"I have a little payback to administer with the help of my size 11 Adidas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit your yapping and just get it over with,\" James chimed in.  Josh nodded his head in agreement.  \"Yea, show it whos's boss already, so we can go drink our brews.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin took his sneaker and kicked the cup off of Eric.  Eric watched as Kevin raised his foot into the air and brought it over top of him.  As it started to come down toward him, Eric took of running toward the door where Josh and James were.  Kevins foot came down with a bang.  Missing Eric again.  As Eric got closer to the other guys, Josh brought his foot down right in Erics path.  Eric stopped short.  He turned around and was running back in the direction of Kevin.  He watched as Kevin raised his foot again, and as Eric ran under him, the foot lowered again with a crash. Another miss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was now running toward Zak.  His brother was his only chance left.  He was yelling and waving his arms back and fourth in hopes his brother would finally notice.  As he got closer to Zak he watched as his New Balance raised off the floor.  Just as he got within a few inches of Zak, the sneaker came flying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Eric saw were the worn treads of his brothers sneaker as it came down on top of him.  With a loud crunch, Zak's sneaker came to rest on the tile floor, and on top of what was left of his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do that for,\" Kevin sneered.  \"That little shit was mine.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didnt have all night for you to show how macho you are over a little measly bug,\" Zak retorted.  \"It was coming right at me like it knew me.  Guess I just have better aim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all started laughing at that.  \"You sure its dead Zak,\" James questioned.  Zak looked down to his sneaker and twisted it back and fourth on the tile floor.  Grinding it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is now man,\" Zak chuckled.  \"Now lets go have a damn beer.\"  \"Hell yea,\" they all replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remained of Zaks older brother was a spot on the tile floor along with some goo still stuck in the treads of his sneaker.  </span></div></div>",

The gigantic work-boots continued their random movement around the sleeping tiny man, Eric somehow lucky enough to not be crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worn dirty heels raised high into the air, just inches from the vulnerable teensy-tiny Professor.  Then suddenly the room was filled with bright light, and the gargantuan heels came crashing back down to the bathroom floor with a bone-jarring thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats got it,\" the Handyman said to himself quite satisfied with his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the Handyman was about to leave, he looked down and noticed a small creature next to one of his massive work-boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA violent crash and sudden intense light startled little Eric awake.  He looked up in complete awe at the colossal god-like giant that loomed high over him.  And then he could not help but notice the threateningly huge work-boots directly in front on him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the giant looked down at tiny Eric and he was petrified with fear.  Before he could move, and before he could even scream, the appalling whopper of a boot lifted just slightly off the ground, hovering.  Then, in an instant, the nightmarish boot was right on top of the bug-sized man.  Time seemed to freeze.  The next three seconds seemed like minutes.  And then it was all over.  The giant casually stomped down, creating an insignificant crunch, barely audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Handyman took a small piece of toilet paper from the roll, and wiped the tiny smear off his work-boot.  He tossed it in the toilet, flushed, and headed back to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you take care of the burned out light in 17?\" the clerk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no problem,\" the Handyman replied.  \"And we've got to do something about all the bugs around here.

All that hard work paid off after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay removed his work-boots after a long day's work at the Hotel and noticed the little red smear on the bottom of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck!\", he thought to himself, and then plopped down in his easy chair to watch some TV.</span></div></div>",

Bruised and battered, the tiny man limped as fast as he could in an effort to escape the crushing tire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Eric managed to move just out of the way of the life-ending mass of black rubber.  The Geo Tracker whizzed by him, creating a whirlwind that blew the pitiful little Professor backwards about ten feet.  And in an instant,  Eric's brother Zac and his buddies were gone.  The helpless half-inch tall man had been left, stranded in the parking lot of run down hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked up in awe at a colossal red pick-up truck that was parked in the space next to him.<br>\r\nThe tiny man was frustrated.  Even the curb was about fifty foot high.  He had no idea what to do, or where to go.  He was so out in the open and vulnerable.  Any kind of shelter seemed miles away.  The tiny man soon began to realize he was in big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt the ground begin to rumble, and heard thunderous voices that seemed to be getting closer and closer.  He was getting very scared.  He was terrified when he turned and looked in the direction of the voices.  Two pairs of enormous, house sized boots were heading right for him.  Above the boots were two giants that chilled the bug-sized man to the bone.  Eric looked around frantically for some shelter, but there was none.  And the four all-powerful crushing forces were just about on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Rusty had checked into the hotel a bit late and were ready to do some fishing and drinking, not necessarily in that order.  The two self-described rednecks were in their late twenties, and both guys were pretty buff, since they worked construction.  They loved to fish and they loved to drink even more.  They got away whenever they could, and this beach was a cheap place to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guys headed out for Rusty's red pick-up truck, trying to carry all their necessities to the truck in one trip.  Arms loaded with a cooler of beer, a tackle box, and fishing rods,  the two buddies stumbled their way in the direction of the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to that secluded spot on the back water,\"  Jack told Rusty as he approached the curb of the parking lot.  \"We had a lot of luck there last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\"  Rusty replied.  \" Let's just ah oh no aaah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRusty failed to notice the approaching curb, stumbled and fell to the hard pavement.  The tackle box he was carrying hit the ground, and all the contents went flying out onto the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit Rusty, are you all right?\"  Jack asked as he reached out his hand to pull his buddy back up.  \"You should watch where you are going, you damn drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, just help me get everything back into this tackle box, and let's get out of here,\"  Rusty said with a frustrated tone.  \"Oh hell, the bait can came open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric screamed as he saw the giant topple to the ground,  seeming to come right down on him.  Eric just missed being crushed to oblivion by the falling behemoth.  The box the giant was carrying hit the ground with a crash, and flung open, scattering its giant contents all around the bug-sized man.  A giant metal can landed with a crash right next to Eric, and the lid had fallen off.  Black moist dirt from the strange can surrounded the tiny man, and he found himself covered in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was repulsed and terrified as he saw a gruesome monster emerge from the black dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, a giant worm!\"  Eric screamed as the hideous creature brushed the side of him, leaving a horrible, sticky residue.  \"Somebody please help me.  Get me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked around in horror and saw giant worms all around him.  And then a far worse horror appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric screamed pathetically as a gigantic hand descended from the vast sky and began to scoop up the black dirt and hideous worms back into the metal can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man's screams were to no avail as the enormous hand also scooped him up with the rest of the worms.  Eric found himself in the bottom of the horrible metal can, surrounded by moist black dirt and hideous giant worms.  Just when the bait-sized man thought it could not get any worse, everything went pitch black.  And then he felt another worm brush up against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, thats got it,\"  Rusty exclaimed as he scooped up the last of the bait into the can and tightly screwed on the top.  \"Let's jet.\"</span></div></div>",

Jack cranked up the local country station, and the two men chatted about the upcoming Nascar race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was repulsed by the sticky residue left by the horrible worms as they continuously brushed up against him.  In the darkness, he tried to find a spot in the horrid can away from the nasty creatures, but there were just too many of them.  The shrunken Professor tried to wipe off the disgusting worm fluids, but it was like super-glue, and it was also causing the black dirt that surrounded him to stick to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the horrible giant worms seemed to settle down, giving Eric a chance to rest and ponder this new nightmarish reality he found himself in.  Eric thought to himself that once the giants opened the can and saw him, he would be saved.  They would surely help him.  Eric tried once again to brush some of the dirt off his body, but gave up from pure exhaustion.  The super-tiny man wondered what the giants would think when they looked into the can and saw him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a frightful thought came to Eric's mind, but it was just too horrible to even consider.  The tiny man tried to brush it aside and think more positive thoughts.  \"Surely they will recognize that I am a person,\" Eric hoped.  He then tried with a renewed vigor to remove some of the dirt stuck to him, in hopes to look more humanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRusty turned down a dirt road and pulled up to an old forgotten pier, at the end of a back-water channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally here,\"  Jack sighed, and grabbed the beer and his fishing rod, and walked to the edge of the wooden plank pier.  \"Come on slow-poke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRusty followed with the tackle box and his fishing rod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only fair that I give you a head start,\"  Rusty said with a chuckle.  He sat down next to Jack at the end of the pier and danged his feet over the side.  \"Hand me a brew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men had finished their first beer before Rusty opened the tackle box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll use a float today,\"  Rusty said, as he reached into the tackle box.  He began to attach the red and white float just above the hook on his fishing rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\"  Jack said.  \"Just hand me the bait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even looking,  Jack opened the bait can and reached inside.  He firmly gripped one of the worms between his thumb and forefinger and proceeded to bait his hook.  The worm thrashed violently as the dagger-like hook was thrust through its body.  Jack handed the bait can back to Rusty, cast his line, and opened another beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was startled by the bright light that flooded the metal can when the top was removed.  He looked up and saw the giant, but the colossal man did not even glance at him.  \"Please help me,\" little Eric screamed as loud as he could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the giant man started to reach into the can.  Eric was horrified as the intimidating giant fingers searched the can randomly for an object to grab hold of.  The menacing fingers brushed against him, but just when Eric thought he was about to be grabbed, the fingers firmly pinched a worm next to him, and lifted it out of the can high into the air.  Eric heard the worm seem to cry out in pain as the powerful fingers squeezed and lifted the helpless doomed creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched in horror as the giant effortlessly jabbed his fish hook into the unlucky worm.  Suddenly, the can shifted, and Eric looked up to see a different giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Jack, Rusty had so much practice, he could bait his hook with his eyes closed.  He reached into the bait can, and firmly grabbed hold of what he thought was a worm.  In a matter of seconds, he attached the bait to his hook and cast his line.  He could see the float bob along in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric screamed as this new set of giant fingers firmly grabbed him and lifted him towards the horrible fish-hook.  The giant had not even looked at him while attaching him to the horrible razor-sharp fish-hook.  Eric thought it was over, but the hook had not pierced his body.  It had just caught hold of his clothes.  Just as Eric considered his good luck, he was thrust with great velocity through the air.  He was flying, but he sure didn't feel like Superman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric landed with a tiny plop and submerged into the water.  He tried swimming to the surface, but the the hook he was attached to was just too heavy.  He managed to pull himself up by the fishing line.  Eric gasped for air when he reached the surface.  Suddenly, the float began to move along in the water, pulling the tiny man with it.  Rusty was slowly pulling the line in an effort to attract the fish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to get free of the horrible fish-hook, but it was attached too thoroughly throughout his shirt and pants.  Then Eric looked down into the murky water and was horrified to see a mammoth monster-sized fish headed right for him, with its mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man had one last hope.  He frantically removed his clothes and swam off just as the hideous fish greedily bit into the hook with Eric's little clothes still attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I got one!\"  Rusty exclaimed, as he pulled in his line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, naked and exhausted, pulled himself up onto a floating twig and hoped the currents would carry him to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A pail the size of a water storage tank crashed down beside him, dropped from the hand of a near-naked, well-tanned giant. The giant wore a pair of tight square-cut red swim trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stepped outside the tab opening in the can to stare up and get a better look.<br>\r\nA light trail of sandy hair ran down the giant's stomach, past a tight navel that could contain Eric's entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant wrinkled his nose. \"Damned litterbugs!\" He snatched up the soda can before Eric could move, and stuffed it into his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous figure dropped down to his knees and began surveying the wet sand before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shelter gone, Eric was left exposed and vulnerable on the sand in the shadow of the huge and awe-inspiring giant. Two enormous hands dropped toward the sand and began smoothing out a large area of sand to prepare a foundation for his creative sand-sculpting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric scrambled backward to try to avoid the sweeping motions of the human earthmover. Sand particles the size of coarse gravel cascaded all around him, pelting him painfully but not causing much actual damage. Still, he desperately wanted to find some shelter until he could find a way to communicate with this new stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought it fortunate when he spotted the huge structure a short distance from him. There was a smooth vaulted opening into the huge structure. Part of the structure was buried in the sand, but some large spirals extended out from the sides of the enormous seashell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shuddered slightly as he approached it. He did some quick calculations in his mind. Considering his half-inch stature, the shell was most likely no more than three or four inches long, but it loomed before him like a pop-art architectural fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant swept away more sand from the intended base of his creation, and the grains once again scattered over Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist darted inside the shell. Clearing the sand encrusted near the opening, his bare feet touched onto the smooth, polished surface of the shell's interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis entry into the shell soon led to twists and turns as Eric made his way deeper into the shell. The narrow, smooth tunnel did eventually began to widen as he reached the center of the shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the giant was beginning his creation. He took the pail and began scooping up loads of sand and water from the surf's edge, and depositing them onto the smoothed foundation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rested against the interior wall of the shell. Sunlight filtered through the calcium walls, producing dim, eerie colors that enhanced the claustrophobic effect he was experiencing. He had more than a little trouble getting his mind to accept the fact that he was standing rather comfortably inside an ordinary seashell. He reached out and ran his hands along the smooth walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric found himself grateful that the mollusk was no longer occupying its former home. He was admiring the polished texture of the structure when it suddenly toppled sideways as the giant dragged it along with a load of sand meant to be deposited on the growing heap that would become his sand castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shell was turned to a degree that Eric found it impossible to retrace his path through the shell's tunnel. He could not know, but he did suspect, that the giant must have turned the shell over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let me out of here!\" Eric began shouting, although he doubted his tiny shouts could possibly be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this one's kind of nice,\" the giant said as he spied the shell in the sand. He set it aside, open end up, and he resumed shaping his sculpture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the castle took form, Eric kept scrambling to climb the smooth, slippery, curving walls of the spiral shell. Each attempt led only to yet another humiliating slide back to where he had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the giant looked down in satisfaction as his elaborate sand sculpture began to assume a pleasing shape. He used his pail, shovel, sticks and even his fingertips to pack and scrape the sand into a rather impressive medi\u00e6val structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now,\" he pronounced, picking up the shell, \"the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance!\" He pushed the shell into the sand at the top of the center tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shell was now positioned in a way to allow Eric an exit, but high above the sand's surface. The tiny man now found himself stranded inside the shell and atop a towering parapet of sand.</span></div></div>",

As the dog stepped closer, drawn to the stench of shoe, Eric sprinted as fast as his tiny legs could carry him toward the toes, all the while seeing the growing shadow overtake him.

Eric was trapped by Scott's huge massive hand, but could see Scott's huge beefy fingers unwrap one of the tootsie rolls.  And then it was headed for the giant jocks enormous open mouth.  And Eric was front row center for the terrifying event.  Scott's open mouth and sharp white teeth were horrific to the minuscule Eric.  Scott chewed the little treat and decided he was ready for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, he's going to eat me next,\" Eric screamed quite terrified.  But Scott could not hear the tiny squeaky screams of Eric.  \"Please, oh Please don't eat me,\" Eric's insignificant screams were drowned out by Sportscenter.  It's doubtful Scott would have even heard Eric in a completely quiet room, much less a room with loud talking thundering macho jocks with the television turned up full blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Eric was about to be unwrapped and casually eaten by the godlike titanic macho jock quarterback,</span></div></div>",

Greg lifted his massive foot into the air for all to see.  Greg may not have been as tall as the other jocks, but he won out in the foot size department.  A curious Eric heard this and peered out from under the couch to see Greg's monster sized foot held high into the air.  \"Meet the Exterminator, its sole mission is to seek out and crush all tiny creatures,\" Greg stated in a stern voice and then giggled.  Even Scott was amused.  But Eric was terrified.  He was now  trapped in a room with a mammoth titan like jock with monster feet who was going to be on the lookout for tiny creachers to squash.  And Greg was a stomp now, ask questions later kind of guy.  Then Greg gave a demonstration by stomping around the room in search of something to squash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out little creatures, where ever you are.  The exterminator wants to play with you.  I promise he won't hurt you,\" Greg said having a hard time keeping a straight face.  Greg was truly a clown and always enjoyed being the center of attention.  All the other jocks were also getting a kick out of this.  Greg slowly searched around the room and stopped at the couch Scott was sitting on.  \"I bet there is someone hiding under there,\" Greg said.  <br>\r\n\"Yah, I saw some bug run under there.

He had bought them when he started a part time job as a builder. Greg was the kind of guy who stomped on bugs, lizards and frogs just for fun. Once he even stomped on a nest of tiny, squeaking baby birds which had fallen out of a tree during a storm. Wearing his boots, he could hardly feel the crunch. He liked that, because it made the tiny creature so insignificant to him that he could hardly feel it. And now he had a real live human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant one boot on and dropped it to the floor. With the huge noise, the wooden beam Eric was standing on seemed to drop out from under him and he was knocked off his feet by what felt like an earthquake. The second boot fell with equal force. An ant the size of a decent sized dog ran past. Eric began to get scared as the giant lifted himself to his full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, although shorter than the lanky Scott, still stood well over six feet. To Eric that made him around 900 feet tall. He placed his boots heavily on either side of the tiny man, who was now lying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could see the huge jock-giant towering over him, and he could see the bulge in the front of his shorts. Fear gripped Eric once again as he realised the huge man was getting off on some kind of sick power trip. He scrambled to his feet, but had nowhere to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg decided to toy with his victim. He stomped down hard on the floor with both boots. And stomped closer to the tiny Eric. Eric ran away from the huge boots with their heavy tread, nearly tripping in a crack between two boards. The giant's boots stomped repeatedly behind Eric as he ran for his life across the room. He was heading for the shelter of the wall, but a boot dropped down in front of him, blocking his path. Eric doubled back, and realised he was being herded around the huge room. His heart was racing, and he was growing weary, and then he stumbled when his foot caught in the crack between two floorboards. He dropped and rolled onto his back, tears streaming down his face as he looked up at the cruel giant above him. He clutched his hands together as if to pray and screamed as loud as he could \"Please, let me live\", but Greg's face remained malicious. Eric realised that nothing he could do could save his life. This monster was going to kill him so he could feel big and powerful. Then the heavy sole of one of Greg's boots moved into position above him, and then came thundering down with an earth shattering sound, bringing darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eric wasn't dead. He was under the giant's instep. Eric was in shock, and shaking uncontrolably. But then the boot boot lifted and came down quite gently on top of him, and slowly it pressed down until the bones in Eric's body cracked, and he became a tiny little stain shared between the floor and the tread of Greg's boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott burst into the room.<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you stompin', man?\"<br>\r\n\"Bugs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The table and bar were covered with empty beer bottles, and the nauseating  smell of stale beer filled the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric noticed an open pizza box extremely close by, and his hunger forced him to investigate.

Scott rolled his eyes but his competitive nature was apparent at any task he undertook, even a simple game of foosball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your on!\" the other two jocks answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four colossal young men jumped up and stormed into the recreation room that was adjacent to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, an earthquake,\"  Eric thought to himself as he was awakened from a semi-peaceful slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minuscule Professor was petrified to see what seemed an endless parade of giant sneakers, boots, and bare feet.  The entrance of the unearthly colossal beasts was frightening.  Eric's box shook violently as the gargantuan feet thundered past him, crushing everything in their path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was frozen in fear as one of the mega-giant's massive boots came crashing down on the edge of the old pizza box he was in.  Frustrated and very scared, Eric could not bring himself to accept he was in a room with the same terrifyingly huge giant jocks he had just earlier successfully escaped from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal jocks stomped over to a foosball table and began a quite spirited game.  In desperation, Eric realized he might have to try and get the attention of these behemoth jocks, and hope they would help him.  But he was so small.  Maybe they wouldn't even know that he was a human being.  Even Scott earlier thought he was a bug and tried to crush him.  The thought of being casually crushed by a cocky young jock was quite repugnant to him.  Anyway now was not the time anyway.  The massive creatures were jumping up and down, and hollering in what was quite an intense game of foosball.  No way Eric was going to allow himself to be subject to that, defenseless to those gigantic feet, out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the game was over.  Eric looked out of his hiding place and saw that the mammoth jocks had grabbed some beers and were sitting down at the gigantic table.  Eric's stomach grew queasy as he realized he had a life altering decision to make.  The tinsy-tiny Professor was going to try and attract the attention of the hulking monster jocks, and try to get them to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling with fear,  Eric ventured from the safety of his hiding place, and began cautiously walking in the direction of the massive table the jocks were seated at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer size of the giant young men was hair-raising.  As he approached the god-like titans, their massive voices were intimidating and deafening.  Eric was beginning to realize just how small and insignificant he had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had walked dangerously close to one of the giant jocks and began screaming and waving his arms as frantically as he could.  Eric was terrified as we watched the giant's massive boot shift position every so often, pounding random areas of the floor.  Eric seemed a safe distance from the life threatening boots, so he continued to scream as loud as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could hear Eric's tiny voice.  He was too tiny.  Eric dared not move any closer to the titanic youth, but he stood his ground and continued to wave his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric was trying to get the attention of a hulking young jock named Joe.  Joe was a defensive lineman on the football team.  He was six foot four, had brown eyes, long wavy black hair and was built like a rock. Joe's boots were massive and black.  He wore size 16. And his shirt could barely contain his bulging muscles.  When it came to football, he was an intense maniac, but otherwise was an easygoing very nice guy.  He wasn't the smartest guy in the world, but basically everybody like Joe.  He was just really down to earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was sitting isolated at one side of the table, and was beginning to become bored with the macho conversation of the other jocks.  Greg was rehashing his story about twins that he dated at the same time.  Joe had heard this story a million times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored out of his mind,  Joe glanced down at the floor, and noticed the movement of a tiny object.  \"Must be some bug,\" Joe thought to himself, continuing to focus his total attention on the incredibly small \"bug\".  Well within the reach of his massive leg, Joe thought about casually reaching over with his monstrous boot and crushing the little thing. He brings his massive boot  directly over the little \"bug\", hovering, and then hesitates.  He moves his foot back.  Joe would definitely  stomp on the little \"bug\" later because they didn't need no bugs in the frathouse, but he let the little creature amuse him for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was relieved and slightly terrified as he saw Joe drop his head and look right at him.  His intense glare was intimidating.  The tiny Professor was confused when Joe did nothing but just continue glaring down at him, so he just kept screaming and waving his arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you stupid Jock,  help me,\" screamed Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Eric got a reaction from the \"stupid jock\", but not quite the one he was hoping for.  Without warning a gigantic black boot belonging to the behemoth had come from nowhere and was now hovering directly over him.  Eric almost pissed his pants.  Then then colossal boot began to lower and Eric did piss his pants.  His life was over.  He was just some bug that a guy wanted to step on.  Eric just hoped it would be quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as quick as it appeared, the boot was gone, back to its original resting place.  Eric was relieved but quite humiliated to know that the giant jock had just played with him.  Could he not recognize that his was an actual human being.  Eric decided to go for broke.  He started walking closer to the giant jock in hopes he would see what he was.  A real man.  Tiny, but real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe watched intently as the little \"bug\" moved closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a brave little thing,\" Joe thought to himself, as his immense eyes focused on the little creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric moved closer to him, Joe began to make out the form of the little creature better.  Joe was astonished at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" Joe whispered to himself, and bent down to the floor on his knees to to get a better look at this.  Joe thought his mind was playing tricks on him.  He moved in close on the tiny figure, and realized he was looking at a miniature human man.  The little man seemed to be screaming something but Joe could only hear a very tiny squeak.  The other frat jocks were so into Greg's story that they didn't even notice what Joe is doing.  Joe decided to examine the little guy closer so he slowly reached down to pick him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was excited Joe  recognized him, but when he saw the massive hand of the jock headed for him, he wasn't so sure.  It was chilling to realize that the gigantic jock was going to hold Eric in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Joe has Eric securely in his hand he:</span></div></div>",

It was quite disheartening for Eric to realize that he was now under the complete control of this colossal muscular football jock.  As the massive hand began to close around him, Eric was terrified as he discovered that he was not even as big as one of Joe's gigantic fingernails.  Just one careless move, and Joe could have squashed Eric without even realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's beefy fingers lifted Eric into the air, and then Eric found himself in the palm of Joe's hand.  The enormous hand was as big as a basketball court to Eric.  It was warm and slightly damp with sweat.  Even the lines in Joe's hand seemed huge,  and Eric could even make out the pattern of Joe's fingerprints with great detail.  Eric was completely fascinated by Joe's enormous hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's fascination soon became terror as the monster-sized hand began to close around him.  The last thing he saw before complete darkness was Joe looking down at him grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm outta here guys, see you later,\" Joe remarked to the other titan jocks, as he closed his hand, stood up and walked out headed for his room, with his new little prized possession safe and secure.  Scott said, \"later gator,\" and continued listening to Greg's yapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt like he was in a gigantic moving sauna as he was quickly whisked through the frathouse in a direct path to Joe's room.  Joe was excited in the anticipation of examining his tiny captive in a much more private setting.  Eric was beginning to dread this colossal jock might have more on his mind than just being a good Samaritan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe entered his room, closed the door and locked it.  He walked over and sit down at his desk, and took a deep breath.  He slowly opened his hand to reveal a trembling, scared little human creature.  At least he thought it was human.  Maybe it was an alien or even a mutant insect that escaped from some horrible cloning laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to communicate with Joe, but he was just to small to be heard.  All Joe could hear was a very faint squeaking noise.  Eric realized that not being able to be heard by Joe was a terribly  bad development.  Without the extremely important humanity of communication,  Joe might be inclined to treat him as just an interesting creature instead of a real person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No, Please not the hand again,\" Eric screamed  as Joe gently reached down and picked him up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't hurt you little one,\" Joe said, as he effortlessly lifted Eric into the air and set him down on top of a CD storage case.  \"Now stay there, I'll be right back.  And don't go too close to the edge.  Wouldn't want you to have an accident,\"  Joe instructed Eric, and slightly chuckled.  Joe left the room leaving Eric all alone trapped atop the mountainous CD case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Joe returned with:</span></div></div>",

The giant jock effortlessly clicked the dreaded prison lid over the tiny bug-sized man, and Eric was trapped in the repugnant insect cage until a giant decided to let him out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt so meager and insignificant.  He had lost all control of his very life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now, Joe's every waking thought concerned the big game on Saturday.  But Eric now had Joe's undivided attention.  Joe was fascinated at every move the little Professor made.  He took the cage in one hand and brought it close to his face until his colossal nose was actually touching the finely meshed lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric grew faint as carbon-monoxide  from Joe's massive breath filled his tiny new home.  Joe turned his head and held his ear up to the box, listening intently for any sound from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me, Please help me,\"  Eric screamed as loud as he could.  \"I'm a Professor at your college and was accidentally shrunk during an experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please hear me, please oh please,\"  Eric prayed as he continued to scream the same message over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe still only heard a faint squeaking sound.  \"If it were human, why wouldn't it talk to me\", Joe pondered to himself.  Joe did not understand that his eardrums were not sensitive enough to pick up the insignificant sounds made from pathetic little Eric's vocal chords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it really is just some sort of insect that looks human,\" Joe rationalizes out loud to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified little Eric hears this and falls to his knees in sheer terror.  Eric knows he'll never be let go if the titanic jock thinks of him just as some cool bug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for the fun of it, the hulking football jock blows into the Professor's little cage, knocking him down with typhoon sized winds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your just a cool little bug,\"  Joe teases.  \"You're MY cool little bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis horrific statement from the giant jock chilled Eric to the bone.  For now, everything was hopeless.  Eric was merely a tiny creature whose sole purpose in life was to amuse a colossal young football jock.  Eric wondered what would happen when giant Joe no longer found him \"amusing and cool\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Joe got a great idea, and he grabbed the phone.  Eric was glad to finally not have so much detailed attention directed towards him.  When Joe talked on the phone, he was nearly oblivious to the world.  The massive giant leaned way back in his chair, propped his monster-sized 16 feet up on the desk where Eric was, and hit speed-dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way in which Eric propped his feet on the desk, his super-colossal white-socked toes hovered directly over the lid of poor little Eric's prison, his only source for fresh air.  Eric was repulsed by the stench.  Eric had never smelled anything worse than this.  And it just got worse.  Joe's toes began to wriggle slightly and lowered even more towards the lid.  Eric's one and only source for fresh air was now almost completely blocked by Joe's mammoth socked foot.  Tears formed in the pathetic little Professor's eyes from the sheer stench.  Then Joe began playing with the little cage with his giant foot, moving it around here and there as he yapped on the phone.  Eric listened intently at Joe's booming voice.  He was curious to what was going on.  Might he be calling someone to help him?  No such luck for the insignificant little Eric, but the conversation definitely did concern him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....hey what's up little bro?........hows mom?.........yeah............nope.......you bet I'll be home for Christmas, and man, little bro do I have a surprise for you this year.  I'm bringing you the best present ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the phone, Joe's little brother shuttered with excitement.  Joe had always gotten him awesome presents, and now this one was going to be the best one ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, what is it, please tell me, please, please,\" Joe's little brother begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it wouldn't be a surprise if I told you little bro,\" Joe teased.  \"Lets just say its a lot smaller than a bread box, and is really \"cool\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe hung up the phone, and removed his feet from the desk, just before the minuscule little Eric thought he would suffocate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe brought his enormous face right up to the lip of Eric's tiny prison, grinned and casually remarked, \"my little bro is going to love you!\"  Joe then put his headphones on and jumped on his bed to take a little nap.  Eric's little universe bounced slightly in the air and shifted about three inches when the behemoth creature landed on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric just stood there stupified.  He was truly doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric pondered his ghastly fate, he noticed a piece of masking tape stuck to the outside of his cage with writing on it.  It must be a label of some sort.  The brilliant, but minuscule professor could just make out the letters from the backside of the tape.  He started to decipher the letters and was frozen with fear when he realized the label read:</span></div></div>",

He was tall, lean and and had dirty blond hair that looked liked it had not been combed in a month.  He wore baggy jeans and a bright orange sweatshirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was not on the football team.  He was a soccer player, but he and a couple other soccer players lived in the frat-house which was a majority football players.   A true jocks' jock, Seth loved all sports, and was pretty good at all of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Joe, got any bugs left?\" Seth asked again impatiently.  \"The lizard needs something to eat.  He probably hasn't eaten in days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do have this one strange bug that I found,\"  Joe said, still half asleep.  \"But I was going to take it home to my kid brother for Christmas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth erupted in laughter, \"You've got to be kidding, you cheap ass.  You can't give your brother no bug for Christmas.  He'd probably kick you in the balls for doing that.  I know I sure would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" chuckled Joe.  He realized the absurdity of giving his little brother a bug for a Christmas present.  \"But it is such a cool little bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bugs ain't cool,\" exclaimed Seth.  \"The only good bug is one that I've squashed under my foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, please no,\" Eric screamed at the top of his lungs.  He grew petrified as he knew where the giant jocks' conversation was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Seth, the bug is in that little cage on my desk,\" Joe said.  \"You can have it to feed to the lizard.  I bet it is half starved to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, man,\" Seth said, and looked over at the small cage.  \"As long as its alive.  The lizard won't eat anything dead.  It's got to be alive and kicking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's still alive,\"  Joe said.  \"You'd better check and make sure though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to play dead,\" Eric thought to himself.  \"It's my only hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric laid down in the cage as motionless as possible, as the mischievous young soccer jock approached the little cage to check him out.  Eric froze and looked up in awe as Seth's face hovered over the tiny cage and began to lower to get a more detailed account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The damn thing sure is tiny, and it ain't movin,\" declared Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly and with no warning Seth yelled, \"BOO\" into the little cage, and the thundering boom caused Eric to jump up, trembling with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little fucker was just playing possum,\" Seth chuckled.  \"O.K. little fellow, you're coming with me.  I want to introduce you to Mr. Lizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth grabbed the small cage in one hand and headed briskly back to the reck room where the other jocks were, huddled around their hungry little pet.  Joe went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric never would get used to being carried through the air by a giant.  He was rocked violently and slid from one side of the cage to the other.  Seth was none too gentle with the tiny Professor.  But why should he be?  He thought he was just carrying some bug, not a human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had one left,\"  Seth exclaimed to the other giant jocks, holding the cage out so everyone could examine the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That damn thing is too small,\"  one of the giant jocks said.  \"It will barely be a mouthful.  We've got to get this lizard some real food.  Somebody go outside and find some crickets or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was humiliated but a little relieved.  He was so small , he was not even adequate enough to be lizard food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was kneeling down looking at the lizard and then grabbed Eric's little cage from Seth and glared down at the measly \"insect\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lizard has to eat something now,\" Greg said.  \"We'll just let this little bug be the appetizer until we can find something more filling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, God no!\"  Eric cried, as he witnessed Greg effortlessly remove the lid from his cage and begin to reach for him with his terrifying, jumbo sized fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg grabbed the tiny insect-sized man with his thumb and forefinger, and lifted him out of the cage.  Eric looked down and saw his fate.  It was a prehistoric creature from hell.  His very own Jurassic nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other jocks laughed as Greg dangled the helpless little Professor over the gargantuan reptile, and very slowly began to lower him to his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard sensed it was dinner time and opened his mouth wide.  The lizard was hungry and a little peeved at the giant jock for teasing him with the tasty morsel, so he leaped into the air in hopes of gobbling down the bite sized piece of meat.  Eric almost had a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast my lizard friend,\" Greg teased the hungry reptile, and jerked the little Professor higher into the air.  \"You know the drill....beg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the lizard waited patiently with it's mouth wide open, and Greg continued lowering Eric towards the awaiting open mouth of the revolting reptile.  Eric feared his life was truly over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Greg was about to release the tiny Professor into the jaws of the lizard.....</span></div></div>",

His blood-curdling encounter with the dinosaur-sized lizard had exhausted him.  The tiny Professor tried unsuccessfully to block out the fact that those giant cocky frat-guys had almost fed him to their hideous pet.  The thought of being chewed up, swallowed and ending up in the stomach of a gargantuan lizard angered and repulsed the measly little man.  Eric was frantic to figure a way out of this ghastly nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stood and walked to the wall of his glass prison and gazed out upon Joe's massive bedroom.  Seeming as big as the Grand Canyon, the room was impressive and quite ominous.  The ceiling loomed vast and far away.  The mountainous walls were covered with various posters and what looked like newspaper articles.  One shelf contained many trophies, and several old looking ratty footballs.  Clothes were strewn randomly about, and the room had a strong musky smell of some sort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was desperate to figure out a way to communicate with the hulking football jock.  His only hope for survival and restoration to normal size rested with Joe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eerie silence fell over the room and then suddenly Eric was jolted from his deep thought as the bedroom door rushed open.  The colossal football jock had returned.  Joe casually walked in carrying a number of curious objects in his massive hands.  Joe walked over and sat down at his desk, plopping down the items he was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's little jar had been set on the desk close to the back part.  From this vantage point, the little Professor  could see everything Joe was doing.  He seemed to have brought scissors, tape, and some kind of box.  The box had something printed on one side but Eric could not quite make out the words.  But the colors and style of the box seemed familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe took a deep breath, sighed, and grabbed a big black pen from a drawer in his desk.  Tiny Eric was curiously taking in the current events with a bit of uneasiness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world is he doing?\"  the bug-sized Professor thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned the box on its side in order to write something on it.  As the box shifted,  Eric was horrified as five gargantuan letters came into his full view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nF e d E x<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God what is he doing?\"  the minuscule Professor said to himself in a panic.  \"That box can't possibly be for me, can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Joe finished writing on the box, he glanced at his little captive and said,  \"well my curious little bug,  just to be on the safe side, I'm going to mail you to my little bro before one of my crazy buddies decides to feed you to the lizard behind my back.  And don't worry, my little bro is crazy about bugs.  He loves to experiment on them and dissect them and stuff....oh but I'm sure you'll be too \"special\" to dissect.\"  Joe shook his head and laughed, as he realized he was talking to a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe took the little jar and unscrewed the lid.  He dropped a few bread crumbs and a cotton ball into the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a snack for the trip, and hopefully the cotton will prevent you from being jostled around so much,\"  Joe explained with concern to the soon to be traveler.  \"And don't worry, with FedEx, you'll be in my brother's hands by tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe screwed the lid back on and also stuck a strip of tape across it for an extra precaution.  He then carefully placed the jar inside the box and surrounded it with crumpled up newspaper.  Joe then closed the open end of the box and taped it securely shut.  With a pen, Joe punched a couple small holes in the side of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K. its time to get you in the mail,\"  Joe said as he grabbed the little box and headed out.</span></div></div>",

He noticed the return address was from his big brother Joe at college.  Jeremy remembered a call from Joe about some special present he was going to give him for Christmas, but he thought his big brother was going to bring it himself during Christmas break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy put the small box on his desk and grabbed a pocket knife.  He thoroughly cut into one end in anticipation of the mysterious contents.  The box was filled with crumpled newspaper, obviously protecting something within.  The first thing that caught his attention was a folded piece of paper directly at the top of the box.  Jeremy took the paper and unfolded it.  It was a note from his big brother Joe.  Jeremy read the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jeremy, <br>\r\nWhat's up bro.  Hope things are going good for you.  I found this strange little bug in the frathouse and thought you might like to have it for your collection.  I hope it's still alive when you get it.  I had to get it out of here because the guys wanted to feed it to our pet lizard.  If it's nothing special, just flush it down the toilet or something, no big deal.  See ya in a couple weeks.<br>\r\nJoe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\"  Jeremy said to himself  out loud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy had a fascination with insects, and had a large collection of different species.  Several large shelves in his room were cluttered with various sized jars of many different kinds of insects.  Jeremy had become quite the professional collector.  He had many of the tools necessary for the examination, experimentation, and preservation of insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy eagerly reached into the FedEx box and pulled out the small jar containing the minuscule, scared college Professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness turned into a blinding light as Eric's prison jar was pulled from its transport by the gigantic youth.  Jeremy was not gentle with the jar so Eric was violently thrown about.  When the motion stopped,  Eric looked out to see two enormous, ominous eyes fixed directly on him.  Eric felt uncomfortable as Jeremy examined him from all directions within the tiny glass prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world are you?\"  Jeremy said, as he slightly tilted the jar and gently tapped it with his giant finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K. lets try this again,\"  Eric said to himself, intimidated by the jumbo finger tapping curiously at him.  The tiny Professor jumped up and down, waving his arms in a desperate attempt at communicating with the young giant.  \"Please, you've got to help me.  I was accidentally shrunk during an experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Eric's meager size, he was just too small to be identified as a human being.  Jeremy thought he was just some curious little insect for him to examine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are an interesting looking little thing,\" Jeremy said with a mischievous smile.  \"I'm going to have to give you a thorough examination.  But first I'm going to have to finish up with a current patient.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was terrified at the thought of an \"examination\" by the extremely curious young giant, but he was powerless to prevent it.  The bug-sized Professor's only hope was that a close examination by Jeremy would reveal that he was actually a human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy took Eric's small jar and put it on an enormous work table of some sort.  Eric was petrified as he took in his new surroundings.  To his left were five jars that contained different kinds of insects.  Only one insect appeared to be alive.  Next to the jars was a small vial that appeared to contain a small bug being preserved in some kind of liquid.  Several ghastly looking metal instruments were neatly arranged to one side of the table.  Eric recognized several instruments as forceps, tweezers, and an enormous shiny razor sharp scalpel.  Farther to one side of the table were two plastic bottles.  Each were labeled, \"POISON---KILL JAR\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly in front of the now extremely uneasy tiny Professor was a strange board.  Eric was repulsed to see an unrecognizable insect secured to the board with horrific giant metal pins.  The pins had been pierced directly through the insect.  Jeremy loomed menacingly far above.  Eric shuddered as he realized he had become a specimen for this young mad scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be patient, I'll get to you next,\"  Jeremy said to the trapped little Professor he thought to be an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked down at his current specimen on the spreading board.  It would occasionally twitch trying to free itself of the deadly sharp pins that had it secured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy reached down and picked up </span></div></div>",

His experiments on the poor little creatures would make most people cringe.  He was fascinated by all aspects of the tiny creatures.  He would carefully remove an insect's wings with tweezers while it was still alive to study how it would react to its environment without wings.  None of his specimens lived very long after an experiment began.  But Jeremy's favorite activity was dissecting the little insects.  He liked to see what they looked like on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy finished the gruesome examination of his current specimen.  He removed the metal pins from the spreading board, wiped up the remaining mess with a kleenex and tossed it into a trash can.  He disinfected the board with some rubbing alcohol, and then glared directly at Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy picked up the little jar Eric was in to have a look at his new interesting little bug.  After witnessing the horrible procedure on the previous specimen, Eric was scared half to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting...what am I going to do with you?\"  Jeremy said aloud.  \"You are too tiny to dissect, but I would like to do some experiments before I \"preserve\" you.  What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy put the jar back on the table and picked up a thin paperback book and began to read to himself aloud, \"Killing bottles --  Once the insect has been captured, it should be killed quickly and in a way that leaves it relaxed.  This is usually achieved by placing the specimen in a killing bottle moistened with a killing agent.  Only one or two drops are needed to charge the jar with vapour sufficiently concentrated to effect rapid death...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Eric heard every word.  His new surreal circumstances were just too much to handle.  From a combination of mental terror and exhaustion, he fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy finished reading and decided it was time to remove his new little bug from its jar.  He unscrewed the lid and carefully turned the jar, and what he thought was a little bug fell right into his hand.  He examined the tiny creature the best he could, but it was so small.  He touched it with one of his fingers, and turned it over, examining it from all sides.  It was motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's dead,\"  Jeremy said with disappointment.  \"I'd better get you in a vial of alcohol immediately so that you will be properly preserved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric lay unconscious in Jeremy's giant hand as he prepared the vial of alcohol with the other.  Eric was unaware he was about to meet a gruesome fate at the hands of this curious youngster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy held Eric between his thumb and forefinger and held him over the vial of alcohol and prepared to drop him in.  Eric would be immediately killed and preserved at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jeremy was about to \"preserve\" his little bug...</span></div></div>",

He had gone from the inventor of a device that would surely change the world and win him a Nobel Prize, to a meager addition to a boy's insect collection.  And he was the smallest of all the specimens.  The next smallest insect seemed over twice his size.  The gruesome spider in the jar next to him was gigantic.  The pitiful little man would have no chance if he encountered such a monster.  At least it was dead.  Eric stared at the nightmarish spider, intimidated by the sheer size and horrific appearance.  It almost seemed to be glaring right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the frightful spider came alive and pounced savagely at the glass wall in an attempt to get at the tiny man.  Eric fell back onto the glass surface and crouched in complete terror as his horrific neighbor continued its futile effort to reach the half-inch tall man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please someone help me.  Get me out of here!\"  Eric screamed, trying not to look at the awful creature that wanted to have him for dinner.  \"This can't be happening to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his glass prison begin to shake as if an earthquake had begun.  The ground beneath him continued to rumble as he witnessed two rambunctious boys storm into the room.  Joe's brother had returned with a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jeremy, ya got any new bugs I can torture?\"  Patrick asked with a laugh as he threw a soccer ball to Jeremy and kicked off his sneakers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one, but the darn thing is dead,\"  Jeremy replied, tossing the ball back to Patrick as he kicked off his sneakers.  \"It's in that jar next to the spider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\"  Patrick said as he threw the soccer ball into a corner and walked over to the shelf housing Jeremy's collection.  \"Something has got that spider all riled up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick looked over into the jar next to the spider and studied Jeremy's new little \"bug\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That spider sure does want to get at that little bug,\"  Patrick said with fascination.  \"Maybe the spider is hungry.  Let's feed that bug to the spider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric listened to Patrick's words in complete horror.  He began to panic.  The tiny man stood up and pounded the glass wall.  He yelled at Patrick with all of his might.  \"I am not a bug!  I am a man!  Please help me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't feed the spider a dead bug,\"  Jeremy explained to Patrick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bug is alive and kickin,\"  Patrick responded, as he reached for Eric's little jar.  \"Come on Jeremy, I want to see the spider eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's pitiful pleas were ignored by the mischievous youth, as he effortlessly picked up the little jar and began to unscrew the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please don't put me in the jar with that monster,\"  Eric pleaded as Patrick turned the jar on its side and let tiny Eric fall into the palm of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Patrick,\"  Jeremy said.  \"If it's still alive, I want to study it for a while.  I have some new experiments I want to try out on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick removed the lid of the spider's jar.  He lifted the tiny \"bug\" with his thumb and forefinger, and dangled the helpless creature directly over the much bigger spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Jeremy, let me feed the spider,\" Patrick pleaded, slowly lowering Eric closer and closer to his doom.  \"This spider is really hungry.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two boys roared with laughter.  \"Or I could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick began to very slowly turn his hand over, causing Eric to begin to fall.

Just as he was about to reach the edge of the table and probably fall to his death, the gust of wind stopped, but it was followed by an equally strong gust from the opposite direction.

As Jeremy brought the box closer, tiny Eric was able to read the words on the side of the colorful box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOT WHEELS TORNADO TWISTER --  DEATH-DEFYING SPEED AND THREE MID-AIR LOOPS -- 3 FEET TALL<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was mortified as he watched the giant boy remove the colossal roller coaster from the box.  Patrick's palm was beginning to sweat from his excitement.  The toy coaster consisted of a bright orange three feet  tall tower.  The toy car would be blasted up the tower.  At the top, the car would be hurled down around the tower through three loops until it reached the bottom.  Then the hair-raising ordeal would be repeated over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy held up two toy Hot Wheels cars for Eric to see.  \"So which do you want?  The super-turbo Porsche, or the Magnum 6?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree feet Eric thought.  Oh no, to him that would be over 400 feet tall.  Eric remembered riding the Goliath roller coaster at Six Flags.  Supposedly the tallest the world, it was only about 250 feet tall.  \"Please don't put me on that thing!\"  But the boys were not going to take no for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the Magnum 6!\"  Patrick said, choosing the car for Eric.  \"But what about a seat belt.  How will he be able to hold on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Problem,\"  Jeremy replied as he pulled off small piece of the bubble gum he was chewing and stuck it in the seat of the Magnum 6.  \"Now why don't you help our little passenger get strapped in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no,\"  Eric screamed as he tried to resist being put into the toy Hot Wheels car.  But Patrick easily pushed the little man into the seat of the car.  Eric was stuck fast to the bubble gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for a ride?\"  Jeremy said with a sinister laugh and flipped a switch on the roller coaster.  Two fly wheels began spinning at the bottom opening of the tower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick slowly lowered the toy Magnum 6 car to the track and let it go.  Gravity initiated the rolling of the car slowly down the track, headed right for the fast spinning fly wheels, which would launch the vehicle up the horrible tower.  Eric just screamed.  Patrick and Jeremy were loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric approached the fly wheels, adrenaline caused his heart to race.  When the car hit the fly wheels, it was blasted up the tower at a death-defying velocity.  The little car zoomed out the opening in the top of the tower and sped down three gigantic loops that encircled the tower until it reached the bottom.  Just as Eric thought he was going to throw up, he was headed towards the fly wheels again.  He was about to experience this horrific ride once again.</span></div></div>",

He was at the total mercy of Joe, an extremely intimidating colossal jock football player, who could effortlessly end his life at any time he chose.  But little Eric was safe for now, because the giant jock was amused and fascinated by him, and wanted to give the interesting little creature to his kid brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe placed Eric's little glass prison on a shelf, surprisingly out in the open and vulnerable.  Eric could easily see throughout the immense room, slightly distorted by the glass.  But Eric could also easily be seen by anyone that happened into the room.  And in a house full of cocky, rambunctious, monster-sized titans, he'd just as soon be as out of sight as possible.  But he was powerless to do anything about it.  Eric just sat there and contemplated some way to make the giant football player realize he was a real human being, not some bug to be given to a kid brother as a present.  God only knew what that kid would do to him.  He might be horrifically dissected by the curious youth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Eric was startled as the door to the room flew open and an enormous guy rushed into the room and yelled, \"Hey Joe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Scott, and he was naked except for a jock-strap, his hair wet and his body slightly dripping with water.  Scott had just showered and discovered he was out of deodorant.  He had come to borrow some from his buddy Joe.  Studly football jocks had no problem with sharing stuff like deodorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe must have left already.  I'll just help myself,\"  Scott mumbled to himself and walked over to the shelf that held Joe's deodorant, along with other stuff like cologne, aspirin, and mouthwash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was trapped in his glass prison on the shelf just below the item Scott was interested in.  Just about waste level, Eric watched helplessly as the almost naked muscle-bound jock casually walked over and stood directly in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stood frozen in awe as he starred into the crotch of the massive young football player.  The monster-sized bulge in the young man's jockstrap was beyond comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant Scott found the deodorant and moved a little closer to the shelf as he began to apply it under his gargantuan arms, oblivious to the tiny little voyeur below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal young man's crotch moved closer to Eric's little jar until it filled his entire vision.  The minuscule Professor was mesmerized.  If he ever got out of this,  Scott was going to get an A+ for this tantalizing show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could even smell the freshly showered masculinity of the young titan towering over him.  And then a tiny bead of water mixed with jock sweat trickled down on the lid of the jar and through one of the air-holes, and splashed the little man directly in the face.  Eric was overcome with lust.  He wanted this gigantic football jock real bad.  But he was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott finished applying the deodorant and...</span></div></div>",

Eric lost his balance and fell over as his universe was shifted, turned, and lifted by the gigantic football player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's emotions shifted from lust to terror as he saw Scott's intimidating eyes staring at him through the glass wall.

He turned the jar in all directions, tilted it from side to side, and lifted it to take a peek from underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the magnificent bug Joe is so enamored  with?\" Scott said.  \"God, you are so pathetically small.

It's probably just some freak of nature bug or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is so small, his voice is probably too faint to hear,\"  Scott explained.  \"Here, I brought him with me, why don't you have a better look.  Oh, and before I forget, crazy Seth wants to buy him from you.  He wants to keep him as a pet or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe just laughed.  Eric was unnerved as he heard the giant football jocks discussing him.  He was relieved to be thought of as a real person, but was a little humiliated and fearful every time the word pet was used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Scott's gigantic hand reached into his shirt pocket and pulled the shrunken Professor out for a more detailed inspection.  He set the reduced man on a cushioned weight bench.  The two god-like mega-giants knelt down and got real close to the tiny Professor to get a really good look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was mesmerized by his new surroundings.  The massive weight room was impressive and intimidating.  The ceiling seemed vast and distant.  Eric was surrounded by an endless array of sophisticated weight machines and free weights.  But the most confidence-shattering sight was the two colossal young football jocks looming so close, observing his every move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, he is so cool,\" Joe exclaimed.  \"Maybe he is a leprechaun.  We should have some wishes coming or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your crazy,\"  Scott laughs as he playfully hits Joe on the side of the head.  \"Leprechauns are bigger than a bug, I'm sure.  Besides, thats fairy tale stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do with him?\"  Scott continues.  \"Seth really wants him but I think we should make him the team mascot.  Maybe he is lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you stupid jocks, I'm not a mascot,\"  Eric yells in a fury.  \"I am a Professor at this university.  You have got to help me get back to my lab!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, he's making that little squeaking noise again,  Joe noticed with interest.  \"I wish we could understand what he was saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a guy rushes into the weight room and yells at Scott, \"Hey Scott, somebody is vandalizing your car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting about their little curiosity for the moment,  Scott and Joe hurriedly leave to find out what is going on.  Vulnerable little Eric had been left, trapped atop a titanic weight bench in a massive weight room occupied with eight muscle-bound football jocks oblivious to his tiny presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was horrified as,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing six foot four inches tall, he was 230 pounds of solid muscle.  A senior captain of the nationally ranked football team, Max spent many hours in the weight room chiselling his magnificent physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sweat dripping from his magnificent body, the muscle-bound jock straddled the weight bench, dumbbells in hand, and slowly lowered himself into position to begin his curls, oblivious the the minuscule half inch tall man just below him screaming in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stood mesmerized in the center of the massive weight bench as he watched the gargantuan football jock approach.  The tiny Professor was in awe as the muscular young giant effortlessly carried two enormous dumbbells.  Eric tried to imagine the weight of the dumbbells in comparison to his reduced size, but it was inconceivable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the muscular giant began to straddle the bench, the bug-sized Professor realized he was in big trouble, and began to scream in a wild panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't sit on me,\"  Eric screamed in terror, while jumping up and down and waving his hands in a futile effort to get the giant's attention.  \"Oh my God, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's faint little screams went unnoticed by the descending mountain of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was about to be accidentally crushed under the massive glutes of a hulking football jock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a basic instinct for survival, the tiny Professor began the run of his life.  The reduced man was doubtful he could escape being crushed by the giant's monster sized butt,  however after running on pure adrenaline, it seemed Eric had distanced himself  from the dangerous and humiliating death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's world shook violently as the football player landed with incredible force on the weight bench.  The tiny man had been temporarily spared, but Eric was still in immense danger, trapped between the enormous legs of a colossal football jock.  An unfortunate shift of just one of those mountains of flesh would mean certain death for the bug-sized man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was that of a locker room times ten.  Eric turned and realized the bulk of the smell was concentrated in the area of the giant's massive crotch.  The tiny Professor was shocked as he looked upon the football jock's jumbo-sized bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only escape route was the far end of the weight bench, which seemed like a mile a way, and even then would be followed by a drop that would compare to jumping from a 60 story building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Eric began his hasty escape from the dangerous giant, a drop of sweat the size of a large boulder engulfed him.  That one drop of sweat drenched the minuscule Professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith even more resolve, Eric regained his composure and continued his run to freedom.  After being knocked down several times due to the bench being shaken from the giant's movements, Eric reached the edge and looked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden jolt caused the bench shake and the tiny Professor fell over the edge.</span></div></div>",

His mind was having a great deal of difficulty grasping the fact he was a tiny passenger on the head of a colossal, muscle-bound athlete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought briefly that, if he could reach one of the giant's ears, he could scream for help and finally be heard. But, not even sure of his location on the giant's scalp, he was much too paralyzed with fear to try exploring, especially while the giant was on the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax, satisfied with his workout, moved out of the training room and headed toward the showers.

He stepped beneath a faucet and turned the water to hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had a very limited view, but he could hear perfectly well. He was alarmed and puzzled by the loud roaring noise that seemed to drown out every other sound. Not until the first blast of water from the shower soaked into the giant's scalp did Eric understand what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax ran his huge fingers through his scalp, working in the water. He enjoyed the warm water as it streamed over his head and body.

He struggled to retain his grasp on a thick hair, but his hold began to weaken. And then, the terrain shifted, sending him sliding through a jungle of hairs. He scrambled to grab one, and failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe washed from the giant's scalp, slipping onto the giant's forehead. A stream of water continued to push him along over the giant's face. He washed along the side of the giant's huge nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the giant tossed his head back. Eric was dropped back onto a level landscape, very near the giant's monstrous mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a jetstream of water collided with Eric's tiny body, sending him into a spiral. He dropped a good distance through open space, landing with a splat in a huge expanse of soapy lather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now sliding across the giant's massive chest. He was buffeted along in a river of water that dropped between the giant's huge pectoral muscles. He whisked past the giant's huge left nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught up in soap and water, the tiny professor was sticky enough to adhere to the giant's body...at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God! Help! Help me!\" Eric tried to scream over the roar of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued his descent over the landscape of the giant's body. The water broke in a series of waves across Max's muscular abdomen. He knew that, if his journey continued at this pace, he would be washed off or fall from the giant's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doubted he had the strength to avoid being washed down the drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric struggled valiantly. He slid in slow motion past Max's navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him, he saw Max's huge hands move back and forth across his torso, working the soapy lather about. Soon, the jock would begin to rinse all the soap from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got turned around, ended up facing ahead as he continued his downward trip. Below, he saw a nest of wiry black hairs and a soft but huge cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat might be his last hope.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He grabbed hold of one of the wiry coarse jet black pubic hairs and held on with all of his might.  A torrential downpour of  soapy shower water pummeled the tiny Professor.  Miraculously Eric managed to hang on.  He feared a fall from this distance would surely mean certain death.  And if the fall did not kill him,  one of Max's enormous feet would probably finish him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a temporary pause of the powerful downpour, Eric gasped as he looked down and witnessed Max's gigantic manhood.  It was massive.  Eric stared in disbelief at the muscled jock's beast-like member.  And then suddenly Eric almost lost his grip as the water once again beat down on him from all directions, but he held on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric screamed in terror as Max's mammoth hand brushed right by him, almost knocking him to the shower floor, and probable death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax finished rinsing the soap from his studly body, shut off the water and reached for a towel.  After toweling off, the jock football player headed back to his locker to get dressed, totally unaware of the tiny stowaway clinging precariously from one of his thick pubic hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scott and Joe exited the gym to check on Scott's truck, they were soaked with ice-water from two giant gatorade coolers.  Two of their jock buddies thought the two football stars had gotten too big for their britches, so they decided to bring them down a notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"  Scott said shivering, drenched in ice water.  He saw his buddies holding the empty coolers laughing hysterically.  Joe laughed too as he stood there in his wet skimpy workout shorts and t-shirt.  \"Very funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the chase was on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two culprits ran frantically back into the gym as they were being run down by two pissed muscular football jocks.  The two athletically gifted football players easily caught up with pranksters and wrestled them to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four men wrestled around on the gym floor while laughing until Scott and Joe held their opponents securely pinned to the gym floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give?\"  Joe said dripping with sweat and water, as he pinned his much smaller helpless opponent to the gym floor.  \"You're staying down there till you said it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe loved to dominate.  He would have made an excellent wrestler had he not focused all his efforts on football.  Scott loved a good prank, however he was rarely on the receiving end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four men stood up exhausted and patted each other on the back.  It had been an excellent release of tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two jock pranksters went for the showers, while Scott and Joe headed back to the weight room.  They had forgotten about the little bug-sized man they left to fend for himself back in the weight room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, he's gone,\" Scott said as he searched all around the weight bench.  \"He's got to be around here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have never left him here alone,\" Joe said as he knelt to the floor and scanned in vain for the miniature man.  \"I don't see him anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did any of you guys see a tiny man in here about this big?\" Scott quizzed the other weight lifters, indicating the size with his thumb and forefinger, not really realizing the absurdity of his question.  \"He was over there on that weight bench.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I saw him Scott,\" one of the muscular brutes said with mock concern, and then lifted his huge sneaker so that Scott could see the bottom.  \"I accidentally stepped on your tiny friend, and this is all thats left of the little fucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked at the bottom of the guys sneaker in horror as the other guys laughed.  Scott did not know if the guy was serious or just kidding. The bottom of his sneaker did look disgusting.  \"What a waste,\"  Scott thought somberly, imagining the tiny man's horrible demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not anywhere around here,\"  Joe yelled to Scott, still on the floor searching frantically.  \"Did any of those guys see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott slowly walked back over to where Joe was searching, his head lowered and gloomily said, \"One of those assholes squashed the little fellow with his sneaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have never left him here alone,\" Joe said.  \"Something that little did not even have a chance against these careless brutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going home,\"  Scott said, visibly disturbed.  \"I'll see ya later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K. buddy, see ya,\"  Joe said and gave Scott a consoling pat on the back.  Not feeling like working out any more, he went to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile holding on for dear life, Eric looked out and saw Max's enormous locker in front of him.  Max continued drying off a bit and then applied some deodorant under his arms.  He reached into his massive locker and grabbed a can of jock itch spray and began spraying a generous amount around his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe revolting liquidy powder covered the tiny man and filled his lungs.

Max's hand descended in what seemed almost like slow motion to the frantic shrunken man.  Just as Eric thought he was about to escape the awful sock, he slipped into the open mouth of the sock.  He was able to grab the edge just before falling into the deep moist cavern for which he knew there would be no return.  With all the strength he could muster, Eric pulled himself out of the sock opening and jumped off to the locker room floor.  A split second later, the giant scooped up his sock high into the air and proceeded to put it on his truly monster-sized foot.  Eric watched in horror and gasped as he realized how close he was to being smashed between the toes of that behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid the giant football player would mistake him for some awful bug that needed to be stepped on, Eric ran and hid at the edge of one of the giant lockers.  Eric looked on with fascination as the giant got dressed.  He was truly living in a world of giants.  He felt very small and insignificant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked off into the distance of the vast locker room and noticed a door.  It was labeled with building sized letters that read, \"COACH'S OFFICE\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God yes, Bruce will help me.  I have got to get in there,\"  Eric thought to himself with a renewed sense of determination.  \"Bruce, please be in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was coach Bruce Smith's fourth year as head football coach.  Eric and Bruce had become very good friends the past couple of years.  Coach Smith's first year was filled with turmoil as the team went winless and the star primadona  quarterback transferred to a rival school.  Alumni wanted him fired, but Professor Brevard was one of only a few supporters that wanted to give him a fair chance to turn the program around.  And this year it was all coming together.  The team was undefeated, ranked number one in the country, and only had to beat Michigan this Saturday to get a chance to play for the National Championship in the Fiesta Bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric estimated the door to be about nine feet away.  \"Just about a quarter mile for me,\" the half-inch tall man thought to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax had dressed and wondered over to talk to one of his football buddies.  Eric began his sprint.  He ran across the dull-green concrete floor, avoiding small pieces of dirt and lint that seemed as big as small boulders to him.  Half way to his goal,  Eric was startled as he looked up and saw a giant walking his way.  One of the wrestlers was headed in to take a shower after working out.  Eric was helpless as he saw the enormous wrestling shoe pound his way.  He just crouched, held his arms over his head, and waited.  The tiny man would be no match for the colossal shoe.  It would squash him to a pulp if it landed on him.  Eric held his breath as the horrific shoe landed right next to him.  He felt like he had just felt a magnitude ten earthquake.  Then the powerful shoe effortlessly lifted into the air and the giant was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stood up and continued his sprint to the door of the coach's office.  He reached the door and stopped to catch his breath.  Eric easily slipped under the door and entered the office.  He looked over and saw;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric peered over to the far corner of the office and saw Coach Smith sitting on an old ratty couch watching game film.  Coach had spent many a night on that couch.  Developing game plans lasted till the very early morning hours, so it made no sense to go home.  He would just work until exhaustion, and then crash on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was exhilarated when he saw Coach Smith.  Bruce would definitely help him.  Too tired to run anymore, Eric began walking towards the giant coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruce, hey Bruce, it's Eric.  You've got to help me!\"  Eric yelled in the direction of the giant coach, but his screams were so pitifully faint, Coach Smith could not hear them.  \"I have got to get closer so he can hear me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric approached his giant friend, he could not help looking up in awe at the magnificent man.  The mega-giant coach was huge.  Coach Smith was about 40, but was in great shape.  Tall and muscular, the thing Eric always noticed the most was his piercing blue eyes.  His blonde hair was buzz cut military style, giving him a slight drill Sargent look.  He was not mean to his players and did not yell a lot, but he did demand their respect, and undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric reached the giant couch, still attempting to get Coach Smith's attention, but the giant coach was oblivious to Eric's meager screams.  Eric had to find some way to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Smith had his grey athletic socked feet propped up on a table, and his old grungy Nike sneakers were sitting at the foot of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get closer so he can hear me,\"  Eric thought, so he began climbing one of Coach Smith's gigantic sneakers.  \"God Bruce, these things are worn out.  You'd think on eight hundred thousand a year, you could afford some new sneakers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric made it to the toe of the sneaker and yelled once again with no effect.  \"Why did I have to shrink so damn small?\"  Eric thought to himself in frustration.  \"I've just got to get higher.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man climbed up across the laces and made it to the edge of the opening of the shoe.  He started to crawl around to the heel of the sneaker.  He looked over the edge and gasped.  It was a very long way down into the shoe.  And the smell emitting from the dark cavern was horrible.  \"Just don't fall in...don't fall in,\"  Eric kept thinking to himself.  He looked up at the giant and yelled once again, \"Bruce, you have got to help me, please help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eric was just too small to hear.  Coach continued watching the Michigan game film with his remote control, rewinding any interesting plays that caught his attention.  Eric realized his attempt at climbing the shoe so he could be heard had been futile.  Now came the daunting task of getting down from the gigantic shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Eric could contemplate how he was going to get off the shoe, Eric was shaken violently when:</span></div></div>",

He quickly rolled onto his back and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach had now placed both feet on the floor and crossed the floor to reach into a compact fridge to remove a bottle of cold water.

A colossal foot encased in a massive grey cotton sock lifted over the old worn out sneaker Eric was trapped in.

The bug-sized Professor could not scale the smooth walls of the gigantic sneaker and he fell on his back, the enormous approaching toes filling his entire vision.

Those have had it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Smith reached down and picked up one of his old sneakers and held it proudly in the air as if he were presenting it to Scott.  It just happened to be the shoe his buddy Eric was trapped in.  Temporarily saved from being squashed like a bug,  the lifting effect of the sneaker was traumatic.  This and the revolting aroma that permeated the sneaker made Eric even more queasy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are just barely broken in,\"  the coach said turning the sneaker around so Scott could take in the view at all angles.  \"And anyway, these are my lucky sneakers.  They ain't going nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an effort to humor his coach, Scott grabbed the sneaker and pretended to examine it with fascination.  Just as he was about to hand it back to his coach, he glanced inside and spotted something that looked like a tiny bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach, you've got a bug in your shoe,\"  Scott exclaimed.</span></div></div>",

As the two men reached the steps that led to the parking lot,  the young quarterback suddenly stopped and gave the Coach a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Scott?\" Coach asked.  Scott just stood there motionless in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweltering sneaker was about to finish off the helpless Professor.  The pressure from Bruce's foot was powerful and Eric felt he could not last much longer before he suffocated.   The pitiful shrunken man was worn out.  He had no fight left in him.  He was ready for it all to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your shoe off Coach, and be careful,\"  Scott said.  \"I want to have a look at that bug again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious Coach, take your damn shoe off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Smith was startled.  His star quarterback had never cussed him before.  Bruce sat down on the steps and slowly removed his shoe that he had trapped the unlucky bug in.  Coach was concerned about Scott weirding out on him just before the big game.  Coach lifted his shoe and glanced at the tiny creature trapped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go Scott, here's your little bug,\"  Coach said as he tilted his sneaker over Scott's hand and let the little bug topple into his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott lifted the little man close to his face and exclaimed, \"I don't know how, but I had a feeling that it was you little buddy.  I hope you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggy little Eric looked up and realized he was once again in the massive hand of one of his giant jock students.  It sure beat Bruce's sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starting to worry me Scott,\"  Coach said as he put his grungy sneaker back on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach, let's go back to your office.  I have something incredible to show you,\"  Scott said with a sudden burst of happiness.  \"This is really going to freak you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular football player carefully enclosed the tiny man within his hand and hurried back to Coach Smith's office, the Coach following close behind, wondering what the hell was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic football jock gently placed tiny Eric on Coach Smith's desk and switched on a lamp that was on the desk.  Eric looked up at Scott and his giant friend Bruce and waved.  \"Hey Bruce, it's me, Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Smith took his reading glasses from his pocket and took a look at Scott's little bug.  \"Whaddaya  think Coach? You ever seen a man this tiny before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just can't be,\"  Coach Smith replied in disbelief, and moved closer to get a better look.  \"Oh my God!  Eric is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes, it's me!\"  Professor Brevard yelled at the giant coach.  \"Oh, thank God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this little guy?\"  Scott asked as he examined the tiny man even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Eric Brevard!\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"You mean Professor Brevard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, how the hell did this happen to you?\"  Bruce asked and his hurricane strength breath knocked the little guy to his butt.  \"Oh, I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach, you have got to be careful.  He is really fragile.  I can't believe this is Professor Brevard.  This is so feaky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric yelled up at the giants hovering over him, but his meager voice was inaudible to the behemoths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have got to figure out a way to communicate with him,\"  Coach told Scott.  \"You got any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Greg has a amp for his electric guitar,\"  Scott thought out loud.  \"We could hook up a microphone to that and maybe we could hear him then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea!\"  Coach said as he grabbed the phone from his desk and handed it to Scott.  \"Give Greg a call and tell him to get his butt over here right now with that amp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang tight Eric, we are going to get to the bottom of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not Greg!\"  Eric thought in a panic as he remembered the cocky jock known as the exterminator that tried to feed him to their horrible pet lizard.

The tiny man could only watch in bemused fascination as the animated muscular jock quarterback rambled almost incoherently to Coach Smith about the day\u2019s events and his bug-sized college professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026this is the most incredible, freakin thing I have ever,\u201d the buff college athlete excitedly expressed his thoughts to his somber and more rational football coach.  \u201cI can\u2019t wait till Greg gets here with that amp so we can find out what the hell happened to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust calm down Scott,\u201d Coach Smith urged his star quarterback as he tried to juggle the thoughts of the upcoming biggest football game of his life, and the horrific fate of his friend and colleague.  \u201cWe will get to the bottom of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric waited anxiously for yet another colossal college jock to arrive, he could not help but look skyward at the two magnificent, all-powerful giants that loomed over him.  Scott was truly an impressive young man.  It was all his ultra-tight shirt could manage to contain his overly muscled torso and bulging biceps.  And his friend Bruce wasn\u2019t too bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt a little bad that all this was happening right before the huge game.  Even though Eric wasn\u2019t the biggest football fan, he knew how much this one football game meant to his friend.  One win here against their fiercest rival Michigan meant a guaranteed spot in the National Championship game at the Fiesta Bowl.  And now tiny Eric knew he had become a major distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Joe and Greg rushed into Coach Smith\u2019s office with the amplifier Greg used to jam out with his electric guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you found my little bug man?\u201d Joe asked excitedly as he walked up to Scott and Coach.  \u201cWhere is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre all of you insane?\u201d Greg asked with a mocking laugh as he held on to his amplifier.  \u201cOkay, where can I set this fucking thing?  It\u2019s getting really heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is right there on the desk Joe,\u201d Scott told his jock buddy.  \u201cAnd you ain\u2019t going to believe this, but your little bug man is actually Professor Brevard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck!\u201d Greg exclaimed in complete disbelief as he saw a tiny man standing on Coach Smith\u2019s desk.  \u201cThat is not possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s watch the language Greg,\u201d Coach Smith informed his athlete sternly.  \u201cSet that amp on the edge of the desk, and be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry coach,\u201d Greg apologized remembering the unofficial rule of cursing in the coach\u2019s office.  He carefully set the amp down on the edge of the desk and plugged in a microphone.  \u201cThere, that\u2019s got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric cringed as Greg set the enormous black box on the desk.  Even though Greg was extremely carefully, the impact knocked the shrunken Professor to his butt.  Eric watched in awe as Greg plugged a microphone into the monstrous amplifier.  Greg then placed the tractor trailer sized microphone next to the minuscule man as Coach and the two other muscular college athletes watched with intense curiosity.  Greg then plugged the amp into a nearby outlet and turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019s my little bug man doing?\u201d Joe asked the tiny Professor in the same manner he would talk to a pet.  \u201cCan you talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is not a bug man!  He is my friend Eric Brevard,\u201d Coach Smith gruffly informed Joe as he gave him a rough shove on the head.  \u201cHe is to be treated with the utmost respect!  Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sorry coach,\u201d Joe said a little surprised Coach had roughed him up a bit.  \u201cI got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four giants then focused all their attention on the shrunken man next to the microphone.  Coach Smith spoke as the other behemoths held their breath with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEric, how did this happen to you?\u201d Coach softly asked and then waited anxiously for an answer.  A few seconds of total silence followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Bruce, you know that important project I have been working on so hard for the past several months,\u201d Eric began what he knew would be a lengthy explanation.  \u201cIt was a shrink-ray.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four mega-giant men listened in complete awe as tiny Eric began the saga that found him here in Coach\u2019s office, shrunk to a mere half an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I got it to work.  I used the device on myself with the intent that I would only be shrunk momentarily, and then the machine would return me to normal,\u201d Eric continued.  \u201cBut something went wrong and I was stuck like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncredible!\u201d Scott mumbled.  \u201cSo how the hell did you end up in that jar in Joe\u2019s room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually Scott\u2026when you visited my office, I stowed away in your backpack in that pocket with the tootsie rolls,\u201d Eric answered the curious giant jock.  \u201cYou almost gobbled me up when you ate one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry man,\u201d Scott sheepishly apologized with a smile as he was told of the bizarre events.  \u201cI had no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Scott,\u201d Eric consoled the muscular college guy.  \u201cYou actually saved my life by getting me out of Bruce\u2019s shoes.  I thought I was definitely a goner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s stomach knotted up as he realized the horror he had put the tiny man though while thinking he was nothing but a mere bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Professor, I\u2019m so sorry I did all that fucking crap to you back at the frat house,\u201d Greg apologized profusely to the shrunken man.  \u201cI really had no idea\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget about it Greg,\u201d Professor Brevard spoke directly into the microphone to the relieved young titan.  \u201cThat\u2019s all in the past now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think we better get you fixed up and back to normal Eric,\u201d Coach Smith strongly interjected.  \u201cNow how do we do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before Eric could speak his instructions, Scott's giant voice sounded through the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Coach, do we gotta do it now? I mean, look at him, he's unharmed! He can wait an hour or so, can't he? The game's about to come on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, I don't think-\" but Bruce was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach - come on.

He no longer wished to be like that, that horrible invention was a mistake from the beginning. \"Okay. But everyone be careful, alright? Greg, turn it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Greg hurried to the television and grabbed the remote before sitting down on the couch with his two friends and teacher to watch the game. With Eric watched with a great sigh as they all stomped away from him, their footsteps echoing in his ears. What was he to do now? What was he to do for the entire length of the game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach, you got food or anything?\" Joe asked, refusing to take his eyes off the television screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got sodas in the fridge and chips under my desk...\" Bruce said. He waited a moment or two, before standing and hurried walking past Eric to the small refrigerator behind his desk. A gust of wind sent Eric flying across the desktop to the very edge, where his friend was bent over, grabbing four large, glass bottles from the fridge. Bruce stood straight again, and not looking at where he was placing his bottles, he quickly placed them on the desk. Eric, in fear of the giant glass beverage, backed up and fell off the desk. He plummeted through the air currents to the tile floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?!\" he cried to himself...</span></div></div>",

The fall took him away from the proximity of the microphone and amplifier on Bruce's desk. \"They can't hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that moment, Bruce shifted and he lifted one of his fearsome-sized sneakers to re-join his team's star players Joe, Scott and Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Coach Smith still wore the old grungy Nike sneakers\u2014 the same footwear the entrapped scientist had spent time in previously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stared up at his tall, muscular, friend. He looked positively mountainous. He saw the blonde hair, buzz cut military style, far aloft atop the colossal head. His sheer size demand respect, from both his huge, burly platers and other men.

Eric thought. Was it too much to ask that they miss one freaking ball game and get him back to his lab where he could unshrink himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a mess, coach?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce, looking down at the floor and his desktop, sounded horrified as he spoke. \"Don't anyone move!\" Bruce commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Scott inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Eric!\" Bruce said. \"He's missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing the direct opposite of what they had been instructed, the three huge jocks lumbered onto their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Joe cried. \"Where has he gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!\" Bruce raised his voice in alarm. \"I told you not to move!

Again, he sighed in relief. \"Don't you guys understand?\" Bruce said in a worried tone. \"He's missing, and he's barely half an inch tall! We have got to be very careful! We could crush him without even realizing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe whistled. \"Gee, I didn't even think about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where could he be?\" Scott said. \"We left him right there on the desktop?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, instead of taking a step forward, the enormous shoe moved back and then began to lower back toward the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shrieked in terror and tried to run, but it was far too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to look for the tiny man for nearly half an hour before even Bruce admitted defeat. He hoped he might turn up\u2026 eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, when he pulled off his sneakers before bed, he dropped the grungy shoes on the floor near his bed. The soles were so grimy and filthy, it was impossible to see the teeny splat that represented the final seconds of professor Eric Braysen. The thick gray grunge and other debris in the tread of the old sneakers simply swallowed up the tiny remains of a once brilliant scientist.</span></div></div>",

He fidgeted with his pen and notepad while waiting for the arrival of his interview subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie ran through his research on the coach: age 38, a graduate of Georgia Tech and currently in only his second college coaching job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, personal life,\" Charlie mumbled. \"Not married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his last-minute scan of his notes, Charlie didn't notice a tiny shape that emerged from beneath the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Eric managed to enter Coach Smith's office without any difficulty by simply slipping through the space between the floor and the bottom of the door. The fact he didn't even need to lower his head emphasized yet again how truly tiny he had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few seconds to look around the room. Although impatient to gain his friend's assistance, he fought back any impulse to act without careful consideration. He had learned some valuable lessons with his earlier close calls with giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a huge man seated in a chair in front of a mountainous desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not Bruce,\" Eric said as he gazed toward the face of the young man seated in front of his friend's desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with this unexpected turn of events, Eric approached cautiously, trying to determine the identity and purpose of the young man in the coach's office. He didn't look like one of the team's athletic players. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer to the seated giant, an unexpected impact close to him sent him diving for cover.

That sounded insignificant until consideration is given that the notebook looked the size of a basketball court to the shrunken scientist. The impact knocked him off his stick-thin legs and sent him rolling across the floor. Landing on his back, Eric instinctively raised his arms as if he could ward off the incoming second blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the giant didn't follow with a second swipe, which almost certainly would have included a more precise aim and disastrous results for the minuscule professor, Eric dared to take a deep breath. The adrenaline pumped into his body prepared him for another attempt at flight should the giant try to visit destruction on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, as Eric huddled beside a colossal desk leg, which resembled an architectural feature more than a support for a piece of cheap furniture, his tiny ears attuned to the distorted and thunderous conversation taking place between his titanic friend and the reporter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was nothing,\" Charlie said in a voice that boomed in Eric's ears. \"A bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric heard his friend laugh and remark that, no matter how often he sprayed for them, he could not seem to exterminate all the bugs. Visions of a giant hand brandishing a can of industrial-strength insecticide haunted teeny Eric as he listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youthful journalist laughed, but offered, \"This one looked weird, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Eric exclaimed, as he darted away from the shelter of the desk leg. \"Listen to him, Bruce,\" the tiny man dared to hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted a better look at the two giants, and he got it. He stared up at the two massive torsos and hears that loomed on the other side of the desk. Bruce sat behind his desk and the reporter leaned forward in a seat placed to the side of the massive plateau of weathered wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other side of the desk, however, Eric could not see the entire bodies of the two giants. But, he reckoned that in a positive light. After all, while seated the giants were not stomping around the office in their dangerous, cruiseship-sized footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the conversation drifted away from Charlie's sighting of a \"strange bug\" and got down to the business of an interview about the team's expectations for its upcoming big game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interlude still represented Eric's best chance to communicate his nightmarish dilemma to someone who might possibly represent rescue and salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I could reach Bruce's desktop,\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the shadowy recesses beneath the desk, he saw tangles of cords and cables, all trailing skyward to connect to devices, such as a phone and computer, atop the coach's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a little shaky as he ventured back beneath the desk. The surge of adrenaline was still working through his system, but he tried to realistically estimate his chances of successfully scaling one of the cables to reach the distant desktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only chance I've got,\" Eric said, not willing to face a locker room universe of frightening, colossal jocks that he knew waited for him outside the four walls of Bruce's office. Bruce represented his best hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping his mind focused only on the challenging ascent ahead of him, Eric walked beneath the desk toward the Gordian Knot of cables in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing distracting him was the unceasing tap of Bruce's right shoe. This nervous tic, greatly magnified from tiny Eric's perspective, gave the shrunken scientist pause before he continued toward his objective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing closer, Eric stopped for an instant to marvel at the sheer size of that titanic shoe. The repetitive tapping of the shoe against the dingy tiles actually sent a detectable vibration through the floor, easily felt beneath Eric's teeny legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, Eric sprinted past the shoe and continued his trek, which brought him within proximity of a massive tangle of cords, wires and cables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chose a thin cable, which in his tiny hands still retained a cord-like thickness. Wrapping his legs around the rope and pulling with his hands, he began the difficult climb.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlike his friend the coach, Eric had spent more time recently in his laboratory working on his shrink ray rather than staying fit at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't completely out of shape, however, and after a grueling climb, managed to clamber onto the wide desktop. He was so exhausted, he collapsed on all fours, fighting to regain his breath and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the interview continued with Charlie asking Bruce questions for the planned article for the sports section of the local newspaper. The voices of the two giants rumbled incoherently as Eric tried to determine his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape of Bruce's desk was cluttered with an assortment of papers, clipboards, a stapler and a large coffee mug emblazoned with the team logo that Bruce used to hold pencils and pens. The distant side of the plateau-sized desk held Bruce's desktop computer and an outmoded land-line telephone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom previous experience, Eric didn't want to betray his presence without careful planning. All the previous times he had been sighted by a giant, a case of mistaken identity had almost brought down catastrophe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he felt sure the giants were not looking in his direction, he sprinted into the shadow formed by the long, black stapler. The building-sized office tool gave the tiny man a perfect place to hide while still observing the two giants and figuring out his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some stats I wanted to give you,\" Bruce announced to Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shadow fell over the stapler and Eric as Bruce stretched out his arm and picked up several sheets of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me staple them together for you,\" the coach offered helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, hearing his friend's intent, froze in place. Before he could react, Bruce shoved the sheets of paper into the stapler. He slammed down his hand to drive the staples into the sheets of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosive sound as the stapler did its work sounded like a thunderclap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he gave the papers to the young writer, Bruce asked, \"Would you care for a drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie nodded and uttered an appreciative \"thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, tiny Eric stumbled away from the protective shadow of the stapler. There was a dull ringing in his ears. The incident with the stapler had left the tiny man temporarily deafened. He shook his head to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard thunderous exchanged between the giants, but he could not make out their words because of the unceasing ringing in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he was startled when Bruce rose from his chair to grab two sodas from the fridge in the corner of his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's startled reaction must have provided a glimpse of tiny size and motion to Charlie. He stared at the desktop near the stapler, studying the spot he was certain he had seen something.</span></div></div>",

He had blond hair and blue-gray eyes. The apparent mismatch of physical attributes, interests and backgrounds somehow managed to work in their favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax could not get enough of Taylor, and Max fulfilled many of Taylor's adolescent fantasies about huge, strapping jocks. Taylor, the more comfortable of the two, didn't spend much time worrying about his sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax, however, wouldn't budge. He didn't want any of his teammates to know he was gay. There would be time for that later, after college, with his sports career behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless he got drafted onto an NFL team, a real possibility if the college could continue dominating opponents for a few more weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, he only wanted to dominate Taylor, who met him at the door with a long kiss. Max pushed inside Taylor's apartment and tossed his gym bag on the floor near Taylor's sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor, as he knew how to do so expertly, soon turned the tables on his huge stud. He began to work on Max the moment he got inside the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've missed you,\" he whispered as he ran his hands across his boyfriend's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry,\" Max stammered. \"Practice. It's been a killer. Coach wants us to be ready for the playoffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has he worked you really hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, really hard?\" Taylor's eyes shone in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor grinned and retrieved Max's bag. He unzipped the bag and put his face down to it. He took a deep breath. \"Smells like it. Mmmm, reminds me of my big, hot jock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax felt himself stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put on your workout gear,\" Taylor instructed. \"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax began to strip off his clothes. Taylor watched intently as his huge, muscled boyfriend stood naked. Taylor dug into the bag and handed Max his jockstrap and the green workout shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just gonna have me out of these again in a few minutes,\" Max said. He felt a little shy standing so exposed in front of his fully-dressed boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's part of the fun, big guy,\" Taylor countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey only had eyes for each other at the moment. They didn't notice a tiny figure desperate to gain their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Eric tried to gain a sense of his location. He had heard the bag unzip and a huge hand reached in. Then, at dizzying speed, he felt himself lifted into the  air.</span></div></div>",

Let's get you out of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax liked the feeling of the shorts being slid down his legs. When Taylor tugged the shorts to the floor, Max stepped deftly out of them and Taylor tossed the shorts to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly awash in light, Eric, a clinging speck with a tight grasp on a single strand of pubic hair, saw the distant drop to the floor. He tried to climb through the hairs, soon finding  himself tangled in the thick forest of Max's wiry, black pubic hairs. With the massive titan on the move, the tiny man again grabbed hold of a single hair and prepared to hold on with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax leaned against a wall. Taylor, already on his knees, reached for his boyfriend's huge, hard cock. Taylor cupped Max's balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire scene played out before Eric, a tiny voyeur caught up, unknowingly, in the encounter between the two giants. Emotions raced around in Eric's brain, ranging from sheer awe to helpless nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax, backed against the wall of the apartment, felt Taylor's hot breath lower down. Taylor gave his boyfriend's huge cock a few more strokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, from a precarious location, looked up into a giant face. A pair of giant eyes were fastened on him, or so it seemed. Eric felt his breathing stop, as his heart froze. Could the giant see him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric dared to wave and shout, but the giant's eyes closed now. Eric, at the base of the huge hard shaft, saw the towering obelisk of flesh extending up. From the tiny man's point of view, the enormous erection looked  almost 100 feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's reaction, partly involuntary, was to go rock hard as he stared up at the unbelievably huge, hard cock. He leaned back, reclining between several strands of pubic hair, and stared up in wonder at the enormous shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with surprising speed, Taylor's cavernous mouth opened over the shaft and began to engulf it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's lips came down almost to the base of the shaft, mere inches from Eric's dangerous location on one of the outer hairs covering Max's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, shocked by the speed of the giant, screamed and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A stream of the giant's saliva swept tiny Eric from the strand of hair and caused him to lose himself in Taylor's huge mouth. He screamed and struggled as he tried to orient himself in the huge living cavern. He bumped against a huge wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's his teeth!\" Eric cried, finding himself behind Taylor's wall of teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor began to slide his mouth up and down the length of the shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric failed to climb the sleek enamel wall of teeth, although his panicked brain told him he needed to escape\u2014 and soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a thick, warm flood poured down on Eric, trapping him in a sticky mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor felt his boyfriend erupt in his mouth.

Eric scrambled to zip up his jeans and look through the glass. He saw Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe ignored the jar on the shelf. He stripped off his T-shirt and pants. Then, dressed only in boxers, he reclined on his bed, his arms folded behind his head. From the jar, Eric watched the resting giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Joe shifted his gaze and noticed the jar. He saw the tiny \"bug\" at the front of the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood, deciding to have some fun with his interesting new \"pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unscrewed the lid off the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Eric cowered. \"What's he going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the jar tipped and Eric slid out, landing in Joe's meaty fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe returned to the bed. Stretched out on his back, Joe lowered his hand to his ridged stomach and dropped tiny Eric onto a landscape of amazing abdominal muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe watched as the tiny bug began to walk around, getting a sense for its new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he doing?\" Eric wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter. This could be his chance. Eric started walking , hoping to make his way close to the enormous head attached at the top of this magnificent torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he had only gotten a few inches when Joe, laughing, picked him up and deposited him lower still, between Joe's navel and his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, determined, began a trek northward on Joe's colossal body. Once again, just as he passed the six-foot deep pit of Joe's \"innie\" belly button, Joe's massive fingers plucked him up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe laughed, amused at the little bug's stubborn antics. No matter how many times he stopped its progress, the tiny bug seemed attached to a specific pathway along Joe's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Eric heard a pounding on Joe's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, also surprised, shifted his body, causing Eric to tumble lower toward the massive crotch. The loose waistband of the boxers permitted him to tumble beneath toward some monumental close encounters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Scott entered. \"I need to borrow some toothpaste,\" the jock said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Joe said. He looked down and noticed that the little bug had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, looking for the bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt everything shift as Joe stood. He landed in the stretch of fabric between the boxers' huge leg openings. Joe took a step, knocking Eric beneath his gigantic balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott, who had gotten a tube of toothpaste, came back in and saw Joe looking among his bedcovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Did you lose something?\" Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Joe said, totally unaware that his tiny \"bug\" now resided within his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for the toothpaste, See ya.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As big a a skyscraper, the giant jock was moving about the room gathering up various garbage and depositing it into the massive garbage bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny little Professor gazed up in awe and amazement at the colossal youth.  He wore baggy jeans that revealed the top of his boxers, and a loose t-shirt with the school logo.  A baseball cap turned backwards coolly topped off the magnificent creature.  As the young giant moved closer, Eric was alarmed as he gazed upon the jock's gigantic sneakers.  Eric was quite intimidated as the powerful sneakers pounded closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was a star player on the baseball team.  He was tall, lean and muscular.  He was the only baseball player living in the frathouse and had become best friends with Seth, their common bond being neither was on the football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Justin's turn to clean up the god-awful mess in the reck room.  This was not Justin's idea of fun and he dreaded it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need a bulldozer to clean all this shit up!\"  Justin exclaimed.  He looked around the room and pondered his seemingly endless task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin began filling the oversized extra strong trash bag with old pizza boxes, beer bottles and soda cans.  He moved randomly about the room, and was walking dangerously close to where the tiny professor was cowering, next to an empty soda can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, he's coming this way!\" Eric said to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric trembled as the ground-shaking colossal jock sneakers pounded their way on a collision course with the insect-sized man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing out of instinct and fear, not considering the ramifications, Eric ran to the closest shelter he could find.  The empty soda can.  Not a good idea!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked out of the opening and saw the mammoth jock's sneakers approaching his hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, he's going to crush this can,\" Eric thought to himself, as he stood in the hollow aluminum can, petrified with fear.  He waited for his fate.  The miniscule Professor was about to be crushed by a gigantic jock's sneaker, or simply trashed as simple garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin had picked up trash for five solid minutes.  He stopped and gazed at his progress.  Hardly a dent.  He decided to take a break.  Justin removed a bag of chewing tobacco out of his back pocket, took some out and loaded his mouth up.  When it came to chewing tobacco, his baseball player instincts took over.  The more the better.  Justin looked around for something to use as a spit can.  He saw an empty soda can lying on the floor that didn't look too grody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, this should do the trick,\" Justin mumbled, as he grabbed the soda can and sat down at the table to relax and have a chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Eric's universe shifted and turned violently and unexpectedly as the giant jock baseball player grabbed the nearly empty soda can.  Eric slammed into the bottom of the can, still slightly sticky from the last remnants of old soda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric feared he was about to be thrown away as trash, but he was sadly mistaken.  He looked up out of the hollow prison and could see Justin's enormous face.  The minuscule professor was puzzled as to why this giant jock was just sitting there holding the empty soda can in his jumbo-sized hand.  He noticed the giant jock was chewing something in those massive jaws of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was suddenly terrified when he saw the giant jock's enormous mouth approach the opening of the soda can.  Eric screamed like he had never screamed in his life.  And then everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn total darkness, the bug-sized man was pummeled by an endless supply of the titanic jock's disgusting tobacco spit.  Eric was covered in the revolting liquid.  Choking and gasping for breath, the tiny professor managed to wipe the thick hideous liquid from his face.  Eric had about 20 seconds worth of peace and the ghastly event was repeated.  Eric was now waist high in disgusting baseball jock tobacco spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please someone help me!\" Eric yelled, half choking on tobacco spit.  This was not the way the brilliant professor wanted to meet his demise --  to be drowned in a pool of tobacco spit, and then casually discarded as trash, no one the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin sat at the table chewing his tobacco, not a care in the world except for the moment the task of cleaning up the messy reck room.

There was no way he'd be able to remain afloat in the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he heard Justin talking to the giant Seth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! Oh please, help!\" Eric screamed until he was hoarse. He tried to slosh through the sludge of tobacco spit to position himself to see through the can's open tab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he looked up he saw a giant hand coming toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the entire can and its contents begin to swirl in a maelstrom. His feet slipped out from under him, and Eric plunged under the foul semi-liquid contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he surfaced, spluttering, trying to get a breath, he heard Seth riding Justin about his \"disgusting habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, with another jolt, the can was returned to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric feared the volume of tobacco spit in the can was about to increase when he felt a terrific impact and everything turned upside-down yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some stroke of luck, the can landed on its side, and Eric crawled through tobacco sludge and exited through the open tab. His muscles were weak. He couldn't manage to walk. He crawled across a massively wide tabletop, seeking some place where he could conceal his tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck this!\" Seth said. \"I'm hungry. We can clean when we get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants walked out of the room. Their footsteps, which caused tiny vibrations to shudder through the tabletop, grew fainter as they left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short rest period, Eric managed to regain some strength. But his clothes were stained and filthy. They reeked of tobacco. He stripped off his lab coat, shirt, his pants, even his underpants and teeny shoes and socks, until he was standing naked on the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his skin was still stinking of tobacco. The filthy spit was even in his hair. Bad enough being as tiny as a bug. Now he felt miserable. He had always practiced a tidy personal hygiene. He hated to feel dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he saw the different-looking label on an overturned bottle. It was a blue and white label. Eric was thrilled by his discovery. Apparently, not every jock chugged beer and soda. At least one of the giants was health-conscious enough to enjoy a bottled water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please, please,\" Eric chanted as he ran toward the open end of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank God!\" Eric cried. He crawled into the open end of the bottle and ran into the center of the glass container. A residue of several inches of clean water remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist splashed in the water, cleaning his naked body. He fell back in the water and let his hair fall back into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he was finished, the water was fairly filthy, but he felt much, much cleaner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now he was naked. He glanced down at his bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ready to get out of the bottle when...</span></div></div>",

Justin? Where is everyone?\" Scott's voice boomed. He dropped the gigantic gourd heavily onto the table. The impact jarred Eric and caused him to slide back down into the bottle momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric trembled involuntarily while gazing out at the titanic jock and the enormous pumpkin. Scott, in the meantime, spread out an old newspaper on the tabletop. He called again for his buddies. They had promised to help him carve out the Jack-O'-Lantern for the Halloween bash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had one thought in mind \u2014 get out of the way! Scott's hand swept the bottle to the edge of the table to make room for carving the pumpkin. Eric barely managed to grasp the lip of the bottle opening in time to keep from falling back inside. Instead, the sudden rolling motion of the bottle caused Eric to topple forward out of the opening, and he sprawled out onto a vast expanse of newsprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he started to pull himself to his feet, Eric heard a loud, wet \"squelch\" as Scott used a huge knife to carve out a lid in the pumpkin. Next, the jock reached in and pulled out a handful of pumpkin innards. He dumped the mound of stringy pulp and seeds onto the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of pumpkin surrounded Eric \u2014 a welcome change from the pungent tobacco spittle. Eric stumbled back away from the mountain of pumpkin pulp that had just splattered before him a bit too closely for his comfort. Before he could get far, though, Scott's enormous hand was over him, and a second handful of cool, slimy pulp dumped down onto the tiny professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like he might be crushed beneath the weight of the mere handful of pumpkin pulp. Eric clawed his way out from under the pumpkin guts. He had to push aside slime-covered seeds bigger than his half-inch tall body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott recalled how tasty roasted pumpkin seeds can be and decided to set some aside for just that purpose. His hand came down toward the pile of pulp and seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric squirmed through the mass of pulp and seeds, finally breaking through the surface and gasping in a lungful of air. As he opened his eyes again, however, he saw Scott's huge, pumpkin-smudged hand looming toward him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing mom's recipe for roasted pumpkin seeds came through this morning,\" Scott mused aloud, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Eric could move, Scott's hands scooped up the pile of pulp and seeds, and Eric found himself wedged between two of the jock's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scott dumped the seed-pulp mixture into a waiting bowl, Eric:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here's to many more! :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric cowered as Scott's huge hand closed around him. He found himself wedged between two of the giant's fingers, pressed there by a wall of pumpkin pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scott released his hold on the pulp and seeds, Eric found that he was still stuck to the giant jock's fingers, seemingly glued there by the sticky juices of the pumpkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Eric's presence, Scott grabbed a large spoon and reached back into the shell of the pumpkin to continue the task of clearing it of seeds and pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached inside the hollowed-out gourd, his hand hit against the side of the pumpkin and dislodged tiny Eric. The shrunken scientist fell suddenly, landing on the soft, almost sponge-like bottom of the pumpkin that had been gutted for a Jack-o'-lantern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of the giant vegetable looked like a dark, alien landscape to the miniature scientist. Strings of pumpkin pulp laced the interior of the shell, and the flesh of the pumpkin had a cool, clammy feel. Despite it's enormous size, Eric had a sense of claustrophobia, as if he had been trapped in a cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up toward the opening cut into the strange, orange ceiling of the pumpkin. He looked up just in time to see the huge spoon re-enter the pumpkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to dodge away from the spoon as it scraped along the interior of the shell. It moved quickly, but the bulk of the pulp and seeds had already been extracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott tried to scrape the last few bits of string from the sides of his pumpkin. He withdrew the spoon again and shook another spoonful of pulp into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric ran toward the center of the pumpkin. He stood below the opening and cupped his hands to his mouth. \"Hey! Scott! Help me!\" Eric shouted. \"Get me out of here!\" At that moment, as though in mocking response to his cry for help, Eric was startled by the loud sound of an enormous knife blade slicing thickly through the shell of the pumpkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade sawed through the curved orange dome overhead, carving out a large triangular chunk of the thick shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sprinted across the bizarre landscape to the other side of the pumpkin. He stopped and again turned to watch as the section of pumpkin \u2014 many times larger than himself \u2014 slid out of the hole, grasped between Scott's gigantic fingers. Light shone in through the new window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realized that Scott must be carving the face on his Jack-o'-lantern. But that didn't make him any less fearful of the enormous, sharp-edged blade that kept plunging into the pumpkin's thick, orange rind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted up at the giant through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott!! Scott! Please hear me! It's me -- Dr. Brevard!!\" But the more Eric shouted, the less he believed that his giant student could hear him \u2014 whether from his tiny size, the sound-deadening effects of the pumpkin rind, or a combination of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mammoth knife's sharp blade continued carving out two eyes, a nose and a jagged mouth on the face of the pumpkin's surface. Having added the features, Scott replaced the cap on his Jack-o'-lantern. \"Now I just need to find a candle,\" the huge jock said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sprinted back toward the newly cut openings. If he could somehow reach the mouth, he might be able to climb out before having to deal with a giant wax candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his half-inch size, however, even the lowest point in the carved mouth was over his head by several body lengths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the lid back in place, the interior of the pumpkin was shadowy, illuminated only by the facial openings of the Jack-o'-lantern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric pushed a stringy piece of pumpkin pulp aside \u2014 and then had he thought. Perhaps he could use the string to climb higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried, but the wet, slick pumpkin string was impossible to climb. He fell back, ending up sprawled on his back on the mushy bottom of the pumpkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the lid opened and bright light shined back into the interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched as Scott's colossal hand held a huge, black votive candle over the opening and slowly lowered it into the cavity of the pumpkin. The spicy scent of the candle wax mixed with the powerful smell of pumpkin, almost overwhelming Eric. The smooth base of the candle settled onto the pulpy floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you look lit up,\" Scott suggested under his breath, retracting his hand. He struck a match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could see the sudden flare of light above him even before Scott began to lower the flame toward the candle....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smell was god-awful.  It was strong and pungent, and all around him.  He held his breath for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I will never get used to this smell,\"  Eric thought to himself.  \"Where in the hell am I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric noticed a deep, dark cavern in front of him, and freedom high above.  He had fallen into some kind of hole.  Eric looked up and saw a giant number 15 on the enormous rounded wall and then it dawned on him.  He was in a shoe.  \"Oh God no!\"  he thought.  He had fallen into one of those giant jock's colossal sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all his might, the reduced man ran at one of the sneaker walls and jumped, trying to dig into the smooth cloth wall any way he could.  He made it a couple feet, and then fell back into the shoe.  The wall of the worn, old nasty sneaker was just to smooth to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dreadful feeling of gloom and despair fell over the pitiful half-inch tall man.  He was trapped.  Trapped in the sneaker of some gargantuan young brute, with size 15 feet no less.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Eric was unable to get the attention of the king-sized athlete when he showed up to get his sneakers, he would certainly be squashed to a pulp under one of his monstrous feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, what's the rush?\"  Scott asked Jason as he stormed into the room headed for the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to hurry, or I'm going to be late for wrestling practice,\"  Jason replied as he opened the door to the gear closet.  \"Coach will kill me if I'm late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"National champion two years in a row, and undefeated as a junior,\"  Greg chimed in.  \"Coach should be kissin your feet.

The strokes rose and fell with a rising rhythm. Eric was sure he would be crushed. <br>\r\nInstead, he managed to survive...although he was moved, inch by inch, up the shaft until he found himself over the massive cock's head. Sprawled over the slit, he was relieved to be free of each of the mighty strokes.<br>\r\nBut, a change in the giant's groans alerted him to a new danger.<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\nEthan grabbed a tissue second before he came, shooting off into the wad of thin paper. He quickly crumpled the tissue, completely oblivious to the fact a shrunken professor had been blasted into the tissue with his load.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Water rushed down along the steeply curving sides, and Eric could already feel the surface swelling and a strong undertow developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny, panicked scientist scrambled against the rapidly forming current, trying to swim to the side of the smooth bowl. The water began to swirl faster, and Eric felt the center begin to sink into an enormous whirlpool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Oh, God -- NO!!\" he screamed. His hands pawed uselessly at the smooth porcelain, unable to find purchase, and he felt himself ripped back into the vortex. He spun faster and faster as he fell deeper into the whirlpool.

But there was oxygen, and that kept him alive \u2014 if only for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body ached from being beaten in the whirlpool. Eric fumbled in the darkness to find a wall of the large pipe, and he scrambled for anything to hold to keep himself from being swept further down the channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pipe wall seemed to disappear as he passed the opening of a tertiary pipe. He tried to fight his way into it, but the main current was still too strong. Eric's tiny hand hit the opposite side of the tertiary pipe opening, but it was too slippery to grab. His hand did, however, find something to grab -- a single hair that had been wedged into a crack in the pipe fitting. His fingers gripped around it tightly and he prayed it would hold at least until the current of the flush subsided.</span></div></div>",

On the floor!\" Eric yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the janitor was on the move again. His entire massive body moved with startling speed for something so immense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric screamed as two fucking huge work boots, each more than 260 feet long and at least 100 feet wide, slammed the floor near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" Eric gasped.

The exertion and the surge of pure adrenaline left him weak-legged. His brain raced.

He didn't know how much longer he could hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the broom lifted. A squarish metal surface appeared beneath him. The broom moved forward slightly. Eric saw the janitor's mammoth hand holding a metal handle that attached to a large receptacle. He recognized the object as a dust pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he lost his grip. He fell what seemed like 20 feet, landing hard in the dust pan among assorted other items of litter. Suddenly, with stomach-lurching acceleration, the janitor's huge hand lifted the dust pan, along with the bug-sized man, far into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal man took a few steps toward a trash can. The trash can looked 500 feet tall and more than 100 feet in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gonna trash me!\" Eric exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, suddenly, all motion stopped.

He dared a look up. The giant was holding the phone receiver in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant frowned.

And then the massive fingers started tapping the table, and the giant's hand began shifting it's position on the counter in a seemingly random manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-inch tall Professor was petrified.

But this was not Eric's lucky day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn bug,\" the enormous janitor exclaimed, and began to stick his gigantic beefy finger into Eric's hiding place in an effort to squash the little menace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was horrified when he saw the janitor's enormous finger headed right at him.

Fate was so unkind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the janitor's jumbo finger only entered the hole half way.  It was too large to reach the cowering little Professor.  Eric was saved, so he thought.  If nothing else, the enormous janitor was persistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant janitor removed his finger from the hole.  Eric was so relieved but also a little unnerved by the sudden silence.

He found a post-it and scribbled a note telling his boyfriend to join him in the gym on campus when class was over.  Bounding down the stairs, he grabbed his gym bag out of the car and headed across campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good 15-minute walk across campus, and Tom enjoyed the scenery.  At one point a team of guys -- the basketball team, he guessed from their height -- ran by providing something extra to look at.  Tom hefted the door on the front of the gym and noticed how heavy it was, and pulling out his ID to flash at the window, it seemed like they had done some remodeling to raise the elevation of the security counter.  He picked a low locker, like always, because it was easier to shovel his stuff in and out of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shucked his clothes off down to his underwear, and pulled out his gym shorts.  Some guys passed him on their way back from the shower, about 6' 8\" from the look of them.  'Must be the day for Big men on campus!' Tom thought to himself, pulling up his shorts.  They felt too loose, and as soon as he let go, they fell right to the floor again.  Tom yanked on the string in his shorts... this was never going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother guy came in, this time almost seven feet tall.  'No way...' Tom thought to himself, as he realized his shrinking situation.  The machine had worked just fine... it's effects were just a little bit delayed.  For a moment he thought of calling Eric, but decided that if he kept shrinking at the current rate there was no hurry.  Eric would probably arrive in about half an hour anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he rummaged through his things.  Only the clothes which had gone with him under the shrink ray could fit him now -- nothing suitable for the gym.

It was dimly lit, as always, and only one other guy was there.  Tom made his way to the other side of the room, where he could only vaguely make out the shape of the larger man.  His dick strained against the towel, but Tom wasn't going to make the first move at his size -- currently sliding below five feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tom was seated, the other form seemed to slide one hand under its towel.

As he got closer the other guy quickly flipped his towel back over to cover himself, saying \"aren't you a little young to be in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom wavered, but then came close enough for the other man to get a good look at his moustache.  He rubbed his hairy chest to emphasize his maturity and said, \"I'm just a little small is all.\"  Then he added with a smile, \"now are you going to let a few inches get in the way of your blowjob\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry,\" the guy said.  \"You just never know who you'll run into around here.\"  The towel flipped open again, and as Tom's lips touched the big cockhead, he hmmmed his agreement.  The guy leaned back and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was grateful to be out from under supervision, because from the way the large man's balls were spilling out of his hand, he knew his rate of shrinking had definitely increased.  The swelling shaft was already nine long inches, and its head was mushrooming with each gentle lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine had been set to 12 inches -- the same size Eric had been -- so Tom didn't panic.  'That is, IF I understood the settings,' he thought with a shiver, droplets collecting on the back of his neck.  The situation still seemed under control, Tom put all those concerns aside and focused on the cock at hand.  He wondered how big he would be at the end of this blowjob.</span></div></div>",

He wondered how much height he had lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 25-year-old man had reached his six-foot-tall height at age 16. He had always wondered what it would be like to be a shorter man, but he always seemed to date men his size or shorter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his seclusion was invaded when a tall, lanky blond guy approached. The guy looked to be about Tom's age, but he appeared much taller. God, Tom thought, he must be eight feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, at six foot, eight inches, the guy was tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" He smiled at Tom. \"Mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom watched as the huge man lowered himself into the hot tub. Once he was settled, he reached out a hand. \"I'm Sean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shook his hand. He marveled at how small his hand looked grasped in Sean's huge paw! \"I'm Tom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean smiled. He had always liked smaller men. It was hard to tell with Tom seated in the hot tub, but he looked barely five feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe I've ever seen you here,\" Sean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a regular,\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I've missed you all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's heart raced.

He waited to Tom. <br>\r\nWhen Tom stepped from the car, he <br>\r\nimmediately realized Sean looked even larger. <br>\r\nHe was staring straight ahead and his vision <br>\r\nstopped right below Sean's massive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean, too, noticed that he had been too <br>\r\ngenerous in his earlier estimate of Tom's <br>\r\nheight.

Furniture looked so much <br>\r\nbigger. The ceiling looked so tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want something to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shook his head. \"Well, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom chose the sofa, and Sean sat down next <br>\r\nto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom noticed Sean's huge, ear-to-ear grin. He <br>\r\ndidn't have time to react as Sean leaned in to <br>\r\nkiss him. He felt Sean lean in, pushing more <br>\r\nof his weight down on Sean's much smaller <br>\r\nbody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they broke apart after what seemed like <br>\r\nmany, many minutes, Sean's next move was <br>\r\nto pull his T-shirt over his head and toss the <br>\r\ngarment across the room. He then pulled Tom <br>\r\ncloser, urging the small man to rest his head <br>\r\nagainst Sean's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom rested against this hulk of a man, he <br>\r\nfelt a strange sensation, as if he wasn't a <br>\r\nman.

The feel of his hand engulfed in a manly paw was straight out of his horniest jackoff fantasies with Erik.  His arm stretched down as Sean pressed Tom against his bulge.  Tom thought he could almost feel himself shrink right there against Sean's skin.  With a grin, Tom yanked on Sean's fly and inserted one hand beneath the elastic band of the large man's underwear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had put his hands on eight-inch dicks before, so it wasn't the length which surprised him most.  As his fingers explored Sean's boner, it was the tremendous thickness which held his attention.  Sean knelt up and pushed his underwear down, exposing his full crotch to Tom's small probing fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom slid his little body down on the sofa between Sean's legs and towards his feet.  His shrinking was continuing, but he wasn't about to stop this show because of it.  Relative to Sean's body, his dick seemed perfectly average.  A nicely weighted ballsac hung below, and the head of his boner wasn't even close to his belly-button.  Just looking, it seemed to Tom that he might be seeing a close-up photograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when his small hands met the waiting erection, everything came into perspective for Tom.  This was no close-up photo.  This was one of the biggest, thickest boners Tom had ever witnessed, and it was still growing.  Tom squeezed the huge mushroom head, and Sean squeezed back.  Hefting the swelling balls in one hand, Tom felt their mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean reached a thick muscular arm past Tom's probing fingers and yaned Tom's fly open, exposing the other hardon in the room.  With one thick finger, Sean rolled Tom's small balls up to to the base of his dick.  Tom felt three other large fingertips close around his short cock.  They were so big and he was so small, Tom imagined that his penis shrink another inch as Sean swelled.  A small \"oh\" escaped his surprised lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisunderstanding, Sean replied, \"I'll be gentle,\" and rolled off the couch to kneel before Tom's think prick.  Sean easily took Tom's shaft entirely in his mouth and gently swished his tongue all around it.  Sean's own dick was now out of reach of Tom's small arms, and he contented himself by rubbing one of Sean's strong arms.  Tom closed his eyes and felt his size floating out his penis and into Sean's growing mouth.  For his part, Sean got Tom close and then withdrew to lick at Tom's fading balls.  After letting Tom cool off for half a minute, he would resume the dick-sucking and Tom would feel even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that Tom was about to blow, Sean backed off entirely and stood up.  Tom blinked and saw a giant towering over him, kicking off tent-sized clothes.  Tom realized half his height was gone already.  Sean soon repositioned himself, kneeling at Tom's head, and allowing his now-massive balls to drape on Tom's forehead.  A foot-long cock snaked over Tom's nose and down his chin.  Extending his small tongue, Tom licked the growing rim at the head of Sean's dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean reached over to take Tom's throbbing meat in just two fingers now.  He tugged on Tom's trousers, pulling them down a little further.  \"If your clothes didn't still fit you,\" Sean said with a deep voice that filled Tom's ears, \"I would swear you were shrinking!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He put his face down next to he jar and looked in on his captive, who cowered in response.  Then he turned his attention to Erik.  Even at 1/6th his usual size, he had a familiar effect on Don.  Don's eyes worked Erik over, and he felt his heart beating a little faster.  Reaching out a hand, he easily wraped it all the way around Erik's chest and picked the shrunken man up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Erik chirped.  It would have been a shout, but his diminished stature had taken its toll on his voice.  Don's dick stiffened as he felt Erik's leg and arm muscles work against his grasp.  For a moment he forgot his excuse for picking the hunk up, but he soon recovered his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down!\" Don said, trying not to raise his voice too loud.  \"I need you to get a close look at the damage to the machine, so you can tell me how to fix it.\"  Erik nodded, still upset at being suddenly so out of control.  Don moved his mentor's body around the damaged areas, his eyes never leaving the little man.  The rush of power over his boss made his head swim and his cock bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you can put me down now,\" Erik said, far too soon for Don's liking.  Erik stood on the counter, while Don gathered the necessary parts to effect a repair.  Fortunately, the damage looked much worse than it actually was, and there were plenty of the right parts on hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than an hour, the machine was back in one piece.  Ben had taken off his shirt and rolled into into a pad so he had something soft to lay against.  Don looked at the hair covering the tiny man's pinky-nail sized chest and he felt his horniness starting to rise again.  \"I think she is ready to shrink again,\" Don announced.  Ben looked up in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or grow,\" Erik corrected, not noticing the glances that had been exchanged between his student and his rival.  Erik looked at Don's large face with a smile.  \"I think you've done a good job, Don.  Would you please move me into position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon wisked his heartthrob off the counter and into the air, feeling his dick want to get hard again.  He did his best to stay focused on what it felt like to have the subject of so many fantasies in his hands for the last time.  Of course it was over far too soon, and Erik was standing on the platform with the barrel of the shrink ray pointed straight at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the control panel, Don noticed that the machine's controls were more complicated than he originally realized.  There were timers, relative sizes, triggers, and more.  A whole host of options was arrayed before him.  He looked at Ben's jar, and again at Erik, and then selected his settings.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then there was a slider to distribute the next change over time.  He selected 8 hours, and then a further 75% reduction.  For a moment, he hesitated wondering if that would be too small.  Then he realized that once these men were completely under his dominion, he could always bring them back to the lab and make them bigger if that was his desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his chair towards Erik and spread his legs wide to get his semi-hard cock and nuts to flop forward so his sexual excitement might not be so obvious.  \"Here goes,\" he said, and activated the ray gun.  Don watched breathless for his boss to shrink before his eyes.  There was a pop near the barrel of the gun as the machine energized as the focusing lense cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon was not disappointed.  The ray discharged its full shrinking power directly onto Erik's waiting form... shortening, compressing, reducing the man in every dimension by 50% in less than a second.  But the lense crack also caused the beam to break, sending a few unexpected tendrils of powerful shrink energy into the room, including a bookshelf of notes and a chest of spare parts.  Each shared Erik's sudden shrinkage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik cried out in dismay as soon as the machine discharged, realizing the lense had broken.  But what Don heard was a loud rip from his chair as the fabric covering his crotch was torn by the stresses of differential reduction.  Taking his eyes off his now-six-inch prey, he looked down to discover that his dick and balls had also been subjected to a sliver of shrinking energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whether it was a sliver or the full blast, the effects were the same.  Don moved the torn material aside to reveal his genitals, now 50% of their size, exposed to the cool air of the room.  It was like someone had taken a bite right out of his crotch, leaving tingling shrink-marks beneath the hair-covered skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Erik's shouting that brought Don back to the lab.  The sound was small and high, but unmistakeably furious.  Don stood up, not bothering to cover himself again, and sauntered over to the platform where his dwindling boss stood.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zac was irresponsible. He ran through jobs, rarely managing to remain employed for more than a couple of weeks at a time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac had a scruffy beard and long, dark hair. His confidence in his own ability to charm got most people to see things his way. Well, almost everyone except his older, serious brother.

I'll give you the money.\" He reached into his pants pocket and removed his wallet. He hurriedly counted out some bills and said, \"Here. Take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Zac's laughter caused Eric to make an important realization. His wallet, like his clothes, had also shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, bro. I don't think those bills are quite big enough.\" Zac laughed again at his own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't appreciate being laughed at, but he swallowed his anger. \"Zac, I need to replace the focusing lens. There's a storage room down the hall...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Before Eric could react, Zac scooped him up like a toy and then started walking from the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's this storage room?\" Zac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, struggling in Zac's grasp, managed to point Zac in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'''''''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later, having obtained the new lens, Eric felt certain he was ready to reverse the procedure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to be on that platform when the ray activates,\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac effortlessly transported Eric to the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I need you to activate the panel,\" Eric said. \"It's very simple.

His super-colossal little brother towered over him like an all-powerful god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an initial analysis of his situation, Eric concluded he was only about 1/8th of an inch tall.

Eric was dead center, and the circular wall was 144 feet away in any direction.  Even though the wall was only 1/2 inch high, it was 24 feet for the tiny Professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minuscule Professor's mind shifted from traumatic terror to elated joy from the success of the shrink ray.  Eric knew the shrink ray was the invention of the century.  If he could get out of this unnerving situation,  the brilliant Professor knew he would be rich and famous.  Although Eric was less an enthused as he realized his fate was in the hands of his unreliable, not-too-bright little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Eric's world shifted violently as the floor beneath him began a horrific ascension.  Zac was lifting him in the air close to his face to get a better look at his reduced brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you are so tiny,\"  Zac laughed as he began a close examination of his big brother.  \"What the hell am I going to do with you?

Philip was a tall, muscle-bound wrestler standing 6'7\" tall and weighing 230 pounds, all muscle and no body fat. He kept his head and body shaved for a competitive edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked almost nearly 4,000 feet tall to the mite-sized scientist. Eric landed on the side of the enormous dome of Philip's skull on a stubbly field of fine blond hair. He began sliding, trying to grab hold of one of Philip's hair follicles. A strand of hair was too thick for his tiny hands to grasp, and he continued to slide until he came to rest in a wide crevice of space between the side of Philip's head and a wall of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!\" Eric exclaimed, recognition dawning. He had landed behind Philip's enormous ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appraised the situation and realized that at least he had not fallen more than 3,000 feet toward the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also had an idea. If he could climb the awesome ridge of Philip's earlobe, could he possibly climb inside the huge jock's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could manage such a feat, he could shout for help. Surely, standing within the jock's cavernous ear, Eric could make himself heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was the major obstacle of simply reaching his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, at least, the huge jock was standing nearly motionless, watching as Professor Westlake demonstrated an experiment for Philip and his assembled titanic wrestling teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As his eyes focused, he received quite a start when he noticed he was stretched on his back next to an enormous thumb bigger than his three-inch-tall body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake,\" said Ben Westlake, Eric's fiercely competitive rival in the university's science department. Eric could not believe he had fallen into Ben's sizable hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric scrambled back in Ben's palm as the huge man brought his hand closer to his face. Every ridge in Ben's hand looked magnified to the small man's tiny eyes. Ben's thumb looked as thick as the trunk of a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had time to look over your invention,\" Ben told him. \"I truly am quite impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, desperate to escape, dared a glimpse over the edge of Ben's palm. His stomach lurched at the sight of the long drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't advise a leap,\" Ben teased. \"At your size, you might survive, but I'd feel terrible if you broke a leg or an arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, although he agreed a jump would be unwise, didn't feel as if Ben actually cared about his welfare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grinned. \"I haven't decided,\" the huge man answered. \"But we can't have you running around underfoot. Much too risky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about the damn invention,\" Eric said. And, he meant his words. His shrink ray had been nothing but a problem for him. \"You can take the credit. Just grow me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shook his head. \"I can't do that,\" he said. \"Don't fear, however. I'll make sure you are taken care of.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
