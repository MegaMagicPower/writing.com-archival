And since you were alone you needn't have to worry about having to well \"play dumb\" since you were kind of Amicus's \"pet\". Though remembering this only made you a bit annoyed considering you weren't really brought here by your own choice after all. Though that muscle gutted wolf was about the only one that you felt you could trust. Though Neferu did seem friendly enough even though you two had only had a few interactions with one another thus far. Though with the trails ocming up within a few days you knew that both Amcius and his younger brother Cassius would be trying their best to prove which one would be the next emperor of Adastra. And of course there was Alex too who was acting as Cassius's pet, and even though his kept your secret of how smart you were so far, you couldn't help but wonder what he was really doing here. However, there was one person you didn't want to run into or interact with at all, and that was CAto since there was jsut something about him that really made you feel uneasy, though you weren't sure why that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while you sat down on one of the benches in the garden you quickly smacked your neck when felt something bite it. This caused you to yell out in slight pain while you yelled out, \"Ow! What was that about?.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then found yourself trailing off when you thought you saw everything was starting to get bigger. Or rather you were getting smaller , or at least that's what you realized when you and the clothes you were wearing quickly shrunk down to the size of 10 inches in height. This though caused you to blink quite a few times before you yelled out, \"W-What's going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after yelling htis out though you heard some heavy footsteps heading into the graden. And when you looked towards the inside of the castle you saw that the person who was heading into the garden was now what looked like a giant sized anthro of someone you knew. And once you got a better look at him you saw that it was.....</span></div></div>",

Panicking you darted near and then under a bush of some exotic alien flower. You were terrified and the thought of encountering one of those spiders at this size was another fear but the approaching figure who was drawing closer and closer each moment was most worrying right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough your eyes were still getting used to your surroundings It was Amicus, he was the only wolf who was dark like that other than Cato but from his jaunt alone you could tell it was not the latter as Cato always walked stiffly while Amicus and the figure that was fast approaching walked with the same sense of self-assured confidence that he always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer it was for sure Amicus! His steps even caused the ground beneath you to shake slightly and then at that moment his large grayish-black foot paw landed right in front of your sight beyond the gap of the bush that was now your shelter. He stopped and shuffled his feet-paws around. From your crouched place under the bush, you could only see those two large paws and only his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did Marco go? I know I saw him here!\" His voice boomed above you as you slowly crawled to get a better view of the now giant alien wolf<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmicus was pretty large even when you were normal sized but now he was massive! These alien wolves were scary enough but now? It was getting a little too much for you and you wondered what to do, but you were scared but at the same time its Amicus! He had been good to you so far, so surely he would help you but you still were racked by fear at what was all happening</span></div></div>",

Plus you knew that Amicus would help you out in anyway that he could. However, upon gaining the nerve to try to get his attention you found yourself being engulfed in the anthro wolf's shadow before you saw him blink down at you very confused as he asked, \"Marco, is that you?\" You just found yourself nodding in silence as the black and gray furred wolf looked even bigger then he already did while squatting down in front of you. You were picked up in one of the giant hands of the wolf and brought up to his. And once he had stood up straight again he added, \"How'd you end up getting so much smaller then you already were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well as weird as this is going to sound. I ended up getting bite by some random bug. Then I somehow found myself shrinking down to this size clothes and all.\" You explained, while the anthro listened to your every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that is pretty weird.....\" Amicus let out, before he closed his eyes foro a second. Though this didn't last long as he just smiled down at you and went on with, \"Whelp then I guess you'll be sticking with me all of the time from now. Or at least until I find someone who can get you back to your normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, sure, that sounds okay with me, Amicus.\" You replied back, as a small smile formed on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had uttered these words you could hear and see the wolf's tail sway from side to side in happiness before he told you, \"Great, glad to hear it since I have to leave soon to make my rounds to becoming the next Emperor. Now I just need to figured out where to hide you.....\" And so yet again the giant wolf went silence for a moment before he just grinned down at you in joy when he kept going with, \"Oh, I know exactly where to hide you, Marco. And I promise that not only willl you be safe, but no one will be none the wiser that you're with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted you to give the wolf a confused expression as you weren't sure what Amicus meant by this.

The reason being because well even though he wasn't as big as Amicus when you were normal sized he was still bigger then you in both height and muscle. But now, now he looked like an Egyptian god at your new size as his muscles seemed gigantic and his face miles away even though you knew that wasn't true at all. Though while staring at his now gigantic pecs which looked like two mountains of muscles, along with his rock hard abs which each one looked like a valley for each ab, and the bulge in the front part of his underwear and loincloth caused you to blush a very dark red color that was spread across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush even got a bit darker once the jackal was standing in front of the bench and had turned his back to you, unbeknownst to him. This ended up giving you a very good view of his now massive, wide, and muscled back which made the two shoulder blades look like valleys of muscle along with his two muscled and very firm looking backside. Or at least the outline of those two cheeks which looked like two very plump pieces of fruit or two very large balloons while his short tail moved from side to side every now and again. And you even had to admit that both of his arms and legs looked truly massive as well along with the rest of his heavily muscled furry body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you swallowed a lump in your throat you saw the giant black furred and golden marked jackal tap one of his feet while he asked out loud ot himself, \"Hmm, how odd. I know Marco is normally out here around this time. But he isn't here. I wonder where my simian friend has gone off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{i)Hmm, I know Neferu has been pretty nice to me thus far while I've been here. Though I know for a fact Amicus will get really jealous if he saw me with him. And at this size no less, that might make him even angrier then usual too.\" You thought to yourself as you placed a hand underneath your chin. Though this only lasted for a few more seconds as you took in a breathe of air and then released it before you went on with, \"Well I might as well try to get his attention since his the only here. Otherwise it'll take me all day to get into the palace from where I am.\" And so you decided to run out from underneath the bench and out in front of the giant jackal. And as you did your best not to swallow another lump in your throat while looking at him and his gigantic form you put your hands up against your mouth and added in a loud voice, \"Hey Neferu, I'm down here! Look down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAFter letting out these words you held in your breathe and waited for him to react in some way as you saw one of his ears twitch.

What was his name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to let out a heavy sigh as you figured the anthro wolf wouldn't know your name. Though you did have to admit that he never did bother to ask it from the start and it was Amicus who had to tell him your name. So you decided to put your hands up against your mouth when you yelled out, \"My name is Marco!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter these words had left your mouth you saw the wolf's right ear flick for a second to which he then said, \"Oh yes, that's right it's Marco.....\" You then saw his eyes go wide as he added on in a panicked voice, \"What a minute. Who just said?! It sounded like the human, but his voice sounded super far away for some reason. Could he be playing a trick on me?

After that I shrunk down to this size of 10 inches.* You explained, while you stood up and saw the white wolf change his expression and nod his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. How very odd since most bugs have never affected any of us wolves like this. Though I suppose it would make sense that Amicus wouldn't have taken this into account when bringing you here.\" The anthro commented, as he then carefully bent down so that he could get a better look at you. Once he did this he added, \"However, due to your change in isze I get the feeling you're quite fragile now. Like you could get hurt real easily. .....Just like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose that's true.\" You replied, while you started to relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this didn't last long because you soon found yourself being grabbed by the white wolf as he then stood up straight again and reopened his palm.

Why?\" You asked, quite confused at what Cassius just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw Cassius scoff and turn his head to the right before he remarked, \"Because it's obvious to me that Amicus wouldn't be very gentle with you. And even if he was he could still easily hurt you without realizing it at first. But I on the other hand know and understand that feeling of easily getting hurt. Though you already knew this. Besides if you're with me then I can have our doctors look into the matter so you cna get back to your normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get all of that.

And even though you and anthro feline hadn't really been able to chat with each other like you used to a few weeks ago you had a feeling hat you could trust the cat. At least you hoped you could trust the cat since you figured he oculd either give you back to Amicus. Or at the very least keep you with him since he seemed trustworthy enough even if he was the \"pet\" of Cassius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough first you'd have to get the now giant anthro cat's attention as you saw him walk past the bench you were on and get to work with his duties in the garden. And with his back to you this gave you a view of the cat's slender back, and lower down his thin and tail sway from left to right above his two firm buttcheeks that were outlined by his pants.

Sure his a very nice wolf, but his so massive compared to you now that you could accidentally hurt you without even realizing it.\" Alex confessed, as a sad expression crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, you oculd be right...as much as I'd like to think otherwise.\" You admitted, while letting out a sigh.

You simply stare at him with eyes widened, paralyzed by fear and by the monolithic predator's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Edapo!</b>\" He shouted before dropping you onto the ground belong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the ground leg first, but the height at this size was not insignificant.  \"<b>AHHHGG</b>\" You yelled out in pain as you land directly on your knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curled your leg to your chest from the sudden and extreme pain distracting you from your current situation. Cato kneels to one leg, hovering over you. Your eyes dart from him and back to your injury, as you wonder what you should do. The look in his eyes is not apologetic, but his eyebrows crease with some concern. He hovered his hand towards you, so you crawl backwards. The sudden shift in events in the last several minutes barely gave you the luxury of a breather or even being able to process what just happened; only that you lied on the ground in pain while this cold giant canine's hand loomed over you. And so you panicked and screamed out, \"<b>G-G-GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flailed and swiped your arms at the hand above to no avail, as it swiftly slid under you and cupped you in it's palm, then rapidly brought you to Cato's eye level. The acceleration at your size made gravity push you further into his palm, earning a whimper from you as you closed your eyes tightly. When you opened them, you were face to face with the giant wolf as his eyes analyzed you pensively. His nose gave you a quick sniff, as if trying to confirm that you were indeed Marco. You were terrified, you couldn't even bring yourself to make eye contact as you looked down in submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marco... Why are you...\" Cato stared before he trailed off before he poked you with a clawed finger, moving you slightly, but enough to feel it in your knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>AH- OW</b> ow ow...\" You exasperated while you shuddered a few rapid and shallow breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're injured...\" He said, though it sounded more like a fact he observed than something he was worried about. <br>\r\nHe drew his other hand closer to inspect you, but you simply crawled back in fear yet again. You stopped as you took a glance behind, only to find another likely fatal fall awaiting you. <br>\r\n\"Marco, let me see it\" he asked in a hushed tone. <br>\r\nYou wiped the sweat for your forehead, as you still couldn't make eye contact with this behemoth. You shook your head in response, denying him permission to potentially injure you any further. <br>\r\n\"Marco... you're injured, let me see it.\" He repeated, in a slight growl this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...\"   you responded as you scratched your hair with your shaking hand. You couldn't get a hold of you breathing as your breaths became even more shallow and rapid, your face beet red in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>MARCO</b>,\" He shouted quietly, \"Look at me.\" <br>\r\nYou almost jumped if it weren't for your leg anchoring you to his palm. Your breath quivered as you slowly looked up to face him. His exposed gum and fangs accompanied his voice, as it was in a low but distinguishable growl. His eyes dilated and were focused directly on you. All this anger, at the fact that a being that could fit in his palm, a being no bigger than the smallest of rodents, a being he could kill just as easily kill as any other rodent, refused his command. You only shivered in response.  \"<b>LET. ME. SEE. IT.</b>\" He commanded a final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied immediately, slowly bringing your hands away from the burning in your knee. As blood poured down your leg, you could tell it got scraped the hell out of. However, how bad the actual injury might be was still up in the air. Cato's snout drew closer as he examined it more closely as he sniffed it a few times. You turned and leaned your head as far back as you could, just doing anything to get as far away from him as you could without getting killed. Finally, he pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... It would be quite unfortunate if that were to get infected.\" He stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then watched as he looked below his waist and retrieved a canister out of his toga. He uncapped it before taking a huge swig of the liquid inside, swishing it inside and around his mouth, gurgling it, then finally swallowing. The lump that bulged out of his throat as it traveled downward looked like it could've been three times your size. Yet, the muscles in his esophagus effortlessly forced it down into his awaiting belly below. You shuddered and recoiled in response. He exhaled a content sigh, then brought his attention back to you. You picked up the unmistakably smell of alcohol, and a whole lot of it by how strong it was. Suddenly, you were pulled back into his field of view as his muzzle fully encompassed yours, which earned a high pitch yelp from you; a yelp that likely sounded closer to a squeak for Cato. He eyed you down, then his tongue exited his gargantuan mouth before the pink serpent enveloped you from head to toe. You screamed as you thought the wold intended to swallow you whole as effortlessly as his beverage. The scrapes on your bloodied knee began to sting like crazy, and then you felt in excess of liquid to watery to be saliva pour into you. By the smell and how it stung, you knew it was alcohol. He left just enough in his mouth to clean you with using his tongue. He inserted your injured leg into his maw and slurped on your knee like a soft noodle, though not pulling you in completely. You could only react by whimpering yet again; equal parts weirded out and equal parts terrified. Then your leg was released from the suction of the canine's lips, as he placed your saliva covered body onto his furred palm before placing you on a nearby ledge. He licked his lips, then in and around his maw. It was then that you noticed the blood on your leg had been completely cleaned off; hopefully disinfected properly as well, though you wouldn't be surprised if not. Cato savored the taste of the last little bit of your blood in his saliva before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha... What the hell...\" Which was the only thing you could muster as you crinkled your nose in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCato's muzzle chinned up as he pumped his chest out and rubbed his hands together.  \"Not bad, not bad at all...\" He remarked followed by letting out a short chuckled. \"Quite delicious in fact... You're quite a delicacy, if I do say so my self...\" He said soft spoken; contradicted by his predatory gaze as he licked his lips again, burping satisfactorily as he rubbed the stomach area of his large muscle gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this however only made your face go pale and for you to let out a gag in disgust. Cato then clasped his hands together and smiled contently.  \"Now, Marco. May I ask how you came to become so small?\" He asked and then gestured politely.  <br>\r\nThe bi-polar nature of this wolf; the way he goes from utterly threatening, to fetishistically homicidal, to completely calm and kind sickened you to your own stomach. This wolf, he was much more terrifying and dangerous than you initially thought. Cato still looks down at you and smiles at you gratefully, something you had never seen him do. The way he smiles makes it seem as though you just gave a blowjob or some kind a sexual satisfaction. As he patiently awaits your response, you decide the best course of action would be to.... </span></div></div>",

Sure you oculd lie to him, but you had no idea what he'd to do if he found out that you were lying even if wasn't able to see your reaction that great even with the visor like technology covering his eyes. So you slowly brought your gaze back up to the edlerly wolf and swallowed another lump in throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then made sure that you had calmed yourself down first before you confessed, \"A-A bug bite me..... Then I shrunk....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon uttering these words, but still in your dumb like state you saw one of Cato's ears twitch before he titled his head to the right in clear a confusion as he replied, \"A bug bite you? And that's why you're so small now? ....How odd.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um so, what now?\" You asked, while you conintued to sit in the center of his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that is a very good question. I can't just leave you out here in this state. And I don't know how Amicus would handle this if he saw you at this size... Though then again...\" Cato said out loud to himself before trailing off completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw the elderly muscle gutted wolf place his free hand underneath his chin as you also heard him hum in thought clearly thinking of what to do next. And so you decided to speak up again when you suggested, \"Couldn't doctor look at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a doctor see you? Hmm, I suppose that could work. Though If I have that arranged I'd have to make sure it was done in secret since no one outside of the palace knows about you. And I'd have to make sure the doctor in question kept what he saw and found out private.:\" Cato remarked, as you saw his head look at you. And even though you couldn't see his eyes due to the odd visor you saw one of his eyebrows raise upward while he added, \"However, I must admit that your suggestion was quite the smart one Marco... Hmm, I wonder.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crud, why did I say that? Now Cato might have figured out that I'm smarter then what I've led him and Cassius to believe this whole time.</i>\" You thought to yourself, as you felt a cold shiver go down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you were thinking this in your head the muscle gutted black and grey furred elderly wolf had started to walk out of the garden and back into the palace. And once you noticed this you broke out of your own thoughts and tried not to stare at the wolf's now gigantic pecs as you quickly turned around and wondered where he was headed to? And within a few minuttes you soon saw that Cato had taken you along with him to.......</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">So it's one month after I posted a poll on here asking if I should make a interactive story based off the Visul Novel Adastra. And thanks to a 7, to 3, to 3 lead I'm making the interactive. However, if you haven't played the VN I highly recommend it. But anyway this interactive story focuses on Macro (aka you) while his on the moon Adastra. However, you somehow find yourself shrunk after getting bitten by an odd bug. After this happens you find yourself shrunk down to 10 inches in height. Not only that but now all of the anthros who either live or who are also stuck on Adastra are now giants compared to you. So the main question is will you be able ot get help fomr one of them, or will it not end that great for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This story is M/M focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Please try to keep all of the characters well \"in character\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The only \"route\" that I can see being kind of dark is Cato's. But his is the only one. Though if you want you can have him slowly change his ways due to having a shrunken Marco with at all times in his story paths. But no one else's story path should be like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Now even though there's a \"dark path\" so to say I still don't want any toilet stuff, or a lot of gore, or death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. And of course have fun.</td>",
