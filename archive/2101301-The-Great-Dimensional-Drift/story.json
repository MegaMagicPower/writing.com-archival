You don't know what's going on besides the fact you are no longer in your house or even your world for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took about five minutes until you finally came to a large empty space filled with giant colorful spheres floating around. Each of them contains many views of several locations of some sort. You float around for a bit, trying to find some way to get back home until you unknowingly come across one of the spheres and you immediately began to get sucked in. You swam as fast and hard as you can, but you don't have the strength to do so and got suck into the giant ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis world has your avenge modern-day setting. There's no monsters or any kind fantasy materials just a normal-looking world very similar to yours just very huge and gigantic. Many locations includes: towns, cities, suburbs, and many more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis world is yet another avenge modern-looking sociality only expect it's full of giant anthropomorphic animals. There's not much to say about the themes other than being similar to World 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one takes place in a dark and eerie city full of giant humanoid monsters. These includes: Nagas, Werewolves, Anthropomorphic Dragons, Harpies, and so on. Besides the city, there are other locates and each are pretty much similar to your own world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the other three which all take place in modern sociality, this one takes place in an old-fashioned town that is inhabited by giant Halloween characters (think Halloweentown). Like the third world, it's also full of monster, but it's also filled with any people related to the stereotypical Halloween setting such as witches. The town is basically old with a classic European feel to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\n????????????????</span></div></div>",

It's all a dream.\" you said as you're in a urge of freaking out. Due to your new speak-like size, you couldn't see much of this room other than a giant television in front of you and a gigantic couch behind you. The carpeted floor look like a landscape of texture that spread for miles and a ceiling fan hangs high above you like a UFO in the sky. This was a living nightmare, but you couldn't help the fact that everything seemed so real to you. \"Seeing all this makes me feel like a tiny flea in this house.\" you said \"I wonder if someone's home right now?\" You stood on the same spot and listened carefully for any sounds. However as five minutes have passed, you couldn't hear a thing. \"I guess they're either asleep or they're not home right now.\" you said, glad that you are safe for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to your left to see a path that what appeared to lead to the entryway. You think that you could just go out and escape right away, but you know that could be extremely dangerous since you have no idea what further danger waits ahead of you. You look behind and saw the giant couch, maybe you could hide there and seek shelter there for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's your choice?</span></div></div>",

You also know that this would take two or three hours to get there by now. \"I just hope nothing happens at this movement.\" you said as you race your way to your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just an average day for the entire Robinwill family as they just gotten out of the supermarket and now ready to go back home. \"Whew, carrying around these grocery was sure exhauting.\" said Liza Robinwill as she place them in the back of the car. \"Oh come on hon, is not that bad.\" replied her husband, Steve Robinwill. \"Oh yeah, try doing that yourself!\" said a slightly annoyed Liza. Two of their children, Amy and Trevor Robinwill finished placing their own and both sat down in the car. \"Next time Trevor, ask me or mom and dad if you want to go get those free samples.\" said Amy to her younger brother. \"We almost lost you there.\" \"Oh come on Amy, I'm a big boy right now. I could go on my own pace if I wanted to.\" said Trevor \"You still need permission, Everyone does it.\" The two began to argue as usual while their parents began to drive off straight back home. \"Kids these day.\" muttered Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it took for about a good three and the half hour for you to finally reach the couch. \"*Pant*...*Pant*...I finally made it. *Pant* Now it's a good time for me to rest now.\" you said. You slowly fall down and decided to take a rest. As you lay down there, you suddenly heard a faint sound of what sounded like a car getting parked, followed by a car alarm. \"Oh crap, the owners are probably home now.\" you said as you heard the sounds of thundering footsteps. You listened real carefully before a loud sound of a door being opened and comes out a series of giant shadows coming from the entryway as you can still make it out despite being far away from you. The first to come to view was a giant man who looked to be in his mid-20s with short brown hair and wears a long-sleeved blue shirt, brown pants, and black loofers. Next is a giant woman almost the man's age with long black hair and wears a orange striped midriff-baring shirt, tight dark blue jeans with a black belt, and white NIKE sneakers. The third one is a giant girl who looked to be 13-15 that has brown hair that was tied in a ponytail and wears a bright pink T-shirt with a large red heart on it, a pair of brown shorts, and green flip-flops. The fourth and final one is a giant boy that is about 11 years old with black hair and wears a red jacket, blue jeans, and red sneakers. These giants are the owners of this house and they're HUGE!!! \"Man I couldn't be smaller than their smallest toe.\" you said, trying to be confident on yourself. You noticed that they're carry grocery bags and thought that they were going to the kitchen and put them away. You were still kinda tried from all that walking so you think it's safe you to rest here since nobody won't be able to find you at the movement. You lay down on the soft carpeting and slowly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that rest, you quickly woke up and look around. \"Crap, I'm still here! It's this real life after all?\" you said and suddenly you saw something outside your hiding place. You carefully walk towards it to take a closer look. As you got there, you finally make out what it was.</span></div></div>",

You weren't sure about your location completely until you looked behind to see something that made your eyes wide as a lemur. Standing behind you was a gigantic building which might as well be a humongous castle due to great size. Although you were a bit nervous about this situation, you decided to check to the place out and see if you could find anyone to help you out. You make a quick dash to the door....or at least trying to but unfortunately, the door was oddly far away to you. \"That's funny, why is the building slowly getting bigger when I try to get closer?\" you asked as you could see the doors were getting taller and taller, is it some sort of strange illusion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer, you finally realized the truth: this building REALLY is gigantic! You finally made it to the doors to see it tower over you like an insect; you soon wished that it was an illusion. \"Holy crap, this can't be real!\" you said \"that crystal must of sent me here in this giant world!\" You wanted to slip beneath the doors to see the inferior of this building but, the doors have no gaps to slip in so you just going to have to wait until some giant open them without their notice on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, you began asking questions to yourself: What was that crystal that sent you here? How are you going to back home? What's going to happen to you? Suddenly, you hear a loud sound coming from the far distance; it almost sounded like a...bus horn? You looked straight ahead and could make out a giant yellow object that almost look like a bus of some sort. \"I don't even get what's going on...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRING!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noise that was enough to startled you bursts out from behind you. \"WHAT THE HELL?!\" you shout from the sudden sound. It seemed to be a bell of some sort, almost like a school bell...what a minute. It was all making sense now, this was a giant school building and those object were actually school buses. By the looks of it, school must be starting right now and the students are all ready to began their day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is what kind of school this is exactly? You look to see the giant students now leaving the buses and going to began their day. By the looks of their ages, this might be...</span></div></div>",

As these girls make their way to the bench, you saw that they were about 10 to 11 years old. Unfortunately, you were too late to see what they completely look like since they made it to the bench and sat down on it just as you were about to observe them. In front of you, all you could see are six footwears slightly dangling from above. In the center is a pair of gray boots, in the left is a pair of red Converse shoes that were below a blue jean, and at the right is a pair of lavender sneakers with red little hearts on each side that covered the pair of pink socks. You watch as their shoes shift, tap, and even stretch a bit while hearing their conversation from above; it just a simple girls talk so you weren't interested at hearing it. You decided to take a look on the three young girls and make your way out of the bench to the right. You walk out of it and go to were the girls are; in the middle of their path. Thankfully, they are too focused on themselves to notice you so it gives you some time to see what they look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a bunch of young girls, they all look very attractive for their ages. Their beauty were enough to make you want just stare at them for a long time. In fact, they look more like young beauty queens than children; they are <i>tweens</i> after all, so not that very unusual to see pretty preteens like these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one in the middle has black hair tied in a ponytail and green eyes. She wears a white T-shirt with a large pink heart on it, a purple skirt, a blue necklace with a jade gem around her neck, and a pair of gray knee-high boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the left has long blond hair tied in a black headband and hazel eyes which you see some bit of pink eyeliner across it. She wears a long-sleeved light blue shirt with red stripes, a short black pencil skirt, and a pair of pink socks and lavender sneakers with little red hearts on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the right has burnette curls, blue eyes, and has slight tanned skin. She wears a pink vest over a short sky blue shirt that reveals her midriff, a pair of blue jeans that is tied by a magenta belt with a golden buckle, and a pair of red Coverse shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as they're still talking to each other. Even thought you don't want to go with children, these three look at least old enough to understand your problem so maybe you could try to contact them. However, you still don't even know if they are even that nice to began with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this; however, you can't really survive in this world on foot so you're gonna have to seek safety on one of these pretty girls for now, even if it means risking your life by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will go for?</span></div></div>",

Seeing that makes think a bit until you saw that she is carry a what looks to be a blue beach towel under her right arm. You quickly look away behind you and soon you found yourself looking at a large ocean that wasn't very far away from both you and the lioness. \"This is not a desert...\" you said in realization \"I'm standing in the middle of a giant beach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shakes even harder as the giantess is now getting closer. Luckily for you, she soon stops right next to you. Did she noticed you? You can't really tell because you can't no longer see her face by this point, only her lower torso and legs (as well as her black handbag that was danging above from her left). Due to not even paying attention to you, it doesn't seem to be true as she's simply just standing there; almost if she's waiting for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stood there and stared at the giant creature. Even though she is a lioness, you can't help but found her quite beautiful and attractive as she has a very shapely figure. You think that this furry woman takes very good care of her body. Since she's still unaware of your presence, you wonder if you could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts got interrupted when you hear a familiar sound nearby; it was yet another series of footsteps. You soon see what you expected; another giant was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however it appears to be masculine in appearance and you realized that the giant in question was a giant male lion coming right towards you and the lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks to be either the same age or slightly older than the other one. He has golden-colored fur and short brown hair that connected to his mane of the same color (which gives the impression of a bread) and is wearing a pair of red swim trunks with blue stripes on each side. Just like her, he appears to be very good-looking and handsome as he has a very toned body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the lion walked up to the lioness and they both hugged each other; followed by the sounds of smooching. You discovered that these lions are in fact lovers as you hear giggling coming from the lioness from how happy she is to see her boyfriend. You can also hear some conversation between them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I took so long, Nadia.\" said the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw that's okay, Sam.\" said the lioness who's name was Nadia. \"What happened to you on the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, annoying traffic jam.\" said Sam \"But that's not important right now. What matters is that we're together again, love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you!\" giggled Nadia \"I told my friends that I wanted to be alone with you so don't worry about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\" said sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to rest under the sun?\" asked Nadia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet, just got my blanket here.\" answered Sam as he set down his beach blanket along with Nadia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the conversation (which was more like hearing titans talk rather than people), they both lie down on their towel on their backs; creating a series of quakes. After that, they began to take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they look more like mountains at this size.\" you said as you were looking at the sleeping giants. you began to think of what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could approach one of their bodies and maybe try to get their attention. You don't know why, but you began to have some other thoughts while they're napping away. You were still fascinated on what you witnessed in front of your eyes. Could you just try to walk around on them and do some bit of research or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will you approach?</span></div></div>",

Their movement was like watching a giant monster roaming across the land in front of your eyes and the green reptilian-like feet further captures the experience. You are not sure what they're up to so you decided that, despite the enormous risk of getting yourself hurt, go and investigate the creature's motive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you exit the can, you saw that the giant was already ahead of you. However, you can finally make out the monster's apprenace due to the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed that the giant in question is actually a female after looking at the shape of her figure. The second thing you noticed was the huge wings she has on her back; figuring out that this creature that you're looking at is a gigantic, anthropomorphic dragon. The third and last thing you noticed was the symbol on the back of her jacket (between her wings). The symbol was red and triangle-shaped with the letter \"H\" on it. What does that mean? Unfortunately, you couldn't see her face since you are only looking at her back; all you could see was her long, black hair that covered her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran up to her, you knew you couldn't keep up with her so you make running leap to catch and climbed on top of her foot as it rises up. You hold on tightly (hopefully it doesn't bother the giantess to much) as she took one step which was almost like riding a horse that makes long leaps across the fields. \"This is one ride that I won't be waiting in line for.\" you said and looked ahead to see nothing but darkness as the dragoness further strolled into the alley. Where is she going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather walked all the way to the dark alley to meet up with her gang. She have told everyone to meet up at this exact location at the middle of the night since the chances of getting caught by law enforcements and witnesses at this place and time are slim to none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather finally reaches in front of the steel door and knocked it. \"Guys it's me, open it up!\" she called. The door opened and the dragoness stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in their hideout, she was greeted by her four goons: Earl, Boris, Xavier, and Trish. \"Glad you can make it boss.\" said Boris \"Yeah yeah, I know now.\" she said as she walked pass them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself looking in front of a hideout of some sort as your unaware ride walked inside. The room was looked small and slighty messy; there were some paper and trash lying on the floor. Other than that, there's not much stuff other than a table, some chairs, and a desk. In front of you were four more giant monsters coming to greet the dragon woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first guy appeared to be slightly shorter than the others (well at least to them) and has a long, black beard. He wears a red tuxedo with a matching tie, pants and even pair of shoes. His noticeable feature is his large red top hat, his attire seemed to red as blood, and he has a devious look too. This monster is based on the red cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second guy is a large, musclar monster with two large horns, black fur, and a head that resembled a bull. He wears a dark green, sleeveless shirt, dog tags around his neck, and pair of brown cargo shorts. He appears to be based on the minotaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third guy is very tall individual that closely resembles a eagle but you noticed that he's got a lion's tail behind him. He wears a green hoodie and blue jeans. He's actually a griffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last and fourth isn't a guy but a girl. She's shown to have cold look with white hair and wears a dark blue tank top. She doesn't seem to have any legs as they been replaced by a large spider-half that was black in color. This woman's a Drider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This world...is full of giant monsters.\" you said, finally realizing where you are. You still don't even know what these guys are and what they are doing here in the middle of the night. You felt the giantess moving again and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, here's what we need to do.\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, they could just fly their way there, but that would be a waste of stamina and must wait until they reach a centain point of length to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sophie, do you have any plans for the upcoming school exam tomorrow?\" wendy asked her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure mom.\" answered Sophie \"I can't help but feel nervous about it and I don't know what to do.\" While Sophie usually doesn't care less with some subjects as there are times she does get good grades sometimes. However, what really set her up about exams is how she felt having her own intelligence being tested by the teachers with a bunch of very difficult questions and the pressure of being surrounded by those who were alot smarter than her; Sophie does not like that feeling of being so overwhelmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sweetie, you know that you can't just coward around like that. You need to have full confidence and try your best.\" said Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom...\" said Sophie as she gave her mother a slight smile. She knows the fact that her mother wants to gave her some encouragement which was nice of her, but that doesn't seem to be enough to erase her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy already see through her daughter's fake smile and can't help but wonder if there's anything she could help. \"What I'm saying is that you need to fight against your own fear and put up tons of effort into what your doing; don't let anyone around you get the best you.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing her words, Sophie did gain some confidence. \"Thanks mom, I think I'm starting to feel better now.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my little girl, now get out there and show them what you're made off.\" said Wendy. She felt so glad to get her child's spirits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two harpies stop next to an alley and both began to take off their shoes; this was so that they won't fall off while they fly. Wendy puts her sandals into her purse while Sophie puts her mary-janes in her dress pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a small peak from inside your hiding spot to see two pairs of giant shoes coming straight to your spot. By the looks of these shoes, it appears that the giants might both be females. The one on the left is wearing black mary-janes while the other is wearing white sandals. You hide back into your shelter and curl yourself, believing that they'll probably going to step on the can and crush you from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it all went quiet and you thought that they must of stopped somehow. You take a look once again and see that they were standing next to you; towering over you like the giants they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant on left appears to look alot smaller than the other one and is wearing a red dress. You can tell that she appeared to be quite young, almost like a preteen. The giant on the right is much bigger than the other one and is wearing blue shorts and a grey tank top. This one was an adult and is presumably the other one's mother. Unfortunately, you can't see their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne unusual thing about both of them is that they don't appear to like human beings at all. Both of their legs seems to closely resembled those of birds and their arms look alot like bird wings. \"What is this?\" you asked \"I'm I in a world of giant bird people?\" As if trying to prove you further, they both took both of their footwear for some reason, revealing their talon-like feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at their feet and thought about trying to hitch a ride on one of them in order to either try to get their attention or go to whatever they are going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe you could just leave and find help somewhere else.</span></div></div>",

These weren't ordinary snakes, NO they're actually nagas! You were left speechless on the sight in front of you, they look so huge and unusual at the same time. You don't really see much of their appearances due to being too tiny compared to them.

Just as you were about to get a little closer to the giant vampire, a soaring sound is heard from the sky which got both you and the giant's attention. You saw what looks like another giant coming straight for the ground on a broomstick at high speeds. Thankfully, you are not in the way of this broom rider and instead crashes in front of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!!!!!!!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the impact, your whole world shakes like an earthquake causing you to fall off from your feet.

The giant slowly gets up from the ground and you later got a good view of the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another girl that is about the same age as the vampire. She had red hair that is tied in braids and she wore a pair of circular glasses. She is wearing a red cloak with grey sleeves that is tied up by a black belt, a witch's hat of the same color and a pair of black boots with blue and white stockings. The most odd thing about her, besides her massive size, was her skin color; it was light blue, this girl appeared to be based on a witch of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire stood up and walked towards the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late as always Wanda.\" said Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies Laura, you know how I'm not experienced on broom riding yet.\" said Wanda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you here let's go, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two get ready to go to their destination as Laura shifts into her bat from and Wanda got on her broomstick.

The young woman looked terrified as she was being roughly handled by the two thugs, who coarsely slammed her to the tatami floor directly in front of the table you were hiding on. The beautiful young woman wore an ornate kimono and her silky black hair hung down to the small of her back. The only blemish on her ivory complexion was the terrified look on her face, with tears streaming down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand! What have I done to deserve this?!\u201d she bawled between sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the next in line to be sacrificed!

The girl pulls herself up into a seated position on her knees. It would be an absolute shame for such a beauty to be eaten by some horrible monster. You remember hearing about the Japanese folk hero Issunboshi, who was just about your size. The girl sobs quietly as you look around for something to cut her ropes with. Something metallic glints in the unsteady light. It\u2019s a sewing needle! It\u2019s no sword, but it will have to do. You should try freeing her before introducing yourself, though. Her body is no longer wracked by sobs, so climbing her shouldn\u2019t be too hard. Grabbing a scrap of cloth to use as a parachute, you jump off the edge of the table and float down to the tatami mat floor. At your size, you can see each individual reed. The question is, how should you approach her? </span></div></div>",

For a moment you lose yourself to the heavenly smell, but quickly shake your head and return to your senses, reaching your arms out to gently massage Ouka's toes. She is unable to suppress a moan of satisfaction, but somehow she is able to keep her feet still, even as you progress past her toes and closer to her soles. This giantess is practically in paradise, and you feel genuinely glad to do her a favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe being tiny and stuck in feudal Japan isn't so bad after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, little guy,\" Ouka says, allowing you to stop your massage and regain your stamina. \"I needed that. We should probably get out of here before we're caught again, though...I think it's best if I take you home! Is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment about the choice you've been given. You do miss your real home, but Ouka has been so gentle and kind to you, it'd break her heart to see you leave! Decisions, decisions...</span></div></div>",

Her humming echos from above like a storm and around your location; it wasn't too loud but it did enough to cover your ears.

She sighed and decide to start telling her middle daughter Libby to stop leaving so many crumbs and bits of food around the kitchen because it'll attract some bugs around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she sweeps the floor, she suddenly could have sworn there was something moving on the floor causing her to stop cleaning.

A moment later, you see a shadow from outside the kitchen and finally comes in the giant person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant looks alot like a young girl about 12 years old with short blonde hair that was tied up by a ponytail. She wears a green T-shirt with a yellow star on it, a brown skirt, and a pair of black boots. You first thought she looks normal (aside the fact that she is alot bigger than you) until you see what looks like two antennas on her head and a tail from behind her. Her skin wasn't any color you see from people in your own world because it was colored blue. \"This can't be real...\" you mutter to yourself in disbelief. Is this some kind of alien or something? Are you in a world of giant aliens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop questioning yourself when the giant girl makes her way to your current spot, did she saw you? Not quite. Instead of looking at you, she was looking at the cookie box that was on the shelf above you. As she approaches, you slowly see only half of her body until the only thing you see was her giant black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear her picking up the cookie box and begins snacking. During this time, the only sound you hear were rather loud munching coming from the girl as she eats the cookies. Thankfully, it wasn't loud enough to hurt your ears. Unfortunately, you are in the middle of a crumb storm that was caused by her messy eating and they are falling towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking no hesitation, you make a quick dash under the cupboards; next to the air vent where you come from. You watch the giant crumbs come down like an avalanche in front of you. You thought about trying to get this giant blue-skinned girl's attention. She may be young, but she does look somewhat old enough to understand your situation at hand. Unfortunately, the crumbs still continue to fall down which makes it pretty risky so you can just wait here until she's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you can just sneak into the backdoor and escape.

The world beyond is incredibly futuristic as you saw the nearby houses that were hugely advanced. The yard itself was bizarre as the grass is blue instead of green and there is a strange tree in the corner that is filled with odd flowers. The fences and other familiar objects are also futuristic and up above, you saw a UFO-like craft passing by.

There's no gap to crawl underneath or anything at all; this glass is too advanced to have something like this. You look up to your left and saw a button that may be the one to open the door. Unfortunately, it's way too high to reach it and you doubt that you can even make it up there. You have no other choice but to sit there and wait for someone to come here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, there is a sound coming from outside the kitchen.

The skies darkened, falling into shadows. It was like a great clap of thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKA-BOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, it <i>was</i> a great clap of thunder. Black clouds swept over the jungle. Watery pellets descended around you, drumming steadily. One raindrop hit your cranium, sending a cool sting through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storm's rhythm quickened. As if your perspective wasn't dizzying enough, the sounds from every direction made it hard to orient yourself. You ran forward, looking for a safe spot. New rivers and oceans formed, spreading out in elaborate shapes through the cracked soil - doubtlessly only puddles compared to the grass. A fine mist formed around the environs, further impeding your visibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the ground dampening more every second, you moved from dashing to wading to practically swimming through murky water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore raindrops crashed against your back. The constant torrent made the wet impacts feel like a flurry of punches. It drove you harshly into the mud, but didn't stop. The mud had a firm grasp of your arms and legs. Trembling surrounded you. It was hard to tell how much was from the downpour, and how much was your head ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No, it was something else shaking the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crash of thunder lit up a leviathan-sized body miles away. It scurried forward briskly. A pair of strongly-defined legs creating great splashes as the shape trod. across the murky plane. A human! And one with a downright feminine silhouette. One of the giant inhabitants of this new (yet ancient) world? Though, the snarling coming from the figure's direction seemed closer to a wild beast's cry, shaking through the voluminous leaves... And oddly, she dashed in the opposite direction from the village. You tore yourself from the muck, keeping your eyes pointed to the clouds from which you saw the colossal woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bright crash, and the figure appeared again. Its distance from you could no longer be described in miles. Micrometers would be a more accurate unit of measurement. A titanic, mud-coated sole slammed down on you. The foot fully engulfed your ground-bound body. In fact, it was immense enough to cover twenty more bodies at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the skin compressed you tightly within the brownish prison. Its map of intricate folds and creases brushed against your body. The constant shifting indicated that this humongous foot's even-more-monolithic owner was still rushing forward. This titan's heel rose, lifting you with it. Your dirty body had joined the minuscule twigs and tiny pebbles caught tight in the wet layer of grime coating the sole. In front, the toes dug into the soil, and pushed back, propelling the limb forward. Strong winds blew past you, and you saw tiny clumps of soil falling unevenly from your surroundings. Before you knew it, the tribal woman completed her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQUELCH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flood of mud erupted up through the supple soil's trembling. Had you been any larger, or the ground any dryer, the incredible force springing from the giantess' firm legs would've squeezed your body flat. But the ground was accommodating, softly pushed back around your tiny face. You spat out some gross brown stuff that entered your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot was accommodating, too: one teeny wrinkle held around you. The harsh step pressed you in deeper to the patterns across her skin, and covered you with more mud. A thunderclap rung out above, which she responded to with a grunt. You barely registered another ferocious, desperate step in the distance before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole hit the ground again, shaking you with dizzying force. The horror was so intense, so numbing, that you barely felt connected with the treacherous scene. Your mind remained frozen in a Blue Screen of Death - until another sickening noise rebooted reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body, comparatively, felt more liquid than solid: drenched, cold, and in the very center of every impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dirt that didn't flutter down got squeezed tighter and tighter into her heel, forming an inescapable clump of mixed grime and filth. From your perspective, the mud caught across her toes could each form their own landmass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMUSH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a precious second, you glimpsed a fresh trail of clean footprints behind: one of them your body was just peeled away from. From their shape, her toes were fairly proportionate; and both the hell and ball of her foot were very round and full. Judging from the depth, she had a low arch - which pressed against the ground with the rest of the extremity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQUISH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time the ground shook from her sprint, you could move yourself a little.  You twisted your tiny arm right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMOOSH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn earthy smell filled your nostrils, mixed with a salty taste in your mouth. You twisted a little more, torso now pressed against your unaware ride's gigantic heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQUEEZE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still heard the rain and thunder, but the sound of her footsteps deafened them. Her foot curled up slightly when it lifted, the detritus caressing and molding your form. When this stride ended, flattening you again with a -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOUND<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- the pressure pushed your face right into the whorls. A bit of skin nuzzled across your lips. When you attempted to spit, it only got more of the foot flesh pushed against your little tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWOOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to see anything before you or behind you, you were left feeling the rushed bounds of this stranger's leg muscles. Her shivers from the cloudburst were shockingly close and real - compared to the distant sound of raindrops, and the animal noises that had fully left your hearing range. All this, without even having seen a clear view of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMPSTOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a punishment for past sins? You sunk deeper in, feeling crumb-like bits rattling down your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMPSTOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting faster. You felt the force of her breaths - coming in shallow gasps - despite being so far away from her. This was a particularly wet area, as she sprinted through a puddle. You held your breath to avoid drowning, and kept it until the next series of crushing assaults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMPSTOMPSTOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, her foot lay flat on the ground, ankle flexing. A small rattling shot through your ears. Dirt from the ground and her sole squeezed through every bit of your clothes. The runner's heel pushed out. She nimbly leaped over a roadblock, then pushed out both feet open ahead of her to catch the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForget joining the dirt clumps. If it kept squeezing you this mercilessly, you might end up becoming a permanent tattoo on the woman's sole. You yelled out for any form of attention, or mercy, from this sky-scraping sprinter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMPSTOMPSTOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour limbs now cried out in protest as the sole squeezed around them. Even if anyone else was out in this wilderness in the middle of the thunderstorm, they'd be hard-pressed to spot you plastered across the foot. The woman made a 90 degree turn on her heel - the one with you right in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTWIST<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, she pushed the entire unbearable mass of her mega-scale body across your speck-scale frame. The world spun around you twice. Gravity, time, and distance lost meaning. Murky soil erupted out in all-encompassing torrents and geysers, as if her skidding dug down to the planet's core. The whole time, she never lost any speed. And as if nothing ever happened, she kept running onwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMPSTOMPSTOMPSTOMPSTOMP...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed her feet, then stopped. Your mind froze. Was she about to jump agai-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBWUMP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething soft to the ground. Slowly, the foot that held you lifted up. And, for once, it didn't descend. The toes kept pointed to the sky... Or rather, the ceiling. It took many breaths for your inhale-exhale tempo to regain its normal speed. The rain no longer hit you, though you could still hear a distant thunderclap. Once breathing normally, you realized: the girl you rode with was sitting in the middle of a cave. Her own heart was racing, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... Why a cave? Wasn't there a village nearby? Had this girl been chasing food... or running away from something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to dry off, the stranger from the new world rattled her hands and feet twelve times each. Your body rattled up and down, watching hardening mud clumps fly away with the water droplets. She then brushed titanic fingers across her body, as if wiping off a bug. Her index slid over you, with enough strength to finally peel you off her sole. With a satisfying, cool sensation, your head separated from the moist surface, followed by both arms, torso, waist, and legs. You fell a mercifully short distance to the ground, lying on the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing two sticks from the ground, the tribal giantess lit a small fire, resting it down. With the warm light, you could see her features more clearly - in fact, this first glance of her face was downright intense. Her sun-tanned face held with red triangular markings. They moved down her body into intricate lines that crossed her limbs, twisting spirals around her strong shoulders and toned stomach, and even a few patterns across her foot soles. All that covered here was two pieces of simple white cloth and a makeshift bracelet, necklace, and anklet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. Her unkempt copper-tinted hair swayed, like a cross between a supermodel's hair wave and a wet dog drying itself. When it swung back, her blue eyes were wide, alert... And they pointed right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body remained still, trapped between the glowing flames and the length of her legs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything was still, and beyond the crackle of the fire, quiet. She stared at you, a deep gaze that pierced right through you. You met her eyes, you, a literal speck, a fleck of dirt, daring to meet the challenge of a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke off first. Her eyes returned to the fire, her hands busy with a stick her used to prod the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed. The flickering light made everything seem more... supernatural. Still, there was nothing natural about <i>this</i>, as you remained still, laying on you back among the field of debris shook off this tribal girl's soles. Perhaps you needed help, but this girl had only minutes ago pounded you into a flat paste. She couldn't be your best source of assistance, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rumbles again, and you see her begin to stir. Flinching, you're helpless as her feet turn over onto their soles, missing you by a hair's breadth. You stumble and stand, ignoring the agony in a fight or flight instinct that is heavily leaning towards flight. She shifts further, and you grunt as her big toe slams into you, sweeping you and and collection of dirt clumps aside as she pulls her knees into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a speck of dirt, just inches in front of a giant's toes. Yet, as you look up, gazing at the deep red swirls along her flesh, peering into the blue eyes that cast out towards nothing, spotting the gashes and scars that mark her body, and witnessing the pout of her lips as she sets her chin on her knees, you feel sorry for her. She's filled with sorrow, that much is clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is she? Why was she running from her village through the rain in the middle of the night? How is it that, out of all the dirt on all the paths she could have taken, you ended up under her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was destiny, plain and simple. You needed her help, and she needed yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to call her Destiny, at least until you had her real name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny did not take very good care of her feet, that much was plain to see. While her toe nails were surprisingly short, everything else about what you could see, which wasn't a lot in the dim light of the fire, was rather... disgusting. You expected the mud, since you were a part of it just a moment ago, that wasn't a surprise. However, her toes were in poor condition; the nails were chipped, the whole underside of her foot was one big callous, and her cuticles were torn up like hell. Not to mention the smell, which was only partially covered by the mud and smoke that filled your nose. It was rank, not just from being unwashed, but from a clear amount of effort. Destiny was sweaty, that much was clear, even through the drying rain on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Beggars can't be choosers,</i> you thought to yourself, and with a grimace you moved in. The best way to tackle this was to get her attention from down here, as trying to climb her before she moved would be impossible. With that in mind, you stepped in between her two biggest toes, one hand over your nose the whole way. With the other, you reached out and gave the skin between them a little poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. You did it again, this time with feeling, and again, the hard, calloused skin didn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new plan, then. From what you knew of tribal tattoos, which was little to nothing, the tatted skin would be much more tender than other bits of flesh. Unfortunately, there was only one bit of red ink you could reach, and it was under her arch. Heart in your throat, you slid between Destiny's feet, staring up at the mountains of her shins as you crept over to her instep. One wrong move here, and you could be toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr not, considering the treatment you suffered on your way in here. Still, better to err on the side of caution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arch wasn't much better that her toes; if anything, it was worse. She was a bit flat-footed, but a healthy bit of mud from her run caked the raised flesh. There, however, under the center of her foot, cast deep in shadow by her body, was a bright patch of red. You could reach it, easy as pie, just get on your stomach, crawl under the tons of strong, on-edge woman, and hope that your jabs are processed with a curious gaze and <i>not</i> a quick stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should try her toes again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You really didn't need to throw yourself in any more danger than you already were. Sure, the red markings highlighting the bridge-like structure of Destiny's arch were more reachable, and could be a weak point. And at your height, even a flat foot's arch gave you some breathing room. (If that was the right word, when the earthy, salty odor around you made you hold your nose again.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if you were under them, you'd be totally hidden in the shadows of her squatted knees and white-clothed hips. Even if she pulled her feet away, you doubted she would be able to spot you. Fear that surged through you the first time her gaze hit you, and it kept you still as the dirt specks around. Now that you resolved this meeting was fate, you wanted her eyes on you again; and to STAY on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides: after all that running, her soles were probably not only callused, covered with grime, and chillingly dangerous. They were probably sore. She might not appreciate a pathetic crumb of a crumb prodding and pushing at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you took a deep breath, twitching at the rank musk, and journeyed back to the spot in front of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavigating around loose twigs and pebbles, you kept alert, ready to dart to safety for twitches from her ankles. Unfortunately for you, the fire-lit behemoth was anything but stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny, just as vigilant as you, turned her neck towards any odd noise or flicker across the stony cave walls. The wet, copper hair brushed along her bare shoulders with only the faintest sound. Probably looking for whatever brought her (and you) in this cave. The tribal girl used the stick to stir the crackling flames at the dripping rocks. With each surprised glance and shallow breath, her gigantic legs tensed, ready to spring up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe balanced her weight forward and back across the forefoot and hindfoot, preparing to lift and then trying to relax. Her phalanges curled, digging trenches across the ground. With some louder echoes from outside the cavern's safety, her left or right leg turned on the heel, pressing both large toes snugly against each other before she returned them. This cautious stirring formed dirt clouds as the hardened skin rubbed across the soil. The dust rose fast enough and wildly enough that they clouded your vision. You found yourself relying on the glimmering light from the fire to guide the way back in front of Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA testament to your scale: it took this trek, filled with treacherous quakes and near-misses, just to get back before her feet. You got a clearer view of her face now. Her pupils had widened to adjust to the limited light, making the glowing effect stronger. Their lids, though, hung lower, lashes at a slight downwards slope. Sorrow still dressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyed your target - or rather, your targets. Each of the massive, worn toes hovered upwards in a wave, exposing their bases to the crackling fire. Even after having brushed off her soles earlier, assorted dirt clumped across the prints, looking like floating islands. With her legs' pressure removed, they cascaded into landslides, boulders of filth raining down with a crinkling noise. A breathy murmur slid from her bare stomach, muffled by the sound of the toes descending again to the indented soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen squirming obelisks, total. And between them, eight interspaces; you'd already tried tapping one callused web, between her two biggest toes, with no reaction from the giant. Maybe another spot would be softer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter choosing at random, you inched towards the smallest of Destiny's digits on her right foot. The ground right in front of the print was dug out in an indent from her fidgeting, and soft from the raindrops splashing towards it. At least, you <i>hoped</i> that was rain, and not sweat, that you were wading through to reach a potential sensitive zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little toe. You held your breath. A rustle of her anklet echoed through the air. A slosh from below as you stepped forward. The jagged nail fell from your field of vision, replaced with layers upon layers of ridges in the skin. Whereas the space between her toes was like a hard, impenetrable wall, the curve at the tip made this different; you couldn't actually reach the skin until part of that tip covered you. Seeing the tanned ceiling, at once like a landscape and a monster, you started to regret the idea. It'd be so easy to be buried in the murk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no - if that orb brought you here, and it let you survive on the treacherous path earlier. Running now would be pointless. You forced an arm forward, wet hand landing on the lowest ridge. Your fingers fit easily in the hard canyon. With no immediate reaction, you brought another hand up, and dug your fingers into the dermis. No use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing too hard could be painful. With the two of you alone, and Destiny still in a state of tension and sadness, that'd easily put you on the her bad list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried something else: elbowing the dirty skin. This pushed the tanned, dusty flesh a touch more. With a gulp of moist air, you pushed your whole arm into the toe. It instantly sprung back, the harsh surface almost tossing you pack without as much as a twitch from her flexor muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext plan: brushing your hands along the little toe quickly, wiggling each finger, trying to tickle her lightly. You succeeded mostly in covering your palms with the fine rubble and droplets accumulated from the catastrophic sprint in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that this foot - a horror in its expansive scale, wear and tear, and downright tear-inducing odor - had lost a good deal of sensitivity. If you had to guess, you'd say Destiny ran across hard terrain often, and rarely wore shoes, if ever. Did anyone else in that hut village?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, what kind of people lived in there? You had the sense that they might not have much in the way of tech; but this girl was the only one of the giant people you'd seen. In fact, you weren't even sure she lived in those huts, seeing how she sprinted away from them. You looked up across her tattoos, trying to read them for information. All the while, you walked to the next toe, crossing the dug-out soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few triangles and lines slid across her legs. Not much hair on her limbs; that meant a reduced chance of lice scurrying down to meet you. Considering the only tools around to shave were rocks and shells, some of which adorned her neck decorations, some of the (relatively) smaller scars could just be from shaving. Others, though, looked more severe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed into the second-last toe, prodding it with your arm, then your head, then your whole body. No response, even after winding up for a punch. And the foul smell was starting to get to you, so you didn't want to wait too long. Onto the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach had the largest of the spiraling, red marks. It centered right above her navel, and broke off into smaller loops just around her ribs - some in lines, giving her hips greater definition. Destiny slid an arm across the swirls, pressing it on her simple clothes. Below the white, intertwining ropes that made her top - beginning to discolour from sweat and loosen from stretching - a portion of her bosom was exposed. She pulled the hand away. Fresh, precise gashes ran across the left breast's underside, a glisten across them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked painful. Would she be okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light glare flashed from her mighty teeth, lighting up a small portion of the face. The strings of copper hair were still mostly in shadows. She was wincing, holding her necklace up. Her fingernails, just as chipped as her toenails, tore away a leaf from the assorted objects across it. The girl took a bite into it, chewing for a few seconds. It was just a tad worrying thinking about the force in those molars. Soon, she spat the ground herb into her palm, and rubbed it across the cuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but share her pain as she groaned, patting the remedy in. A string of worried thoughts went across your head. Were these tattoos common among the villagers? You'd heard stories of criminals getting permanent marks sewn as punishment; or of having themselves willingly marked to show loyalty or occupation. Come to think of it, there was nothing that actually said the village was inhabited. What if the others were running away, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this speculation, however, wasn't bringing her any closer to noticing you. She returned her gaze to the fire, prodding it more quickly. You picked up the largest pebble you could, buckling under its weight, and tossed it towards a part of the middle toe that looked less dirt-worn. It flicked slightly when the stone hit. The force from her toe sent you back, rolling in the mud. From her empty gaze, it seemed like Destiny's action was subconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething crossed your mind: if she didn't notice pressure, what about wetness or temperature changes? Like if something slimy touched her foot... You stretched your tongue out, feeling the godlike tribal girl's bodily warmth enter your throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No. You weren't desperate enough to start foot-licking. It was unhygienic. Just tasting the unwashed sole might be enough to get you poisoned with gigantic germs. Instead, you spat on your hand, rubbing the saliva across the toe. Even this made your stomach turn. Each breath was more and more dreadful, being bathed in this miasma for so long. Your head pounded from the constant noise of her breaths and pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, shaking. Her chin slid back. One arm fell to the ground, putting away the stick. The knee lifted. The ball of her foot lifted off the ground, some of the salty water glistening in the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wetness around you meant you were pulled up a little as Destiny shifted positions. Your arms were glued to the dirty toe again, coming off the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that again - you jumped off as soon as possible. The mud made for a soft landing, but it still knocked your wind out. And the muck splashing around you made it hard to move. For the moment, you could only look up and hope she saw you...</span></div></div>",

Chills shook down your wet spine, dripping with rainwater. She spotted you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense woman's red-tattooed fingertips poked the underside of her lip, curled into an expression of confusion. Above, her untrimmed eyelashes stood out, eyes spread in sudden alert. Mile-wide pupils shrunk slowly in the glowing fire, revealing more of the glistening blue irises. These were pupils trained to quickly identify threats and food. Attached to them, her titanic, healthy body was perfectly trained to overcome foes - or catch meals. It was covered only in simple white underwear, and those swirling red markings along her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rested in place, still as a rock, trying to read this titan's actions. Her nose curled up in suspicion and curiosity, making the red paint across it flex with her. The shadows metamorphosed her overpowering form into something even more fearsome, creeping back and forth along her skin with her heavy breaths. The crackle of flame echoed behind you, and sent light against her skimpy bra and beaded necklace - which glistened with moisture. Her bosom's expansions and contractions, accented by the glow, were irregular and brief, making the jewelry chatter. Droplets dribbled off her stomach and limbs, glistening brightly in the dim cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain kept crashing outside, with animal noises joining it. \"Okay. No need to panic. She could be friendly.\" Trying not to scream, you reached an arm up to the lightly-clothed titan before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft thumping - the girl's anklet pieces were moving together. Her leg stretched out to greet it, a single toe pushing forward to poke you. This digit drove into your open torso with the strength of a battering ram. It sent you flying in a clean arc through the sky, and, upon your landing, rolling across the grungy cave ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Neh?! La ero - flugis?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearly-nude behemoth's startled cry echoed against the walls. She stared at the gigantic toe, twitching it in shock, surprised by her own power over you. Her face tilted over to you. This titan quickly hid her foot under her backside, and her gaze darted to the side. It looked as if she was saying, \"nope, that wasn't me who tapped you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumbled through the pain, getting back up. \"S-seriously...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tone put the gigantic girl at alert again, scrutinizing your movements. The spiraling tattoos on her shoulders flashed. Her towering hand pawed down to the ground, terraforming the dirty cave floor landscape between her digits. She leaned in more, tilting her neck back and forth. You made out some relatively-minuscule raindrops still running down the mounds of her dangling chest. As they dripped, they gathered into huge puddles by your feet. That face hovered over you like a UFO. Even in the dim candlelight, you could see every detail of its intense, puzzled features. Ropes of copper hair swung like a thousand Swords of Damocles above. Her breath was strong enough to blow stone-sized dust off the ground around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made you flinch, stumbling backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap, she drew her mighty arm back, as if something bit it. Her teeth clenched in surprise, each the right size and sharpness to guillotine a whale. \"<i>Fibesta!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I will not bite you.\" You inched forward, pointing to yourself. \"Friend. Good. Not bug. Don't squish anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing how much your colossal cave-mate could see (or understand), you put on your biggest, friendliest smile. Through your shaking, some of the remaining dirt and sweat fell off your body. You moved your arms in the most open, non-aggressive pose possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue eyes above you squinted as she clicked her tongue. Experimentally, she sniffed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigantic gusts pulled at your shirt from above. It was impossible to keep your footing faced with this bone-shattering wind power. But you didn't tumble over like before. Rather, you floated up towards the suction's source. With just a curious whiff, she'd turned the world around you to a shapeless blur, pulling you up, up, up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, everything was black. Black, but you still felt something underneath you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis giant huntress has sucked you right up into her left nostril! You were encased in a glob of her snot, nose hairs shifting around like unsteady trees. The flesh inside was also wet, from what you could feel. It formed a whole cave of its own, in a way - the \"ceiling\" was far enough over your head to make it almost roomy. Her breath's constant huff-puff was like a hurricane to your face and scalp; but you kept held in place by the yellow-green gunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah! Eeech! Lasu, lasu, lasu!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell by the voice pounding below that this woman was seriously irritated by her nasal intruder. She itched her nose. First, it was a quick, brisk rub. Then she began clawing at it rapidly. You felt the soft surface of her skin brush and clash against you. With each twitch of her active, fidgety fingers, slimy mounds of nasal flesh kneaded your teensy body. If anything, it pushed you deeper into the putrid mucus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge winds began erupting around you, with horrid shaking all around the squishy microcosm. Your cave-mate had plugged one nostril with a finger, and was attempting to blow you out. With no access to tissues, she had trouble. The snorts and blows sent even greater winds still across your body, making your hair stand on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one snort pulled so hard, it caught you in a flood of mucus. The waves pulled you down through the behemoth girl's soft palate, onto her tongue. Sensing you there, the mouth quickly built up a flood of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. HELP - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to call out, only to have your own mouth flooded by the wave of spit sweeping the giant huntress' jaw. Your arms thrashed around in the fluid, its thickness making every wave feel slow and heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn earth-shaking \"<i>PWEH!</i>\" vocalization melted you. A split-second later, the girl spat you out to the cave floor. Your drop was long; but thanks to your body's minimized weight, the landing didn't hurt much. Still, the pool of drool was so deep that you had to paddle to keep from drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Eck. Fiaaaa!</i>\" The titanic tribal girl ran the side of her red-tattooed arm over her tongue a few times. After watching you twist and turn for a moment, cheeks slightly green, she brought a thumb and index down over your flailing form, a pillar on either end - and with surprising gentleness, plucked you out of the pool. You still couldn't respond or run, having too much of her spit caught in your mouth. You lay helplessly as she twisted her heel, trapping your body beneath the shadow of her largest toe. Not this torture again - your heart raced, throat swelling, as dirt rained upon your face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed a single immense toe down, covering your body and knocking the wind out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a second-long squeeze, she peeled it off. You felt your skin glued to hers by the slimy coating for a moment, before falling back to the dirt floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she pushed back on you, dirtying your form once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribal girl's unstoppable toe compressed your torso in a rhythm - until you choked out the last of the liquid into the flesh. Her sole sprung back, still mobile as it dug into the ground. Her gaze lay on you. The sharp teeth were still unsteady, frowning, as if the whole situation embarrassed or disgusted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Th...thanks?\" What else, really, could you say to a half-naked girl that had just given you CPR, and who towered over you even on all fours?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, the woosh of her dirty copper hair sending a spittle of salty drops on you. \"<i>...Nnhn. Ne dankinde.</i>\" Her attention turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rainfall splashed louder outside. You heard the same animalistic screech, close enough to shake you. The copper-haired girl shook at it for a moment, too, looking unsure. Was that beast chasing her? Is that why she ran all that distance away from the village?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not one beast. The paws of at least three wolves arrived at the cave entrance. Normal animals wouldn't chase prey that far - but here they were, right at the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the cave roared back to them, her harsh echo conquering the air. She began waving her hands before the fire. It cast a shadow on the far wall that spanned even larger than the real thing. A goliath able to crush mountains under her heel... She took a deep, quivering breath, and let out another uneasy warning scream. You realized her tactic: she was trying to make herself look larger with the flame, and scare the predators off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves kept approaching, undeterred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be a good time to run away. But to leave the girl there, after she saved your life... Still, what could you even do to help?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were ready to bolt for it; these wolves could eat twelve specks like you in one gulp, judging by the scale of their barking muzzles. The towering tribal warrior girl might be too large of a prey for them; but one wrong move from you, and they'd leap at an opportunity to have your little form in their barking muzzles. What could you possibly do against the wild beasts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wild? You looked up to the girl's quaking, open eyes as she fanned the fire. Sparks danced across the wet shine of outspread arms, embracing the red tattoos. Every little wave sent minuscule splashes of rainwater from her trained, agile muscles, evaporating into the crackle of flames and sparks. A few drips crashed onto your scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't make sense; why would wild creatures follow this behemoth hunter all the way here, through harsh weather? She didn't have any food with her. The hands danced in and out of shadows, empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this massive cave was their territory, and they were defending it? But - as the pain still jolting your back recalled - the two of you had a long journey here through the home. If this cave were the wolves' home, they would have been close enough to come in from the rain, before you and your copper-haired carrier plopped to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless... the wolves weren't wild at all? Were they ancestors of hunting dogs, tamed by some early human? Maybe someone that the red-marked goliath was running away from, with you plastered below?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that why she fled the village?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nrrr... Tschoo!</i>\" As the tattooed girl's fierce warning echoed through the walls, it wavered with an uncertain whimper. She pounded the soil once more, revealing the sole of that foot you had become too familiar with: mud coating its calluses and clumping around the short nails, and between the folds of her toe segments. They hid red markings on the foot's underside; you could barely glimpse the edges before she slammed it down to the earth once more, pebbles flying around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above, through massive clenched teeth, she took in shallow breaths as her eyes darted to you. They gleamed blue with a sense of urgency and disbelief - and kept darting behind her, as a signal. \"<i>Iru!</i>\" You felt frozen frozen in her mighty gaze; a speck within her blue-moon pupils. An impatient tap of her immense foot knocked you off your feet; before she positioned the largest digit over you. The mass of wrinkles eclipsed the flame, overcoming the entirety of your ground-bound body, and encasing it in the same mud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hard, salty surface of her toe flesh above dragged you back across the ground, coating your torso with grime. Soon, the harrowing weight rose from your chest - slamming once more, as a warning to the wolves, and driving a gigantic, wet footprint into the ground beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your jostled head in pain, re-orienting yourself from the young woman's sudden swipe. \"Urrghh...\" Slowly, your eyes focussed on the flame - the grey wolves were nearing, starting to break the standoff from outside. Droplets slithered down her cloth garments, tracing a line down her sky-high legs; barely visible from the lower lighting in this part of the cave. You realized, the titan's tattooed toes had covertly dragged you to safety from the wolves. Despite her panic, despite her animalesque roars, your colossal cave-mate was trying to keep you from their jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't just leave her there. Even if a single sinew in her flexing toe and twitching finger held more power than you'd ever seen in a living being... the low, hurried breaths from her sad lips felt deeply human. The more you thought back to the crashes of thunder and her curious sniffing, the less she became a force of nature, pushing your helpless body around; she was someone who you'd escaped danger with. No, even bigger than that: in the clash of flames, the flashing red marks' movements had more importance. The warrior was on edge for a reason; she was being chased by animals for a reason; and, you couldn't help but think, you had landed in her path for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was destined to happen this way, no matter what path you or her took. You'd end up on the same muddy road with this titan... Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you could learn your copper-haired companion's name, you decided to call her <i>Destiny</i>. It just sounded <i>right</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward. To your right, something big rattled up. Destiny's arm had reached over to pull out a stick - and brushed it out over the flames to try to push the wolves back. Her lips quivered, releasing a cautions groan. Quickly, it grew to a bark, as Destiny swung fast - generating a boom above you, and shifting the shadows nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndeterred, the wolves approached, jaws snapping. A crash of thunder outside emphasized the rough, torn fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward, your pulse racing, to the behemoth soles as they shifted. Round crimson markings flashed by your face as she stepped back - waving along with the creases on the side of Destiny's foot. Ignoring the pressure that made your legs shake, and the earthy aroma that made your sinuses ache, you patted your hand on the murky surface. A reassuring brush of your palm, on the only part of her you could reach - sinking into the remaining murky residue over her skin. Even if just for moral support, you would stand with Destiny. You shouted to the animals: \"Stand back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween a wave of her arm, the gigantic, red-kissed face stared down to you. \"<i>...Ero? Nyeh!?</i>\" She shook her neck, and pointed the rod behind her, jabbing it. With a glimmer from the flame, she looked to have an incredulous expression, one eyebrow raised and her mouth open slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as the barking outside approached its crescendo, Destiny leaned in closer - the immense shadows on the wall transmogrifying with the shifting mountains - and stretched her hand out. It was dirtied and wet, boulders of murk and miasma between the shivering wrinkles. The whole thing engulfed you in its shadow, reaching you cautiously. Figuring this was some kind of salute, you stretched your hand out with equal hesitation; and let it press to the woman's skin, sinking in. The furrow in her brows receded with the speed and weight of tectonic plates eroding. She shut her eyes and whispered: \"<i>Zamakibo.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" You answered, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, her fingertips closed around you, pressing you deep into their salty ridges. You were stuck between a red dot mark,  and a clump of dirt. She stood to her full height, bringing you up with her in a soaring rush. Even with your heart racing, you remained perfectly still; a feather floating on the winds of Destiny, raised by her will shifting, crackling flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resumed her shouts, facing the approaching wolves with greater vigour: \"<i>Bwaargh! Grr... ARGH!</i>\" Her gaping mouth was now close enough that projectile spittle doused you, before fizzling out into the fire below. Uncomfortable warmth ran its course through your sinews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo canines pawed back. One, in the center, approached closer - barking at you and your tattooed companion. She snapped at her, baring her teeth; and with a sudden jump back, kicked dirt into the flames. The fire seemed to grow wider, her shadow on the wall larger; and her face was lost in the bizarre, morphing shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see your own shadow against the wall, clearly. The angle of the flame made you look almost normal-sized - or it would, were it not for the titaness clutching to you. Her own shade occupied a greater surface area than the brown wall. With the way the flames lit it up, you could practically see the drool running down her lips across the mismatched stones, as your shadow moved in closer to her teeth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shuffled her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't dare look down: but Destiny's humid breath blew across your flesh from below. Out of the corner of your eye, you caught the glimmer of her sharp teeth, as she lowered you towards them. You didn't flail or squirm, beyond discomforted wobbles: you just let Destiny take command, as her mouth shut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHOMP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that sickening crunch, the tamed animal receded, tail swishing to the flame. Its two companions followed. Destiny's harsh, hoarse breaths echoed through the cave, rattling everything, until the last paws had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook, too. The ground was still hard, leathery, and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing your eyes open you held your breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd let it go in a sigh of relief, sinking into her palm. She sunk to her thighs, her building-size shoulders loosening, as her other hand checked you for damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny had moved you right beside her cheek. The scaled-up shadows made it look like a gigantic monster had swallowed a whole human, scaring the predators away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you knew you had no reason to panic. She might have poked you around with ease, buy This behemoth tribal girl had no reason to gulp down something she found on her foot. She knew how to handle herself in this jungle. You needed her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by the way her short, dirt-caked nails kept poking you, while her great blue irises and diluted pupils scanned your tiny face, she needed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destiny,\" you muttered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"<i>Dess... tih... knee...</i>\" Her scratched neck nodded, and her hand rubbed her glistening hair; until she pointed at herself, mouth open slightly. \"<i>Destiny? Hhmh.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Yeah.\" It looked like she was starting to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman slowly fanned the flames, getting back to her seated position, she jabbed the finger at you. Her voice was down to a whisper. \"<i>Zamakibo.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp of air, you repeated, pointing to yourself: \"Zah-mah-ki-bo.\" You guessed that was her name for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nmm.\" For the first time that night, Destiny's lips curled up slightly. It was as if, in the middle of a storm, she was able to shut herself away for a while, into a tiny corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just happened to be in that corner with her.</span></div></div>",

Your breath grows short, your mind begins to race, and your heart pounds like thunder. You scream out into this other worldly rainbow sea before it over took you and you passed out. In that time the darkness gave you solace, an escape from the plane of light that had taken you into its grip. You escaped into the void of your very mind the darkness giving you a sense of freedom as your body moved weightlessly through that unending world of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake with a sharp gasp with the sounds of nature all around you. Your eyes open to a light blue sky with a few soft white clouds slowly drifting through the sky. That strange world of light, had it been nothing, but some kind of dream?

You were sat on the side of a massive brown plan with large boulders scattered about going on into the distance in both directions.

The young morning had now turned into aging afternoon with a lazy sun hanging low in the sky. You had walked miles by now, at least at your size it was miles. You hadn't thought about the fact this path was not on your scale so a day's walk for a giant could end up a week or two for you. It was quickly growing clear you'd never be able to walk anywhere on your own before dying of starvation or dehydration. You need to figure something out and soon or this road would be the end of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral Hours later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started to grow dark making it hard to see much of anything.

It would seem you'd have to figure out what you were going to do in the morning, but then a growing tremor. It started light and started to grow stronger and faster.

She had on simple clothing just a basic cloth shirt and pants and what looked like leather shoes. It took you a moment to notice one other feature, her ears... they were massive!

You would of normally said elf's weren't real, but your day had proven that you had no clue what was and wasn't real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon lost sight of the elf woman's face as she stopped just a few feet away from you. You could hardly see past the woman's knees as she simply stood still for a moment. It seemed she was looking at something. You keep to the edge of the path and away from her massive feet the best you could not wanting to end up like the ant from that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman soon placed her pack on the ground before taking a seat in the grass.

You really are the size of an insect here and possibly even smaller too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you know the truth behind your size, you don't where you are at the moment. You climb one of the grass blades in order to get a close look at this new world. Once you got to the top, you finally got a first look at the giant world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on an open field that stretched for miles; the only thing you saw here at the moment were a few trees and small hills but no giants around here. You sighed a relief at the last part since you don't want to get stepped on right now, but you do need some help right now so you began searching for a sign of people around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, you managed to find something that was a bit closer to you. It was a large area that was fenced up, but you could make out some structure behind the fences. The buildings appear to look like barns plus a farmhouse making you believe that it was a giant farm. It could have some people there that might help you out, but they might be too busy to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and saw a nearby forest which is unlikely to have inhabitants, but you were kinda curious on what to find there and what this world's about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile searching around some more, you suddenly stop at something further away. You can't make out what it is, but you can see a bright light coming from that spot. There was something going on there and you were on the urge to find out what it is. As attempting you are, it could be dangerous because you scent a rather unusual activity there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere would you go?</span></div></div>",

The journey ahead was akin to a long hike, unfortunately you had very little experience with even the basics of hiking, but it wasn't like you could leave to learn and come back later. Your knowledge of survival skills was limited as well, but it was quite easy to tell that anything lurking among the grass would be a threat. That and once night fell, your clothes would do little to protect from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this rather damning information in hand, you pushed on regardless. Moving through clumpy dirt and towering grass, you pondered over how good this'd be for your fitness, perhaps that gym membership was a waste of money. Then again, there was no way for you to predict strange basement crystals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours of walking passed, and your enthusiasm for the task ahead had been snuffed out like a candle in the wind. You didn't even know if you were heading in the right direction. That was until you saw it, a huge wooden pole stretching incomprehensibly high into the sky, and another, and another. The fence!

Beyond was valleys of brown earth, much more visible than the ground was among the grass. The tree like grass was gone, replaced with even taller plants. You couldn't see the top of them, but they very much looked like corn plants. This world seemed familiar... but at the same time utterly foreign.

The plants weren't too far along yet, which made it quite easy for her to walk among them and give them the water they needed to persist through the dry season. Faith was fifteen, a rather meek little thing (at least in comparison to other people native to this world). She was a tiefling, with red skin and solid purple eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorns sprouted from her head and a large thick tail extended from her rear. By almost all metrics, she looked quite demonic, and was immensely imposing to the tiny person before her. In her hands she held a crude watering can, it's heft and weight was clearly causing her some difficulty. Faith inched forwards slightly, pouring some water down onto the next couple of plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour awe rather quickly turned to horror as the sky over you darkened, this person's immense shadow falling over you. It hit you how utterly gargantuan she was, your body filling with adrenaline. It only worsened as you spotted something seemingly falling, a couple of seconds passing before the first of the rainfalls began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater droplets crashed against the ground in great number, some of it soaking into the ground, with some of it sliding down across the dirt, some into the valley where you stood.

Her smug face glared down your flea-sized body, pushing it tight between the ridges of her gigantic index and thumb. How could she even see you - when her body was like a landscape in its own right, her boobs below forming mountain ranges? You felt absolutely engulfed by her satellite-sized lime irises, pitch-black pupils showing a slight slant. The lashes caused gusts as they blinked towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeated, confused: \"E-enjoy your...\" It was hard to read her tone when her mouth wasn't even in your field of view, stretching far down below. Was that a look of excitement, or anger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I didn't see you on my gut, pesky mortal!\" The demon girl laughed, dangling you before her flying spittle. From this dizzying position, you saw a flash of her teal hair, hanging loose, lathered with beads of sweat from the dimension's sweltering temperature. Wide horns rose from within the locks, sharp and well-polished. \"I don't know where you came from, little one - but you're on  Feliss Beach now, at the heart of the Netherworld. Here, nobody can go around feeling people's skin...\" Her dainty digits rubbed her gut, right where you were, the pointed fingernails easily running across the malleable skin. \"Especially not a tiny bug like you! The only male anywhere in this world - I can have you boiled in the second hell for your insolent lust, facing the dark goddess' legion of the damned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the intense sensation of burning, you felt frozen and numb. \"I...I didn't...\" This towering woman's fingers, despite their constricting, inescapable hold on your chest, felt loose with carelessness. The bounders of sand built up around them, along with the dripping sweat, threatened to sweep you away and send you rocketing back down. The Netherworld? That strange flash had transported you right into hell! You could only imagine the great rocks and people laboring in torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was entirely different. From up here, you finally got a good view of the surrounding area: a beach... entirely populated by gigantic demon girls! No males or humans in sight, just building-sized ladies loafing and relaxing around the whole sandy country! Some, like your captor, are soaking in the sun, resting on towels and chairs - this giantess' towel had a pattern of skulls across it, exactly like one in the modern world above. Sandals crashed around, lifting sandstorms of boulders with their treads - completely unnoticeable to them. Most terrifyingly, some wet bodies frolicked, dove, and paddled in a red sea... an ocean of boiling lava, so hot that steam rose from the waves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this where you were going to die? You clasped your hands together, made cross symbols over yourself, and whimpered, desperate for some miracle to save you from this temptress of the Netherworld's shores...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, look at you wriggle!\" She snickered, her sharp teeth in a smile. \"I lied to you. What fun would it be to just watch another stupid sinner burn up? You're in luck; the great Bezella has decided to give this belly button lint some mercy...\" She brushed her azure hair back, the ends snapping like whips in the distance. \"...As long as he pays her back justly for your insolence. So, I ask again: did you enjoy my belly, specky? You can have much more of it...\" She rubbed the flesh once more, blood-red canyons and salty rivers rising and falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBezella... You shivered before her mighty form, and considered her offer. Make a deal with a devil? That sounded terrifying. And it was obvious - by the tilt in her hold, the slant in her eye, and the demeaning words slipping from her long blue tongue - that keeping you safe wasn't a priority. But by the way it sounded, little humans might not be welcome here; or they may be victims to horrible torture. What would happen to you if you were at the mercy of this \"Dark Goddess\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd anyways, when you looked at it from here, spread out like a map of soft folds - but still with a nice, toned surface. The red soil lay between the expanse of her simple bikini top and bottom, lathered with a river of sweat from her cleavage. You couldn't lie; it was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter the devil you know. With a gulp, you nodded profusely, staring at her face. \"I... I liked your belly, Miss Bezella! Please, don't be mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, hand to her hip. It looked as if an ember emerged from her other palm. \"You're honest, wandering mortal. Maybe foolhardy, but honest. Of course, who can blame you!\" She stretched out over the towel, basking in the rays of the sun. \"I put a lot of work into keeping it in shape, after all! So, you'll be happy to know - your payment could very well make Bezella's beautiful stomach even more glorious...\" She grinned, indulging in the sensation of your terror. </span></div></div>",

You slid right off the smooth pillars, falling a great distance. All the sands and flashing bodies of beachgoers whir by you as you descend, lower and lower; before finally landing on her stomach. The tight black swimsuit Bezella wore left little to the imagination; judging by the other titans in the distance, partly distorted by the heat lines, small bikinis were the current fashion in the underworld. Now, the chest of your captor, in those loose cloths, looked like great mountains that fielded in your landscape. The slow, relaxed breaths she let out rocked them up and down; even when it looked like a world of glistening red around you, every minute sound below reminded you that this was, indeed, a living being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, if demons were \"alive\". You didn't know how Hell's mechanics worked; and you hoped, if you made this woman happy, she'd get you back up before you had to find out more. From above, Bezella's slanted, demonic eyes loomed, patches of otherworldly yellow in a blazing crimson sky. From this position, you could clearly see her mighty fangs as she spoke - clean, sharp, and pristine, like spires on a cathedral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too comfy down there. I know it must be hard not to enjoy Bezella's stomach... but you're on a mission, not a sightseeing tour.\" The world shook as Bezella's slender hand moved, reaching for great bottle of lotion from beside her generous ass. Her claw stealthily cracked the canister open, and she hovered it above her gut for a second. Just the tiniest bit of pressure from her fingers, and a stream of ethereal blue liquid swept down atop you. Nearly drowning in the demonic tan lotion, you swam to the top of the sticky glob, watching it sink into her flesh. It irrigated the fields and valleys of her stomach and abs. The dark red texture gained a lustrous sheen, that glistened against the crashing waves of magma. It almost felt as if something was moving by your hand - but that was probably only the quake of her stomach as she flopped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer azure hair swept across the sandy beach, and she shook you a little by tapping on her gut - making you paddle in the sticky lotion as it crawled out to fill the new crevices in her soft gut. \"Now, if you love my belly so much, rub that all in. Give it an even coat; I want to see it glisten all over!\" She prodded you again, without even looking, content to sip away at a soda. \"And hurry up, before the lotion dries away. It's a special gift from my friend, Acedia, and she wouldn't be like you wasting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trudged out of the wet blob, rubbing your clothes - no matter what, the blue liquid still soaked them. You sighed to yourself, leaning over the skin. The flesh wriggled gently against your touch, as you brushed the lotion into its pores. Looking in the distance, the flowing magma shores shone far away - over a whole map of hills and valleys for you to rub. \"Her gut's so huge... Why can't she get another demon to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I hear a <i>little sloth</i> down there?\" Bezella cooed, her singsong tone rattling you to your micro-sized feet as it rushed through the huge pipes below her skin. \"Slothful mortals are punished the fifth hell, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap - this demon had super-strong vision AND hearing? You knelt down and began lathering the tanning lotion into her skin, running your fingers along the floor. You forced it in to the best of your ability, polishing the smooth, squishy surface until you ran out of liquid. Quickly, you ran across the fields of her stomach to get another handful of the tanning lotion, feeling the blue, glowing substance rush out of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic demoness pounded her fist in the sand - sending a few other beach visitors walking away. \"Come on, put your back into it! Or maybe you want me to get a bad tan?\" She reached out, fingers blotting out the light as they wiggled, brushing against her skin. \"Maybe you'd rather face the Dark Goddess' legions as you drown in an endless swamp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you sloshed the lotion all over her stomach - using your whole body as a sponge to rub it in roughly. Desperate to get that looming shadow off your back, you splashed more and more liquid across the red flesh. For the time being, you could ignore how gross it was as it clung to your hair and rushed under your shirt. You could ignore the face that sweat from her toned gut was starting to leak off on you, mixing with the blue-glowing oils with a wet, sloshing texture that absolutely engulfed your being. You could ignore the small, dreadful movements from her gut that seemed to grow as you spread more lotion over her world of a belly. All that mattered was making her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long, quiet laugh, Bezella's stomach moved up and down - tripping you into a faceful of the gleaming torso. \"Haha, that's hilarious!\" She dragged her hand away, across the moist surface of her skin - and poked at her abs, the side of her hand brushing back the blue bikini top. \"Now, up here, my speck of a sinner. You've yet to see Bezella's abdomen at its finest sheen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked back, soaking in the Netherworld's rays. You didn't dare grumble as you climbed closer to her abs, lathering more lotion within their folds. These weren't as forgiving as her stomach; they didn't let you squeeze the tanning liquid in, flesh overflowing between your fingers. They were like mighty walls that you had to climb over, slipping and sliding. Every part of your body fell down at least once, to the demoness' amusement, as you made your best attempt to follow her instructions. Sometimes, if she breathed in enough, bits of her skin would entrap you between them, pushing your face into the dazzling crimson curves - forcing you to fight back with all your might just for breathing space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top it all off, your job was occasionally interrupted by great noises from the beach nearby. A team of demons played volleyball nearby, and each harsh impact of the ball against their palms made you shake. At one point, it even slammed nearby; the ground rumbled as Bezella threw it back, letting you fall into a puddle of glowing azure as she lifted up gently. And right after that, she prodded you. \"I hope you're not getting tired of my body... There's a lot more you have left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was back to work again. The liquid made a sizzling noise as you mixed it in, as if it were evaporating upon contact with the demoness' body. You weren't surprised; not only was the surface wet with sweat, both yours and the enormous sunbather's, the waves of lava around made the atmosphere as hot as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, as hot as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, panting, you collapsed at the greatest height of the demon girl's towering torso; right under the cool shade of her mighty bosom. Behind you lay the fruit of your work: fields upon fields of glowing, brilliant red flesh, lathered with the tanning lotion to a beautiful sheen. Every little goosebump, inch, hard corner, crease, wrinkle, and muscle glimmered with it. The skin below reflected your wet, disheveled face; you could barely recognize yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhm... That'll do.\" Bezella sighed, looking up to the sun. She nudged her flesh to press against you, feeling one last, weak wiggle from your tiny body. \"You've done well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stared down, ready to sink, you felt something push back up. The same strange movement that you'd sensed before; you'd thought it was just the mega demoness' unconscious movements, but standing still, it almost felt like multiple bumps against you, pushing from below the barrier of red. Reflected in her gleaming, beautiful skin, there was something other than your face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were dozens of other faces, screaming, pushing over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot boy, you've damned us all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jesus, forgive me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fainest echo of voices passed your head. You shifted it to the bottle of tanning lotion, finally getting a good look at it... It read \"Sin Screen - Souls of the Damned in Liquid Format\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your heart sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly, you shook your hands; but there was still blue, dripping soul lotion over your palms. You panted out, short of breath: \"This... isn't tanning lotion! It's... human souls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic horned head soon appeared in the reflection beside you, teeth showing through her giggles. \"It's both! My gorgeous skin needs regular application of soul energy to keep its perfect red luster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over the fields in terror. This whole time, you didn't think there were any fellow humans. But human ghosts were there all along; and you were condemning them to a fate among these curvy masses! It made your stomach turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a hand to her hip, eyelids sinking smugly. \"Don't act so shocked. It's a demon's job to punish sinners. If you ask me, I'm doing your world a favor.\" Gleefully, she poked her red finger right by her navel, the skin forming waves around it. \"This here is the soul of a mass-murderer; he'll have to burn his wrath away here.\" The digit twisted in the sky, before poking her abdomen. \"Oh, and this little soul here was the head of a pyramid scheme! She put people on the street from that!\" Slowly, Bezella traced her digit up, before it landed right next to you. \"And this little spirit here wrote degrading fetish stories... But never finished any of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a whiny, disembodied scream beside you: \"I just got busy<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">yyy</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">yy...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reeled her head back in disgust, squeezing her slender fingers over her skin and digging canyons within. \"Their sins will burn nicely in there, and they'll end up giving me a body befitting a Demon of Vaniglory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, sweat running down your neck. Just how had you gotten yourself in here? Could you really trust Bezella?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her laugh finished, the red giantess moved a hand over to you. \"Come on, now, mortal...\"</span></div></div>",

Your character can have any sort of personality such as adventurous, mischievous, fearful, and among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Any sort of fetishes are allowed, but try to keep with the main theme of the story which is Macro stuff of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Keep up with the main theme of each world you're on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. You are small enough to go unnoticed by the giants. If you want to write an aware story, try to make an explanation on how they managed to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Use at least descent grammar and try to put more details into your chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Don't end the story so soon and too early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Deaths are allowed, but make it more detailed instead of just a \"You got eaten and died\" sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Giants must be humanoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Have fun!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n06/21/2019 UPDATE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of this time, the story's rating has now jumped from 13+ to 18+ giving everyone the freedom to write whatever fits their style whatever they want. Any chapters with violent, sexual or other contents that are common in older rated stories are accepted without consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there's still a few limits that you must follow. Just because you can write whatever you want does not mean there's no rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No extreme sexual content with underage characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's so damn obvious why stuff like this should never be in the story. I don't want to see a story involving NSFW material with young characters because it's seriously messed up. So please don't go too far with this sort of stuff with the chapter involve around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No rebirthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can still tolerate Insertion stuff....even if that's not my cup of tea. However, I can't really make sense with rebirthing stuff (I mean how can't you be turn into a newborn just by going inside reproductive organs) so I'm afraid this sort of stuff aren't allowed. My apologizes to all you fans out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Toilet stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I'm fine with some bodily functions like sweat, boogers, and so on. However, I'm not okay with pooping, peeing and other stuff that is commonly seen on the toilet. Seriously, I'm terribly grossed out by this sort of stuff. Of course, that doesn't mean everyone can't do their business as long it happens off-screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you have it guys, go extra nuts and write what's ever in your mind ;)</td>",
