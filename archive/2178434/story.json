Some believed a mad scientist invented it but it was too powerful and caused his downfall. While others preach the gods themselves once wielded the mighty device. All that is known is that this powerful object fell to earth and was lost in time. Until, by sheer coincidence, it found its way to a Hunter Academy called Beacon. A place where children are turned into warriors to fight the monsters called Grimm. Why it wasn\u2019t destroyed by these monsters, will never be known.

She had been practicing a few new moves in the Emerald Forest right outside of Beacon. With no other Grimm in the vicinity, she transformed Crescent Rose, her signature weapon, a high caliber sniper rifle that could transform into a large scythe, back into its compact mode before clipping it onto her hip. She then started to head back to Beacon to hang out with her team. Whistling, she started skipping, happy that her training was bearing fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething sparkled in the sunlight near a tree and she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid someone drop something?\u201d Ruby thought, heading over to it. The forest was used by all the students at Beacon, so it wouldn\u2019t be uncommon to see things left behind occasionally. As she drew close, a look of confusion formed on her face. \u201cA remote? What would a remote be used for out here?\u201d She picked it up and noticed a small folded up pamphlet underneath it. Her confusion only grew as she read the title.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nYour Guide to the Swapping Remote</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething compelled her to read the pamphlet and her eyes slowly widened as she read on. By the time she reached the end, her mouth was wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has to be a prank,\u201d Ruby muttered. \u201cBut what if it\u2019s not?\u201d She looked back and forth and all around her for someone to pop out and confirm her suspicion. \u201cIf something like this is real, I have to try it.\u201d Her only option was to try it out. The temptation was too great for her to ignore and Ruby had always been weak to temptation. It\u2019s why the cookie jar back home was always empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was; should she use it now or show it to someone first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was non other than velvet scarlatina from team Cfvy. \"Maybe I should test the remote in her first.\" Ruby said giving a big grin on her face. \"But what to try on her first?\" She added. \"Perhaps, a body swap couldn't hurt.

It was so obvious and she wouldn\u2019t have to say anything before doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer partner would be the perfect test subject. As they lived together, any swaps could easily be undone and it allowed Ruby to observe the results of said swaps. This was also the opportunity to learn more about her partner. Giggling to herself, she ran as fast as possible. Her speed Semblance allowed her to arrive back at Beacon in no time at all. She dashed up the stairs and turned down the hallway to her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly crashing into the person she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, dolt.\u201d Weiss had barely been able to step to the side and Ruby tripped in the process of trying to avoid her, ending up on the ground. \u201cI thought you were going to waste time in the Emerald Forest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did,\u201d Ruby bragged, pushing herself up to her feet. \u201cI came back to\u2026 get started on my homework.\u201d That was a lie and Weiss had to obviously know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d She raised an eyebrow in disbelief while crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ruby lied again. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking. You were right. My grades aren\u2019t as high as they should be because I don\u2019t study hard enough. I still don\u2019t like studying, but I\u2019m trying to get into the habit.\u201d Weiss stared at her for a moment in silence. Ruby felt sweat form on her forehead and her heart stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Weiss said and her expression changed from skepticism to being slightly impressed. Ruby\u2019s heart started beating again. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you are taking your responsibilities seriously for a change. No one likes studying, but you have to do it. I need to drop something off at Professor Goodwitch\u2019s office and then I\u2019ll be back. If you have any questions on the assignment, I can help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot, bestie,\u201d Ruby replied and Weiss rolled her eyes. Weiss normally helped by making sure Ruby was reading the right chapters and occasionally proofread her essays. Ruby had an inkling that Weiss would be more helpful this time because she believed Ruby was taking the initiative instead of being forced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Ruby to feel a little guilty as she raised the remote at Weiss\u2019s retreating back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Weiss was going to be back soon, Ruby didn\u2019t want to Life Swap yet. She limited it to one of the other swaps. The Body Swap button would allow Ruby to become Weiss physically, but everyone else would still see her as herself. Wardrobe Swap was really temping. Weiss never let Ruby try on her clothes. Of course, she hated heals, but it might be fun to walk a mile in Weiss\u2019s shoes. Ruby immediately hated herself for thinking of a Yang pun. The last option was a Personality/Personal Info swap. This would cause them to swap something less physical.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her signature red cloak covered most of it from view. Weiss\u2019s shoes had also changed to Ruby\u2019s black combat boots. Weiss didn\u2019t seem to notice anything and turned the corner as Ruby stared in disbelief, her mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>IT WORKS!</i> Ruby squealed internally and jumped into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she landed, she remembered she had Weiss\u2019s outfit It consisted of wedged heeled boots, which were much higher in the back than the front. She was not used to heels of any kind. Ruby learned the hard way to be careful and struggled to her feet, rubbing her aching bottom. How anyone could stand to wear lady stilts was beyond her. At least these boots had a little more support than normal high heels. Ruby noticed her legs and chest felt colder. Weiss didn\u2019t wear tall stockings and her dress wasn\u2019t closed at the top. There was only a little bit of black cloth covering the valley between her breasts. The fact the clothes fit her was not lost on Ruby. Ruby and Weiss were similar size, but they did have different proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling into her room, Ruby was glad no one else was there. The shoes were making it difficult to walk. It was like walking on her tiptoes and the center of balance was off. Standing before the full length mirror, Ruby finally had the chance to examine herself. She looked exactly the same physically. The only difference was the clothes on her belonged to Weiss.  Ruby pulled off the bolero and spun around to admire the strapless dress. The dress started as white at the top and slowly changed to blue as her eyes lowered. The hem was stitched to resemble snowflakes. Her hand played with the silver necklace around her neck as she stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Ruby gasped. \u201cThis is so cool! The remote is magic. It has to be. What should I do with it? Should I swap more? Show it to someone?\u201d She tapped her cheek. \u201cI could try on all of Weiss\u2019s clothes. Maybe I should try to figure out why she likes heels so much? She\u2019ll probably be with Goodwitch for forever.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, they\u2019re my clothes now,\u201d Ruby half sang, kicking off the boots and bounding to the closest. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through Weiss\u2019s clothes was much less enjoyable than she thought it would be. So many of her clothes looked the same in varying shades of blue and white. It was mostly dresses, but there were a few long sleeve tops to go with her combat skirts. Ruby was glad her partner understood the importance of those, unlike Yang. She pushed aside a few nightgowns and skimmed through the underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does Weiss really not get anything in any other color? </i>Ruby thought and then shrugged. She wasn\u2019t that different. Most of Ruby\u2019s clothes were red and black, though she did have some other colors. Her pajama bottoms were white with roses on them. Giving up on trying to find some special hidden outfit Weiss was hiding from her, she turned toward the shoes. <i>Why does she need so many? Nearly all of them have heals.</i> There was a pair of slippers that, to her relief, lacked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby glanced over her shoulder anxiously. The remote changed reality to make all the shoes hers, but that didn\u2019t change the fact if she had been caught doing what she was going to do normally, Weiss would not have been happy. Like, less happier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks at me,\u201d Ruby mocked though not with any ill intent. \u201cI like wearing\u2026woah\u2026 lady stilts to feel taller and look down at people.\u201d She stumbled and nearly fell over. The shoes she was wearing was one of Weiss\u2019s fancy high heels. With almost no support except a thin stick in the back, Ruby nearly fell over every third step. \u201cHow does she walk in these, let alone fight?\u201d She closed her eyes and then frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she stopped moving like she normally did, her body seemed to know what to do. Her next step was perfectly aligned to avoid any chance of slipping. So was the next one, and the next one. Ruby opened her eyes and focused on the feeling. Her body was acting like she had been wearing heels her entire life. The remote had done more than just swap clothes. It swapped the ability to wear clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that\u2019s what Ruby believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped when she heard someone unlocked the door and bolted toward her desk, kicking the heels far in the corner to hide them. This was pointless on her part, as everyone considered them her shoes, but in her defense, she just swapped. Her panic overshowed logic. Ruby just managed to sit at her desk, grab a book and rip it open, before Weiss walked into the room. She turned around to act like she had been studying to find Weiss staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Weiss stated, looking surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to actually be studying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d Ruby asked innocently, as Weiss walked toward her. Besides Ruby\u2019s clothes, she was exactly the same. The way she moved her hips when she walked, the air of importance, everything. Her clothes just had more color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo walk in on you playing a game of some kind,\u201d Weiss answered and leaned over Ruby\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOr maybe have your book open to the wrong chapter? One we haven\u2019t covered yet?\u201d Ruby blinked and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer book was four chapters ahead of where they were in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just\u2026 reading ahead?\u201d Ruby lied lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, Ruby Rose, who can barely sit reading a text book longer than Nora or Arc, was reading ahead.\u201d Weiss stared at Ruby with her arms crossed. Seconds ticked by in silence and Ruby diverted her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Weiss sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. When she next spoke, her words were a little softer and understanding. \u201cListen, Ruby. Even if you weren\u2019t the team leader, education is important. You need to study to get ahead, even as a hunter. Doctor Oobleck explained that to us countless times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t like it and everything else just seems funner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore fun,\u201d Weiss corrected her sternly. \u201cOf course it is. You think there wouldn\u2019t be things I would like to do over studying? But I don\u2019t because as an adult, you have to distinguish between your wants and needs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to have fun?\u201d Ruby gasped and Weiss narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny, almost as good as Yang\u2019s jokes.\u201d Ruby looked like she had just been slap. Saying she wasn\u2019t even as funny as her unfunny sister was below the belt. \u201cHow about this? If you can study until we meet up with Yang and Blake for dinner, afterwards, I\u2019ll spar a bit with you and we can try out those new electric dust rounds you got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Ruby pointed at her dramatically. \u201cNo take backs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t. If you hold up your end of the bargain.\u201d Weiss sat down at her desk and picked up her Scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019ll show you,</i> Ruby thought triumphantly and turned her book to the correct chapter. It only took five minutes for Ruby to groan at how boring this was. She was ready to give up, but caught Weiss\u2019s watching her with a mix of smugness and superiority. <i>I can do this! I have to show her I can.</i> Another few minutes passed and Ruby\u2019s mind began to wander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder it fell on the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Another swap won\u2019t hurt,</i> Ruby thought, her hand clenched tightly on the device. <i>A Body Swap might be fun and technically I returned the clothes to the right bodies. </i>She giggled under her breath. <i>Oooo, what about a Life Swap? I could live as Weiss while she tries to study as me. Maybe figure out all her secrets or why she\u2019s so grumpy. Personal Info might also be cool. If I switch our intelligence, I won\u2019t have to study as much. She can be the \u2018dunce.\u2019<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nWhat does she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruby hit the button on the remote and experienced the world warp around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she realized was that she was sitting at Weiss\u2019s desk instead of her own. It took a moment to realign her senses when instantly moving from one spot to another. Her speed Semblance was similar from someone else\u2019s view, but it was fundamentally different from her side. Weiss\u2019s scroll was in her hand and she had been looking up some information on a line of clothes from some specific designer. Ruby\u2019s eyes traveled downwards and saw she was wearing her clothes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh? I hit Life Swap, why am I wearing my clothes\u2026 Oh, right. I switched our clothes beforehand.</i> Life Swap was supposed to put her in the target\u2019s life. She only kept her body and the clothes would switch. However, their clothes were swapped beforehand, so Ruby was now living as Weiss, without having her clothes. Something felt off about her head. One side was heavier than the other. Ruby looked into a mirror curiously and her mouth fell open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite hair tied in a ponytail on one side adorned her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Our hair switched too?! </i>Ruby thought in shock, immediately glancing over at Weiss. The remote never mentioned that. Maybe it was some kind of indicator lives had been swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was sitting at Ruby\u2019s desk, hand propping up her head, as she gazed at the book in front of her with a glazed look in her eyes. Everything except her hair was physically the same. Short black hair with red tips, Ruby\u2019s hair, sat atop her head. The biggest difference Ruby observed was Weiss\u2019s posture and mannerisms. Normally prim and proper, Weiss didn\u2019t slouch when studying. She sat up straight and read the material methodically while taking notes. Now, she looked exactly like Ruby did when studying, bored, uninterested, and wanting it to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby couldn\u2019t believe it. Clothes were one thing, that could be explained through teleportation and Weiss pretending not to notice. Lives were another. There had to be a way to test out if Weiss really believed she was her. Ruby had to act like Weiss and talk to her. As she thought about what Weiss would consider important enough to interrupt Ruby studying, she felt something, like a faded memory swimming to the surface. Wanting to understand what this was, Ruby relaxed and let the thoughts flow to the forefront of her mind. Her mouth opened and words she didn\u2019t consciously consider came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cHow is the studying going? Do you understand the material?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 coming,\u201d Weiss replied, looking up and then collapsing in her chair. \u201cThis is so boring. At least some of the previous chapters contain awesome battle scenes and history of weapons. Why should I care about economic and political struggles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause those shape our very government,\u201d Ruby answered, not sure how she knew. Her brain just did and instinct was telling her what to say. It quickly sunk in that the remote was helping her act like Weiss to fool others. \u201cHunters and Huntresses need to understand the big picture, not just what Grimm needs killed at one location.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never want to meet a politician,\u201d Weiss muttered and slammed her head on the desk. \u201cSounds like the boringist job in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be surprised,\u201d Ruby muttered and memories flickered in her mind like from an old television. They were images of a white haired man talking to people in suits while she stood by his side. Ruby had definitely never done that. <i>I have her memories too? Life Swaps are so thorough. I wonder what else I could do.</i> Wanting the full experience while she could, Ruby clicked the Wardrobe Swap button again. One flash of green light later, she was back to wearing Weiss\u2019s white dress. Now when Ruby looked into the mirror, she saw herself with Weiss\u2019s hair and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What to do next?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe that was the energy Weiss and Yang always said Ruby had. She zipped over to the door and opened it. \u201cHi, Jaune and\u2026 Blake?\u201d Ruby had a brief glimpse of the way Weiss looked at Jaune. Normally, she put up with him unless he tried to flirt with her. This time her expression was of someone greeting a best friend. Which made sense, as Jaune was Ruby\u2019s best guy friend and Weiss believed she was Ruby. Weiss stepped back and allowed Blake to pass through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might want to stand back,\u201d Blake advised Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Weiss looked confused and then turned to Jaune. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ruby,\u201d Jaune greeted her. \u201cThink I could talk to Weiss real fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh.\u201d Weiss turned around and looked at Ruby. \u201cShe\u2019s free, but\u2026\u201d The hesitancy was not hidden in her voice. Ruby knew why that was the case. She knew what Jaune wanted to do and it hadn\u2019t worked in the past, but she also didn\u2019t want to get between them. This was something between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Ruby huffed and stood up. This is where things got confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was trying to figure out how to act. Weiss\u2019s attitude toward Jaune would be of indifference and slight scorning, due to his lack of academic achievement and combat prowess. However, Ruby was the exact opposite. She liked Jaune, not the way Yang suggested of course, but as a close friend. She really didn\u2019t want to treat him badly. As she made her way toward the door, her mind was fighting against Weiss\u2019s life instincts. Ruby found out she could suppress the desire which she did, though she was a little worried people might think Weiss was acting weird if she diverged too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want, Arc?\u201d Ruby asked. That response was a good compromise. Weiss would have added something along the lines of; \u2018It\u2019s never going to happen,\u2019 or \u2018If you ask me out again, I\u2019m going to freeze you.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if you free tomorrow,\u201d Jaune asked hopefully. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice little caf\u00e9 that just opened up and then maybe we could see a movie tomorrow.\u201d A pure white rose was clutched in his outstretched hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019s life was screaming at her to say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby could not deny that was the appropriate response. Every fiber in her being knew that, including the fact she had seen Weiss deny him dates multiple times. Ruby had felt bad for him, but for some reason, she was kind of glad Weiss didn\u2019t agree. The reason why was unknown to her. Her hand fiddled with the remote hidden in her sleeve, as she stared at Jaune\u2019s hopeful puppy dog like expression. Out of the corner of her eye, Ruby noticed Blake sitting down on her bed with a roll of her eyes. Weiss on the other hand kept looking anxiously between her and Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby had a couple choices. She could tell Jaune no and keep up appearances. This would be the obvious choice. However, thinking of telling Jaune that made her feel queasy. The other option was to say yes. Jaune was a nice guy and Weiss should at least give him a chance. The problem was Ruby didn\u2019t know what would happen after saying yes and then giving Weiss back her life. Would she know what happened or would it get swept under the rug and Jaune would only find more disappointment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a third option available to her. She could swap with one of the three others there and not have to make the tough decision herself. The thing was it would be a little cowardly on her part.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Make it count.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was painfully aware of everyone staring at her and it took a lot of effort not to let her nervousness show. Weiss\u2019s mouth fell open and Blake actually set her book down. Neither of their expressions could match Jaune\u2019s though. It looked like he had been smacked upside the head from the shock. After Ruby\u2019s words finally sunk in, a huge grin formed on his face. Any guilt Ruby felt dissolved with his smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t regret this,\u201d Jaune promised. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the best day ever. Thanks for giving me this chance, Weiss. I got to go and get everything planned. Pick you up tomorrow at 11:30?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Ruby repeated. \u201cYou get once chance.\u201d She closed the door before Jaune could respond. Before she could get back to Weiss\u2019s desk, Weiss bolted over to her with a combination of excitement and shock on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Weiss!\u201d Weiss exclaimed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you finally said yes. Why though? You\u2019ve never saw how awesome Jaune was before.\u201d Ruby had to suppress her laughter at seeing Weiss talk so excitedly about Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to know too,\u201d Blake added from the bed, sitting up. \u201cYou complain about him constantly and rarely say anything nice about him. What made you decide to actually say yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t planning to hurt him, right?\u201d Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought about it\u2026,\u201d Ruby started to say and looked between the other two. She couldn\u2019t think of a good reason except saying Jaune\u2019s a good guy. Weiss\u2019s instincts had told her this was a bad idea and seemed to be trying to work out what happened since Ruby went directly against them.<i> I can\u2019t think of a reason. Is Blake going to get suspicious? I should just let Weiss handle this. She\u2019s smarter than I am. </i>Ruby reached into her hidden pocket and clicked the Life Swap button while aiming at Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne flash of green light later and Ruby found herself standing in front of Weiss, who was looking exasperated. Their clothes and hair styles were also back on the right bodies due to the swap. She hid the remote as Weiss continued where Ruby had left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and no matter how many times I say no, he keeps asking. It\u2019s getting tedious.\u201d Weiss rubbed the bridge of her nose. \u201cI\u2019ll bite the bullet and give him a single date. After that, I\u2019ll try to explain it again that we don\u2019t have anything in common and it won\u2019t work out. He might be more bearable if he\u2019s not trying to ask me out all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune\u2019s a nice guy and a good friend,\u201d Ruby told her. \u201cMaybe you guys can actually find common ground or some similar interests?\u201d<i> I swapped back and Weiss immediately knew what to do to act like herself yet continue what I did in her life. So if I was in her life longer, would I see more changes once I swapped back? Weiss is my best friend, but no one would disagree she could open up more.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cI seriously doubt that,\u201d Weiss replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Blake mused. \u201cI can understand that.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou do realize Yang\u2019s going to have a field day with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a factor in my decision too,\u201d Weiss admitted, as she sat down. \u201cHer attention span is lacking and, after a day or two, she will find someone else to bother about something pointless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Blake went back to her book, paused, and then looked up. \u201cRuby has a point. Don\u2019t be too hard on him. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s trying to get close to your family. He really likes you\u2026 for some reason.\u201d She muttered the last part softly so the others couldn\u2019t here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I put up with him because of that,\u201d Weiss huffed. \u201cBut he needs to know his actions are annoying to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to go into a date with an open mind,\u201d Ruby pointed out, trying to help her friends. Even if they weren\u2019t going to go out, they might be able to be friends. She wanted to hang out with both of them together, rather than separate all the time. \u201cIsn\u2019t the point of dating to get to know each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Blake answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Weiss groaned. \u201cMaybe this was a bad idea after all and I should have told him to get lost.\u201d Blake shrugged. Ruby took the opportunity to grab her text book and climb up her bed. She wasn\u2019t planning to study. It was just a cover. She wanted to think about the remote and what she\u2019s learned so far.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nI have to be careful,</i> Ruby thought to herself. <i>The Life Swap function could have a lot of serious consequences.</i> She hit the Reset button to undo all the swaps she had done so far, even if it was pointless. She had swapped everything back manually, but she just wanted a blank slate. <i>Then again, everything seemed to work out naturally. Weiss will probably come back tomorrow, gripe about Jaune, and then go back to being\u2026 well Weiss. Jaune will need someone to cheer him up after that.</i> Ruby felt slightly warm, though quickly dismissed it as excitement about the remote in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wardrobe Swap had changed nothing except from Ruby\u2019s perspective. With the Reset and Undo buttons, these kinds of swaps weren\u2019t permanent and would cause no long lasting damages. Ruby couldn\u2019t contain her eagerness in testing out the other swap functions to see how they changed the world around her. Of course, she and the others were supposed to meet up with Yang soon for dinner. There was also the option of swapping back with Weiss and seeing if maybe she could tweak her slightly to be a little friendlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruby had time to spare and the remote\u2019s power was far too tempting to ignore. With Blake\u2019s arrival, she had an entirely new target. Peeking over her book to make sure Blake and Weiss were preoccupied, Ruby aimed the remote. Her finger hovered between the Body Swap and Personal Information button. Both were easy to test without the risk of Personality. While the Life Swap instincts could be suppressed, she didn\u2019t know if a new personality could. Her finger finally fell on the Body Swap button and there was a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby blinked and looked down at her body. There were only a few noticeable differences. The first, she was taller. Even laying down, her body took up much more space than she had before. The second, and perhaps the biggest difference, was everything suddenly got louder. Ruby\u2019s hearing improved exponentially. A shaking hand rose to her head and she felt a soft sensation of a cat ear. Her eyes darted over to Blake. Ruby experienced the weird sensation of seeing herself wearing the Beacon uniform, a black suit with a red skirt, reading a book. Blake\u2019s black bow was tied up on her head. Normally, the bow covered her ears. This time, there couldn\u2019t be anything under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep!\u201d Ruby squeaked and dove off her bed to flee into the bathroom. Both Weiss and Blake looked at her for a moment and then each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Weiss asked. Blake shrugged and they went back to what they were doing. Ruby could get excited over so many things. It was just part of living with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom, Ruby was studying her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake\u2019s amber eyes stared back at her. Ruby shivered in excitement and examined her new face closely. Her head felt heavy because Blake had significantly more hair than she did. Not as much as Yang though. Ruby liked short hair. It didn\u2019t get in the way when she was fighting.  She brushed a strange of black hair out of her face and then her eyes traveled upwards. Two black cat ears sat proudly on her head. They blended in seamlessly with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026so cuuuute!\u201d Ruby squealed. They were so soft and smooth, like velvet. Blake never offered Ruby the opportunity to touch her ears. She rubbed them for another minute and a strange sound escaped her throat. \u201cDid\u2026did I just purr?\u201d She blinked when her brain processed the voice she was speaking with. \u201cThis is Blake\u2019s voice. The body swap switched it with mine. I guess that makes sense. Vocal chords are part of the body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby twirled around and admired her body. Her clothes were still the same as she only swapped bodies. They had changed to accommodate her new body size though. Her dress was a little longer because of her height and the chest area had increased slightly. Ruby wasn\u2019t small by any means and she was still growing while drinking plenty of milk. Blake was just older. Thus had longer for her body to develop. Her chest wasn\u2019t nearly as impressive as Yang\u2019s, but it was nothing to sneeze at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss would be soooo jealous.\u201d Ruby laughed. Her cat ears rose up and Ruby tilted her head. As a test, she thought of something sad, like when they ran out of cookies and saw her new ears drop. \u201cSooooo cute!\u201d She repeated. \u201cEven though I understand why Blake wants to hide being a Faunus\u2026 is she still a Faunus?\u201d Ruby checked her school ID and saw she was still listed as human. \u201cSo that didn\u2019t get changed. Body Swap is really just that, a swap of bodies.\u201d Feeling up her ears one last time before leaving, Ruby exited the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Ruby replied happily. She could feel her ears reacting to her excitement. \u201cHow\u2019s your day been, Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame old,\u201d Blake replied. \u201cClasses are done and I can relax.\u201d When Blake looked at Ruby, there was no indication she saw anything unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to study?\u201d Ruby asked and the corner of Blake\u2019s lips twitched upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake\u2019s grades are near the top,\u201d Weiss stated firmly. \u201cHer study habits are fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not worthy of your praise,\u201d Blake muttered sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh, I\u2019m trying to raise my grades.\u201d Ruby huffed and crossed her arms. If she had been staring in a mirror, she probably would have laughed seeing Blake make that expression. \u201cIs it time to meet up with Yang yet?\u201d Weiss glanced at her scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cWe will be a little early, but that\u2019s preferable. Yang would probably eat without us if she finished early.\u201d Weiss paused and scratched behind Zwei\u2019s ear. Zwei was Ruby\u2019s corgi she was hiding in their room. He was currently sleeping halfway under her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe would,\u201d Ruby agreed and then turned to Blake. \u201cComing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Blake agreed and set down her book. Past experience told her if Yang was still upset losing to Pyrrha, her book would end up covered in food. The door closed behind them with a bang and Ruby fiddled with the remote in her pocket. The urge to continue to use it was strong.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruby, Blake, and Weiss left together and Ruby managed to control the urge to start swapping things. Seriously, it was difficult and she wanted to try it out. It was only because of hunger and knowing she had team responsibilities that she put off using it. The three of them grabbed their food and sat down. Yang joined them a few moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up!?\u201d Yang asked, plopping down next to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dYou will never believe this,\u201d Blake told her and Weiss\u2019s cheeks gained a slight shade of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Her expression wasn\u2019t lost on Yang. \u201cWhat did the Ice Queen do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing important,\u201d Weiss huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might as well tell her,\u201d Ruby suggested. \u201cYang will keep bothering you until you do. Trust me, she never grows tired of pestering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, I taught my baby sis so well,\u201d Yang teased. \u201cI still remember that one time you accidently wet the bed and tried to hide the evidence by throwing the sheets out the window.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYANG!\u201d Ruby cried out mortified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t resist, sis.\u201d Yang laughed and turned to Blake. \u201cSo what\u2019s the big news?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let\u2019s see how you like being the younger sister,</i> Ruby thought vindictively. She wasn\u2019t usually a person who sought out revenge. This time was special. The remote gave her a perfect opportunity. Her finger fell on the Personal Info Swap option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune came over today,\u201d Blake explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh.\u201d Yang paused and looked at Weiss. \u201cYou didn\u2019t make him cry, did you?\u201d There was a flash of green light no one noticed except for Ruby. Yang\u2019s hair became noticeably shorter, she lost a couple inches in height, and her chest shrunk slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had become fifteen years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Weiss replied indignantly. \u201cI was nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour version of nice usually involves them not being frozen solid,\u201d Yang shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t frozen,\u201d Blake informed her. \u201cBut he might have been crying tears of joy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Yang was visible confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ruby was trying very hard to hold in her laughter. Revenge was served when Ruby swapped their ages. To everyone else, Yang was fifteen and Ruby was seventeen. Yang\u2019s current appearance was exactly like Ruby remembered two years ago. Her clothes stayed the same but shrunk slightly to accommodate her new figure.  Ruby, on the other hand, grew taller, her chest expanded, and her hair style changed. It grew slightly longer, but still remained short, like she preferred. Her clothes also adjusted to fit her new frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can\u2019t wait for everyone to treat me like an equal. I\u2019m so tired of people seeing me as a kid.</i> Ruby could barely contain her excitement until her thoughts were interrupted by Yang\u2019s cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said yes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep it down,\u201d Weiss hissed angrily. \u201cI only said it so that he would realize we are incompatible and leave me alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself,\u201d Yang whispered excitedly. \u201cPyrrha likes him, so there has to be something special about Vomit Boy. Try to find it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so interested?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably because Ruby doesn\u2019t let Yang date,\u201d Weiss mocked and Ruby flinched in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on dates,\u201d Yang retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because dad was watching you,\u201d Ruby answered and her mind suddenly saw in image in her head of herself and her dad spying on Yang\u2019s first date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you were spying!\u201d Yang accused. \u201cI told you I was old enough to make my own decisions. I even got into Beacon two years early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement confirmed Ruby\u2019s suspicion that this world had changed. Images and information kept flashing through her mind, causing some confusion. A lot of stuff was different. Ruby had taken care of Yang instead of the other way around. She actually managed to have a couple dates without Yang causing the boys to flee. The biggest difference was how they got into Beacon. Ruby had taken the normal route and applied, while Yang was the one to stop Roman Torchwick. Both of their personalities were still pretty much the same. Yang was a party girl and Ruby was more reserved and awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the right of an older sister,\u201d Ruby retorted, causing Weiss and Blake to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be fair, anyone would have with the magical remote being in their possession. The swaps were fun and all, but Ruby still had a dream of being a hero and defeating the Grimm. That meant she still needed to practice. She also loved weapons and no swap could change that. Probably. She still hadn\u2019t tried to personality swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d Ruby agreed immediately. \u201cI got these new electric Dust rounds I want to try and could use your insight into how to make the best use out of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you understand my skills,\u201d Weiss replied. \u201cI would be happy to help.\u201d Yang made a gagging motion out of her sight with a finger. Ruby had to try very hard not to laugh. Ruby waved goodbye to her \u2018younger\u2019 sister and Blake, as she and Weiss left. They grabbed their weapons and ammo from their lockers before finding an unused training room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck this out,\u201d Ruby bragged and fired a few rounds from Crescent Rose, which was currently in its sniper mode. The training drones she was aiming at were hit with perfect accuracy and stumbled as sparks of electricity coursed through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElectrical Dust does tend to stun machines,\u201d Weiss agreed. \u201cIf you were facing a mech suit, like that time with Torchwick, I could see this being useful. Against Grimm, you might be able to slow them down or paralyze n appendage. For raw damage, your normal rounds would be better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Ruby agreed. \u201cWasn\u2019t sure if I should try some higher caliber bullets, or maybe purer crystals for a bigger impact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth would increase the stun effect,\u201d Weiss admitted, thinking. \u201cHigher caliber would allow you to break through armor or material with low conductivity.\u201d She watched Ruby fire a few more rounds and then checked the damage to the training droids themselves. \u201cYour current rounds are already overloading the circuits. Huh, I\u2019m actually surprised at how much damage they do. We might need to try these on actual Grimm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink we can try sometime this weekend?\u2019 Ruby asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Weiss relented. \u201cI wanted to test using Gravity Dust with my glyphs in a more offensive manner anyways. The Emerald Forest would be a good place to try it out against Grimm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d Ruby declared and then immediately covered her mouth. \u201cOops, sorry. I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Weiss assured her. \u201cThat dunce is probably going to mess everything up somehow and I\u2019ll be back before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Jaune is going to show you a great time,\u201d Ruby protested. \u201cPlease, Weiss. Give him a chance.\u201d Weiss rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt it, but I told you before. I\u2019m giving him this <i>one </i>chance.\u201d She turned to leave. \u201cI lost the motivation to do any training tonight. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ruby frowned and fidgeted with the remote in her pocket.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling down about what happened, Ruby packed her weapon and ammo back into her locker. She wasn\u2019t sure what she should be doing. Training lost its luster at the thought of what would happen between her two best friends. It was kind of her fault. Okay, entirely her fault. She swapped with Weiss and said yes to Jaune. Admitting that, she knew what she had to do. Disappearing in a flash of rose petals, Ruby bolted toward Jaune\u2019s dorm. Seconds later she found herself knocking at his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ruby,\u201d Jaune greeted when he opened the door. \u201cCome on in. What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026err\u2026 wanted to check up on you,\u201d Ruby explained. She looked around. \u201cHuh, I kind of expected balloons and streamers.\u201d Jaune laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever thought I would get this far,\u201d Jaune admitted nervously. \u201cI was about ready to give up. Figured I should try one more time.\u201d Guilt welled up in Ruby. It was because of her that Jaune hadn\u2019t given up on Weiss. \u201cWhen I told Pyrrha, she seemed happy for me, but had to leave right after.\u201d Ruby\u2019s flinch went unnoticed. It was probably a good thing Jaune was so oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d Ruby asked, sitting on the edge of his bed, noticing Jaune had been playing a video game. She picked up the remote and held it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of?\u201d Jaune said, picking up the second controller and sitting down beside her. \u201cThere\u2019s a new caf\u00e9 I knew my sisters would love, so I figured Weiss might like it. Then maybe go to a movie afterwards and see where it goes from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might want to plan a little more detail,\u201d Ruby suggested, her eyes on the screen. \u201cShe\u2019s a real stickler to details.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Jaune hummed as he focused on the game. \u201cI might have to ask my sisters for ideas then. Unless you have any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy idea of a fun time is probably the opposite of Weiss\u2019s,\u201d Ruby pointed out and they laughed. \u201cLike playing this game. Yang and I love doing this with our dad and uncle. Weiss? She would rather study or go to some fancy party where they just stand around and talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile Blake would want to visit a library and Nora would see if there was a way we could find a sloth,\u201d Jaune finished. Ruby laughed loudly and punched him in the shoulder. They focused on the game for a good ten minutes when he spoke up again. \u201cThink I have a chance with Weiss? Be honest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d Ruby hesitated. A lot of conflicting emotions ran through her. Part of her knew they were too different. Weiss was someone who preferred order in her life and wanted high class living arrangements. Jaune was much more down to earth and laid back. Funny, charming sometimes, and didn\u2019t judge people from their first meeting. He had talked to Ruby when she first arrived at Beacon, even after causing a scene. They hung out all the time, had similar interests, and he thought Crescent Rose was amazing. She would be a much better partner for Jaune than Weiss would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze when that thought occurred to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d Jaune confirmed. \u201cI want to know. I\u2019m still going to try, but I could really use your opinion. Pyrrha and Nora would try to spare my feelings while Ren would say something philosophical that could mean multiple things to avoid answering.\u201d Ruby bit the corner of her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby had always liked Jaune ever since they met. These feelings she was experiencing weren\u2019t new. They just seemed to be more intense than usual. As she thought about what to answer, memories flashed through her mind about experiences she knew never occurred. There were scenes from a couple dates she had been on. With Yang now being younger than her, Ruby was free to date who she wanted. From what she saw, none of them were successful in the long term, but they weren\u2019t bad. There was just something else she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething Jaune had\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization hit her like a truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m older and looking for a boy to date\u2026 I fell for Jaune. Yang wasn\u2019t there to hold me back. </i>Her hormones and emotions were guiding her. She really wanted to grab Jaune\u2019s hand and hold it. To get him to understand what she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat bad?\u201d Jaune asked, taking her silence as the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Ruby cried out suddenly. \u201cI mean\u2026 I think you two are really different, but I can\u2019t say you would work or not. Stranger things have happened. At the very least, if things don\u2019t work out, I think you two could still be friends. Weiss promised me she would give you a chance and try to approach this date with an open mind. You should do the same. Focus on trying your best and accept the outcome, whatever it may be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt killed her to say this. Pyrrha\u2019s lack of confessing her feelings suddenly became clear to Ruby. How do you tell a close friend they should ignore the person they like for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Ruby,\u201d Jaune said. She could feel and hear the gratefulness and honesty in his voice. His smile nearly caused her to melt on the spot. \u201cI\u2019m really glad I met you.\u201d He threw his arm around her shoulder and gave her a hug. Ruby\u2019s face flushed. The warmth of his body felt perfect against her and she missed jumping over an obstacle in the game, dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cinder was a lot taller than she was. The remote however put Ruby in Cinder\u2019s life, and while others saw her as Cinder, Ruby still saw herself, just wearing her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was, Ruby knew Yang would tease Emerald if she was in her position. However, Ruby wasn\u2019t into girls and neither apparently was Cinder. Cinder\u2019s life tended to get pleasure in bullying, much like Yang.

It took a lot of self-restraint not to confess to Jaune immediately. She always liked him, but now he was just\u2026. Something more. Pyrrha liked him too, so if their date goes wrong, there was a chance to swoop in. The thought upset her stomach and she felt horrible thinking about that. To make up for it, Ruby tried to help Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhite and blue are Weiss\u2019s favorite colors,\u201d Ruby continued. \u201cSo those should work. Don\u2019t get a big bouquet. It\u2019s just a first date, but maybe just a couple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Jaune agreed, writing this down. \u201cI was thinking of getting lunch at a nice caf\u00e9 then a movie and see where that goes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss likes romance movies,\u201d Ruby recalled. \u201cThough not cheesy comedy ones.\u201d Jaune nodded. \u201cCaf\u00e9\u2019s a good choice too and I bet she expects you to dress up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot sure I own a suit,\u201d Jaune muttered, looking at the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a nice button down shirt then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have those.\u201d Jaune nodded. \u201cShould I plan for anything else after the movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s up to Weiss,\u201d Ruby replied. \u201cAsk her if she would like to do something and if she doesn\u2019t suggest anything, have a backup plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it. I assume if she\u2019s willing to go out for dinner, the dates going well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably. I would be worried if she throws food in your face.\u201d They both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby\u2026\u201d Jaune suddenly grew serious. \u201cThanks. I mean it. For everything. I know you don\u2019t think we will get together, but you are still willing to help. It means a lot to me and I\u2019m glad I found you in that crater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Ruby cried and pushed him lightly. \u201cThat was an accident, Vomit Boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad it happened since we met.\u201d Jaune hugged her. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend and again, thank you for everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It was n-no problem.\u201d Ruby stammered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have to go. Need to\u2026 turn in al library book. Yeah! Overdue! I\u2019ll see you tomorrow!\u201d Jaune looked a little confused as she rushed out, but simply shrugged and went back to planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t believe I almost kissed him there. Ruby thought in shock. During that hug, the temptation surprised her. He needs to finish with Weiss, plus Pyrrha likes him, so you have your work cut out for you. Distract yourself with something. Anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes traveled to the remote in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting dark, but plenty of people were still active at Beacon. She had only tried out a couple functions of the remote. Wardrobe Swap, Life Swaps, and a Personal Info Age Swap. There was so many options left to keep her mind off of Jaune. Body Swap was one good option. She could be someone else and everyone would think she always looked like that. Personality Swap was a little scary, but tempting. She wouldn\u2019t believe she was her target, but would act like them and people would assume that was normal too. Lastly, the Personal Info swaps were numerous and had some weird affects she could experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to decide.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though her body wasn\u2019t technically living tissue, Ruby considered her alive. Penny had feelings, loved to learn, and wanted to make friends. If you got past her strange way of talking and a lack of understanding personal space, she was actually pretty cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote instructions did say the  remote didn\u2019t work on nonliving things, so this would be a test on multiple levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect</i>, Ruby thought, aiming the remote and pressing the button. There was a flash of green light and Ruby saw herself in the distance wearing Penny\u2019s clothes. Ruby reached up and felt her hair, which seemed to be a little more abundant and saw a strand of orange. <i>Cool! I have to check myself out in a mirror.

Luckily, Penny hadn\u2019t gone far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny!\u201d Ruby called out. She got to witness herself turning around to see who called out to her and then beaming when she saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSalutations, Friend Ruby!\u201d Penny called back and the two of them ran forward into a hug. \u201cOoo, you\u2019re as strong as ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoops.\u201d Ruby blushed. \u201cSometimes I forget my own strength. How have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve have been doing well. What about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 been better.\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cMostly looking for a distraction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of trouble?\u201d Penny asked worriedly. \u201cNot White Fang or runaway friends, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Ruby shook her head quickly. \u201cBoy trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoys?!\u201d Penny\u2019s silver eyes lit up. \u201cWe should totally talk about boys sometime.\u201d Her expression grew solemn and her voice lowered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t tonight though. I have to go for my regularly schedule testing for my organic components. They have to make sure my DNA is stable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo is Penny a clone or something in this reality? Ruby thought to herself. Then what does it make me with a metal body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you be free this weekend?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSunday,\u201d Penny said. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to prepare for the Vytal Festival on Saturday, but I promise to meet up with you the following day. I really would like to spend time with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d Ruby replied, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow wonderful!\u201d Penny said, slapping her hands together. \u201cI have never been on a date. I\u2019m supposed to worry about what to wear, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on!\u201d Ruby had to stop her before this got out of hand. \u201cDate is just a saying here. It\u2019s just us hanging out as friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat still sounds sensational.\u201d Penny told her. \u201cI will do everything I can to ensure my schedule is free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look forward to it too.\u201d Ruby waved goodbye as Penny left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby debated what to do while Penny walked away down the hall. Penny had her body and clothes, while Ruby had hers. Everyone else would still consider this normal, so it wasn\u2019t like anything bad would come from it. One Undo would swap her back, regardless where they were. What Ruby was considering was swapping something else with Penny. Like names or weapons. While Ruby loved her baby, Crescent Rose, she debated if it was worth trying out Penny\u2019s cool multi swords. There were other options, but she had to decide fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she didn\u2019t have to swap anything more. Penny\u2019s interaction already showed Ruby was super strong and it might be fun to go to a training room and see how fighting changed now that she was an android.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m combat ready.\u201d Ruby muttered and then giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, maybe she should look for a new target to swap something with. The school was a big place.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Armed with the knowledge of how to use them she went to the practice area to try them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mimicked what she seen Penny do with these multiple times to find to her delight they hit the target dummies with relative ease.

Blake wielded Gambol Shroud, a sword with a sheath, that could also be used as a one handed weapon for duel wielding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold back,\u201d Ruby said to Blake, giving Crescent Rose a practice swing. It felt so light to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could even if I wanted.\u201d Blake replied with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe preset bell rang and they began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby started off with a few long range shots from Crescent Rose in gun form. Blake was a melee opponent and liked to get in close. Blake dodged the random bullets and ran swiftly around the ring, forcing Ruby to keep turning. It was throwing off her aim. Finally, Blake must have seen a flaw in Ruby\u2019s defense and charged straight at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot you!\u201d Ruby fired a bullet directly at Blake, who smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullet hit Blake square on and her body flickered before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, a clone!\u201d Ruby tried to figure out where the real Blake was, only to get hit in the back by Blake\u2019s sheath. There was a loud bang and Ruby fell forward. \u201cHuh,\u201d she realized. \u201cThat didn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still took Aura damage,\u201d Blake stated, pointing to the screen. Ruby doubled checked and saw she was right. While her body didn\u2019t hurt, Aura was still absorbing the impact and Ruby did not have a lot of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I need to get serious too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrescent Rose mechoshfited into its scythe form and Ruby vanished in a flutter of roses. She didn\u2019t really disappear, it was just her Semblance. Ruby could move at speeds even Faunus eyes couldn\u2019t follow. Blake was only saved by her reaction speed. Ruby appeared behind her and brought her scythe down. Blake responded by crossed her weapons in front of her like a shield. The force of the blow sent her flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI forgot about my strength! Ruby realized too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake landed hard and skidded backwards. Her Aura took a big hit just trying to avoid the shockwaves. Her sheath transformed into a gun and she started fire bullets at the shocked Ruby, who was too slow to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! That hurts!\u201d Ruby cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoted.\u201d Blake threw the ribbon attached to her weapon around Ruby\u2019s feat and pulled. Her foot slipped and Ruby fell on her back. A second later, Blake landed on top of her with her gun pointed down. \u201cI win?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou win. Nice Job.\u201d Blake smiled, hopped off, and helped her up. \u201cI guess even with super strength, I can\u2019t let my guard down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReason I was trying to avoid a direct confrontation,\u201d Blake admitted. \u201cThat one blow you hit me with? Took 20% of my aura, AFTER I blocked.\u201d She looked Ruby up and down. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides not needing to eat or drink?\u201d Ruby couldn\u2019t resist and even giggled. \u201cI feel sensational.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake raised an eyebrow but decided not to comment at Ruby\u2019s strange wording. The two of them heading back to the locker room to grab some towels and store their weapons. During this time, Ruby eyed Blake, while fidgeting with the remote in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had always been interested in knowing what having animal parts would be like. What if Ruby swapped ears with Blake? She could have a pair of cute cat ears. The question is using a Body Part Swap, would she still be considered a human or a Faunus? What would Blake be considered? So many questions. Ruby also debated swapping Wardrobes with Blake. There was no doubt Blake had some attractive clothes. She wondered what Penny would look like wearing her black and white outfits compared to the boring grey ones she had now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could Life Swap with one of them a bit while Yang fought her substitute.

What made it even funnier was Blake was wearing Penny\u2019s clothes, including the pink ribbon tied in the back of her head. Ruby was confused when she saw Blake with the ginger hair, but then remembered Life Swap swapped positions and for some reason hair. She reached up and felt the long Blake hair on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake\u2019s life found watching the video games boring, so Ruby felt her eyes drifting down to the book. She always wondered what Blake was reading by herself so much. As she started reading, her eyes widened and her cheeks flushed.

Ruby picked up the remote and hit Undo, the find herself over on her bed, rather than at the mirror. Blake looked normal, except for the lack of cat ears under her bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get some food,\u201d Yang said to Blake. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Blake nodded. \u201cWeiss, are you joining us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have some preparations to make first and I\u2019m not that hungry right now,\u201d Weiss admitted and Ruby\u2019s ears twitched as she heard Weiss mutter. \u201cWhy I agreed to this, I will never know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you don\u2019t deserve someone as cool as Jaune then, Ruby thought and immediately felt sick.

She never did find the perfect clothes for Penny\u2019s body. Nora had cute white and pink clothes, Pyrrha tended to have outfits with red in them, and Ren had older style clothes that were usually green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were also heading to the cafeteria, so there could be tons of other targets there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Skirts always got in the way.\u201d They exchanged a hug and Pyrrha went to the cafeteria, Ruby however, froze in the hallway.

Though Ruby did get a good look at Neon wearing the grey feminine overalls and shirt, along with the pink bow. She looked a lot more like what Weiss described Atlas school uniforms as. Ruby really wanted to get a good look at the changes. It too ka few minutes to get used to her skates and she almost fell a couple of times. Once back in her room, which was thankfully empty, she ran to the full length mirror and examined herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically, Ruby looked like Penny. She had the cute freckled face, bright green eyes, and orange curly hair. Now, instead of her boring atlas clothes, she was wearing the kind of outfit Ruby would see in Yang\u2019s magazine. The blue tank top that revealed a good portion of the purple bra still embarrassed her. Ruby wasn\u2019t sure why Neo wore short shorts under her skirt, but it might have been so she could skate faster without worrying. Finally, she had a pair of cute black cat ears on her head. They didn\u2019t match her hair, but they were adorable and Jaune would love them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around, Ruby began to wonder if she could improve herself in other ways to make Jaune like her. She read somewhere that guys liked big boobs. While Penny was a robot, she was designed to look like a girl. Her chest wasn\u2019t that big. Maybe she should find someone to swap with? Yang would have been the obvious choice, but due to her de-aging, her chest shrunk to more realistic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also other possible upgrades she could possible think of as she met other girls. It would be a bit before Jaune got back, so Ruby had time to improve. She made sure Zwei had water and then went out to explore Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did she see?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The issue is Pyrrha might try to sneak in during that time. Ruby would just have to make sure to treat Jaune special, without being overly clingy. They need to hang out together and just refresh to him why they are compatible. Part of her wanted to show him the remote too. It could be a secret they shared, but then he might question her current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune would probably like her how she was and if he found out she used the remote just to attract him, he might not be happy about that. Perhaps she would wait until Jaune returns her feelings, then swap back to normal, then show him the remote. That might be the best choice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But at the end of the day I can only choose one of you.\"  Jaune mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't easy, I really didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings but will you assure me that regardless of who I choose we can all still be close?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"  Ruby swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\"  Pyrrah added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, after careful consideration and mulling over my feelings and how I feel when I'm with each of you I've decided that I want my girlfriend to be.\"  </span></div></div>",

Instantly, Ruby was sitting across from him in his sweatshirt and jeans, while he was wearing her black and red dress. There was a constricting feeling over his chest and he knew that had to be her bra. His manhood was also uncomfortable, as it was stuck in a girl\u2019s panties. However, he tried not to show any discomfort to prevent her from guessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do it?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, didn\u2019t you see the flash?\u201d Ruby shook her head and Jaune wrote that down in his notebook. \u201cJust in case.

Think carefully.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby frowned and looked at him closely. He was still, tall, strong, and blonde. Everything she remembered. His outfit was cool, a nice dark red and black dress for easy movement. Everything was as she remembered. She looked in the mirror at herself in hopes she could tell the difference. Silver eyes stared back and her hair and body seemed the same. She was wearing a comfortable sweatshirt and jeans. No bra of course, as it just felt so constricting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell at all,\u201d she announced. \u201cEverything looks normal and my memories agree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry to guess, anything that looks slightly off.\u201d Jaune pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, bodies again? You think I wouldn\u2019t guess that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. I swapped our clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Ruby gasped. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always had these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it logically,\u201d Jaune pressed. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a dress, bra, and panties.

You don\u2019t have them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBras are constricting and boxers are comfy,\u201d Ruby protested. \u201cBesides, you look cool in that dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d Jaune held out the remote. \u201cI\u2019ll undo the swap so you can see.\u201d Ruby touched the remote and there was a flash of light. \u201cBetter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s face flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought wearing boxers was better than my underwear.\u201d She gasped mortified. \u201cI can now see why no one suspects the changes.

Though, our teams are the top two of the year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive.\u201d Terra complimented. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, so I\u2019ve left the city occasionally to fix relay towers. Always with an escort though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrimm are an enemy we never seem to beat,\u201d Jaune sighed and Ruby pushed his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no pessimism here. This is a fun place.\u201d She held up Adrian. \u201cTell Uncle Jaune not to be sad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian reached out both hands and had big wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s too convincing,\u201d Jaune said with a laugh. The laughter was contagious and everyone there laughed. He bounced the little kid on his knee to his laughter. \u201cSorry I haven\u2019t visited much. Once you find a new place, it\u2019s going to be even harder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Jaune.\u201d Terra assured him. \u201cWe all have our own lives and being an adult means you have a lot less free time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerra!\u201d Saph called out. \u201cCan you help me set the table?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing.\u201d Terra stood up. \u201cCan you two watch him for a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Jaune said and Terra beamed at him before going into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune,\u201d Ruby whispered and she held up the remote. \u201cSwap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith who?\u201d Jaune followed her gaze at the little boy in his lap. \u201cReally? With Adrian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not?\u201d Ruby asked. \u201cJust for a short time. It\u2019s not like anyone will know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re already in the body of some rich girl,\u201d Jaune pointed out. \u201cYou want to be a little kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Ruby shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of options, but I won\u2019t if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune sighed and waved for her to go ahead. He knew she really wanted to and she was right. It wasn\u2019t like it would matter if she swapped back soon. He did reach over and touch the remote so he knew what happened. Ruby kissed him on the cheek and aimed the remote.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked cute in the long sleeved shirt and overalls. A normal sexy girl like the twin she swapped with wearing clothes for a kid. \u201cI did a basic outfit swap, but\u2026\u201d She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo bra?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, but the overalls kind of fix that,\u201d Ruby replied. \u201cNo\u2026 Adrian\u2026 wears diapers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Jaune started snickering. \u201cSo you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush you. Keep this up and I\u2019ll tell your sister ALL about your fun adventures at Beacon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll behave.\u201d Jaune gulped. \u201cSo, are you going to switch back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I made my bed so I\u2019ll stick with it, for now.\u201d She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on in, guys!\u201d Saphron called. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Jaune carrying Adrian entered the kitchen to see the table set for four adults and a high chair. There were several plates of food set up and Terra came over to pick up Adrian. Once they were seated, Saphron waited until everyone was served before she started drilling Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo, tell me more how you met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, we met by chance when another student had some unsealed dust and made an explosion,\u201d Ruby replied. \u201cHe came over to find out what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he try a cheesy pickup like?\u201d Saphron demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Ruby wasn\u2019t sure how to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! I knew it.\u201d Saphron pointed at Jaune. \u201cI don\u2019t you not to use those lines. It doesn\u2019t matter how cute you are they are just awful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune just face palmed while Terra held a hand up to her mouth to prevent them from seeing her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you fall for him?\u201d Saphron continued. \u201cDid he make the first move or did you? How long did it take for him to notice you liked him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune slammed his head on the table while Ruby chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually asked him out,\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cHe was trying to date another girl who wasn\u2019t interested and once he was over her, we started dating.\u201d She left out a lot of details, but decided she could preserve her boyfriend\u2019s dignity as much as possible. \u201cAs to why I like him? He\u2019s kind, strong, loyal, helpful, and will go out of his way to help his friends with anything. I know he will always be there for me and we have similar interests so dating just seemed like the next logical step.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune smiled at her and continued eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do like your outfit,\u201d Terra admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s very youthful. I suppose being a huntress you need clothes that are function?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, yes.\u201d Ruby agreed. She was ashamed to admit she was getting use to wearing the diaper. The overalls and shirt were pretty normal. \u201cI like Adrian\u2019s outfit too. It\u2019s very cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he won\u2019t wear light color clothes and he hates having his legs restricted as he tries to walk,\u201d Saphron explained. \u201cSo the dress was the best choice for now until he grows out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune and Ruby had to hide their laughter. When they finished, Saphron shooed them to the living room while she cleaned up the dishes and brought out ice cream. Terra was finishing feeding Adrian and cleaning him up. When they sat down, Ruby put the remote in his hand and hit the Undo Button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTired of wearing the diaper?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI felt like I was going to us it if I wasn\u2019t careful.\u201d Ruby moaned. \u201cThat would not have been pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill want to use the remote?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Ruby admitted slowly then looked at Jaune. \u201cSo\u2026 I was thinking\u2026 what if we swapped lives with Saphron and Tera?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLives, really?\u201d Jaune asked surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, think about this.\u201d Ruby explained. \u201cWe won\u2019t have a lot of time being alone at Beacon. If we swap with them, we have all night to be together. Terra\u2019s going to put Adrian to bed soon, so we would be free to be alone together. Not only that, if we do lives, all we would do is swap clothes. We would still have out bodies, so you wouldn\u2019t have an awkward situation with seeing your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Jaune wasn\u2019t too sure if he wanted to live his sister or sister-in-law\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother option would be to swap positions,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big Personal Information Swap that literally exchanges everything not physical. We would be seen as the owners here, with Adrian as out kid, and Saph and Terra would be the Huntresses in training, even though they are older. This way, we could keep being ourselves in the twin\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really want this?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you do,\u201d Ruby said quickly. \u201cIf you want to do something smaller, I\u2019m perfectly fine with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune decided\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wrapped his arms around Ruby and pulled her close. \u201cMaybe we should?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward and kissed her lips softly. Ruby closed her eyes and kissed him back, enjoying the warmth. Jaune couldn\u2019t resist and his hands lowered to grasp her butt. Ruby moaned from her mouth into his, but didn\u2019t break contact. Instead, she tightened her grip to prevent Jaune from drawing back. Finally, they separated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBedroom?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBedroom.\u201d Ruby agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rushed upstairs, careful not to wake Adrian. The last they thing wanted was him to cry and disturb them. His door was shut so he shouldn\u2019t hear them. They found the main bedroom with the large bed and immediately plopped down. Ruby removed her heals and Jaune did the same to his. Finally, they pulled off their dresses, leaving Ruby with just red bra and panties, while Jaune\u2019s was white. They sat down and kissed each other again before examining one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Jaune told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe or my current body?\u201d Ruby teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth.\u201d Jaune kissed her neck and she moaned. \u201cWith the remote, aren\u2019t bodies just kind of\u2026 outfits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never thought of that,\u201d Ruby admitted.

What if they are virgins?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, I don\u2019t have a dick right now.\u201d Jaune reminded her. \u201cPlus, the remote keeps us the same people with Body Swaps, right? So maybe it\u2019s tied to life? If you lose your virginity, it doesn\u2019t matter what body you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd since your sister and Terra are already intimate-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t mention my sister and intimacy, please.\u201d Jaune begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t messing with anything,\u201d Ruby finished. \u201cSo we can continue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jaune said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of comfortable here.

Ruby was happy and warm, along with being embraced by her lover. This might be the first night they actually did something together. Sure, Jaune wouldn\u2019t have his manhood to put inside of her, something she was a little scared of, but that could easily happen the next time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eventaully Jaune began toying with the breasts Ruby owned and she moaned in appreciation from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you just wanted to cuddle.\"  Ruby moaned out as she felt him unclasp the bra she's wearing revealing the girl's body she's wearing's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I both knew this was bound to happen.\"  Jaune growled lightly in love and lust.  He removed the bra he was wearing as to mounds appeared before Ruby,  she gazing longingly at them causing Jaune to smirk and began to rub one of Ruby's breasts while sucking the nipple of the other.  Ruby moaned out his name and held him close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter turning the TV off with the normal remote since that is no longer needed Jaune focused on pleasuring his girlfriend causing her to cry out for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jaune.\"  Ruby moaned out.

Focusing at the task at hand he continued to enjoy the breasts he now owns being treated in a delicate fashion, Ruby was really good at this but this shouldn't be much of a surprise since women knew what women wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had some self practice?\"  Jaune asked, causing her to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have, the thought of me masturbating turning you on their vomit boy?\"  She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more than you doing this to me is turning you on crater girl.\"  He teased back, and both of them chuckled before kissing each other again.  After their make out session they both knew it was time and removed their panties, Jaune got to take a look at the womanhood Ruby was borrowing while Jaune displayed the womanhood he was borrowing he took the time to view it and couldn't help but touch it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what it feels like.\"  Jaune commented moaning out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're supposed to do that to me.\"  Ruby purred.

Her body was pretty sensitive and Jaune, while not having a lot of e experience, was making it up with enthusiasm. She could feel it inside of her, pleasuring all her sensitive spots. Not wanting him to stop when she was so close, she put on hand on the back of his head. Careful to keep his hair out of the way, but holding him so he couldn\u2019t retreat. Her other hand messaged her own breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m almost there!\u201d She proclaimed and she could feel the shift in his technique. He was trying to bring her over the edge by aggressive licking everywhere inside her his tongue could reach. \u201cAh, yes\u2026oh god!\u201d She felt herself release and Jaune finally was allowed to lift up his head. \u201cYou\u2019re really good,\u201d Ruby added, panting a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were pretty tasty,\u201d he responded with a grin, causing her to blush. \u201cThink I could get a chance to experience that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I suppose. If I tasted good and you\u2019re my twin, you should too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby grinned and began to repay the favor. She could hear Jaune\u2019s cute feminine moans as her tongue explored his cave. In a way, he had been right. His pussy juices weren\u2019t bad, maybe even a little sweet. Though that might have been her imagination because she was with the one she loved. A hand pressed on the back of her head but she didn\u2019t mine. She wasn\u2019t planning to get up until her boyfriend came. Finally, when she heard him gasp again, she knew she was close. Her tongue began to run alone his most sensitive places and, at long last, she felt the liquid hit her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Ruby.\u201d Jaune said, awestruck. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, women know where they are sensitive,\u201d she reminded him and then licked her lips. \u201cNow, shall we get to the real fun, or do you want to play around some more?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They knew the general position on scissoring, but neither had done it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we just rub them together?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they did in the book,\u201d Ruby confirmed, scooting together. They crotches were close, but now their legs were kind of tangled together. \u201cThis isn\u2019t very comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we need to change positions slightly?\u201d Jaune suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, stick your left leg under mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour left leg!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my left leg!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy left!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d Jaune declared, sliding one leg under Ruby. He then put his other leg over hers so they were in a rough x-shape. \u201cThis is better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to feel good,\u201d Ruby assured him. \u201cit will be worth it.\u201d They pushed together until their slits were touching. \u201cMmm, you\u2019re warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are too, but it does feel nice.\u201d Jaune told her. \u201cI\u2019m going to start moving.\u201d Ruby nodded and he began. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, but I think being eaten out felt better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to move too.\u201d Ruby began bucking her hips slightly and then gasped when a surge of pleasure ran through her. Jaune\u2019s expression told her he felt it too. \u201cFound the sweet spot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began to tweak their hips at each other, keeping their pussies touching and rubbing enthusiastically. After a little trial and error, they began to find the sweet spots and started to go all out. Both of them were gasping and moaning with pleasure as they drew nearer and nearer. Boobs were bouncing up and down, causing them to have a show too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Jaune!\u201d Ruby squeaked. \u201cI\u2019m almost there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am too! Let\u2019s go all out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir speed increased and they were virtually humping their crotches at each other. Eventually, they couldn\u2019t hold it and both of them cried out as they came. Panting, they fell on the bed. Scissoring was a little tiring and, as they weren\u2019t Hunters anymore, they didn\u2019t have as much stamina. Both of them just laid there, catching their breath, and enjoying the peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 was\u2026 fantastic.\u201d Ruby told him. She rolled over so her head was resting on his chest. \u201cThanks for going along with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime you want,\u201d Jaune assured her and she laughed. \u201cI think we deserve some rest now.\u201d He scooted over and pulled the blanket off to the side so Ruby could cuddle up next to him. Once they were covered, he leaned down and kissed her nose. \u201cYou\u2019re adorable you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so are you,\u201d Ruby replied, rubbing her cheek against his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we are twins.\u201d They both got a laugh out of that one. It was lucky Adrian didn\u2019t wake up or they would have to take care of him. Right now, sleep began to overtake them as they relaxed into each other\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Morning...</span></div></div>",

We have to take care of Adrian still, but he\u2019s so adorable and I can help out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want,\u201d Jaune replied neutrally. \u201cWe can act like a family if you want to see what it\u2019s like.\u201d Ruby blushed again and Jaune did too, once he realized what he said. \u201cI mean, we only have Port\u2019s and Oobleck\u2019s class today. We can skip Ports for sure and Terra and Saph will write down notes for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly downside is missing Crescent Rose.\u201d Ruby admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink of it as instead of losing a weapon, you gained a beautiful kid.\u201d Jaune gestured to Adrian, who puffed out his chest. Ruby squealed at how cute he was. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s just a day or two, think of this as a vacation. We can go back to killing Grimm afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bring up good points, Jaune.\u201d Ruby told him and nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him and had some fun imagining him naked again. Being hot twins and doing it was kind of weird, but strangely hot. Maybe if they stayed, they could try out other bodies. Of course, part of Ruby did want to go back and hang out with her team too. There were pros and cons to both sides. She noticed Jaune had his back to her and she looked at Adrian. The remote was in her pocket and she \u2018could\u2019 make a swap to have Jaune pamper her as a baby. She giggled silently, but also worried about the consequences of swapping anything non-cosmetic with a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally decided on\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t take long to find them, as classes had just let out. There were a couple flashes of light as they Life Swapped. Ruby was now wearing Emerald\u2019s revealing top and pants, while Jaune was wearing Cinder\u2019s grey pants and jacket with a sarashi tied around his chest.  Ruby also had Emeralds short green hair and Jaune had Cinder\u2019s long black hair. \u201cShould we swap bodies too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, and then when we swap with my sisters, we can keep these bodies.\u201d There was another flash as Jaune took Cinder\u2019s body and Ruby took Emeralds.

Jaune and Ruby looked at each other, unsure what to do, until Jaune held up the remote. Ruby\u2019s eyes widened and she slowly smiled. Since it was Jaune\u2019s idea, he got to make the swap and Ruby just touched the remote. Jaune thought about it for a moment and then pressed a couple buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he did was swap bodies and clothes. Now he shrunk a bit as Neo was a lot shorter than Cinder. He tried to say something to Ruby and found out Neo was indeed mute, not just silent, and he swapped voices. Next, he swapped the male genitals he had kept on Cinder which Neo now had. Figuring he might as well have some fun, he swapped weapons and Semblance too. Lastly, he swapped names. So he was pretty much Neo with Cinder\u2019s voice and life, and his own dick. Neo found what she was looking for and left with a short wave. It was disconcerting to see Cinder silent and smiling friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree days only,\u201d Jaune reminded her and Ruby had to work hard at keeping a straight face. \u201cThen back to work.\u201d Neo saluted and left. The two of them waited a few minutes and then burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so weird to heard Cinder\u2019s mature voice come out of you looking like a colorful kid!\u201d Ruby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeo\u2019s actually pretty developed,\u201d Jaune commented. \u201cBesides, I do like her outfit more than Cinders. Hers is kind of plain, like she didn\u2019t want to stand out. \u201cThough, the pants are a little tight now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed.\u201d Ruby pointed at his bulge.

We will need to leave first thing tomorrow if we want to catch Saph and Terra before they leave to go anywhere. I\u2019m not sure what to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby rubbed her chin. Emerald\u2019s expression was much closer to someone contemplating a difficult issue than Ruby\u2019s normal cute face could ever be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not myself, I don\u2019t want to waste the opportunity to use the remote, but someone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d Jaune told her. \u201cAnyone you want to be is fine with me. Did you have an idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, skipping over Yang,\u201d Ruby continued. \u201cI think Blake would be an obvious choice. She\u2019s really hot and has those cute cat ears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let her hear you say that,\u201d Jaune warned and she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t.\u201d Ruby beamed at him. \u201cThen I was thinking\u2026 if you are okay with it\u2026 Weiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss?\u201d Jaune asked surprised. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you find her attractive,\u201d Ruby pointed out. \u201cSo I thought you might like it. Besides\u2026 if we\u2026 uh\u2026 share a night over the next couple days\u2026\u201d She trialed off and Jaune felt his own ears burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure what else to say, though his mail imagination went into overdrive while his dick began to grow uncomfortable in Neo\u2019s tight pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen maybe Velvet,\u201d Ruby continued, deliberately avoiding eye contact. \u201cShe\u2019s cute and I liked having enhanced hearing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your choice.\u201d Jaune said, but there\u2019s Emerald and Cinder in our lives. I recommend swapping bodies back with Emerald, at least that way all you have between them is a Life Swap. Things are going to get confusing fast with so many partial swaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Ruby said and one quick swap later she was back in her own body, wearing Emeralds clothes while living her life. \u201cSo I\u2019ll swap body and clothes with someone and then we can call it an early night? Get up, early, go to Vale, and then Position Swap with your sisters?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI recommend the name too,\u201d Jaune suggested. \u201cMight as well make it as complete as possible. Only reason I have Cinder\u2019s voice is because Neo can\u2019t talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaph and Terra are going to be Cinder and Emerald,\u201d Ruby snickered, as they stood up and threw their trash away. \u201cThat\u2019s hilarious in its own way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the real Cinder and Emerald are doing our work,\u201d Jaune added. \u201cNow, let\u2019s find you knew body for the next couple of days.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Adrian couldn\u2019t look happier to be with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours, Jaune decided to look around the house. Something was telling him they needed to do something important.

Jaune smiled at her and the two of them left together, before splitting up. Ruby held Adrian tightly in her arms as she walked down the street. A couple people waved at her, neighbors most likely, and she waved back. When they got to the park, she noticed Adrian reaching a hand out to the sandbox. \u201cYou want to play there? Sure thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought him over and set him down. Adrian began to immediately making a pile out of sand and Ruby helped him out occasionally. It was early, so there weren\u2019t a lot of other people around. It meant they weren\u2019t interrupted.  Once the sand pile was made to his specification, Adrian stuck a couple sticks in it and looked pleased with himself. Ruby clapped her hands together and patted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You\u2019re so smart, Adrian.\u201d Ruby complimented. \u201cHow would you like to try out the slide?\u201d Adrian nodded and Ruby picked him up. The slide at the park was very small and designed for kids. Ruby set him up top and let him go, before catching him at the bottom. While it wasn\u2019t a long slide, Adrian was still very young. Ruby did this a couple more times before taking Adrian to the rocking horses on the spring. She sat down with him in her lap and rocked back and forth while Adrian cheered. \u201cHaving fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian\u2019s smile told her everything she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour son is adorable.\u201d Ruby turned to see a mother pushing a stroller with two kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Ruby told her. \u201cYou\u2019re twins are cute too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be tough having a kid while so young,\u201d the women commented. Ruby brushed her white ponytail back and looked down at Weiss\u2019s dress. It was a little sandy, but would dust off easily enough. She almost forgot she took Weiss\u2019s body and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little,\u201d Ruby replied, remembering the trouble Yang had gone through. \u201cHaving a wonderful partner and seeing him smile makes it all worthwhile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know exactly what you mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked a bit before she left and Ruby realized she needed to get back and meet up with Jaune. Adrian looked a little sad about leaving, but rested his head against Ruby\u2019s chest as she carried him back home. When she entered the house, she saw Jaune putting groceries away. A laugh escaped her as she saw Jaune having trouble reaching the upper shelves because of Neo\u2019s small frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun?\u201d He asked, looking over at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots of it,\u201d Ruby replied. \u201cI met another mother and we talked a bit. Though, I think I need to put Adrian down for a short nap. He\u2019s tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d Jaune agreed. \u201cLet him rest. I\u2019ll make some lunch and then we can decide what to do next.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being so young it didn't take much for him to go to sleep, and once he was Jaune smiled kissed him on the head and left quietly.  Once he left the room he found Ruby was waiting for him and pounced him to kiss him which he returned.  They made out for a while then Jaune smirked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's eager.\"  He teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you're not.\"  She teased back, he simply gave her a coy smile and kissed some more, heading to their bedroom.  The two of them plopped to the bed as their make out session continued before deciding clothing was becoming a bit constricting, Ruby went first and removed the attire Weiss wears in a slow sensible fashion to give him a show.  Seeing his reaction near his crotch area she went even slower teasing him by moaning a bit and not quite removing her underwear once she was stripped down to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tease.\" He growled. She smirked at that as she teased him more, getting him nice and aroused.  He decided enough was enough and pounced her to the bed, she was a bit surprised but it wasn't unwelcome she found herself liking this side of him.  Jaune decided to remove her underwear himself starting with her bra, as they were free the breasts of Weiss came into view.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had the smallest size of breasts out of all her teammates, two mammary glands that were barely visible, but he appreciated them nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything you dreamed of?\"  Ruby winked.  Jaune couldn't deny he fantasized this about the silver haired girl for so long, but now that he has her body it was Ruby he was thinking of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once upon a time yes, but now that I have you I have better.\"  He replied, causing Ruby to gush and smile happily at that and tackled him back to kiss him.  Going to work on his body's clothing he got her down to the underwear Neo was wearing to find that multicoloured as well, a pink bra with white panties, and stripes of brown all over her white panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really likes those three colours.\"  Ruby commented before removing the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To each their own I suppose.\"  He replied back before it came off.  The two stared at each other longingly before going to work on their underwear, Ruby glanced and Jaune's manhood for the very first time and blushed, a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to go very far if you'd like.\" He advised \"Just foreplay can do if you feel you're not ready for the whole experience.\"</span></div></div>",

Slowly, her hand moved up and down, feeling every inch and bump. She could feel his pulse though the contact. Knowing what she wanted, Ruby lowered her head down and gentle licked the tip. Jaune\u2019s body jerked slightly and she grinned. The taste wasn\u2019t too bad, a little salty and there was a slight musky smell, but not in a bad way. She opened her mouth a little wider and stuck the head of her boyfriend\u2019s penis inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking gentle, her eyes kept wandering up to Jaune\u2019s face, trying to gauge his reaction to her skill. His face was a little flustered, but that really just made him cuter. His eyes even swapped colors a couple of times due to Neo\u2019s Semblance. Ruby lowered and raised her mouth, easily getting half his cock in there, but she wasn\u2019t used to deep throating. Instead, she sometimes removed it with a plopping sound and spent time licking the sides and using her hands to cup his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it was kind of an awkward blowjob. She didn\u2019t have any experience. Weiss\u2019s body didn\u2019t have any experience or automatic reflexes, and Saphron, who was married to another woman, definitely didn\u2019t have experience giving one. Ruby was on her own and made up for her lack of skill with enthusiasm and determination to make Jaune feel good. When she tasted a little salty precum, she knew she was doing okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting close,\u201d Jaune told her, his pelvis jerking up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby nodded and made sure to enclose as much of his dick in her mouth as possible. Her hand began to work his balls and she internally smiled when she saw Jaune playing with his own breasts. Neo was pretty well developed for her size. The feeling of his balls in her hand changed slightly, feeling harder. He must be about to release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahed.\u201d Ruby murmured, talking with her mouth full of his manhood. \u201cI wan if.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t expect for Jaune to grab the back of her head and forcefully push his dick all the way down her throat. Before she knew what happened, her mouth was at the base, pushing up against his balls. A little water began to form in her eyes. Before anything could come of that, she felt him release. His dick spasmed slightly and hot streams of cum flooded her throat. She couldn\u2019t take it all and some of it leaked out her nose and mouth as she desperately tried to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what he was doing, Jaune pulled back, his dick escaping her mouth with a wet plop sound. He pulled back a little too soon and one stream of cum flew forward and smacked Ruby right in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Jaune apologized immediately. \u201cIt was so good, I just lost myself there for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby coughed and didn\u2019t immediately answer him. Instead, she took a finger to wipe the cum off her face and slowly inserted it into her mouth. Her lips gentle sucked her finger while her eyes fell on Jaune\u2019s manhood. It had begun to shrink, but now was rising to full mast again. Her eyes traveled up to Jaune\u2019s apologetic face, with just a hint of arousal. He was so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d she finally assured him. \u201cJust surprised. That was actually pretty hot.\u201d She licked her lips and smiled when he blushed. She knew he loved the fact she looked like Weiss and had just given him a blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand reached down between her legs. She was soaked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This caused her to cry out even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, right there!\"  She almost shouted but manged to contain herself for Adrian's sake.  He grinned at her and went faster at her clit, making her grab his head to keep in there, but not to hard to prevent him from taking air.

Claim me as yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was a guy and when a girl tells you that, you move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed the tip of his member against her lips and slowly pushed in. It took so much control not to jam it in. Ruby was tight, or Weiss\u2019s body was tight, maybe a little of both. Either way, it took some pushing to get it in, but slow enough so he didn\u2019t hurt her. Ruby was gripping the bed tightly, her eyes closed, and lips pressed deliberately together to prevent noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jaune asked, stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep\u2026keep going,\u201d Ruby gasped. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune pushed in the rest of the way and she gasped as she felt his tip hit inside of her. Weiss didn\u2019t have a hymen, but both of them were sure she was a virgin. Maybe it broke due to all the Hunter training. Now that he was all the way in, the pressure on his dick was insane. Warm, moist, flesh was gripping his cock, trying to hold him inside of her. That also might have been Ruby unconsciously tightening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to relax,\u201d Jaune told her. \u201cI can\u2019t move if you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a sec,\u201d Ruby told him, opening her eyes. Their gaze met and he smiled to put her at ease. Neither of them were experienced with this, so it wasn\u2019t like Jaune was trying to show her up. They both were trying to make the other feel good. \u201cOkay.\u201d She tried to relax. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune began to slide his dick out. Once he reached the tip, he pushed it back in again. Ruby squeaked and then let out a moan of pleasure. Jaune smiled and began to repeat the process, slowly going faster and faster. His hands were on her hips and his boobs kept bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes ,yes!\u201d Ruby cried and then threw her hand over her mouth. She didn\u2019t want to wake Adrian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me know when you\u2019re about to cum,\u201d Jaune said, his face scrunched with determination. \u201cI\u2019m trying to hold\u2026 back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Ruby half whispered, half gasped. \u201cFaster, harder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune obliged and both of them were about to climax.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kids are a lot of work. We may not be team leaders anymore, but we are responsible for a life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cI have weird urges to vacuum and clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPart of having Saph\u2019s position.\u201d Jaune pointed out. \u201cI have similar urges. Speaking off, it\u2019s almost time for lunch, but what do you want to do afterwards?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStaying home is always an option,\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cThough, I really want to take Adrian to the mall and put him in different cute outfits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that brings back memories.\u201d Jaune recalled and flinched. \u201cMy sisters would dress me up in so many dresses.\u201d Ruby had a good laugh out of that and Adrian, sensing the mood, laughed too. \u2018I\u2019m sure we can figure out something else to do while we eat.\u201d Jaune carried Adrian to the kitchen and set him down in his high chair. \u201cMind feeding him while I cook?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Ruby grabbed the baby food. Adrian was at solid foods, but not quite to full people food. She scooped up a spoonful and made airplane noises until Adrian opened his mouth to eat. \u201cHeh, there may be stinky diapers, but this is fun too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt gets old quick.\u201d Jaune warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his back turn, Ruby again thought of doing a secret swap with Adrian that Jaune wasn\u2019t aware of.

It would make Adrian the new age and then you Life and Body Swap back and Adrian stays the same and you\u2019re back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what age?\u201d Ruby asked. ::Like ten or maybe a teenager like 14? He could go on most of the rides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they get too old, they won\u2019t want to go on rides with us,\u201d Jaune reminded her. So fourteen is probably the oldest we should go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Ruby thought about it for a moment. \u201cWhat if you and I Life Swap with kids going to the amusement park? We could have fun as kids and no one would be the wiser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLife would be funny,\u201d Jaune agreed. \u201cEveryone would see us as kids, while we would see ourselves wearing kids clothes.\u201d Ruby laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could do a body too,\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cImagine being smaller and seeing normal rides grow giant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your normal size?\u201d Jaune teased and Ruby gasped at him, before flicking his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust for that, no kisses today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please anything but that?! I\u2019m sorry a thousand times over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby laughed at his pleading and kissed him on the lips. Adrian covered his eyes at their display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat choice did they go with?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though Jaune and Ruby could tell a lot of the earlier stuff was just a warm up. It was always fun watching the magician give a kid a wand and then it collapses to the poor kid\u2019s dismay. When a lot of the little kids left, it got a lot more exciting. The first was when he pulled out a long box, a saw, and a volunteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll need a lovely volunteer from the audience.\u201d The magician said and then pointed to Ruby. \u201cYou miss. Would you like to come up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Ruby didn\u2019t like being the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on mom, you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d Adrian whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on\u2026 dear.\u201d Jaune said, pushing Ruby forward. Betrayed by her \u2018family\u2019 Ruby went up and nervously introduced herself as Saphron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to be scared,\u201d the magician assured her. \u201cI\u2019m a professional. Now, if you would just lay down in here.\u201d Ruby did and he pulled out a saw. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to divide this lovely lady in two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have her in one piece afterwards?!\u201d Jaune called out and got a lot of laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, of course miss.\u201d He sawed all the way through and Ruby had her eyes closed. Then the man slipped some metal sheets between the box halves and pulled them apart. The crowd gasped as Ruby was in two pieces. The foot on the lower half even moved. \u201cNow, to put her back together!\u201d He pulled the halves together. \u201cAbracadabra!\u201d He opened the box and Ruby was whole once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as he helped Ruby down and she joined Jaune and Adrian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was awesome!\u201d Adrian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did he do it?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo idea.\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cI could swear my feet were out of the box the entire time, so it wasn\u2019t like I was stuck in half of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA good magician never reveals his tricks.\u201d Adrian pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shark tank got pulled out, Adrian completely forgot about his \u2018parents.\u2019 The magician bound himself up and then locked himself in a box before being submerged. Everyone got scared when he didn\u2019t emerge after a couple minutes, but then he just walked down the ally from behind them to everyone\u2019s surprise. The rest of the show was just like that. Magic that blew their mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat show was great!\u201d Adrian said happily. \u201cThanks for tanking me, moms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI enjoyed it too.\u201d Jaune said and then noticed Adrian stifling a yawn. \u201cWhen we get back, it\u2019s bedtime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwww.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby laughed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I want to go out, explore the world a bit and help as many people as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame.\u201d Jaune ran his fingers through her hair. \u201cWhen we are ready, I can see us settling down and having kids. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to stop being Hunters though. We can alternate going out or having babysitters watch them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know just how to make a girl feel special.\u201d Ruby told him, nuzzled his neck. \u201cI promise to tell Yang about us tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise to have an escape plan ready to live past tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby laughed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooooo.\u201d She pushed off him and looked him in the eyes. \u201cWant to do it again? Or are you bored of Weiss\u2019s body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby, I told you before, whatever girl you are, I\u2019ll still want to do it with you,\u201d Jaune told her. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the day we can have our first time in our bodies and lives.\u201d Ruby blushed. \u201cPlus, Weiss is hot. I\u2019ll keep that up for days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJerk!\u201d She punched him lightly and then kissed him. \u201cAm I hotter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThousand times hotter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle low, but I guess it\u2019s okay.\u201d They laughed and kissed again. Ruby began to unhook her bra and then started on Jaune. \u201cThis is our last time here. Anything special you want to do?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She watched him head into the kitchen and rummage around. \u201cAh hah!\u201d he came out with a can on whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u2019 She asked, a huge smile on her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Chocolate syrup?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have any,\u201d Jaune told her. \u201cI figured you might want a little sugar rush while we start having fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know me so well.\u201d Ruby told him and they went into the living room. All the curtains were closed so they didn\u2019t have to worry about neighbors spying on them. She pushed Jaune onto the couch and took the bottle. Smiling she sprayed his chest with the stuff and knelt down on top of him, before digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see why girls like this,\u201d Jaune moaned, as Ruby licked and sucked on his whipped cream covered breasts. \u201cBoobs are so sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd tasty,\u201d Ruby said, earning a chuckle. She raised her head and Jaune noticed some cream around her mouth. He leaned forward and licked her cheek, causing her to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaste like strawberries,\u201d Jaune said and licked her lips. Ruby couldn\u2019t take it anymore and kissed im, pushing him back on the couch. Their tongues worked hard in each other\u2019s mouth and she didn\u2019t even care she hadn\u2019t cleaned him off completely. A little cream was spreading on her own chest. All she knew was she wanted him and he wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally broke apart and a thin line of drool connected them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cI need you in me. ravish me. Make me yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re already mine,\u201d Jaune told her and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m yours.\u201d He grinned as her face turned crimson. He lifted her as he stood up. Her legs wrapped around him automatically to hold on. It wasn\u2019t hard. Weiss weighed almost nothing and Neo was actually pretty strong.He leaned up agains a wall and lifted her body a little more as his dick was positioned her pussy. \u201cReady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it!\u201d Ruby begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune pushed her down and she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept slamming her down on him as she gripped him with her legs. Her arms were wrapped under his and he could feel her nails in his back. He didn\u2019t mind. He was in heaven, just like Ruby. He kept this up as long as possible until he couldn\u2019t hold it. Ruby cried out in ecstasy as she came, but he couldn\u2019t risk inside of her. He wasn\u2019t sure the ramifications if she got pregnant in Saph life what would happen. Instead he put her on the couch as he stood over her, still slamming into her womanhood. At last, there was no way he could hold it and jerked back, freeing himself from her hold. His dick was free and released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrands of white cum flew out right on Ruby\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and squeeled as it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Jaune apologized. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Ruby used a finger to whip some cum into her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. But I guess it was my turn to be covered in cream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t help laugh.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He flipped her over and pushed her head into the couch. Her but was sticking up in the air and Ruby was obviously not mad at him for being forceful. No, her butt was wagging back and forth enticing him to enter. He pushed the tip of his cock into the entrance and grunted. \u201cDamn, it\u2019s tight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Weiss\u2019s body,\u201d Ruby reminded him and he laughed.

He continued to pound his dick in and out of her ass. Damn, it was tight and her cheeks kept squeezing his member. If he hadn\u2019t come moments before, he would have shot off immediately. \u201cHow does it feel\u2026 to be abused\u2026 like a whore?\u201d He slapped her ass a couple times until it was red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m such a whore!\u201d Ruby moaned. \u201cI deserve to be treated like a toy. My ass is your property!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right it is!\u201d Jaune told her, smacking it again. \u201cWhat can I do with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything!\u201d Ruby cried. \u201cAnything you want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Jaune said. He got an idea and reached forward. He took one finger on each hand and put them into Ruby\u2019s mouth. He pulled back on her cheeks while still pounding away on her ass. She was partially lifted up and was moaning constantly from the sensation. \u201cLike being fish hooked too you dirty girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah!\u201d Ruby agreed, a little muffled since her mouth was being abused too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m about to cum,\u201d Jaune warned her after five minutes of abusing her butt. \u201cYou want me to fill up your ass?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFill it up with your baby batter!\u201d Ruby called over her shoulder. Jaune would have laughed if he wasn\u2019t about to blow. He slowed down the pace right before and slammed his dick as far in as he could.It was only then that he let everything he had saved up into her. Ruby gasped, her eyes rolled back in her head as she came too, and collapsed on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune collapsed on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were panting and it took some time before they began to move. Ruby shifted her head and kissed his lips. He returned the favor but didn\u2019t move. His flaccid dick was still partially buried in her backdoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you\u2026 not tell anyone we talked like that?\u201d Ruby asked, her face glowing bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking it to my grave\u2026 or the next time we do this.\u201d Jaune said. \u201cDepends if Yang kills me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cif I tell her how good you are, she might want to try you out.\u201d Ruby commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKidding!\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou knew I was kidding, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah.\u201d Jaune was not going to tell her he imagined doing both of them at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune, things won\u2019t change between us, right?\u201d Ruby asked. \u201cAfter we go bck to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby\u2026 things change all the time.\u201d Jaune replied. \u201cBut I love you and I want to be with you.

Jaune laughed at her as he got up. \u2018Not funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was pretty funny.\u201d He heard Adrian start to make noise. \u201cI think It\u2019s time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d She held out the remote and Jaune touched it. Ruby kissed him once more before hitting the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, she found herself back in Beacon, in her dorm room, with her teammates all getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Friday after we got back from the worst fieldtrip ever,\u201d Yang complained. \u201cWhy do we still have classes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s because the want us to treat missions like real world scenarios.\u201d Blake explained. \u201cWe are expect to come back and continue our lives like normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Ruby said, trying to act like a leader. She hid the remote in her pocket. Jaune would be with his team now. \u201cThe field trip wasn\u2019t that bad\u2026\u201d Everyone stared at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you\u2026 block the last few days from your memory?\u201d Blake asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d Ruby was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt literally down poured the ENITRE trip,\u201d Weiss stated in shock. \u201cOobleck made us go out and collect artifacts, PLUS we had to keep fighting Grimm who seemed to LIKE when it was raining. I felt like I would never be dry again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything of ours was muddy and soaked,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cYou complained about being stuck in a tent most of the time because it was too wet. The showers in the gym were packed as everyone couldn\u2019t wait until they got to their dorm to shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 right.\u201d Ruby suddenly saw the memories of how bad the trip was. The highlight was them all sitting in a tent playing cards. Everything else sucked. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be positive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a difference between positivity and denial.\u201d Weiss huffed. \u201cNow, should we go get breakfast? I for one am going to enjoy a hot meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking my language, Weiss.\u201d Yang hopped down from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby knew she had to get the courage to tell Yang.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruby entered the cafeteria, grabbed her food, and sat down next to her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Ruby replied, tossing a cookie in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpill the deets.\u201d Yang huffed. \u201cYou just told us you and Jaune were dating. Tell us more.\u201d Ruby noticed Blake\u2019s bow twitch and even Weiss glanced over at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much to tell,\u201d Ruby explained. \u201cWe have similar interests, like spending time with each other, and just sort of got together since we hang out so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoring.\u201d Yang sighed. \u201cAt least make up some amazing backstory about why you fell for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 I was fighting a bunch of Grimm and bit off more than I could chew?\u2019 Ruby made up. She noticed Yang didn\u2019t change much personality wise, but wasn\u2019t holding back on her personal life. \u201cHe came in and saved me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter, but more details.\u201d Yang told her. \u201cMake it believable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike anyone would believe Arc had to save Ruby.\u201d Weiss huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe nice.\u201d Ruby warned and she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, since he no longer is pursuing me.\u201d Weiss\u2019s expression softened. \u201cWhile I still think his combat skills needs work, I can tell you\u2019re happy with him. So I have no issues with you dating, if it doesn\u2019t affect our team dynamic. And if I catch you two doing it in our room, I\u2019m freezing you both and throwing you into the forest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoted.\u201d Ruby laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah is me that my fifteen year old team leader got a date before me,\u201d Yang moaned. \u201cAnd with my dorky brother too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if you didn\u2019t just flirt with every guy\u2026 and some girls,\u201d Blake suggested. \u201cYou might find a partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that an invitation, Kitty Kat?\u201d Yang asked and Blake rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, if you could answer a question for me, I might.\u201d Blake said. \u201cRuby wouldn\u2019t-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO, NO, NO, NOOOO!\u201d Ruby interjected.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A quick flash of light and Jaune\u2019s pants were now a lot more comfortable. The sudden weight on his chest was more concerning, as he quickly adjusted himself. He looked down and saw his shirt sticking out. \u201cWow, these are heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang complained about them a lot growing up,\u201d Ruby told him. \u201cGave her back pains for ages.\u201d She noticed him grabbing one. \u201cMight not want to grope yourself in public.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, oops.

A reward for being a good sport about our previous bet.

Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d Jaune told her. \u201cSo, what now?\u201d It was getting late, so they couldn\u2019t really explore unless they wanted to do something at night. They could go to Vale, but they were going to be there most of the day tomorrow. They could find people to swap with, if Ruby didn\u2019t have a punishment swap in mind already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, they both had wings. Ruby with feathery Nevermore and Jaune with reptilian wyvern ones. Jaune was currently wearing Coco\u2019s clothes, with Yang\u2019s boobs and genitals. He was glad Coco was decently endowed herself, which meant her bra was designed to handle larger boobs. Ruby was just wearing Emerald\u2019s outfit right now. Most of her upper body was revealed, with an olive crop top over her chest and an intricate white top that mostly covered her back and wrapped around her shoulders and neck.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We passed Goodwitch back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey backtracked and Ruby made a quick swap once they saw the deputy headmistress before running off. Next they went looking for Weiss. They wanted to learn their Semblances together. Weiss was in the library talking to Blake.

Yang\u2019s boobs were a little annoying because of their weight and bounciness, but he was getting use to them. The lack of dick between his legs was probably worse. Though, out of all the swaps, wearing Coco\u2019s shades indoors impaired him the most. Ruby on the other hand seemed to have more freedom with less clothes.

Since no one will notice, I didn\u2019t see the rush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should definitely see if he did,\u201d Jaune agreed. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss is watching him,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cWe might see her walking him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprised Zwei is male,\u201d Jaune said. \u201cHe has smooth fur and long legs, though when he goes and steals toys, sounds just like a male dog I knew back home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss loves him.\u201d Ruby said. \u201cOh, there they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune turned to see Zwei wearing Weiss\u2019s outfit holding a leash in his mouth attached to a naked Weiss\u2019 neck. She was sniffing a tree and then raised her leg to mark it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope Weiss doesn\u2019t find I stole her Semblance.\u201d Jaune told Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be the least of our worries if people find out about it.\u201d Ruby reminded him. The two of them got into the Bullhead, Jaune focused on not vomiting, and they headed to Vale. \u201cIf you vomit on me, we\u2019re through.\u201d Ruby warned him. Jaune didn\u2019t reply until after they landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was mean.\u201d Jaune huffed. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll remind you of your explosion every time we walk by a dust shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll use my punishment and make you swap with Adrian.\u201d Ruby replied with a smirk. \u201cHmm, I like the sound of that. Make you life his life and act like him while I practice taking care of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do, I swear I\u2019ll poop and cry a lot.\u201d Jaune countered, pushing her shoulder lightly. Both of them laughed as they headed toward Saphron\u2019s house. It was just going to be her and Adrian, perfect if they wanted to swap.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Adrian was on the sofa and was watching one of Ruby\u2019s favorite TV shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby really liked the fact everything was so much bigger now. Jaune\u2019s lap was like a palace and when she laid back, his big boobs acted like a great pillow. Part of the reason she could let go was because Jaune had the remote and she trusted him to use it if things got bad. Unlike last time, when she did it accidentally and could have been trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune tickled her and she laughed. Though no words came out of her mouth. He then laid her down and blew a raspberry into her belly. It tickled her so much and she couldn\u2019t stop laughing. When she sat up again, she noticed Adrian smiling at them. Ruby was a little worried Adrian might try something as he believed he was her and had her body, though didn\u2019t know about the remote. She trusted Jaune would have a plan to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was a baby, she might as well act like it and just have fun with simple things. Struggling, Jaune got the message to let her down on the ground and she crawled over to a basket with building blocks, sort of like large Legos for kids. She began to build a tower and Jaune sat down on the floor behind her. Adrian even helped by sorting the blocks by color for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that there was no risk, being a baby was awesome.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Weiss turned around and beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was adorable!\"  She gushed \"Your dog is the cutest.\"  She calmed down again and fake coughed \"I mean, it was fine I'll do it again when you want me to.\"  She got up and fixed herself \"anyways, I'm going to grab an apple to snack on, take care Ruby, Arc.\"  She said her goodbyes and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you she loves him.\"  Ruby snickered, \"Now let's do that swap.\"  Jaune nodded and approached Zwei who was sleeping, pointing the remote at him they were ready to do the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you'll put clothes on your dog so I won't run around naked?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\"  She started and Jaune glared at her, \"kidding, kidding.\"  Ruby grabbed Zwei's dog outfit and carefully put it on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, some decency.\"  Ruby assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, alright I'm ready.\"  Jaune told her, the held the remote together and with a press of a button did the necessary swaps to put Jaune in Zwei's body and wear his sweater while running his life.  Jaune was now in Zwei's body wearing the sweater while Zwei in Jaune's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for tomorrow.\"  Zwei mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, we'll play a lot of games together.\" Ruby gushed, Zwei blushed and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of games?\"  He purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The non sexual ones, we promised Yang we'd keep the public affection to a minimum remember?\"  She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, anyways night Ruby.\"  Zwei said and went back to his dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night!\"  She said back as he left, she turned to Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember, be very careful around Blake, I'll do my best to keep her away from you!\"  She told him, Jaune nodded as he laid there.  Ruby went to her bed, and decided to tease Jaune a bit by undressing in front of him, Jaune's eyes were glued to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider this your benefit for being my dog until Monday.\"  She winked at him as Jaune got to see her nude body before she slowly put her pajamas on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruff?\"  Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have done this in front of Zwei, Jealous?\"  Ruby teased, and giggled \"only kidding, this is just for you.\"  Jaune nodded, thinking this might not be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Jaune!\"  She said with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruff!\"  Jaune barked back.

He guessed this was the literal meaning of sleeping in the dog house if you make your girlfriend angry. Though, he wondered if Zwei really wore these clothes a lot. The life felt like it only happened occasionally. Somehow, he managed to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s alarm clock started being and Jaune jumped up in surprise. Being a dog, he had enhanced hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d Ruby called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust you do this so early in the morning?!\u201d Weiss huffed, pulling a pillow over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up, lazy bones!\u201d Ruby told her, pulling at her blankets. \u201cTime to rise and shine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really should be used to this by now,\u2019 Yang said, now normal with her chest and lack of a dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake simple yawned and sat up, stretching. Jaune felt her glare at him for a moment and then got up to get dressed. Suddenly, Jaune was surrounded by four attractive girls getting dressed while he watched. He glanced at Ruby, who winked at him. This was part of the perks of being a dog and Ruby wasn\u2019t going to deny him. After everything they did, Jaune looking at a few naked girls didn\u2019t bother her. She knew he would always come back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for today?\u201d Yang asked Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured we could do some team training and then do something together,\u201d Ruby suggested. \u201cTeam Bonding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to spend time with Jaune?\u201d Blake teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love spending time with Jaune,\u201d Ruby replied. \u201cBut I love spending time with all of you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, sis.\u201d Yang pug her in ab one cracking hug. \u201cLove you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t\u2026 breath!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut remember, limited PDAs or I get involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s scroll beeped and Yang finally let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, Goodwitch wants to see me,\u201d Ruby mused. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do that badly on a homework assignment?\u2019 Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I can recall.\u201d Ruby thought hard. \u201cI\u2019ll see what she wants and meet you all down for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two of them nodded and headed out leaving Jaune and Blake all to themselves.  It was at that point he noticed the remote on the desk, apparently Ruby forgot it.  Maybe if Jaune can grab it, he started barking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet you!\"  Blake hissed, not liking dogs at all for obvious reasons, her eyes not leaving her book.  Jaune wanted to growl but caught himself, he'd have to do it himself.  He found Zwei's body was athletic and nimble, which made sense since Ruby told him he was a combat dog. With maneuverability Jaune reached the remote, grinning triumphantly at his achievement.  But the question was now what?  A few options came to mind as the remote was near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can be true to his word and simply safeguard it until Ruby got back, this will earn him some massive brownie points, he can mess with her a bit and show her not to forget them by hiding it near him then revealing it before she freaks.  She might be mad at him but it'll teach her not to forget the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, he looked at Blake, he can use the remote to become Blake and as far as he knew he'd serve his time, but was it really worth it.  Ruby puts her trust in him several times, and here he was about to cheat out of his word, and if Ruby found out she might give him a new punishment, besides she promised to do a swap later as compensation.  With deep thought he made his decision.</span></div></div>",

It was a dangerous item that had already proven in the wrong hands could be trouble. Ruby almost got stuck in Adrian without Jaune knowing and Weiss and Zwei had swapped without them knowing. If one of her teammates accidentally found the remote, there would be a lot of questions. Jaune took the remote in his mouth and hid it in the room. A place he knew no one would find it without tearing the entire room apart. Jaune then went and hopped on Weiss\u2019s bed to lie down and watch Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was no looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did it go?\u201d She murmured, moving a stack of books. \u201cYang better not have taken it.

He couldn\u2019t just tell her, so he figured he might as well help. Leaping off the bed, he walked over to the bed and barked once to draw Blake\u2019s attention. She spun around and glared t him, but then he pointed with his body like dogs do to under her bed. Blake frowned in confusion and then looked at the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is!\u201d She grabbed it and looked at the cover, before looking back at Jaune, who just sat there and tried not to be intimidating. \u201cUmm\u2026 thank you?\u201d Blake was hesitant to thank him and then hopped back on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune figured he probably shouldn\u2019t push his luck, but maybe he could help Blake with her fear of dogs?<br>\r\n\u2003<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At last, he found his target, Velvet and Coco. They were outside, on a bench, watching the sunset. They were also along, which was important. Jaune pulled out the remote slightly from the pocket of his dress and aimed. He thought about which girl to swap with. Velvet was really nice and attentive, but if even after this swap, things were considered weird, she might not do anything. Coco on the other hand would do whatever she wanted. Jaune decided to really see what happens in a short time period, he aimed at Velvet and swapped Romantic Relationships, which would put him with Coco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash and nothing seemed different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Jaune looked closer. Coco and Velvet weren\u2019t snuggling together, but simply talking. Jaune hid the remote in his dress and walked toward them. Velvet noticed her first and stood up.

The cages are big enough to let them fly, but the trees and decoration are small. Not sure how they would hold with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe take on some of the aspects of the life,\u201d Ruby reminded him. \u201cBut I see your point. So what? The larger ones like eagles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually thinking we could have fun with a specific one,\u201d Jaune suggested. They stopped at the tropical birds and he pointed to the parrots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy these?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParrots can talk a little\u2026 well, they really just repeat noises.\u201d Jaune explained. \u201cIf we turn into them, we can mess with our friends as they walk by.\u201d Ruby giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we could say thing they didn\u2019t say?\u201d Ruby asked. Jaune nodded and she giggled again. \u201cThat sounds fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus the habitat is a little bigger, so we won\u2019t feel so squished.\u201d Jaune added. \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t know exactly what all we get from the swap. Remember the Nevermore? It could still fly without wings. So many swapping with a bird allows us to fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be cool,\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cEven if limit space, the cage is big enough to try it out. I like your idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet.\u201d The two of them waited until their friends had their back turned before they swapped with two parrots. They even used the helpful signs out front to determine which was male and which was female for them. The next second, they found themselves behind the cage, sitting on a tree branch. Normally, their weight should have broken the branch, but it seemed to be supporting them without problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne test completed already.\u201d Jaune said. tapping the tree branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do we do first?\u201d Ruby asked. \u201cPeople tend to spend time here trying to spot all the types of birds, so I\u2019m sure Weiss won\u2019t leave until she does. Do we see what bird powers we kept, mess with our friends, or have some more fun time together?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something welled up within him and he let out another howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s eyes glazed over and her intensity increased as all the other wolves raised their heads and howled too. Jaune didn\u2019t even realize until he felt a couple of them licking him. Ruby was already partially lost in the pleasure. The howl might have pushed her to far.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was like his body had a mind of its own. Another wolf was licking Ruby\u2019s crotch, which was obviously soaked from arousal, her reddening face was a sign of it. There were three other wolves, all licking Jaune, trying to get his attention. Jaune felt his control over his body wane and he shot his load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit Ruby and the wolf next to her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither seemed to mind and Ruby turned around, presenting her butt to him. The other wolf did the same thing. As much as Jaune knew that doing it with an animal was wrong, it was like the raw meat. It felt right and his body told him it would feel amazing. Breaking away, he aimed himself at Ruby and stuck his dick inside of her ass. She gasped in happiness and began to press herself against him. It seemed like it didn\u2019t matter which hole, as long as it went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal for the Alpha to have to impregnate several mates at once,\u201d the zookeeper explained to the onlookers. \u201cIt\u2019s also how we keep a vibrant population.

Weirdly enough, he wasn\u2019t even telling his body to move. It was slamming into Ruby all on it\u2019s own.

One of the wolves licked her face clean of his cum. \u201cThis is\u2026 woah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jerked as one of the wolves began to lick his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown girl.\u201d He tried to snarl, but due to his situation, the wolf didn\u2019t seem intimidated. \u201cFuck\u2026 what do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruby felt her mind grow dull and so did Jaune.

Her hips were swaying to the enchanting song and her hands were rubbing up and down her body. Jaune was next to her and doing something similar. Though his manhood was bouncing around since it was still at full mast. Ruby knew something was wrong, but couldn\u2019t think straight. When Weiss and Pyrrha glanced into the cage, she grew hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the music stopped and Ruby\u2019s brain began to work again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe music!\u201d She told Jaune. \u201cIt's making us dance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwap back, fast.\u201d Jaune advised and she did just that.

Jaune had been to busy examining them to respond. He landed on his back while the two of them were on top of him. Ruby spun around on top of him and pressed her butt into his face as she began to lap at his dick. While he couldn\u2019t see anything, he felt another tongue lapping at it. Damn it felt too good and he distracted himself by eating out Ruby. Trying not to think about what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure did become too much for him and he felt himself release. There were some noises from Ruby and the leopard and she finally got off him. Both of them had cum on their faces when Jaune sat up. Tongues were licking as much off themselves as they could. When Jaune managed to get up on his knees, both of them turned around and presented themselves. Jaune stared as his girlfriend took a submissive pose right next to a leopard doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune felt himself growing hot. Animal and human hormones were flaring up and while some contradicted each other, others were joining forces. Logic told him no. Reason told him to stop being a baby. His eyes kept darting back and forth to both of them. His reasoning was clouding up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This one was a fenced in area, with all different heights of grass. There were some trees for shadow, rocks halfway buried in the ground, and bushes to hide behind. There was a building designed to look like a cave for the kangaroos to sleep and hide from people. There were maybe around a dozen kangaroos in the enclose they could see. Several of them had babies in their pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww.\u201d The girl cried, getting as close to the fence as they could to look in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune looked around at the choices. The perfect revenge would be to have Ruby the baby kangaroo in the pouch of the mother, which he would swap with. The problem was, how would that work if it was a life swap? They kept their bodies, or at least saw each other that way, while everyone else would see them as animals. It was something he would have to try to know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA safer bet would be to have Ruby swap with a young kangaroo hopping around and Jaune would target one of the parents. That would be similar to the pandas, but he wasn\u2019t sure how much kangaroos cared for their young after they left the pouch. For all he knew, they were on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other options he guessed. Looking at himself, he was still spotted and Ruby was still stripped.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seems in the past some kids tried to sneak into the animal enclosures. Like anyone would do that. Excluding those with reality altering remote. The crowd was beginning to thin and they were being ushered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like it\u2019s time to go,\u201d Ruby huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnimals need their peace and quiet too.\u201d Pyrrha told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was quite relaxing,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI might have to do some extra training tomorrow to make up for this day off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinus Blake trying to stage a rally.\u201d Yang joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI misjudged them, I admit.\u201d Blake muttered. \u201cThe zoo here is quite nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018We could still party somewhere else.\u201d Nora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora\u2026 how much ice cream did you sneak when I wasn\u2019t looking?\u201d Ren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone\u2026 some\u2026 a gallon\u2026\u201d Nora shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we have to give everyone their body back,\u201d Ruby said and Jaune held out the remote so she could touch it. One Reset Button later, everyone was back in their own body. \u201cYou going to miss my sexy leopard body?\u201d She asked Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little, I think you were more flexible.\u201d Ruby hit him. \u201cSorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better be.\u201d She huffed. Her eyes continued to dart around to the animals as they passed. \u201cMaybe I want to take a body home with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was the same way, but his eyes fell on the wolf enclosure. The male wolf was standing on the large rock in the middle of the habitat. The Alpha that caused some problems for them. He couldn\u2019t resist on testing out if he could. The Alpha Presence that captivated the female wolves and Ruby, would that work as a human? Is it even possible for something so intangible? It might not even work, as it could be a combination of many things. Still, the temptation was too high, especially after all the flirting Ruby did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a quick flash of light and Jaune didn\u2019t feel any different. Best bet was to wait to test it out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But that was then, for now they all headed back to Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changed your mind?\"  Jaune asked about the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I figured I want to be myself for a bit, get you to appreciate me better.\"  Ruby glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was joking you know, I love you for you.\"  Jaune told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just making sure.\"  Ruby smirked, \"I want my sexy body imprinted on your brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it is!\"  Jaune admitted, she smirked at that and hugged him, snuggling closer to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem different for some reason!\"  Ruby told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I, I don't look that different.\"  Jaune said trying to avert her suspicion if any, he didn't want the fun to end quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't quite put my finger on it.\"  Ruby hummed, \"for some reason you're way more handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now  I'm always handsome!\"  Jaune defended, that was probably pay back for his jab earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant, there's just an aura of power about you know.\"  Ruby said, \"it's really attractive.\"  Jaune inwardly smirked at that, while that didn't necessarily meant it worked as Ruby is his girlfriend it was a good sign, now to see if it'll work in Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival they all were dead tired, but he did noticed the girls were eyeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know about you but I want to relax and dry off.\"  Weiss said, seeing Jaune and a blush forming on her face.  She never noticed how Jaune was attractive before, Blake was the same way and Yang came by and gave him a pat on the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to hand it to you, I can see why my sister digs you.\" Yang chuckled, Ruby shot her a glare.  Pyrrha was once more eyeing Jaune hungrily, she promised herself she'd be over him but for some reason her previous affections to him came back in fold.  She came up to him and pecked him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, had to get that out of my system.\"  Pyrrha told him with a blush, \"I wanted to do that for so long and I figured by doing it I won't be tempted to do more.\"  Even Nora was eyeing him but with Ren nearby she didn't try anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" Nora said, uncertain who she wants to be with more.  Ren thankfully didn't notice anything and nodded as they left.  Jaune didn't like causing tension but he was certain as long as Nora stayed clear of him it'll be fine.  All the while Ruby glared at them and held him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough out of you!\"  Ruby mentioned as the other girls backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alight let's go do something.\"  Yang excused, the other girls with blushes left them alone, just like when they were wolves Ruby is his Beta and had the say on whether they joined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what got into them?\"  Jaune feigned innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're beginning to see you as something special, but you're mine, I'll even stay close by to make sure nobody takes you from me.\"  Ruby told him.  His presence also increased Ruby's jealousy ten fold, he could have fun with this.</span></div></div>",

Glad someone did, or I would have had to step in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, this is where Velvet would have gotten upset with Coco being so forward, but she was too busy gazing at Jaune, a dull look in her eyes like she was mesmerized.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hungry eyes warned him that was not a good idea and he politely declined. As he wondered around Beacon, he tried to avoid populated areas. The last thing he needed was a crowd of girls chasing him. There was a close call with Team IDGO, but he avoided them. As he ran around the school, he had time to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they undo the swaps, they remembered seeing the swaps and remembering thinking they were normal. However, swaps that were hard to identify, they could miss. If Jaune swapped back, Ruby wouldn\u2019t be sure why he changed. It\u2019s not like she would guess Alpha presence. Probably brush it off as her imagination or hormones. For now, Jaune was interested in seeing what all this swap would do, but he was going to make sure Ruby was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally found her outside, watching the sunset on a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d She asked, turning to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jaune assured her, sitting down next to her. \u201cI was just annoyed at the situation. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone is now realizing how special you are,\u201d Ruby said, leaning against him. \u201cI\u2019m happy they finally understand, but now they want to take you away from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Jaune said, putting his arm around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost guys would trade up for someone like Cinder or Coco.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t trade up the perfect girl for me.\u201d Jaune remarked and Ruby\u2019s face burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 that\u2026 arg!\u201d Ruby buried her face in his chest. \u201cHow do I respond to that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith a kiss and a smile?\u201d Jaune suggested. Ruby looked up and smiled, before kissing him. \u201cOut of order, but I like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoof.\u201d Ruby giggled. \u201cSo what happened after we split? You\u2019re still in training clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny found me and we talked,\u201d Jaune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny?\u201d Ruby looked surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 wow. She\u2019s not the most socially aware person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPot calling kettle?\u201d Jaune teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I did learn her secret,\u201d Jaune said. \u201cI can tell why you wanted her to say it and not you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Ruby\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou accept her, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. It didn\u2019t change the weird sweet girl she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby sighed in relief and cuddled against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough she admitted I was dating material,\u201d Jaune remarked. \u201cI think she might like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026what?!\u201d Ruby stared up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, she felt really worried about that and quickly left as not to hurt you,\u201d Jaune continued. \u201cYou might want to talk to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Ruby jumped to her feet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He needed to learn how to control this presence of his. Alpha wolves in packs displayed dominance and they also used it to let others know when they wanted something, food or sex. So there had to be a way to control it. Right now, it was probably running based on his feelings. Looking at Ruby, he thought about how he could test it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was to see if he could intensify it. Jaune didn\u2019t know what to do, but he sort of willing it, like he did with Aura, toward Ruby. He wanted her to know he was horny. Ruby seemed to stumble and turned around, a glazed look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped into his arms and kissed him, her hands reaching down toward his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s find some place private.\u201d She purred. \u201cI\u2026 need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Penny?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will\u2026 later.\u201d Ruby panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune then tried to calm her down and Ruby\u2019s expression changed from lust to confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d She pushed away. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, people have been acting weird all day and I didn\u2019t mind it from you.\u201d Jaune assured her. \u201cNow, back to finding Penny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah.\u201d Ruby agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jaune tried to suppress his presence and they walked by a bunch of girls. None of them seemed to register him more than normal, well normal before he had his powers, and Ruby wasn\u2019t acting possessive. Jaune began to get an understanding how to relay the presence. Though, he still wasn\u2019t sure if it was hormones or something else he was releasing. He wondered if there was a way he could push Ruby to willing do it with him with another girl. Maybe he could try it at some point.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was the Alpha presence he wielded telling him it was okay. So he was currently fighting a battle between emotions and instinct. If he tried to go one way, the other side kept fighting. He finally reached a compromise. He would do one more time with Ruby and another before giving up his power. This time, he would make sure to say this was a one of event and for everyone not to mention it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he and Ruby walked through Beacon, he realized did he just have to have one more partner? Could he have multiple ones? That was something to try out since this was his last chance. He even made an Arc Promise to himself to swap back after this. Now, he needed to decide who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet and Coco were a good option. They were easily affected by his presence. Plus, both of them were really hot. The downside is that after he swaps back, would Coco just give up? He wasn\u2019t sure how the Undo would work in this situation, since it was just presence and not life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next option was team RWBY. Weiss already expressed interest and Blake and Yang were super models in their own right. Ruby might be okay sharing with her team mates once. The downside was again, what would happen afterwards? Would there be awkwardness in her team? That was something to consider. He might not want to risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should choose a group that would leave after the Vytal Festival? Team NDGO was full of hot girls who seemed nice enough. It\u2019s not like he would ever normally have a shot with girls like that. It would be something to remember and a good way to end his presence. The downsides were just like above.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That left RWBY and NDGO, NDGO didn't have the potential risk of it being awkward but again he didn't know anything about them other than they were good looking, for all he knew they had boyfriends, they certainly have admirers since they were the favourites to win, and he also didn't know how they react.  This left Ruby's team, Yang would be fine with a one nighter guaranteed, Blake will see it as an experience and carry on, Weiss might be a bit problematic but knowing her she'd shrug it off and carry on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only issue again was he might make it awkward, and he had absolutely no idea if the undo swap feature would fix this, but if there's any girls Ruby might be okay with sharing him with it's her team.

It began with a group hug before giving each other knowing looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we're on the topic of cheering up.\"  Weiss began, \"maybe we can do this the fun way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sex time, count me in!\"  Yang chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure why not?\"  Blake added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that idea a lot.\"  Ruby purred, they all looked at one another, Ruby turned to Jaune, \"don't want him to be left out though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we get to see what vomit boy does to you, I'm in, as your sister I need to really see if he's treating you right.\"  Yang said suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me!\"  Blake added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I deserve it after what I did to him.\"  Weiss mentioned, Jaune tuned it up on her, \"but it would be interesting to see what I'm missing out on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You in Jaune?\"  Ruby asked.  This was it, after this there may be no going back and things might change forever and probably not for the better, if this didn't go well nothing would ever be the same again, he had a chance to back out of course and a small part of him was telling him to do that to be safe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s time to show dominance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby heard it and looked at them. Jaune gave her a questioning look and she smiled\u2026 before nodding.

His balls were slapping loudly against her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Yang cheered. \u201cStuff the Ice Queen.

We aren\u2019t sticking his dick in us with your butt debris on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I keep myself clea-\u2026AH!\u201d Weiss suddenly cried out as Jaune pushed his dick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to get going for me to have time to get to everyone,\u201d Jaune said, pushing his dick the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArc\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 oh god! Feels so good.\u201d Weiss buried her face into the pillow as Jaune began to pump in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept up pounding her ass, going faster and faster. Her cries were muffled by the pillow or everyone on the floor would hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, she\u2019s tight.\u201d Jaune grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe always keeps her but clenched so tightly,\u201d Yang laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might cum,\u201d Jaune admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Yang gasped. \u201cHold it in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Weiss caved first and she squirted all over her bed. Jaune took the opportunity to pull out. Weiss collapsed on the bed, panting wildly, not moving. Remembering Yang\u2019s words, he positioned his dick near Weiss\u2019 mouth and she began to suck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d Jaune asked Ruby.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both of them worried about what would happen if Blake had found the remote if this was her inner desire. However, Jaune was an alpha and quickly brushed his surprise aside. Ruby was also considered a beta and second in command. They communicated silently and Jaune had an idea. He gestured for her to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby?\u201d He asked. \u201cHow do you feel about us getting a pet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have Zwei, but he\u2019s more of a family pet,\u201d Ruby considered. \u201cDid you have an idea for one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea.\u201d Jaune said, looking down at Blake continuing to work his shaft with her mouth.

Ruby then swapped places with him and she pushed Blake\u2019s head between hers. There was the sound of Blake lapping away again and Ruby moaning happily. Jaune then moved behind Blake and examined that amazing ass of hers. There was a slight pause in the noise when he touched her, but she quickly continued. Jaune used two fingers and opened up her labia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!\u201d Ruby gasped. \u201cShe just upped her intensity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s excited,\u201d Jaune grinned. \u201cI\u2019m about to do a\u2026 internal diagnostic,\u201d He aimed his dick and slowly pushed it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNyah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked down at the red faced Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid she just\u2026\u201d Weiss trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep and I\u2019m making that my new ringtone.\u201d Yang confirmed, putting down her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cute!\u201d Ruby squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what other noises she can make,\u201d Jaune suggested and began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake moaned and purred as Jaune continued his assault into her womb. Her back kept arcing from the pleasure and Ruby was forced to use her hands to keep Blake\u2019s head down. Jaune didn\u2019t go easy on Blake and really pounded himself into her. He also slapped her ass a couple times, something she seemed to enjoy. She lasted a lot longer than Weiss did, but eventually he felt her tighten around his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Blake! Yes!\u201d Ruby moaned and climaxed herself, spaying Blake in the face. \u201cCan we keep her, Jaune?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Jaune said laughing and pulled out of Blake, who collapsed on the bed. \u201cYou okay with that Blake?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning was awkward for everyone in Team RWBY. They all knew that going down for breakfast would mean meeting Team JNPR, more specifically Jaune. None of them knew why they felt like they had last night, only that they had wanted to. Consensus was the animal in the zoo were hormonal and it got to them being there so long. It was kind of a long shot, but it was all they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go talk with Jaune,\u201d Ruby volunteered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone has to,\u201d Yang sighed. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to be me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably bragging to everyone that Ruby let him play around with other girls,\u2019 Weiss growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Ruby defended him. \u201cHe would keep this a secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Blake said. \u201cLet us know how it went.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt was actually kind of fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Yang and Weiss gaped at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Faunus being more open wasn\u2019t just because we were all strange last night?\u201d Yang cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCya.\u201d Ruby said weakly, sneaking out while her teammates argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually kind of a relief that Blake said that. It made what happened slightly better. At least Blake was okay with it, now to sooth Weiss\u2019 and Yang\u2019s worries. She headed to the cafeteria and saw Jaune eating with his team. They seemed to be almost done, so Ruby waited for them. Observing them, Jaune seemed to be normal, at least he was smiling and laughing. She didn\u2019t have that urge to jump him like last night at least. Pyrrha didn\u2019t seem to be forcing anything, so it looks like he didn\u2019t tell them. When they finished, Ruby grabbed Jaune saying she needed to talk to him privately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune,\u201d Ruby told him once they were alone. \u201cI\u2026 umm\u2026 about last night\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow we all acted crazy?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that!\u201d She frowned. \u201cYou were too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefiantly,\u201d Jaune agreed. \u201cWhat happened there was something I\u2019ll never forget\u2026 but looking back, I wasn\u2019t myself. I felt\u2026 weird and in control. I would never have done something like that normally.\u201d He reached into his pocket. \u201cI meant to give this to you yesterday when we got back, but after Penny\u2026 and your team, I forgot.\u201d He handed her the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Ruby gasped. \u201cI completely forgot about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the thought crossed her mind that Jaune might have done a swap. She felt guilty suspecting him, but that might have caused what happened yesterday. When she put it away, she hit the Reset Button and nothing seemed to happen. Jaune looked like he always did, goofy, tall,, blonde, and her boyfriend. She suddenly felt super guilty suspecting him and vowed to be a better girlfriend in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo, anyways,\u201d Ruby continued. \u201cWe thought all of us had raging hormones because we saw the zoo animals doing those kind of things. Though, some of it was us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe missed the look in his eyes as he realized there was a way out for him. Jaune didn\u2019t know Ruby didn\u2019t suspect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby\u2026\u201d He said slowly. \u201cWhat if when we did all those animal swaps, there was some kind of lag behind with their instincts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Ruby blinked. \u201cLike the remote didn\u2019t swap everything back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have been using it a lot,\u201d Jaune pointed out. \u201cPlus human and animal swaps might have some weird crosswire. Everyone kind of acted like the lions and wolf and leopard. Maybe I had some of those male hormones going on still and it made everyone react weirdly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Ruby\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI can\u2019t tell the others that, but\u2026\u201d She looked at him. \u201cCan you keep what happened last night a secret?\u201d She asked. \u201cI know you only did it because I was okay then, but the rest of my team, mainly Weiss and Yang\u2026 they kind of regret it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune looked immensely guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell a soul and I can understand if they don\u2019t want to see me for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s more out of awkwardness than dislike,\u201d Ruby assured him. \u201cGive them a few days.\u201d She looked at her pocket. \u201cDo you think we should stop swapping? It\u2019s Sunday and no classes until tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a lot of\u2026\u201d Her face flushed. \u201cActivities that revolved around what we did yesterday and while I would love to experience them, I limited my search quota for more casual activities. Dates seem to be the most common way and there is no limits to what they can be. It simply needs to be one where the members of the relationship spend time together and have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense.\u201d Ruby said slowly. \u201cAre\u2026 you okay with a\u2026 group relationship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Penny asked confused. \u201cI get to spend time with my two best friends who accepted me as I am and get to experience new things.\u201d She put a hand over her heart. \u201cI felt happy and even more after our experiences yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Jaune looked each other.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHow about a simple swap at the start?\u201d Ruby suggested. \u201cPersonality is one we haven\u2019t used much, so let\u2019s save that for a little later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sounds so fun,\u201d Penny said, clapping her hands together. \u201cIt\u2019s like an experiment. Shall we go with the Clothes Swap option then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Jaune said. \u201cyou\u2019ll look nice in Coco\u2019s outfit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you to say, Boyfriend Jaune,\u201d Penny told him, beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlirt.\u201d Ruby whispered with no real anger behind it, just amusement. She then turned to address Penny. \u201cI saw Coco and her team in the cafeteria earlier. If we hurry, we might be able to catch them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still not sure what she means by basic, but I am looking forward to trying out new outfits,\u201d Penny said, following Jaune and Ruby. \u201cPerhaps I can understand her remarks better once I experience it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExperience is the key to learning,\u201d Jaune agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them reached the cafeteria and looked in. To their luck, Coco and her team were still there. Coco was even standing up with one leg on the bench. It made her an easy target. Ruby and Jaune reminded Penny which button was witch and let her aim, while they touched the device. Penny was shaking slightly in excitement before hitting the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco was in the same position but was not wearing a white and grey old fashion blouse with short grey overalls. She was also wearing black and green color and stockings. They were clothes she would never have been caught dead in. They were plan and covered everything without being form fitting to show off curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny on the other hand was not dressed as a fashionista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long cocoa colored shirt with dark brown wasit cincher. Matching dark brown trousers covered her legs, held up by a brown belt. Above it, she wore a second cocoa colored belt with cartridges. Dark brown high heeled shoes replaced Penny\u2019s old shoes. She was also wearing sunglasses and a coco colored beret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is beyond belief!\u201d Penny gasped, as they ducked out of the cafeteria. \u201cOur clothes not only swapped, but adjusted to fit each other. No one seemed to notice a thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis remote seems to swap reality and in some cases, other changes occur,\u201d Ruby explained. \u201cReality adjusts to fit the new swap. In this case, it\u2019s only going to be people reacting to the clothes specifically. Everyone will consider it normal, but they will notice them if you point them out. Like they won\u2019t see your old clothes, but the ones you\u2019re wearing.\u201d She rubbed her head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, reason demonstrations work better.\u201d Jaune agreed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several groups of people passed them and they were all possible swap targets, but Ruby and Jaune were looking for something special. Something really to get Penny involved in. They finally found their first opportunity when they passed a group of guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you know the favorites for the Vytal Festival?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam NDGO? The really hot girl one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they are doing a photo shoot today in Vale.

General Ironwood never liked photo shoots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cThe point is to try new things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Penny started to look excited. \u201cLife Swap is where everyone sees us as them, but we would see each other as ourselves, but with their clothes and hair. And we get some information on how to be them, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Ruby confirmed. \u201cNot sure why life keeps the hair, but I have no idea how a reality warping remote works at all anyways. There will be one of them we can't swap with, so it's also a chance for us to try our acting abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want the full experience.\u201d Jaune added. \u201cWe could do Life and Body Swap. That way we would have their bodies too. That would be more for our entertainment, since no one else will notice either way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDibs on the leader!\u201d Ruby said immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it!\u201d Jaune groaned. \u201cI knew I forgot something.\u201d He turned to Penny. \u201cThough, if you aren\u2019t interested, we can do something else.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Team NDGO was outside the Bullheads and surrounded by fans. They finally got close enough to use the remote. One flash later, Ruby was Nebula wearing her grey shirt, light blue coat, bandolier, and grey pants. Penny was now Gwen with an organic body and wearing  black corset dress with a dark gray front, purple hem and purple laces on the back. Jaune was not Octavia and wore a blue waistcoat with two long tails, darker blue crop vest, and cream skirt under an orange open front layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so excited they didn\u2019t consider Team NDGO may have been in the middle of something.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruby and Jaune couldn\u2019t contain the excitement their lives felt. While neither of them really cared about clothes, they found it to be fun anyways. None of them really bought anything, but they had fun looking and holding up outfits for the others to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting a little too involved. Picking the perfect outfit, beginning to say words such as \u2018like\u2019 more often than she should. Her entire persona was changing. It wasn\u2019t until Ruby showed her the remote and she didn\u2019t remember it that they realized how dangerous the situation had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwap back.\u201d Jaune agreed. They had to make sure Penny was touching it before they hit the button. Ruby literally had to force it into Penny\u2019s hand. There was a flash of light and Ruby found herself in the training room with a towel. Her team had been practicing and Nebula, being Ruby, did everything for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to kick butt at the tournament,\u201d Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss didn\u2019t have a single thing to criticize,\u201d Blake acknowledged. \u201cWhich I believe is a first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only point out flaws so you can improve them.\u201d Weiss huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think we all deserve a break.\u201d Ruby declared. \u201cGood work. If we keep this up, first place is as good as ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, here!\u201d Her team agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a quick shower in the locker room, Ruby left to find the others. Jaune eventually stumbled into her and they had to wait another thirty minutes before Penny was able to show up. She had to get away from her escorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny!\u201d Ruby cired and hugged her. \u201cHow are you feleling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling fine now, Ruby.\u201d Penny assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not using girlfriend anymore,\u201d Jaune pointed out a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter being Gwen, I finally understand names don\u2019t always need titles,\u201d Penny explained. \u201cEven though I got absorbed into her life, I still retained some of the information I obtained. Should we do another Life Swap, I will take care not to let that happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets\u2026 avoid the Life Swap for now.\u201d Ruby suggested. \u201cDo smaller simpler swaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about a game?\u201d Jaune suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe random one?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, little different.\u201d Jaune explained. \u201cOne person gets a swap, but the other two decide on the swap. Then we just keep rotating until everyone is completely different. We can stay like that the rest of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds fun.\u201d Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvoid big swaps like Life?\u201d Ruby clarified and Jaune nodded. \u201cOkay, who wants to be the first victum?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They made him wear them before. No\u2026 we need something else. Something awkward for him, yet won\u2019t cause any pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, perhaps something he doesn\u2019t have.\u201d Penny suggested. \u201cLike extra ears or a tail from a Faunus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, that\u2019s not bad, but I think he would enjoy those too much,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cBut that gave me an idea.

The largest though probably belongs to Professor Glynda Goodwitch. She just covers it up with conservative outfits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou come up with the best ideas, Penny.\u201d Ruby said, hugging her. \u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDecided?\u2019 Jaune asked, as Ruby skipped over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, you\u2019re going to get a little extra weight from Goodwitch.\u201d Ruby told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 dang.\u201d Jaune said. A short while later he found two large breasts under his shirt. \u201cYou sure I couldn\u2019t have her bra too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d Ruby told him. \u201cOne swap per turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Penny assured him. \u201cNext round we can get you some new clothes to suit your chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Penny.\u201d Jaune told her. \u201cNow we go back to Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emerald had her duel blades that transformed into guns and Cinder had some dust, though she did have a pair of glass swords. Besides Emerald wearing Jaune\u2019s chest plate, since they swapped tops, she didn\u2019t have any other physical changes. Cinder still looked the same. Jaune, Ruby, and Penny were the ones that were getting used to their new attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny had it the easiest. Her changes were Neon\u2019s hair, Blake\u2019s ears, Coco\u2019s weapon, Cinder\u2019s personality, and Pyrrha\u2019s vagina. None of them really interfered with her fighting. In fact, Blake\u2019s ears actually helped her locate nearby Grimm so she couldn\u2019t get sneaked up on. Her super strength and the purse actually smashed through multiple Grimm before she transformed it into the Gattling gun and mowed down a horde of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby had a little harder time. She kept her weapon sure, but she didn\u2019t have her speed. Instead she had Velvet\u2019s Mimic Semblance. Instead of just race past Grimm and cutting them, she bounced off trees to attack from all different angles. Like what Blake and Weiss did. This was actually beneficial for her. She was leaning to change directions and not be predictable. Once she got used to fighting in Weiss\u2019 heals and Glynda\u2019s outfit. One time, Yang\u2019s hair got in her way and she almost got smacked by a Beowolf, until a bright golden glyph appeared in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing Jaune quickly learned was Weiss\u2019 Glyphs. He had swapped it before, so it was more of just a refresher course. Blake\u2019s hair didn\u2019t bother him too much. He was mostly distracted by Glynda\u2019s bust bouncing around whenever he moved. Emerald\u2019s top didn\u2019t support it nearly as well as her own. There was a size difference to take into account. Then there was Velvet\u2019s weapon box. It was amazing and he copied several weapons. First, he copied Penny and tined the numbers so he could practice more on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to realize why Ruby always kept encouraging him to get a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turned it into Ruby\u2019s weapon and combined slicing a Beowolf while using a glyph to hold it still. He swapped through several weapons, including Yang\u2019s fists, Blake\u2019s swords, Nora\u2019s hammer, and Pyrrha\u2019s spear. While not as efficient as they were, the variety and adaptability of it combined with Weiss\u2019 Semblance did a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fun,\u201d Emerald said, when all the Grimm nearby were just coprses dissolving into smoke. \u201cWe should do it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cinder agreed. \u201cIt was a sensational experience with our new friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease say I\u2019m not that bad.\u201d Penny muttered to Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2026 gotten better.\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cBesides, Ruby and I don\u2019t judge people just on the way they talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like Penny\u2019s old smile broke through at his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough you,\u201d Ruby huffed, pushing him away from Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose two don\u2019t seem nearly as mean as the rumors said,\u201d Cinder whispered to Emerald. \u201cAre you sure they are true, Friend Ruby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Pyrrha had some issues with Cinder,\u201d Emerald admitted. \u201cNot sure why, but they didn\u2019t like each other from the start. Yang mentioned Ruby tends to be a trouble maker and stole a few things growing up.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI think Jaune\u2019s been a good influence on them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe seems like a nice guy,\u201d Cinder said. \u201cHe is my first real boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCinder\u2026\u201d Emerald sighed. \u201cA boy that is a friend is not necessarily a boyfriend\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you both do a good job, I\u2019ll consider rewarding you too.\u201d Her eyes traveled to Jaune. \u201cMake her submit to you like she does to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looked at him, before flipping Yang\u2019s long blond hair out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s the kind of guy to do that.\u201d She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised,\u201d Penny said. \u201cHe just needs some motivation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune thought about it for a moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruby instantly lunged at him, but Jaune was quicker, he rolled over, pinned her arm, and made sure the remote was touching Penny\u2019s leg and Ruby before he hit the Reset Button. There was a flash of light and Ruby and Penny shook their heads. They were all back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you two okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I talked like that!\u201d Ruby cried, hiding her head in her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Penny apologized. \u201cI was getting carried away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d Jaune said, putting a hand on her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d He turned to Ruby. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d he turned back to Penny. \u201cWhat were you planning to do at the end there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was planning to swap our genitals are continue to have sexual intercourse with Ruby,\u201d Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?!\u201d Ruby stammered. \u201cBut I\u2019m saving my first time for Jaune!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad I reset it then.\u201d Jaune sighed. Ruby hugged him and then Penny joined him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Ruby muttered into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, we might have decided to stay like that.\u201d Penny confirmed. \u201cThis remote is powerful\u2026 too powerful. It might be better if we got rid of it. Even if it helped me better understand social interactions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 think that may be the case too.\u201d Ruby said. \u201cThere were too many accidents where we could have been stuck as something and then side affects and that\u2019s not counting if someone bad gets a hold of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s destroy it first thing tomorrow.\u201d Jaune suggested. \u201cBut right now, can we stay a little bit longer? While your new personalities were fun, I kind of prefer the original.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlatterer.\u201d Ruby said blushing and kissed his nose. Penny also kissed him, but on the cheek.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Someone who didn\u2019t see her as Pyrrha the Champion, but Pyrrha Nikos, the person. The silence lengthened and she finally spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora and Yang said I should keep moving forward,\u201d Pyrrha admitted. \u201cThat you and Ruby might not stay together.

To have things like before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat means a lot to me.\u201d Jaune replied. \u201cKnowing we will always be family.\u201d Pyrrha sniffled as he returned the hug. For all he knew, Ruby and Penny might let Pyrrha in.

We would then have to hike the rest of the way up the slope\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA long time, got it.\u201d Jaune interrupted. \u201cWho wants to do the honors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do it.\u201d Ruby said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. But seeing you swing a sword seems more appropriate. Like you\u2019re slaying a dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you do it shirtless?\u201d Penny added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Jaune stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 I remember it from last night and liked it.\u201d Penny said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s learned too much.\u201d Jaune whispered. \u201cThe remote must be destroyed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it shirtless.\u201d Ruby pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune raised the sword above his head, like he was at a chopping block. Shirtless for his girlfriends to drool over. The remote laid on the ground, looking completely normal.

Her eyes kept darting to her friend and, now, crush. The Personal Info Swap had a lot of unforeseeable results. The world adjusted to fit the new information, even herself. Fumbling with an excuse about having to meet her team, she left and slipped back into her own room, grateful it was empty. Ruby sat down on Weiss\u2019s bed and fell backwards, looking at the bottom of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis had gotten complicated. Maybe I should never have messed with Weiss\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBark?\u201d Ruby sat up and saw Zwei, her pet corgi, rubbing her leg. He may not have known what was wrong, but he knew something was. His master was upset and he was trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZwei, you are the sweetest thing ever!\u201d Ruby declared and picked him up. She fell back on the bed clutching him against her chest. \u201cWhat do I do? I might have made things really complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZwei\u2019s response was to tilt his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Ruby continued. \u201cI made my bed and I have to lie in it. Maybe I could use the remote to help out or at least observe?\u201d Zwei covered his face with his paws. \u201cIf I did observe, I would have to swap with someone else. Probably Life Swap because a Body Swap would still have others see me as me. I could swap some Personal Info with someone I guess to make me a stranger to them. Weird stuff happens when I do that though.\u201d She scratched Zwei\u2019s ear and he slumped down on her, content. \u201cSometimes, I\u2019m jealous how easy you have it, Zwei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand scratching his ear froze.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWould that work?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pamphlet on the remote never forbade swaps with animals. It never even mentioned humans. The term it used was target. An animal would be a great target to test the remote on. Ruby could swap with a bird or something and just watch Weiss\u2019s and Jaune\u2019s date. If the opportunity presented itself, she might be able to help or hinder them. She was still conflicted and hoped she would make the right decision for her friends when the time came. This would be risky, but luckily she had a perfect test subject in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat swap does she decide on?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stay.\u201d She held out a hand and Zwei sat, staring at her attentively. A flash of green light went off when Ruby hit the Life Swap button. When the light faded, Ruby found herself on the floor. That wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal, since she had Life Swapped with Weiss already. What freaked her out the most was the draft she suddenly felt over her entire body. She looked down and cried out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was completely naked except for a collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeep!\u201d Ruby squealed, dropping the remote, squatting down, and covering herself. All of her clothes had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBark!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looked up and saw Zwei, sitting up on Weiss\u2019s bed, where Ruby had just been. The sight before her was so odd, she actually forgot she was nude. Zwei was wearing her clothes, which shrunk down to fit his frame. Ruby\u2019s red dress covered his body and her combat boots were covering his back legs. What\u2019s more, like with Weiss, his hair had been switched. Zwei now had slightly longer black hair with red tips, Ruby\u2019s hair. Zwei was also sitting on his butt, with his back legs over the side of the bed, like how a person would sit. Ruby\u2019s mouth fell open as he jumped off the bed. Zwei walked over to her and reached up to pet her head with his paw, before making his way to the door. Before Ruby could try to stop him, he jumped up, turned the handle and disappeared into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Ruby called out, but it was too late. The door shut behind him. \u201cAh!\u201d She remained crouch there, covering herself, as what happened sunk in. \u201cCalm down and think, Ruby.\u201d Her hand moved up to her head and felt the short soft hair she normally associated with Zwei. \u201cThis is what you wanted to test out, right?\u201d She slowly stood up, her face reddening from the embarrassment, arms still covering her precious areas, and looked into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZwei stared back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ruby stated out loud in an attempt to steady her nerves. \u201cYou Life Swapped with Zwei and, as you, he must have thought of something to get out of the situation. He shouldn\u2019t know about the remote though, so it might be him trying to figure out your feelings for Jaune.\u201d She shivered. \u201cI want to be the one to do that. I can\u2019t stay as him for too long. Hopefully, he\u2019s just trying to take his mind off the situation and do some weapon design or something. Yeah, I would do that.\u201d She looked into the mirror again and then down at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t bear to stand there naked and pulled one of the sheets off her bed to cover herself. Out of curiosity, she checked her own dresser and saw all of her clothes still there. The only difference was they were much, much smaller. Everything had shrunk to fit Zwei. She shut the door and looked around. Besides the fact Ruby and Zwei had swapped lives and clothes, everything else seemed exactly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess that makes sense,</i> she thought.<i> It was the same with me and Weiss. Everyone sees us as each other. Since the remote works on animals, it would be really easy to spy on Jaune and Weiss.</i> She looked down at herself. <i>Being naked is going to be tough to put up with and I don\u2019t want to force someone else to be in town. That would just be weird.</i> She laughed at the thought. Her day was already weird enough. Ruby then glanced around for the remote.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She walked up to Ruby and yanked the sheet off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad dog!\u201d Yang admonished, sounding as if she didn't understand anything Ruby said. \u201cYou know these don\u2019t belong to you. I know Ruby lets you bunk with her, but don\u2019t damage the sheets!\u201d She rubbed her face as she threw the sheet back up onto Ruby\u2019s bed. \u201cThat girl baby\u2019s you too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Right, </i>Ruby realized. <i>I\u2019m Zwei right now. She sees me as a dog.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here!\u201d Yang cried out suddenly and pulled Ruby into a hug. This was something she did to Zwei all the time and he liked it. Ruby, on the other hand, did not. Her face was being smashed right into her sister\u2019s breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it! Get off, Yang!\u201d Ruby protests went unheard as Yang scratched her behind the ears. Suddenly, Ruby\u2019s body lost strength and she didn\u2019t want to move as Yang continued. Her leg twitched automatically. For some reason this felt so nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about yelling, Zwei\u201d Yang apologized, still unknowingly scratching her sister behind the ear. \u201cBut you know you can\u2019t play around with our stuff. We brought you chew toys for a reason.\u201d She rubbed her face against Ruby\u2019s. \u201cCome on Zwei, kisses!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby froze for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Kisses\u2019 was a trick she and Yang had taught Zwei .He would immediately begin licking the face of the person holding him. Ruby really didn\u2019t want to lick Yang, though Zwei\u2019s life was telling her too. She settled with a quick peck on Yang\u2019s cheek, hoping she would let her go. It satisfied her current life\u2019s desire too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the sweetest dog ever,\u201d Yang cooed, finally letting Ruby go, who sighed in relief and covered herself again. \u201cSorry I can\u2019t stick around. Need to pick up my scroll.\u201d She grabbed it from her desk and then stopped. \u201cI suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d She headed toward the closet and pulled out a can of dog food. Grabbing the can opener, she smoothly opened it and unloaded the brown mush into Zwei\u2019s bowl. \u201cAs an apology for yelling.\u201d She headed toward the door. \u201cBye, Zwei. Behave yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was so embarrassing,</i> Ruby thought mortified, her face crimson. <i>I need to switch back before someone else comes in. At least I know no one notices me being naked.</i> She flushed even more. \u201cI can\u2019t get use to not wearing clothes,\u201d she muttered. \u201cNow, where\u2019s that remote.\u201d She got down on her hands and knees and looked under the bed. \u201cThere you are! I was worried I might be stuck like this.\u201d Before she could hit the undo button, her eyes traveled to the dog food Yang left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wanting too, she could feel herself beginning to drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet a hold of yourself!\u201d Ruby slapped her checks with her hands and the desire stopped. \u201cHave to watch out for animal instincts.\u201d She hit the undo button and it was followed by a flash of light. The next second, Ruby found herself in a hallway, unsure of what she was going to do.

It will be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ruby said slowly. \u201cJaune worked hard to get her to say yes, we shouldn\u2019t bother them.\u201d <i>Besides, I\u2019m going to spy on them myself in a much better way.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to bother them,\u201d Yang protested. \u201cWe are just going to observe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d Blake replied and set down her book. \u201cWeiss asked me to make sure you didn\u2019t follow her today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraitor!\u201d Yang accused. \u201cWhat happened to being partners!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was very persuasive,\u201d Blake replied, swinging her legs off the side of the bed. Yang\u2019s eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe bribed you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFull set of signed limited edition Ninjas of Love.

You\u2019re too fast for me.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWeiss trusts you though to leave them alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilt stabbed Ruby in the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Weiss didn\u2019t say this. She told Blake to guilt trip Ruby into staying behind. There was a small part of her that thought Ruby would stay back, but she wanted to take precautions. This strategy would have worked if Ruby hadn\u2019t possessed that remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me!\u201d Yang declared and rushed for the door. Blake slipped in front of her and stuck out a foot, causing Yang to trip. She smashed into the wall with a loud thud and fell backwards. Blake stood over her and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me tie you up,\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou may be strong, but I have two years on you in experience.\u201d The age swap was still in effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby glanced out the window to see Weiss and Jaune heading toward the Bullhead. The problem was they were surrounded by other students, some Beacon and the rest from the other schools. She had never aimed the remote from this far away and there was a good possibility someone else would be hit. She had to do a Life Swap option fast though, or she would lose them. The reason she decided on this swap was a Body Swap wouldn\u2019t change who others saw her as. She would still be Ruby. Personal Info Swaps were risky, as reality changed to fit the new swap.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a moment for Ruby to readjust to the suddenly relocation as she found herself in the crowd getting onto the Bullheads. Eyes darting around, she quickly located Weiss and Jaune. It took a little bit of work to push against the crowd, but she managed to slip into the same Bullhead. She wasn\u2019t able to sit next to them though. Instead, the seat across from them was open. It was close enough to listen without seeming suspicious. While everyone was buckling up, Ruby glanced at the girl next to her, who was holding up a hand mirror. It was the first glimpse Ruby received of what she looked like to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/topstrongest/images/8/84/Reese.png/revision/latest?cb=20151117230317\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/tops...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was bright green and swept to her right, matching her eyes. Two black facial markings were on her cheeks. Glancing down, Ruby saw the dark purple hooded sweater over a mauve sweater. To finish off her ensemble were black shorts and black shoelaced high top sneakers. The mirror showed what she looked like to others, but she was sure her body looked weird with the green hair. The girl gave off a punk skater girl vibe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Doesn\u2019t matter,</i> Ruby thought. <i>It\u2019s not going to affect anything how I look. Whoever this girl is, she likes to dress this way.</i> She could have dug through her new belongings to find an ID, but it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. There were more important things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike listen to the people talking in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026afterwards I thought we could check out the festival stalls for an hour or two until the movie started,\u201d Jaune explained. \u201cThen, depending on how you feel, we could get dinner or head back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems you put some thought into this,\u201d Weiss huffed, though she sounded slightly less irritated then before. \u201cI do appreciate it, but you understand we have nothing in common.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Jaune protested. \u201cMy mother always told me dates were to get to know someone before any serious commitment. We might find something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI seriously doubt it,\u201d Weiss replied and then raised an eyebrow. \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t depleting your bank account for this long shot. I would feel bad if you had to live on scraps for the next month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee,\u201d Jaune said proudly. \u201cThere\u2019s something we have in common. Neither of us want to be a burden to others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He\u2019s actually doing pretty well,</i> Ruby thought impressed. Her stomach turned slightly as the thought, but not as bad as it did before. The girl whose life she occupied wasn\u2019t into Jaune and dulled the feelings slightly. Jaune also didn't seem to be having his normal motion sickness issues this time, so he probably took some medicine before hand. That was smart on his part. He was really trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was more along the lines that if Ruby found out, I would never hear the end of it,\u201d Weiss refuted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good job at ruining the mood, Weiss.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jaune reassured her. \u201cI have some money saved up for this sort of thing. I asked you out, so let me make an impression. Show you I\u2019m serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you must,\u201d Weiss sighed, seeming to accept this date was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss didn\u2019t hate Jaune, she even admitted that. It was more of his persistence in asking her out, along with the weird ways he tried that irritated her. The serenade still caused her to burn with embarrassment. As Ruby listened, she noticed Jaune was mainly trying to get Weiss involved in conversation, rather than trying to push into something more romantic. He was honestly trying to get to know her and let her see a different side of him. It was working because as the time passed, Weiss\u2019s replies became a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Bullhead landed and everyone departed, Ruby had to hurry to keep up with her targets. She didn\u2019t have super speed anymore and, with the Vytal Festival in town, things were getting crowded on the weekends. The most she could do was keep Jaune and Weiss in sight, unable to get close enough to hear them. An issue came up when they arrived at the caf\u00e9 Jaune had a reservation at. It wasn\u2019t the classiest place in Vale, as there was no doubt on Ruby\u2019s mind he couldn\u2019t afford those places, but it was rather nice. Weiss might have come here for a quiet casual dining experience. Well, casual for her. The place was upper middle close for most people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looked down at her clothes. The life she currently inhabited would normally never be found here. Her instincts were sending out warning bells. She could go ahead and try to get in if she wanted to, though it would stand out and probably fail. Another option was to switch with someone already inside, like an employee or a customer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jaune and Weiss eventually were seated and now Ruby knew where to target. There were two possible options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a single guy in the corner of the room reading a book. He had red hair that came down over his right eye, with a complete undercut. His outfit consisted of a white sleeveless shirt and light gray pants. A red coat was draped over his chair.

Normally, she wouldn\u2019t have reacted to that name, but the life she was living did. Before Ruby had a chance to even think, instinct took over and she turned around. A fierce girl with a dark complexion, platinum blonde hair and olive green eyes stood before her. She was wearing a yellow robe with only one wide, loose fitting sleeve over a black tube top. She also has black pants and shoes and a red sash embroidered with a white \"endless knot\" on it. Bandages wrapped parts of both her arms.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/a/a7/Vol3_Arslan_ProfilePic.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025184959\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/rwb...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just\u2026\u201d Ruby trailed off trying to think of an excuse. The life she was living was also in the same boat. It must be a normal occurrence for her to wander off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking around and got distracted.\u201d The girl rolled her eyes and grabbed Ruby\u2019s sleeve. \u201cCome on, your weapon is ready. How you jammed it that badly is beyond me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s eyes started sparkling at her words, wondering what kind of amazing weapon the girl, Reese, who she was currently occupying the life of, had. Memories Ruby was sure wasn\u2019t hers suddenly flash through her mind like she was watching a TV show.  She saw herself riding the coolest thing ever, a green hoverboard. It could be thrown, used to smash enemies, and even split apart into two pistols for range attacks. It wasn\u2019t as impressive as her scythe, but she would still love to examine it up close and personal. The reason it broke was Reese had been trying to see how high she could go off a ramp and caused some damage on the landing. The only reason Reese hadn\u2019t repaired it herself was timing issues with them arriving in Vale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had lied to her team leader, the girl in front of her, how it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby instinctively knew Arslan was her name thanks to the remote\u2019s power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to make sure it\u2019s fully functional,\u201d Arslan continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t have your weapon malfunction during the tournament.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI totally get it,\u201d Ruby agreed surprised at her language. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Arslan. I heard that guy was top notch. He\u2019ll fix it up, no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Arslan agreed, beginning to drag Ruby. She was way stronger than her. \u201cLast thing we need is it jamming in the middle of a match. You are still going to test it out and make sure it is working perfectly. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby suddenly remembered why she was here. Her initial excitement at being able to test out a new weapon pushed Jaune's and Weiss\u2019s date from her mind. Of course, that was the reason she was even out here in the first place. She knew she really shouldn\u2019t have been spying on them in the first place. Checking out Reese\u2019s weapon was a good excuse to abandon her mission. If she wanted to keep spying, she would either have to get Arslan off her back or swap to someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger reached into her pocket for the remote.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reese\u2019s life didn\u2019t know anything about Jaune or Weiss and wouldn\u2019t be attached to them. Another factor was probably that Ruby didn\u2019t get a chance to try out other people\u2019s weapons as much as she liked. Either way, Ruby decided to forgo spying on her friends. Checking out a new weapon was her new priority. She still planned to learn what the end result of the date was though. It could just wait a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Arslan made their way through Vale. Arslan was leading the way, but Ruby found her feet moving with her in step. Reese had been here before so Ruby just let her life lead. It didn\u2019t take long for Ruby to figure out where they were heading. An old man owned a small weapon\u2019s shop off the main street. She had been there plenty of times to pick up parts. While she liked to make her own weapons and never had to wait for repairs, rumors had it he did good work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re here,\u201d the man welcomed them after they walked in. \u201cI remember you. That skateboard of yours took quite a beating, but it\u2019s as good as new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeating?\u201d Arslan eyed Ruby. \u201cYou told me it was just a jam, Reese.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d Ruby didn\u2019t need any help acting as she rubbed the back of her neck sheepishly. Arslan sighed as Ruby handed over the credits for the repairs and took it out back to test it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t overdo it,\u201d Arslan ordered. \u201cJust run through the basic motions and make sure there\u2019s nothing unusual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!\u201d Ruby called over her shoulder, as she turned the hoverboard on and set it down. It floated about a foot off the ground and excitement overtook her. She hoped on the board and it barely wavered under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe controls were pretty simple. Well, in theory. Her feet\u2019s positioning determined how the board moved. Normally, it would take a long time to master a sensitive piece of equipment like this, but Ruby had Reese\u2019s life guiding her. Moving on instinct alone, Ruby took off. Shifting her positon slightly, the board veered to the right, nearly throwing her off. It was only thanks to her body\u2019s center of gravity adjusting automatically. She kicked her back leg and the board blasted upwards. Ruby grinned and reached down. The board broke into two halves as she started to fall. After checking the shifting into the guns, she slipped the pieces back together below her. The second her feat landed on the sensors, the hoverboard roared back to life and she swerved away before hitting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 is\u2026 awesome!\u201d Ruby cried out. Having a weapon was one thing. A weapon that doubled as transport? That was another thing entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything working then?\u201d Arslan called back, as Ruby zipped over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like brand new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s head back to Beacon. We need to hammer out some team strategies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese\u2019s life and Ruby both didn\u2019t want that. Of course, Ruby could go along with her and play around with the hoverboard. It\u2019s not like one of those come along every day. This experience also gave her an idea on examining other people\u2019s weapons. Most hunters and huntresses didn\u2019t like other people using their specially designed equipment. With the remote, she could spend days just trying them out. Then there was the fact she was out in Vale and could find something else to do. She would just have to use the remote to get away from Arslan.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, this was a normal appearance to the others around her that gave Ruby time to think. She really didn\u2019t want to mess with Weiss\u2019s life. At most, she had just been planning to see what it was like and learn a few things about her best friend and partner. Now, she was getting involved in something that should have been private. Stealthily reaching her hand into her hidden pocket for the remote, Ruby aimed the remote at the one other person in the room she could see without turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of green light and Ruby found herself laying on a bed, a book in her hand. Her eyes flickered upwards to where she had been to see Blake standing in front of Jaune. Her hand was on her hip, expression one of annoyance, and was dressed in Weiss\u2019s white dress along with her signature white hair tied into a ponytail. Ruby\u2019s heart then stopped for a moment as she saw Blake\u2019s black cat ears on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no! </i>Ruby thought, raising her hand up to feel the black bow on her head. She didn\u2019t get a chance to react as Blake started speaking to Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what makes you think I will change my mind after all your other pitiful attempts?\u201d Blake demanded at Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I thought you might finally give me a chance if I planned everything out?\u201d Jaune admitted hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought wrong.\u201d Blake slammed the door in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Right, she\u2019s living as Weiss so everyone doesn\u2019t notice her ears,</i> Ruby sighed in relief. <i>That means I need to remember to keep the bow on since I\u2019m Blake now.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cYou could have been nicer,\u201d Weiss said, noticeably upset. Her arms were crossed and she was looking direct at Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tired being nice and just saying no,\u201d Blake huffed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get the message. Maybe now he will stop badgering me for a date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could at least give him a chance,\u201d Weiss huffed and Ruby had to try very hard to hold back her laughter while staring straight ahead at the book. This was hilarious watching Weiss, who was in Ruby\u2019s life, try to get Blake, who was in Weiss\u2019s life, to give Jaune a shot. \u201cOr at least explain to him nicely why you won\u2019t go out with him. There\u2019s no reason to insult my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Blake relented. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get the message and tries again, I\u2019ll sit him down and lay out in detail why we will never happen. Happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 guess?\u201d Weiss answered. \u201cJust\u2026 don\u2019t be mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m never mean,\u201d Blake scoffed and Ruby couldn\u2019t hold back her own laughter completely. \u201cIs something amusing you, Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Ruby replied, focusing all her attention on her book. Blake usually tried to ignore the rest of the team\u2019s shenanigans and usually just commented once in a while. This lifestyle was perfect for Ruby right now, who just wanted to stay out of the way and watch the swaps in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should go see if Jaune\u2019s okay,\u201d Weiss stated and started for the door, only to have Blake rab her by her cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d Blake said quickly. \u201cYou have to finish your work first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been studying forever,\u201d Weiss whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even an hour,\u201d Blake corrected her. \u201cWe are going to meet with Yang soon, right? Study until then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, slave driver.\u201d Weiss muttered, under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not,\u201d Blake huffed indignantly. \u201cYou need to pass your classes. How would you like it if you get held back? Yang\u2019s even doing better than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s stomach sunk at that. This was technically true. Besides classes relating to weapons or engineering, she was slowly falling behind the others. It would take some dedication to raise her grades. Even though she always complained, she really did appreciate Weiss taking time out to help her. Anytime she had a problem, Weiss would coach her through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were settling down as Weiss started studying in Ruby\u2019s place while Blake was writing something down at Weiss\u2019s desk. Ruby didn\u2019t move from Blake\u2019s bed and began to examine herself. Blake was in her school uniform, not having changed out of it yet. It was exactly the same as Ruby\u2019s except Ruby wore black stockings and her red cape. Blake only wore a bow to cover her ears. As the silence lengthened Ruby\u2019s thoughts turned back to the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could stay in Blake\u2019s life and see how things differed from her perspective. Blake was relatively secretive and Ruby could use this time to learn more about her teammate. Of course, since three-fourths of her team had been swapped, it would be rude to not include Yang. Having Yang, one of the more outgoing members of their team acting like Blake would be fun to watch. Of course, there were other swaps available to her and she didn\u2019t have to limit herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not at all.\" Ruby responded back.

There was no way she was going to turn around for no reason and see what was about to happen to her and her knowledge.

All there are is just political and historical issues that just gives boring points on what we have in our society today and what builds on it.\" Weiss said sounding more like Ruby when she was studying then herself. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss, I know you may not like studying, but you will hopefully need it someday in the near future when you are running your family business.\" Ruby said sounding more like Weiss instead of herself.

Revenge was sweet like cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess your right Ruby but it is just so hard, do you think we can take a breather and do something else like, train for the upcoming Vytal festival in a few months or just do something else that just gets our mind off of work and studying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems the instructions were right. Some Personal Information Swaps change more than just the specific attribute. Because Weiss was no longer smart, she wanted to do other stuff over studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Weiss, but studying and knowledge comes first, then we can relax and do something fun later.\u201d Ruby replied still sounding more like Weiss every minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh.\" Weiss said. \"But it is so booooring, Ruby.

Might be funny to see Yang acting smart like Weiss. Though, keeping Weiss\u2019 intelligence doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of a sudden, Weiss returns from talking with professor good witch on what she would need to inprove on for the vytal festival coming up soon. Ruby at this time, has the remote in her hand covered by the comic book she is ready. \"Hey Weiss\", \"how did  it go with  professor good witch\". \"It went very well, ruby\". Weiss said. After saying that Weiss decided that she was going to study for an upcoming exam in Grimm studies.

Ruby said to herself while holding the remote in her right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looks down from her comic book and without any hesitation, aims the remote at a back turned Weiss that is currently sitting at her desk with her Grimm studies book out on the correct page and pushes the personality swap button on the remote and a green beam shoots strait toward Weiss who is clauses unknown to the situation.

Ruby was the first to notice this, and all of a sudden, had the egre to either wear  Weiss clothes, or study really hard the upcoming exam. Weiss in the other hand was completely different, she was more egre to wear ruby's clothes or goof around and either work on mods for myrtenaster or read a comic book instead. Ruby said, \"woah, this is kinda freaky having Weiss knowledge, yet satisfying\". \"Omg, I'm like totally smart now, I can finally do well on the exam now.\" \"I need to study, but first, I think a change up is in order\". While getting off her bed, she walks  over to Weiss wardrobe closet and opens it up. She notices that Weiss has spare clothes of everything from her white snowy dress, to her white dress as a secondary. Ruby deciding that since she has Weiss personality that she wouldn't have a problem with swapping clothes with Weiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby grabbing Weiss spare snowy white outfit and spare heels and walks into the bathroom to change into her new attire. While this was going on, Weiss on the other hand decided to do the  same thing to what ruby said before and goes to ruby wardrobe closet and pulls out a spare of Ruby's black outfit with matching hoodie and spare heel boots and decides to change in the room since no one else was there and because the bathroom was preoccupied by ruby. After both ruby and Weiss swap into their new attire, ruby walked out of the bathroom and notice Weiss standing there in a new attire. \" hey there  dolt, watchable trying to do, study. Weiss in reply says, \"yes\". I have been trying, but haven't been able to get the basics down for the upcoming exam this week\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby in reply say's, \"well lucky for you, I can help you out with that.

Ruby while walking behind  Weiss overheard the conversation she was telling her fellow Teammate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby still remembered the plan she came up with, decides to do the swap now. While they were heading to Grimm studies class, Ruby pulled out the remote and pointed it at a back turned Weiss that was causiously Unknown to what was going to happen to her, pushed the brain swap button and a green bean shots out and hits an impact on Weiss's turned back. Once the green bean had collided with both Weiss and Ruby,their brains came popping out if their heads and trade places with one another.

After the switch, we see both team rwby and team Jnpr go into grins studies to take the exam that was on this day. After a couple of hours, everyone including team RWBY and team Jnpr had just finished taking the first exam of the semester. Ruby felt great, not only did she get a one hundred on her first test exam, but she also felt great. \" I'm so glad to be a Gineus\". Ruby said. We can also see Weiss with a nurvous look on her face.

Weiss takes her index finger and places it in the center of her white spandex shorts and pulls the waist forward, to see how far it can stretch, and to also see her new pair of panties which belong to Blake. \u201cHuh, I feel kinda strange right now, yet I also feel satisfaction as well.\u201d She said with a big smile on her face.

After the training was completed for the day, team RWBY decided to head back to their dorm room to either study or relax and chill. Once they made it back, ruby decided that it was time for the trick. She calls her teammates and her sister into a group circle while being five inches apart from one another. \"Alright  team RWBY, I need to ask you all a favor, I need you all to close your eyes, I have a very special treat to give you all.\" \"Is it a cookie ruby?\" Weiss said. \"No\". Ruby said. \"It's something that is going to blow all your minds away.\" Ruby said. \"I hope your are right, little sis\", I don't want to get mind control or anything\". Yang said, trying to think of a good pun to say but to no avail. \"Yang\", this is serious\". Ruby said. \"What sort of surprises is it ruby?\" Blake said. \"All you will know it sooner or later Blake, only sooner or later.\" Ruby said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they all agreed to this, the rest of team RWBY closes their eyes and ruby pulls out the remote and aims it at her older sister and her other two teammates. She comes up with the trick she wants to use. \"I think another personality swap is in order\". Ruby said with confidence in her mind. \"She decides to swap all their personalities at a time. She decides to start with swapping yang and Weiss personality first.\"I wonder how yang would react to being a smarty pants for once, while Weiss tries to come up with the worst  bad puns.\"  Ruby said. By pushing the personality swap button on yang and Weiss, a light blue beam shoots straight toward both of them, and a light blue smoke covered them both for a second. After the smoke had cleared away, ruby can tell that Weiss and yang are feeling different somehow, they just don't know it yet. After a few seconds of quietness, ruby decides to ask her sister a question. \"Hey yang, are you feeling alright.\" Ruby said. Yang said, I'm not sure why but i have the certain erge to either study real hard for this upcoming exam for Grimm studies or go online and shop for clothes.\" She said. While that was going on, ruby notice Weiss is doing some sit ups and push ups to gain extra mussels. \"Uhh Weiss, you feeling okay.\" Ruby said. \"Ah ruby, I'm feeling just fine, just trying to stay in shape for our next mission.\" Weiss said. Woah, I actually swap Weiss and yang's personality's, and they don't even know how it happen.\" Ruby said in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, she decided that Blake was the only one still left who hasn't gotten her personality swap yet. With her eyes still close, ruby aims the remote at Blake and swap's her personality with Blake. With a blue smoke covering both of them, it fades away in an instant. Ruby was the first to notice the swap. \"Woah, this feels kinda weird having Blake's personality. But will be kinda fun to know what Blake does in her spare time.\" Ruby said. All Ruby  feels right now is to  either read a romance literature in a quiet place, or just relax and take a nap. While Blake on the other hand just either wanted to eat cookies, read a comic book, good around with her teammates &amp; team Jnpr, or just work on mods for her weapon, Gambol Shroud. \"Woah, I think I have the sudden erge to goof around with my team or team Jnpr, read a comic book, eat cookies, or do mods on Gambol Shroud. \" Blake said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone's personality's are swap, Ruby tries to think of another idea in her head on what she should do with the remote. \"Should I tell my team about the remote?\" Or should I just keep it a secret and redo everything?\" What should Ruby do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her teacher said. \" oh, I was just walking around the training facility and just happen to stumble along to see that Weiss's sister winter was trying to get directions to the dorms.\" Ruby said. After saying that, winter walks up to the professors desk and didn't notice the swap had accured and see's Ruby standing there. \"Hello there, you must be Ruby rose, team leader of Team RWBY and also my younger sister's partner, is that correct.\" Winter said. \" \"of course I am.\" Ruby said.

Once arriving, Ruby opens the door and sees the rest of her team doing noting but either doing homework, reading a fantasy novel, or is doing push ups or sit ups in the room. \" hey guys look who I have here.\" Ruby said. Winter walks in and notice her sister doing homework at her desk and walks over. \" hello Weiss\". Winter said. \"Hello winter\", Weiss said. \"Say winter, have been this tall the last time you were here or have you been that way all our life.\" Weiss said. \" why of course Weiss, how did you not no that I have been this tall this whole time.\" Winter said.

After the green mist soon evaporated, we now see that Ruby has her sisters body, Weiss has Blake's body, (both partners swapped heads with each other.) yang has pyrrha's body, blake has Weiss body, Weiss has her sister's body, Pyrrha has no body at all, and winter has professor goodwitch's body (once more.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looks down at her new preoccupied body that once belonged to her sister and says, \"huh, whoa, I have yang's body, this is so awesome, (with stars in her eyes.)\" \"Not only do I have a sweet bod with a sweet rack, but I am also not a virgin anymore. Wahoo.\" (While not realizing before that she used to have winter's and Blake's body beforehand.) \"why do I have the sudden erge to say bad puns or exercise a lot.\" Ruby said. It was very strange for her to say that. But notice Weiss, her partner who's head is currently on Blake's body has the sudden erge to eat fish, or read a romantic novel, decides to look down at her partners white spandex shorts and swap em with her black spandex shorts  without Weiss noticing. She then pulls out the remote and aims it at her unnoticeable partner still having a chat with her older sister and swap shorts with her. Ruby pushes the wardrobe swap button and a purple lasor comes out of the remote and impacts the bottom part of Weiss new body. Once the purple mist has desoloved we now see that Weiss and Ruby swap spandex shorts with one another. Ruby body has still had yang original outfit from top to bottom, but the only thing that seemed different was that yang's lower half has white spandex shorts instead of black, while Weiss preoccupied body has Blake's original<br>\r\nOutfit from top to bottom but  has black spandex shorts instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so amazing, not only do I have yang's body and clothes but I have Blake's white spandex shorts instead of yang's black ones instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything seem to quiet down, winter decides to head back out of her younger sister's dorm room and leave to go and patrol the area around beacon academy. Not noticing anything from the three head swaps she had, she leaves still with professor's goodwitch's body. Pyrrha decided to do the same thing but head back to her team's dorm<br>\r\nJust across the hall from team rwby's dorm. But without a body, so she is just a head floating in mid air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwords, Ruby decides to tell her team about the remote and what it does. After explaining everything, Weiss say this, \"Ruby, you absolute dult, why do I have Blake's body but yang's spandex shorts and yang, Blake, and you have different bodies as well?\" Well, because I wanted to see what it is like to have someone else's' body and their aurora.\" Ruby said. \"You are going to fix this now.\" Weiss yelled at Ruby. \"But I don't want to.\" Ruby said. \"Fine, I will do it. Weiss said taking the remote and reading the paper that has instructions on how to use the remote. After reading the instructions, Weiss found the redo button and resets everything back to normal.

While sneaking quitely over to yang's side of the room, Ruby pulls out the remote, aims and pushes the head swap button. One activated, a green mist covers both sister's  bodies. Once the green mist had evaporated into midair, we now see a close up view of ruby's face, with a questionable look on her face while her right eyebrow is arching above her forehead. \"I feel different somehow\", Ruby said. \"Why does my chest feel so heavy? why does my back hurt so much? &amp; why does my vagina feel so big and loose at the same time? Also, why do I have the sudden erge to say bad puns or want to fight people really bad?\" Ruby questioned herself not realizing what it is like to have an adult body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking, her face started to feel itchy, so she decides to scratch her face with her hand relefing the itchiness to stop. When she stopped scrating her face, she notice something different about her hand, it wasn't her normal hand she scratches with, no, it was some else's hand. It was her sister's hand. While trying not to scream, she tippy toes to the bathroom quitely opening and closing  the bathroom door quietly behind her. Once inside the bathroom, she looks herself in the mirror and was able to answer her question  she said before hand. Finding out that she had somehow swap heads with her sister. Looking down at herself, she notice that she felt taller and muscular at the same time. \"So this is what it's like to be an adult, this feel's amazing.\" Ruby said in a quiet voice. \"Huh, look at me, I'm yang, I like to make bad puns and punch stuff.\" Ruby said trying to mimic her older sister.

She wasn\u2019t entirely sure what she wanted to do, but it was probably better for less people to know about the remote. Some people might want to do bad things with it. Ruby left the room and debated what to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had done body and part swap, clothes swap, age swap, and say personality swaps. That left trying out Life Swaps and other Personal Information Swaps. Personal Info Swaps might take some creativity to have fun though, but life seemed pretty interesting. Everyone would see her as someone else. She would keep her body, but not her clothes or personal information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked into a mirror she passed in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang\u2019s face stared back at her. Ruby still had her sister\u2019s body with Velvet\u2019s ears, though the ears were blonde like her hair. She also had swapped ages with Yang, so she was the older sister. Other than that, she was the same. Same red and black clothes, same personality, same name etc. Yet the remote was too tempting not to try.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe she could learn new things to improve herself. There were plenty of Beacon students she didn\u2019t know that well and then there were students form other schools.

The world saw Coco with Yang\u2019s body living Ruby\u2019s life. Ruby shook her head as thinking about all that hurt.

She took a deep breath and suddenly she felt something well up within her. Coco\u2019s personality, or life, or whatever it was told her to do things. It was how she could act like Coco and not draw suspicion to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIT was telling her to take Velvet to Vale and make her try on cute outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby left the bathroom and Velvet smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust had to fix my outfit,\u201d Ruby replied, sounding like Coco with the help of her life.

While Weiss Schnee was the most likely to be disapproving of Ruby's ideas, she was also the one who most needed to loosen up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss jolted up from her seat as Ruby crashed through the door. \"Gah! Ruby! Would it kill you to slow down once in awhile?\" Ruby ignored the heiress' words, knowing it would only end in yet another boring lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about that, you <i>need</i> to look at what I just found.\" Ruby pushed the mysterious remote and its matching pamphlet onto her partner's hands. It only took Weiss a few seconds to scan through the pages and understand just what her partner thought the remote was. Of course, Weiss wasn't having any part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, aren't you a little too old to be playing with toys like this?\" Weiss scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Weiss, I'll admit it does seem a bit impossible, but wouldn't it be so cool if it did work? Besides, how often do you find remotes in the Emerald Forest? It has to do <i>something</i> interesting. Think of the possibilities!\" Ruby exclaimed, her imagination running wild with all the things they could do with the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think I would need such a thing? I may not be perfect, but I'm further along that path than anyone else here.\" Weiss claimed with a flip of her hair. Ruby rolled her eyes at her prideful best friend. The redhead already knew what little things Weiss was self conscious about, even if the ice queen herself loathed to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it can give you Yang's boobs?\" Weiss' shocked, blushing face told her she hit her mark dead on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss quietly, though angrily, contemplated her choices. While she was... lacking in certain assets, there were a few other things that did honestly catch her attention. While she wore her pride on her sleeve, she wouldn't mind leaving the life of a Schnee, if only to truly get away from her father's influence for a bit. There was also the matter of Weiss and Blake's falling out due to their views on Faunus much earlier in the year. While they had made up, there was lingering guilt that makes her believe she could stand to learn a little more and what better way than seeing life from their perspective... Of course, there were also the breasts, but the fact that Ruby had pointed that out so easily made it a sore subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine. We'll test the remote. But let's make this clear, we're doing this to see whether or not this device is dangerous and-\" Weiss' lecture to justify their actions was cut short by Ruby grabbing one end of the remote and placing Weiss' hand on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Weiss. There's no one around to hear you monologue, let's just get it over with already.\" Ruby said impatiently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Don't just go around pressing any of the buttons! I'd rather not be stuck as some Weiss-Ruby hybrid if something breaks. At least pick something trivial to switch.\" Weiss stated, though she was already aware that no matter what her leader picked would lead to awkward shenanigans.</span></div></div>",

When the light resigned, the duo were met with their own faces staring back at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, it actually worked!\" Weiss's voice rang out with uncharacteristic excitement. The now white haired girl sprung to her feet, looking for a mirror to see her new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, why'd you pick that one!?\" Ruby's own body raged against its old owner. While some small part of Weiss wanted to see the remote work, the actual feeling and shock of being in another body as well as seeing someone control her own body sent threw her into a panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see the problem. It's not like we're not ourselves, we just look different.\" Ruby reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're literally in each other's bodies, you dolt! There's no way to violate someone's privacy any more than what we're doing now. We should've eased into it with a clothes swap or something.\" Weiss complained. However, Ruby had already taken to checking out her new body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*squee* This is so cool! Come on Weiss, we've got a magic remote! What could be better?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby moved back and forth in front of the mirror, making odd expressions, messing with her longer hair, and watching her reflection copy her. Despite her initial demeanor, Weiss couldn't help but smile at the sight. Weiss had often seen herself in the mirror, wearing the refined and composed look that was expected of her status and upbringing, but now that same face wore a goofy smile that was could've only belonged to Ruby Rose. Weiss had to hold herself back from laughing at the contrast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you laughing at?\" Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would've inherited some of my elegance along with my body, but you're the same goofball as always.\" Weiss said. \"I don't think I've ever seen myself smile so widely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a compliment. Now get up here. I wanna see what we look like together... I mean we look like each other obviously, but you know what I meant.\" Ruby said, pulling Weiss up from where she sat. Now with both of them together, they could fully appreciate the changes brought on. Weiss had put so much emphasis on swapping bodies that the two nearly forgot the clothes did not follow. While the image in the mirror seemed like the two simply swapped clothes, that image was quickly shattered. Ruby's wild movements and prancing around made it clear who was in control of the ice queen's body while Weiss moved carefully, slowly acclimating to her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised. You look much better than I thought.\" Weiss said. Her words came out slowly, as she finally took in how different it was hearing someone else's voice come out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Wait, were you talking about 'you' as in me or 'you' as in you, because either way it seems kinda narcissistic.\" Ruby reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking about your body in my clothes. It's definitely a different look, but it's not bad. I suppose 'you' you also looks good, but I like to think I know how to dress my body best.\" Weiss claimed, a smug look on her younger face. Ruby looked on in amusement at the pride of a Schnee held within her adorable frame before coming to a troubling realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still taller than me! You're stupid heels still give you the advantage\" Ruby bemoaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's</i> what you're concerned about?\" Weiss asked incredulously. The two broke out into smiles at how quickly their magical antics had taken a mundane turn.</span></div></div>",

It was called \u201chead swap.\u201d What she read about this button on the instructions is that it allows two or more people can swap heads onto each other\u2019s bodies with no memory of it.  \u201cHuh\u201d; That sounds fun to do.\u201d She said with excitement in her voice. \u201cBut who to try it in first?\u201d She thought in her head. \u201cWell there is my team which includes my sister Yang, my partner Weiss, or my sister\u2019s partner Blake. There is also team jnpr which includes Jaune, Pyrrha, Nora, and Ren. Or even team cfvy which also includes Coco, Fox, Velvet, and Yatsuhashi.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard to choose but I think I will go with my team first and then maybe team jnpr or even team jnpr\u201d. Ruby Said cheerfully in her voice while  finally Coming  up with an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwords, she opens her door to her  dorm room and notice no one was there except her partner Weiss sitting all alone at her desk just studying as usual. \u201cI wondered if I should swap with Weiss now.\u201d She questioned herself quietly. \u201cSure, Weiss isn\u2019t as cut loose as the others are but I know it will be worth it for me.\u201c  Ruby said. She sneak quietly up to her partner not trying to alert her that both of em with have swap heads with one another. After she was in close range of her target, ruby pulled out the remote from her pocket and aimed it at her partner.  She pushes the \u201chead swap\u201d button under \u201cbody parts swap and a light green beam collides into an unknown weiss\u2019s back not Knowing what is going on. We now see that somehow, ruby and Weiss\u2019s heads detached from their necks down and flew to each other\u2019s bodies, once both bodies were floating above their new bodies, their heads plopped down attaching their new heads from the neck down to their new bodies. Ruby is the first to notice the swap. \u201cHuh, where am I, I feel so different .\u201d She said looking around the room. She notice that she is sitting at weiss\u2019s desk in Weiss\u2019s chair as well. \u201c why am I sitting at weiss\u2019s desk, I was just standing behind her a few minutes ago.\u201d While questioning herself, she looks down at herself getting a Glyphs and a shock at the same time. \u201cWuh\u201d \u201cI have weiss\u2019s body, this is amazing, the remote actually worked.\u201d Ruby said with stars in her eyes while touching her face with her new hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she looks over and notice Weiss is standing in the same spot she was just previous in. \u201cHey Weiss, are you feeling  okay right now?\u201d Ruby asked her partner. \u201cOf course I am ruby, why do you asked. \u201cI just wanted to ask you something real quick?\u201d \u201cGo ahead Ruby\u201d. Weiss answered. \u201cDo I look different to you?\u201d She said giving a pose with weiss\u2019s body While smiling at the same time. \u201cUm, no.\u201d \u201cYou always had that dress ever since we first meet at the begging of this semester.\u201d  Weiss said with a confusing look and her right eyebrow arching above her forehead. \u201cOh.\u201d Well thanks for answering and listening to my question.\u201d Ruby told Weiss. \u201cNo problem ruby.\u201d \u201cNow if you excuse me, I need to get back to studying for the next Grimm exam in a couple of weeks. Weiss said walking back to her original desk  but with Ruby\u2019s body instead of  her own body  before the swap had Acurred. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d Ruby said to herself. \u201cNot only did I aqurried weiss\u2019s body but she seemed to have not have any memory at all during the switch.\u201d Ruby said in excitement. Just then, Yang and Blake had just return from training together at the training facility and Blake who is reading her fantasy book \u201cninja\u2019s of love\u201d walks over to her bunk bed jumping up and reading more of it while yang walks over to her younger sister and Weiss . \u201cHey guys, what\u2019s up.\u201d \u201cBlake and I just came up with a special move Down at the training facility that will  Surely  knock your socks off.\u201d  Yang told both her younger sibling and her teammate. \u201cThat sounds great Sis, I can\u2019t wait to see it.\u201d Ruby told her older sibling.\u201dokay, whatever it is, it Won\u2019t help me study Faster if I keep getting interrupted by you or your sister Yang.\u201d Weiss said in annoying voice. \u201cOh Weiss what wrong, Can\u2019t support your team by acting like a Ice queen.\u201d Yang told Weiss back in a smuggler expression. \u201cI can handle supporting my team but i require some peace and quiet so that I can finish studying for the next Grimm exam in a couple of weeks.\u201d Weiss  Annoying said To Yang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on; ruby got an idea. Does she swap Yang and Blake\u2019s head as well? Does she continue keeping weiss\u2019s body for a little longer? Or does she try something else on the remote? </span></div></div>",

Ruby you are a genius. She said. \"Hey guys, can you come in the middle of our room please, I have something to show you.\" Ruby said in yang's body. \"Oh okay.\" They both said in union together. \"What is it you need us here for yang.\" Blake said to Ruby, who is unknown that she is possession her sister's body. \"This.\" Ruby said jumping out of yang's body and into her's very fast and quickly. Blake was off guard at what just happen, all of a sudden, her body began to move  around in a werid and ocward way, once her body stopped moving in a weird way, we now see Blake's black eye colors changed to ruby's red eye colors instead. \"Woah, I'm in Blake's body now.\" Ruby said with her normal voice coming out of Blake's mouth. \" \"look at me, I'm Blake. I like to read fantasy novels such as \"ninja's of love\" and eat tuna all the time. \" \"I also like zwai when he is around sometime, I like him a lot even though I am a fanus.\" Ruby said with excitement in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, are you okay?\" Weiss said, you are now starting to sound like yang when she had that hi pitched voice that sounds a lot like ruby's voice. \"Oh yea, well I'm practicing my voice talent to sound like Ruby as well.\" Ruby said to Weiss from Blake's body. \"Oh okay.\" Yang, are you alright, you seem a little pale in the face right now.\" Weiss said. \"Oh my head, what happen, the last thing  I remembered was talking to you guys down at the courtyard about improving our technique for the upcoming vytal festival in a few months and all of a sudden, I blacked out and just somehow reappeared here in our dorm room.\" Yang said with bubble around her head appearing out of nowhere remembering that last thing she saw. \"What.\" But you can't be serious yang.\" Weiss said. \"That's totally obsurb.\" She added. \"We might have a ghost problem here in our dorm.\" Weiss said.  \"Well, then I guess  we might have a ghost of a chance\" yang said, messing up yet another good pun.\" \"Yang this isn't a good time for your bad puns right now, this is serious.\" Weiss said. After saying that, yang asked Blake a question, not realizing it was her sister all along in control of Blake's body. \"Hey Blake, what do you think of this ghost problem we have.\" Yang told her. \"I think we need to cover our tracks and find this mysterious ghost that haunts our room so to speak.\" Ruby said with her normal voice coming out of Blake mouth. \"Blake are you okay, you sound like Ruby right now.\" Yang asked Ruby who is preoccupied in Blake's body. \"Of course I am yang.\" \"I'm just practicing my voice talent by sounding like Ruby to see what you both think about it.\" Ruby said. \"Well, it is impressive.\" Yang said. \"Weiss what do you think?\" \"Weiss was just confuse now. \"That very odd of you to say Blake because, not long ago, I heard that exact same voice coming out of yang's mouth.\" Weiss told Ruby. \"Blake what is really go on here.\" Ruby  realizing she might have been found out, decided the only thing to do is possessed Weiss body so that her sister and Blake don't know it's her that is their ghost problem. After a sec, we now see Ruby coming out of Blake's body and jumping into Weiss's body instead. Weiss was as well off guard of what just happen. Afterwords, Weiss's body began to move in a werid and ocward way, once her body stopped moving in a ocward and werid way, her eye color's changed from Weiss's white to ruby's red color instead. \"Ahh, now I know my secret is safe with me.\" Weiss won't be able to find out because, I am in her body controlling her and nothing will stop me from having fun with this magical remote I found in the forest.\" Ruby said with her normal voice coming out of Weiss mouth. \"Whoops\". Not realizing what she just said  out aloud in front of yang and a now confuse and dizzy Blake. \"Weiss, why are you starting to sound like Ruby now, I'm confuse.\" Yang said. Ruby knew the gig was up so the spilled the beans to yang and Blake. \"Guys, I'm<br>\r\nNot really Weiss pretending to be Ruby because, I am Ruby.\" Ruby said with her normal voice coming out of Weiss's mouth. \"WHAT\". Both yang and Blake said in a perfect union. \"It's true.\" \"I'm not trying to lie to both of you, I really  am Ruby and this is my normal voice.\" \"I was just trying out this magical remote I found in the forest coming back from chopping down Grimm and wanted to see the effects of how it work.\" Ruby said from Weiss's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, Blake and yang know that Ruby wasn't lying to both of em. \"So what is it you are doing right now?\" How are you in control of Weiss's body.\" Yang said. \"Well, when I got back to beacon, I wanted to test the remote on you guys first to see if it worked and it did. I found a button that is called \"ghost possession\", which allows the user to turn into a ghost form of themselves and overshadow another person's body.\" Ruby said. \"So all that time Weiss and I were talking to yang, that was actually you Ruby.\" Blake said. \"Pretty much.\" Ruby said with a smile and a grin with her eyes close. \"That is awesome.\" Yang it. \"I know right.\" Ruby said with a big smile on her new face. \" By the way ruby, shouldn't you Un possessed Weiss now, I think she deserves to hear the truth from you as well?\" Blake said. \"Yea, your right Blake.\" Ruby said pushing  the reset button and all of a sudden , turns back into her human normal self. We now see a confuse and dizzy Weiss standing in the corner not realizing what just happen a few minutes ago. \"What just happen?\" Weiss said, Ruby tells Weiss what she had told yang and Blake before and ask for an apology from her. After a few moments of silence, Weiss accepted ruby's apology and ask her how she possessed her body. Ruby told her about the magical remote and what it can do by showing her the instructions on the piece of paper. Afterwords Weiss said, \"why don't you let me try the remote on someone else? Okay.\" Weiss ask Ruby and she gladly gave it to her. Weiss and the rest of team Ruby headed down to the training facility where they see professor goodwitch standing there doing nothing. \"I think I know who I'm going to possessed.\" Weiss said. \"Who?\"  The rest of the team said in a perfect union. \"Professor Goodwitch\". Weiss answered. \"Oh yea, by doing that, you can help bump up my grades by using professor goodwitch's body for me.\" Ruby told Weiss. \"That's my plan Ruby.\" Weiss said. \"Okay, here I go.\" She pushes the ghost possession button on the remote and open's her eyes to a ghost version of herself with a ghost tail floating in midair. \"Okay, it's show time.\" Weiss said flaying quietly up to a unknown professor goodwitch's body. Once she was floating behind her back, she sticks her hand through her professor's  back and all of a sudden, gets pulled in by a force that was magically pulling her in. Once she was inside, professor goodwitch eyes open wide, and body begun to shake and move in a werid ocward way. Once her body stopped movie in a weird way, we know see professor goodwitch's purple eye color change to Weiss's  blue eye color instead. \"Woah, I'm in professor goodwitch's body.\" Weiss said with her  normal voice coming out of her teacher's mouth. While looking over to her teammates, she walked over to them and said, \"hey guys, look at me, I'm professor goodwitch, a full pledge huntress with a riding crop.\" Weiss said while whipping the crop in her hand making Ruby and yang laugh out aloud. \"So Weiss, can you fix up my grades for me?\" Ruby said. \"Of course I will Ruby, what are teammates for. Weiss said from her teacher' mouth with a big smile with her eyes close at the same time. After she looked on her tablet, she changed her grade and the rest of team rwby's grades to passing. Once she was done. She decided to let her other Teamates use the remote for a chance giving it to yang first, then Blake, and finally Ruby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does team Ruby do with the remote, do they continue possession other student's bodies By turning  into ghost forms of themselves? Do they try out other functions on the remote? Or does Weiss return to her normal self? </span></div></div>",

Yang said. \"Do you remember what happen this morning, during our exam?\"'Ruby asked her older sister. \"No. Not really.\" \"It's strange though, one minute, I'm sitting next to you and after we did our handshake on congratulating each other, I had somehow  gotten really shorter again and had swap seats with you. Then all of a sudden, was back in my seat and felt taller once more afterwords.\" Yang said. \"Well, that is what i am Going to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby said. \"What you were feeling and experiencing  was that you and I had somehow swap bodies with each other\" \"How? That is impossible.\" Yang said in a confuse tone. \"With this baby.\" Ruby said holding it in front of her sister's face. It is called a \"buzzer swapper\", it allows two people to swap bodies with each other.\" \"But in hindsight, it is actually a magical remote in another morph mode button form that I found in the forest while chopping down in Grimm. \"Huh\". Yang said, \"wow, that is kinda cool and impressive at the same time. I didn't know we had swapped bodies with each other.\" Yang said with excitement in her voice. \"I know right.\" Ruby said. \"Hey, could I use this buzzer swapper device on Blake?  I want to know what it is like to be a Fanus.\" Yang pleaded with her sister. \"Well okay.\" Ruby said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Yang said. Once Ruby had given yang the device, she placed it on her index finger and walked over to Blake who is currently sitting at her desk, reading her romantic and fantasy novel \"Ninja's of Love\". \"Hey Blake I got a surprise for you. Yang said to her partner. \"Yang, if this is some sort of prank, then I am going to be very upset with you.\" \"No, it's not a prank, I promise.\" Yang said to Blake. \"Alright, fine, what is it.\" Blake said to yang. \"Hold out your hand and you will see.\" Yang told Blake. Blake complied with yang with a huge annoyed look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwords, yang decides to grasp Blakes hand while placing  the buzzer swapper in Blakes hand grasping yang's hand at the same time. All of a sudden, yang and Blake's bodies start shaking out of control from the zapping  of the swapper buzzer, and  their ghosts suddenly came  out of their bodies and swap places with  each other. After the swap, we now see a confuse Blake with a confuse expression on her new  face. \"Huh, what just happen? I thought I was sitting at my desk reading \"Ninja's of love\". Blake said with her normal voice coming out of yang's mouth. We now see a happy expression coming from Blake face which we know that yang is in control of Blake's body. \"OMG, this is amazing.\" She said. \"I can't believe I am a fanus now. I am Not just any ol fanus, but a cat fanus.\" Yang said while touching Blake's body from top to bottom. Afterwords, yang gets up from Blake's desk and walks over to her body without warning her, she snatched the buzzer swapper from her original body hand so that Blake doesn't mess around with it. Yang walks over to Ruby and says, \"hey Ruby, it's me, yang. Yang said with her normal voice coming out of Blake's body. \"Yang\", Ruby said. \"How is this possible?\" She told her sister that is in the current state of her partners body. \"I just listened to what you told me about this morning's exam, about you and I swapping bodies with Escher with this device and I have to say, I am Love it. Yang told her sister. Btw, here you go, I think I might stay in Blake's body for a while, she said handing Ruby back the buzzer swapper. \"Oh okay, well when you are ready to swap back with Blake, just tell me and I will surly give it to you without any notice at all.\" Ruby told yang.  \"Aww, thanks sis, I appreciate it a lot.\" Yang told her from Blake's body. \"Hey, what are sister's for.\" Ruby answered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finish their conversation, Ruby decided to walk over to Weiss and swap bodies with her real quick. She walks up to Weiss that is currently either studying for the next exam or is on her scroll searching for outfits. Ruby notice that Weiss has one hand out  lose doing nothing and the other preoccupied with a scroll in it. She decides now is the time and walks over to Weiss's right hand and grasp  it with her own that has the buzzer swapper on it. We know see that Weiss and Ruby body's start to shake uncontrollably. We now see Ruby and Weiss's ghost's coming out of their bodies and swapping with each other. Afterwords, we see a confuse look on Weiss face, \"what just happen\"? Why do I feel shorter all of a sudden?\" \"&amp; where is my scroll at?\" She said with a confuse expression on her face. We now see Ruby grinning a smile off of Weiss mouth. \" yes, I am In Weiss's body, she doesn't know we swap bodies, Ruby said with her normal voice coming out of Weiss mouth.\" Afterwords, she sneaks over to her original body and places Weiss scroll in her left hand while grabbing the buzzer swapper off of her body's index figure. \"Oh, there is my scroll, in my left hand as it was before.\"<br>\r\nWeiss said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that team RWBY has swap bodies, what does Ruby do now! Does she return the magical remote back to it's normal size and form? Does she redo everything back to normal?

Yang in reply, gives a thumbs up and Ruby sneaks quietly out of her team's dorm. While walking down the hallway, Ruby notice professor goodwitch walking down the opposite direction where she was currently at  her dorm for some reason. Professor goodwitch notice Weiss, but doden't realize that it is Ruby who is in control of Weiss's body. \"Ahh, hello Ms. Weiss Schnee, to pre tell  are you heading off too.\" Professor goodwitch said in a calm and gentle voice.

I think I can make it there by my self.\" Ruby said. \"Come on miss Schnee, if you want to pass my class, then you are gonna need myself to assist you, okay.\" Professor goodwitch said in a annoying voice. \"Come on let's shake on it.\" She replied to Ruby. Ruby all of a sudden had an idea. \"What could happen if I swap bodies with professor goodwitch?\" \"Not only will I be the teacher, but will also be a full  huntress.\" She said in  a happy mode her within her thoughts. After thinking about it, she accepted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her teacher doesn't realize she is going to be a student once more, but also a princess of a big dust company, that imports slave labor of fanus. Afterwords, Ruby pulls her hand out straight to grab her teacher's hand that is slowly coming up fast to grab her new hand. Once both hands are grasping each other with a smile and both eyes close tight, Ruby and professor goodwitch's bodies start to shake uncontrollably from the effects of the buzzer swapper in progress.

Afterwords, goodwitch looks up at Ruby and says, \"ahh professor goodwitch, I am glad you are here, I was wondering if you could take the time in assisting me with training for the upcoming vytal festival.\" Her teacher asked Ruby not realizing she had just swap bodies with her first year student. \"Uhh, sure I will.

He had been walking along the grounds of Beacon for some fresh air and to avoid the bully Cardin. Just because Jaune wasn\u2019t very skilled, faking his transcripts of attending combat school and all, Cardin and his friends picked on him a lot. He was even still wearing his uniform; black suit lined with gold, accompanied by a blue vest and a white shirt with a red tie. The walk had been his way of cooling off and not having his teammate try to console him. He knew they meant well, but it made him feel inadequate. As not many people came out this far, Jaune was surprised to see something laying out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA remote?\u201d He picked it up and saw a small pamphlet underneath. At this point, he might have just left the remote in the grass, but the title on the pamphlet caught his eye.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nYour Guide to the Swapping Remote<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be real,\u201d Jaune muttered and skimmed the guide. \u201cThis really can\u2019t be real,\u201d he repeated when he finished.

The quiet girl with long black hair from Team RWBY, Blake Belladonna sitting under a tree in the distance. She was wearing the Beacon uniform consisting of brown shoes, red tartan skirt, white blouse, brown vest with gold buttons, and maroon blazer with gold trim alongside knee-high black socks. The only difference from other girls was the black bow in her hair that Jaune knew covered her Faunus ears. She didn\u2019t want others finding out, but he and the rest of her team knew.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nI shouldn\u2019t be surprised</i>, Jaune thought, noticing Blake was reading a book.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>A little test wouldn\u2019t hurt.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, Jaune was in the clear. If the remote was a prank and nothing happened, no one would be upset. If it worked as intended, Blake should have no idea anything happened. The only problem would arise if the remote worked yet everyone noticed. In that case, Jaune could find himself at the end of a very angry girl whose combat prowess far exceeded his own. His life would be forfeit in that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could always deny I knew anything about it</i>, Jaune thought. He wasn\u2019t a bad person, but temptation is a very powerful tool. Plus, with a reset button, there would be no lasting damage. The entertainment value, however, was endless. He aimed the remote and hit the button for body part swap then made his selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote flashed green for a moment and then he felt additional weight on his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt worked\u2026\u201d Jaune couldn\u2019t believe it as he ran a hand through his hair. The test had been simply switching his hair with hers. Now Jaune, who normally had short scraggly blonde hair, now had thick luscious black hair that reached down to his lower black. When he glanced over at Blake, he had to suppress a snort. Completely unfazed by the swap, Blake was still reading a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference was she now had Jaune\u2019s hair and the black bow hiding her ears looked ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy shit!</i> Jaune couldn\u2019t believe the power this remote had. Reality changed based on the press of a button. He smiled. \u201cThink of all the fun I could have with this.\u201d He snickered. \u201cFirst, let\u2019s mess with Blake a little bit.\u201d A harmless prank couldn\u2019t hurt. He clicked the Personal Info button and selected names. There was another green flash of light and Jaune took a deep breath as he marched over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the risky part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Jaune,\u201d he greeted. Blake looked up and Jaune\u2019s breath caught in his chest. This was the moment of truth. Their names had been switched and he had to see if Blake noticed it or not. Jaune\u2019s brain was already panicking about what to do if she thought he was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Blake,\u201d she replied after a moment and Jaune had to catch himself from sighing in relief. She turned a page in her book as he struggled to think of a reason to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m heading back to the dorm,\u201d Jaune explained. \u201cDo you know if Ruby is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe so,\u201d Blake answered. \u201cWeiss wanted her to get her grades up. Part of being a team leader or something.\u201d Her expression said she didn\u2019t believe that was the real reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, okay. Thanks, Jaune.\u201d He made sure to repeat the name for fun. Blake hummed in response. \u201cOh, one other thing.\u201d He flipped his hair back. \u201cHave you notice anything unusual today?\u201d Blake raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnusual?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Not sure what it is, but something seems off.\u201d He brushed his black hair off his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like a normal day for me,\u201d Blake replied, her bow twitched slightly and she tilted her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about losing to Cardin. Keep training and you can teach him a lesson one day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Jaune was surprised she actually encouraged him. Blake nodded and glued her eyes back to her book, indicating the conversation was over. As Jaune left, he clicked the reset button of the remote and everything went back to normal. His head felt considerably lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he needed to decide what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mind began to race through the possibilities about how to use the remote. He wanted to try one of the other options before visiting his friend, since he had already tried Personal Info and Body Part Swap. For now, he wanted to avoid the personality swap.

The two closest teams he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam CFVY was a second year team that helped his and Ruby\u2019s team during the Breach. They consisted of Velvet Scarlatina, a rabbit Faunus that was Jaune\u2019s friend, Yatsuhashi Daichi, a kind and giant of a man, Fox Alistair, a silent person who Jaune knew nothing about, and the fashionista leader, Coco Adel.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xzUHh9qLIu4/maxresdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xzUHh9qLIu4/maxre...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam SSSN consisted of four guys, two of which Jaune knew personally. They were composed of Scarlet David and Sage Ayana, who Jaune didn\u2019t know much about, while Neptune Vasilias was a ladies man who was after Weiss. Sun Wukong was a cool monkey Faunus and Jaune liked him.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://orig02.deviantart.net/2bcb/f/2014/233/a/c/team_sssn_by_21as-d7rhk19.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://orig02.deviantart.net/2bcb/f/2014...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were more options if he continued.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sun and his team were already heading out, so he wouldn\u2019t have a chance to use the remote unless he fired immediately into the group. Team CFVY also consisted of two guys and two girls, which gave him variety on who to switch with. Leaning up against the wall nonchalantly, he pulled out his phone and the remote. If anyone caught him, they would think he was just looking something up on his phone. During that brief moment of distraction, Fox disappeared around a corner with everyone else about to.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing Jaune noticed was the room got a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco wasn\u2019t terribly shorter than Jaune, as she was tall in her own right. It was still noticeable. He looked down at his small hands and noted they were also much paler. His hand reached up and moved a piece of now brown hair in front of his eye. Suddenly, two other sensations overwhelmed the others. The first was the added weight on his chest. While not as well-endowed as someone like Yang or Nora, Coco wasn\u2019t lacking breasts. The second feeling was the lack of any equipment between his legs. Jaune\u2019s hands moved to examine both. His right hand squeezed the mound of flesh on his chest while his left made sure there was nothing left down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, that feels good</i>, he thought, as waves of pleasure coursed through him. He jumped slightly as he hand brushed the entrance to his new vagina through his pants and that brought him to his senses. <i>I shouldn\u2019t be doing that. It\u2019s not right.</i> A smaller voice in the back of his mind spoke up. <i>It\u2019s your body now. You can do whatever you want with it.</i> Jaune frowned, arguing with himself, and settled for squeezing his boobs one last time. Afterwards, he started making his way back to his dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It feels weird walking without a dick</i>, Jaune thought, as he thighs rubbed each other more. His clothes fitted him comfortably, even if they were styled to be male clothes. The remote had caused all clothes to fit their new body. Coco\u2019s outfit, as she had changed out of the Beacon uniform already, grew to accommodate Jaune\u2019s bulkier frame. Comparatively, his clothes shrunk. Coco had a rocking hot body with curves to spare. If Jaune had been any kind of deviant, he would have rushed to a bathroom to examine everything in detail. Instead, his sense of justice managed to hold out until he reached the landing with his and Ruby\u2019s dorm. The urge to rush toward Ruby\u2019s room was great, but he wanted to drop off his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey-o, Fearless Leader!\u201d Jaune was greeted by the bubbly ginger, Nora Valkyrie. Ren, who was together with Nora, but not together-together, as Nora so often said, was sitting on the edge of the bed tying his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, guys?\u201d Jaune made a mental note they didn\u2019t notice he had lost a half foot or so in height and was unmistakably a girl. Trying not to point that out was difficult. \u201cPyrrha not with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wanted to practice a new combo in the training facility,\u201d Ren explained. \u201cAnd we are about to go into the Emerald Forest to fight a few Grimm this evening. Neither of us were called for combat class and you know Nora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get rusty and also kicking Grimm\u2019s butts is fun,\u201d Nora added. \u201cWant to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah.\u201d Jaune smiled and waved his hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m tuckered out from getting my butt handed to by Cardin. Think I\u2019m going to rest all my bruised muscles.\u201d Funnily enough, even having Coco\u2019s body, the pain and tiredness didn\u2019t transfer. He noted this for future use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will beat him one day,\u201d Ren assured him, patting Jaune on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we will be the ones laughing,\u201d Nora added and high fived Jaune on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jaune was sure they were gone, he walked over to the mirror. Coco\u2019s deep brown eyes stared back. Jaune reached up and touched his cheek, while the mirror imitated his every move. His hand brushed the wavy locks on one side of her face, dyed with a gradient that started in dark brown and transitioned to caramel. Everything was exactly the same as if Jaune was staring at Coco. The only difference was the expression. Coco was also bold and forward. The expression he saw now was a combination of confusion, excitement and disbelief. A lot more insecurity was involved too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Jaune muttered, loosening his tie. Performing this action, his shirt slipped and he got a glimpse of the top of Coco\u2019s, well, his chest. Jaune took a deep breath and could no longer hold back the urge. He unbuttoned his shield. \u201cWow.\u201d That was the only word he could mutter as he stared at a half dress Coco in the mirror. All resistance left him and his hands were working both mounds and messaging them delicately. \u201cShit\u2026 this is amazing.\u201d He pinched one of the dark nipples and jumped as a spark ran through his body. \u201cMan, how do girls get anything done when this feels so good?\u201d Getting a hold of himself, he grabbed a t-shirt before he was tempted any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to go see Ruby,\u201d Jaune declared. Before leaving, he glanced back at the mirror and puckered up his lips. \u201cCoco is so hot.\u201d The door shut behind him and he found himself in front of Ruby\u2019s dorm. According to Blake, Weiss was also there. Taking a deep breath, Jaune knocked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stood there in the Beacon uniform, not having changed out of it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to speak to Ruby about\u2026\u201d Jaune hesitated a moment. \u201cAbout a few things for our leadership class.\u201d As he and Ruby were both team leaders, they had additional classes. Weiss didn\u2019t know about their homework or what they were covering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d She raised an eyebrow skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jaune nodded. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take long, but better get it out of the way early so we have the weekend free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk.\u201d Weiss clicked her tongue. As much as she didn\u2019t like Jaune, she wasn\u2019t childish enough to ignore a good point. \u201cFine. Hey, Ruby!\u201d She called over her shoulder. \u201cThe dork is here to ask something about your leadership class homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune?\u201d Jaune was actually hurt Ruby knew it was him by Weiss\u2019s insult. \u201cHomework? Wha-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jaune interrupted. When Weiss looked away from him, he shook his head frantically as a sign to Ruby. \u201cPart of it is tripping me up and I could use some help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Ruby exclaimed, catching on. \u201cThat\u2019s right. The professor assigned it at the last minute, I almost forgot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is why you write things down,\u201d Weiss scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Ruby apologized. \u201cI\u2019ll remember. Let me grab my stuff and I\u2019ll meet you in your room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it. Thanks, Ruby.\u201d Jaune replied. Little did Weiss know, there was going to be something else happening instead of studying. Nothing sexual of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s it,\u201d Weiss stated. \u201cYou can go.\u201d She closed the door in his face.\u201d Jaune sighed and went back to his room, to be joined a minute later by Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, Jaune!\u201d Ruby cried and hugged him. \u201cYou have no idea how mean Weiss was just because I got a C in history.\u201d Her tone grew higher and colder. \u201cYou have to set an example. You\u2019re a leader. You have to get A\u2019s!\u201d Ruby sighed. \u201cYou would think I\u2019m not a person or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s just trying to help you reach your full potential,\u201d Jaune reassured her and then grimaced. \u201cShe still doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could be the fact you embarrassed her by asking her out all those times,\u201d Ruby pointed out. \u201cOr you\u2019re not that high up on the combat ladder or grades\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Jaune muttered dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then your breasts are also larger than hers,\u201d Ruby finished, pointing at Jaune\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t tell her I said this, but she\u2019s really self-conscious about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, someone actually pointed out a difference in his new girl body. However, they didn\u2019t consider it strange. It was nothing unusual to them. Jaune appreciated the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what you want to do for an hour?\u201d Ruby asked. \u201cI doubt we could sneak down to Vale tonight, even being Friday. Weiss would have my head if I tried to leave. I have an hour at best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the leader of your team again?\u201d Jaune teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it, Vomit Boy,\u201d Ruby replied affectionately, using his nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight back at you Crater Face,\u201d Jaune replied and the two of them laughed. \u201cWell, I actually have something I want to show you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to explain, even with the guide.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She kept twirling around and then peaked into Jaune\u2019s part of the closet. \u201cAnd all my outfits are in here now! How is this possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was laughing at her reaction. To his surprise, Ruby believed him about the remote being magic. The reason: There had been no reason to lie to her about it. She merely wanted a demonstration. Jaune decided to try the Wardrobe Swap option and the two of them swapped every article of clothing instantly. Ruby went from wearing her normal a black long sleeved dress with red trim on the sleeves and skirt, a black waist cincher with red lacing up the front, a pair of thick black stockings and black combat boots with red laces, and her signature red hooded cloak to simple pants, sneakers, and a t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune, on the other hand, was now wearing her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw what he looked like in the mirror and damn. Coco\u2019s body looked amazing in anything. Ruby periodically kept turning around and snickering at him though. Even though his body was Coco\u2019s, everyone saw him as Jaune who wore male clothing. Now that he was wearing female clothes, it was funny. Well, no one else besides them would find it funny, as Ruby had been touching the remote when Jaune swapped their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you change us back?\u201d Ruby finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Jaune hit the reset all button and suddenly he found himself in his own body and clothes, while Ruby was now back in her clothes. \u201cOops, sorry. Forgot you need to touch the remote too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything seems okay,\u201d Ruby informed him and looked down at her clothes. \u201cNo harm done. Just remember that next time, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise,\u201d Jaune answered. <i>So everyone considers things normal after a reset?</i> \u201cAnd an Arc never goes back on his word. Next time we use it, we will both have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest friend ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d Jaune asked. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything except Life Swap and Personality Swap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Ruby mused. \u201cLife Swap lets you live as someone else, rather than just swapping bodies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the guide says,\u201d Jaune confirmed. \u201cNot sure about personality. Will I even notice? Imagine if I swap obsession with homework in Weiss and refuse to admit I did.\u201d Ruby laughed and then shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way. Nuh uh. Do not use that function on Weiss.\u201d Ruby held out her hands and shook her head. \u201cMaybe we could swap lives for a day to see what it\u2019s like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an idea,\u201d Jaune said slowly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Within mere moments they now switched places, in more ways than one. Jaune was now wearing Ruby's outfit which consisted of a black long sleeved dress with red trim on the sleeves and skirt, a black waist cincher with red lacing up the front, a pair of thick black stockings and black combat boots with red laces, and her signature red hooded cloak. He had worn it moments before with the wardrobe swap, but that was with Coco's body, now he has his own and Ruby's outfit feels very different this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby on the other hand was now wearing Jaune's shirt, pants and sneakers, which were comfortable to her, but again, they had just swapped this so it wasn't very new. Their hair however is new, since it swapped with their lives and clothes in the last swap. Ruby didn't have very long hair and neither did Jaune, so the only real difference was style and color.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have your hair now too! Cool! You look really ridiculous in my outfit with my hair.\" Ruby said not able to hold back her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel ridiculous too, but I can't deny it is interesting.\" Jaune said back shifting a little in his newly acquired outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll swap back tomorrow, that way we can see what each other's lives are like, maybe we can use the remote more together after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just try to be.... well me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will don't worry, I think the swap gave me the ability to act like you when I need to, but I think I should go, Weiss will give you a hard time if I stay too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Jaune agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune and Ruby left the room and Ruby prepared to leave and see what life as Jaune would be like. Just after Ruby left with his life, Jaune hears a familiar voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby! Are you ready?\" Weiss was standing across the room dressed in her usual white dress. \"I promised to help you train today and you're not even ready?\" Weiss scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune looked back to see the ice queen yelling out his new name, which was going to take some getting used to. He wasn't fully used to his new outfit and name yet, wearing her outfit is one thing, but her name, that is something he needs to really be careful with. However, training with Weiss while wearing Ruby's outfit will not be easy either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Being Ruby is going to be so exhausting...</i> Jaune thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Ru... I mean Jaune just left, I'm ready.\" Jaune said only just catching his almost potentially fatal mistake. Weiss would get really suspicious if he keeps misspeaking or acts out of character, which means he has to be just as active as Ruby, which could take a lot of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then come on, you need to start studying after like you promised.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss took Jaune across the hallway back to her\u2026their room. As Jaune was living Ruby\u2019s life right now, he guessed it was technically his too. He had come over to their dorm enough times to know which desk was Ruby\u2019s but his body walked automatically to it without much though as Weiss closed the door behind him. He noticed a half opened bag on Ruby\u2019s desk with a towel, water bottle, and other things she would need for a training session. As their weapons were kept in lockers, they would grab them on the way to the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to go?\u201d Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d Jaune answered. He wasn\u2019t sure how he was going to be able to fight living as Ruby. He wasn\u2019t used to her clothes and he just realized that instead of a basic sword and shield, he was going to have to try to use Ruby\u2019s masterpiece, Crescent Rose. A giant scythe that could transform into a high caliber rifle. Weiss raised an eyebrow and Jaune also noted he wasn\u2019t acting nearly as excited as Ruby would have. \u201cI mean\u2026 Yep! Can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m gonna win this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Like that will happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss lead the way as the two of them made their way to the locker room outside a free arena. Jaune opened the locker he instinctively knew was Ruby\u2019s. His hand even turned the lock without him realizing it. The remote really made it easy to live her life and he was wondering if Ruby was doing okay. It was kind of embarrassing to act all preppy around Weiss on the walk down. He even found himself skipping a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Weiss asked suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet\u2026 well, quieter than usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thinking about R-\u2026Jaune and something we talked about earlier,\u201d Jaune lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t let Yang know you\u2019re thinking about him,\u201d Weiss commented, pulling out her dust rapier and refilling a couple vials. \u201cShe would get even more annoying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe would, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d Weiss nodded and Jaune shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that, sh-\u2026 he\u2019s just a good friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Weiss agreed. \u201cWe could hardly forget about Ruby running around in your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I bet she\u2019s having-\u2026 what?!\u201d Jaune gaped at her. Weiss slowly turned toward him with a dark smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI overheard your conversation. Now, why don\u2019t you just admit it\u2026 Jaune.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But how did you find out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI overheard you two talking about swapping with a remote,\u201d Weiss explained, walking around Jaune and examining him. \u201cThen Ruby suggesting you swap lives. While I didn\u2019t understand everything, I was glad I overheard what I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, why are you circling me?\u201d Jaune asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really can\u2019t understand it,\u201d Weiss muttered, more to herself than him. \u201cYou look exactly like Ruby and I can\u2019t detect any differences.\u201d This was important to Jaune because he saw himself in Ruby\u2019s clothes and hairstyle. \u201cThe only reason I knew you two swapped was because of a couple slip ups from you, almost unnoticeable, and what I overheard.\u201d She reached into the pocket of Ruby\u2019s dress that Jaune was wearing and pulled out a remote. \u201dIs this the device?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cEach button is a different type of swap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Weiss raised an eyebrow. \u201cTell me which one is which.\u201d It was not a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune spent a few minutes explaining the remote to her along with what he knew. The only thing he didn\u2019t mention was the instruction pamphlet since he told her everything. Thinking back, he probably should have lied. There was no way Weiss would have been able to verify her suspicion. He did have a crush on her so that might have played to her advantage there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 are you mad?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Weiss stated. \u201cThough most of it is directed at Ruby. For the life of me I can\u2019t figure out why she thought it was a smart idea to let a guy swap lives with her. Did she think about what would happen if a boy saw us all changing?\u201d Her eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Jaune protested. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have watched. I would have looked away. For your information I was planning to avoid the room for that very reason. The only reason I went back was because Ruby promised to train with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually promised her that,\u201d Weiss corrected him. \u201cHmm. What to do? I really want to see if this works and that you and Ruby/Jaune aren\u2019t pranking me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you\u2026 want to make a swap?\u201d Jaune asked. \u201cWe just need to\u2026 er\u2026 both be touching the remote to recognize the swap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss went silent for a moment as she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she finally told him. \u201cI have decided. As punishment for going along with Ruby, you are going to come with me while I test and record the functions of this remote.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune almost groan but the thought of spending all day with Weiss was exciting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You may be Ruby trying to trick me. Yang could have easily put you up to this.\u201d She looked around expecting Yang to jump out from behind a locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can understand that,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cWhat do you want to swap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and \u2018Jaune\u2019 supposedly swapped lives,\u201d Weiss decided. \u201cSo that would mean Jaune is in your life, even if I see you as Ruby. If that is the case, I will not trust a boy in my life. So I figured a simple swap will do.\u201d She held out the remote. \u201cYou said you had to touch it right? Go on then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you planning to swap?\u201d Jaune asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d Weiss said with a devious smile. \u201cThis will be obvious.\u201d Her finger clicked a button Jaune couldn\u2019t make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Jaune felt unstable as Ruby\u2019s combat boots were replaced with high heeled boots. Weiss was standing in front of him now wearing Ruby\u2019s red and black gothic dress, cloak, and combat boots. He looked down and saw his new dress was white which slowly changed to blue. In the mirror, he was staring at himself with Ruby\u2019s hair and in her life, now wearing Weiss\u2019s clothes. He quickly stabilized himself. Growing up with sisters, this wasn\u2019t the first time he wore high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t\u2026. this is impossible,\u201d Weiss muttered, staring at the mirror. \u201cSo you really are Jaune?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I've been telling you.\u201d Jaune realized Weiss still saw him as Ruby, but now wearing her clothes. \u201cHuh. Ruby won\u2019t notice we swapped clothes. If we swap lives back, she will be wearing your outfit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, fascinating.\u201d Weiss twirled the remote in her hand. \u201cSo the order of the swaps does matter.\u201d She hummed to herself and then quickly rummaged around in her locker before pulling out a notepad. \u201cHere,\u201d she said tossing it to Jaune. \u201cKeep track of my findings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, what?\u201d Jaune was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first thing we need to do is examine this systematically,\u201d Weiss explained. \u201cRuby is off doing who knows what in your life and this is your punishment for trying to sneak into our dorm. Do this and I\u2019ll forget about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s fair,\u201d Jaune conceded. \u201cBesides, I wanted to learn more about this. I showed it to Ruby because I wanted someone to help test it. You\u2019re smart, so I bet we are going to learn a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlattery won\u2019t help you, Arc,\u201d Weiss told him, though her words were missing the usual harsh tone. \u201cLet\u2019s see.

Anyone who saw them would just think Weiss was leading Ruby somewhere, but the truth was the two of them were looking for targets. They wanted a small group of people out of the way so Weiss could decide what to swap. The problem was most people were in large noisy areas and those in the hallway were going from one place to other. None of them were good targets. They were about to try to find an occupied training room when Weiss stopped and looked out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d She elbowed Jaune in the side and pointed to the tree on Beacon\u2019s ground. It was the same tree Blake had been reading under when Jaune discovered the remote. She was still under it, hours later. It must have been a really good book. This time, Yang was standing over her, talking. She must have just come from the gym, because she was wearing an orange tank top and black sports short rather than her uniform. Based on Blake\u2019s expression, Yang must have just said one of her world famous puns. \u201cLet\u2019s swap with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jaune agreed, deciding not to mention Blake had been his original test subject. \u201cWhat option do you want to try first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLife swap would put whoever clicked the button in their position, right?\u201d Weiss questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. The swapped person would be over here and believe they are me, well Ruby since I\u2019m in her life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo order is important\u2026 hmm.\u201d Weiss eye\u2019s seemed to glaze over as she thought about something. \u201cOkay, I want you to swap something with Blake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I want to see what changes would happen after a life swap,\u201d Weiss explained. \u201cI still see you as Ruby, since you swapped before I knew about the remote and couldn\u2019t touch it. Right now, it\u2019s more like you possessed her than swapped. I want to see you swap something, cosmetic preferably, to see if I notice Ruby being changed, not you. Order of swaps seems to be important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, that makes sense. Didn\u2019t think too much about that myself,\u201d Jaune admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reason I\u2019m making the plans and you are writing what we discover.\u201d Weiss reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune nodded and held up the remote. Because Blake wasn\u2019t moving, it was going to be an easy swap. All Weiss was asking for was something physical. That could be body, body part, wardrobe, or other swaps involving Personal Information. As they had tried a Wardrobe Swap already, Jaune suspected Weiss wouldn\u2019t appreciate that as much as the others. He also had to be careful what he swapped. If he swapped, say Blake\u2019s chest with his own, Weiss might accuse him of being a pervert. If he wanted to that, he might want to do an entire body swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune took a deep breath, made his decision, and pressed the button.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t see any flash of green light this time, so there was a chance Weiss didn\u2019t press a button. Of course this was the first time he had been not touching the remote. A green flash would normally draw attention. Maybe the flash was only for the user? Either way, he grabbed the remote from Weiss\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Weiss hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were going to swap without me,\u201d Jaune hissed back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026were?\u201d Weiss blinked and looked down. \u201cI actually swapped. Can you notice any differences? I swapped with Yang if that helps you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune frowned. Leave it to Weiss to make a lapse of judgment into a learning experience. He eyed her up and down. She looked exactly the same as she always did. Long silver hair tied in a ponytail on one side, pale skin that almost made her look doll like, large breasts that never seemed to quite fit her frame, and a white dress that changed to a light blue. Everything was exactly like he remembered. Thinking he might get a better idea by comparing Yang, he looked back out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang finally was getting through to Blake, who finally stood up. Jaune tried hard to figure out what changed with Yang. She had long blonde hair, a muscular body, was very tall but no breasts, and her gym wear seemed usual for her. All of that matched his memories. Finally giving up, he turned back to Weiss and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell anything changed. That must have been what it was like for you finding our Ruby and I swapped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss nodded ever so slightly, glad he understood her circumstance. The question now was if she was going to tell him what she swapped.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m curious about Body Swaps with Life Swaps.\u201d She held out her hand for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune didn\u2019t immediately hand it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you swap?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing big,\u201d Weiss stated, her face unreadable. \u201cCome on.\u201d Jaune still refused to give it to her and she rolled her eyes. \u201cFine. I forgot okay? I was a little over eager to test something and it worked. I told you I would tell you if you guessed correctly. This is also a test to see if a swap can be noticed. Reason it was something noticeable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I still can\u2019t see it.\u201d Jaune admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a sign of good faith, I\u2019ll let you hold on to it,\u201d Weiss stated. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t try anything\u2026 ungentlemanly, would you?\u201d She turned and started walking. Jaune quickly followed. He didn\u2019t notice, but Weiss seemed to be in a slightly better mood and kept looking down at her impressive chest for a girl her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jaune protested. \u201cI\u2019m interested in testing this remote out myself. It\u2019s nice to have someone else to do it with. Ruby just wanted to try out living each other\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a simple choice.\u201d Weiss sighed. \u201cI doubt she will do anything bad in your body. She probably wants to be treated as an adult for a little while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tend to call her a kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly to help her grow mentally. She needs to fix some of her childish tendencies in order to be an affective team leader.\u201d Weiss rubbed the bridge of her nose. \u201cI\u2026 may have been a little harsh on her sometimes. I should apologize.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cYou may be tolerable if you quit that incessant flirting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune felt a stab in his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPass me the notes you have taken. I want to check something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune handed her the notepad and there was a moment when she was distracted. He had the chance to swap something with her without her noticing. He could also swap with someone else. There were a few people in range. He could swap anything without her knowing as revenge for swapping something without him knowing. Of course, he could be a gentleman and not do anything. He pushed some of Blake\u2019s hair out of his face. They never did swap hair back. There wasn\u2019t much time to decide.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The instructions said that only the people touching the remote would be able to tell the swap happened. Even when Weiss used the remote, he knew the remote would work yet couldn\u2019t see what changed. His memories were completely altered with the new reality. It was weird being on the opposite end of the remote. The question on his mind now was: what would happen if he swapped lives with Weiss? He would be living her life with her in his current life, Ruby\u2019s. Would she remember everything? Would she only remember the swaps he knew about? Would she just believe herself to be Ruby or believe herself to be Jaune in Ruby\u2019s life? So many questions. The temptation was too strong to ignore and Weiss made a swap without asking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll\u2019s fair in love and war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim, he decided to use a Body and Life Swap right before his finger hit the button. There was a flash of green light and Jaune found his position swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that happened was wobbled as he found himself wearing high heeled shoes. Weiss had a couple inches on her heels after all and a sudden change to them threw everything off balance. The next thing he noticed was how much shorter he felt. Jaune had always been tall and Weiss was rather petite. His clothes weren\u2019t too much different that Ruby\u2019s, as they both wore combat skirts. The fabric felt much smoother and finer though. The weight on his head was more to one side, a sign Weiss\u2019s ponytail was on his head. He almost stumbled forward before righting himself back up. Again, experience saved him. Weiss\u2019s breasts were really big for her size. The weight wanted to pull him forward. They were amazing and Jaune almost felt them before stopping himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn\u2019t realized yet Weiss had swapped her breasts with Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason he stopped was because he heard Weiss move behind him. He turned around, hiding the remote inconspicuously in his skirt pocket. In front of him he saw himself, in Ruby\u2019s clothes, with Blake\u2019s long black hair. Weiss was in there and opened her\u2026 his?... mouth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn\u2019t sure if Weiss believed herself to be him in Ruby\u2019s life or just Ruby. As she was not mentioning the remote and seemed to be referencing just them hanging out. She apparently didn\u2019t recall the remote. Jaune had to take a shot in the dark and tried to let Weiss\u2019s life chose his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only natural for partners to do things together, Ruby.\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019m glad for the chance to rub off on you.\u201d Weiss in Ruby\u2019s life rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so the remote had put Weiss in Ruby\u2019s life. Everyone except him would see her as Ruby, even though she had his body. This was going to take some getting used to. If Weiss acted like Ruby, it wouldn\u2019t be too bad. He pretty much would be hanging out with his best friend, just in Weiss\u2019s life. The remote allowed him to act like Weiss so no one would be able to tell anything was different. Now that the remote was safely in his possession, he had to decide what to do next. Naturally, living as Weiss for a while to learn more about her was the first thing on his mind. He was in the body of the most beautiful girl in Beacon to him. It was a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he felt a little guilty. The longer he stayed in her body, the more tempted he would be to take advantage of the situation. Part of him wanted to because he was a guy. The other half told him he would be scum if he did. Using the remote on someone, either switching back with Weiss or swapping something with someone else, would be a useful distraction. He could continue to experiment. The notepad in his other hand still had the notes he and Weiss had written so far.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had just answered his Scroll automatically. From Weiss\u2019s action in Ruby\u2019s life, she also received the group message. Jaune figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to read it, since it was a team message and he was now part of their team. Yang had sent them a rather short message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Found Blake! Meet back at the room and we can head to the Vale Spa.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Spa?</i> Jaune thought. He vaguely remembered one opening up. It was mainly advertising a hot spring environment and massages. As someone with seven sisters, he was used to giving them massages. They helped relax the muscles and allowed faster recovery. He could feel Weiss shifting nervously next to him and he turned to her. \u201cWhat is it, W-\u2026Ruby?\u201d He asked, correcting the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to go, Weiss,\u201d Weiss told him. \u201cI don\u2019t like people touching me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it all made sense. Ruby had wanted to swap lives and then ran off on him. She wanted to get out of this trip and the remote was a perfect opportunity. He didn\u2019t doubt she would come back and want to try it out more once she was safe. In Weiss\u2019s life, Jaune could feel himself wanting this trip. Two of his sisters always complained about neck and back pains because of their chests. Weiss being small with large breasts was bound to have the same problems. He could also tell how Weiss would treat Ruby\u2019s complaints and thought he would have some fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s beneficial for you to get one once in a while,\u201d Jaune stated. \u201cRunning around and swinging that scythe of yours does call muscle fatigue. You can select a female masseuse so it won\u2019t be awkward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Weiss grumbled and crossed her arms. \u201cYang said the same thing.\u201d She stuck her tongue out and Jaune had to fight to hold back a laugh. Seeing his body act like Ruby and make expressions like that was hilarious. The two of them headed back to Team RWBY\u2019s dorm, giving Jaune time to think about what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The movement accented Weiss\u2019s body\u2019s boobs. Yang scowled and Blake smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha.\u201d Yang faked laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous you can\u2019t have a toned ass like mine.\u201d Jaune only rolled his eyes. Yang was pretty sensitive about her small breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have to?\u201d Weiss asked. \u201cI told you I\u2019m not comfortable letting people touch my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine, Ruby.\u201d Yang threw her arm over Weiss\u2019s shoulder. From Jaune\u2019s point of view, Yang threw her arm over himself, as Weiss was in his body but living Ruby\u2019s life. \u2018It\u2019s going to feel amazing and I\u2019ll even be in the same room if it\u2019s that big of a deal for you. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Weiss shuffled her foot nervously. \u201cIf you promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Blake?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind. My shoulders could use some work.\u201d Blake shrugged. \u201cAt the very least, I want to relax in their hot springs.\u201d Her eyes traveled over him. \u201cI feel sorry for you through. Your back must hurt a lot. Being so developed yet with a small frame.\u201d Jaune automatically scowled. Seemed Weiss\u2019s life hated being called short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you learned to live with,\u201d Jaune replied and Blake turned away. Noticing Yang was busy teasing Weiss, Jaune targeted Blake and swapped heights. He immediately felt himself shoot up a couple inches. Glancing in the mirror, while Weiss\u2019s body still had a very prominent rack, her chest appeared a little more natural with her new height. Blake was now the shortest person on their team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the four of them left and headed toward the Bullhead to reach Vale.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jaune noted the man began to really suck up to him, once he was introduced. Always asking if there was anything special he would need. It seems the Schnee name was well known here. They entered through a door into a large changing room. Rows of white towels with the Spa\u2019s symbol lined the walls and countless towels were piled up against the far wall, free for them to use. There were individual lockers for each of them to store personal possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place is nice,\u201d Jaune commented. \u201cVery high class.

He felt slightly guilty about this, but excited at the same time. Managing to stand so brazening in the female dorm room was a dream many guys wish they could live. Yang and Blake were two of the hottest girls in his year at Beacon. Ruby was cute, but he wouldn\u2019t look at his best friend like that. There was also the case of Weiss being in Ruby\u2019s life along with being in his body. He had to suppress a laugh as he saw himself beginning to strip down in the female locker room. The showers were individually stalled and everyone was required to use them before using any of the amenities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun then, Weissy!\u201d Yang called out, already down to her underwear and a towel over her shoulder. Her yellow bra barely protruded due to her small breasts and she finished stripping before heading into the shower. Jaune got to admire her fine, toned ass as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake on the other hand merely nodded as she stripped down to her black underwear. Jaune found his eyes falling on her. After he switched heights, Blake was now by far the shortest person on the team. Weiss\u2019s outfit had high heel shoes that put her right above Ruby. Something Blake did not. So now Blake was an exotic little beauty. Her attractiveness hadn\u2019t changed and she still had a curved body. The famous bow still never left her head. After she disappeared into a shower stall, he snapped back to reality. Weiss in his body walked into her own, happy she found way to delay a stranger touching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Realizing he was falling behind the others, he quickly stripped off his boots, followed by the blue and white dress he was wearing and hung it up in the locker. A mirror showed Weiss in all her perfection standing there in nothing but her underwear. As Jaune excitedly peeled off the white underwear, the bra seemingly not made to support her large breasts, he moved into the shower.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the water washed over his body, it took all of Jaune\u2019s determination not to spend all his time exploring his new body. Weiss\u2019s body was like a pristine temple that when he finally explored, he wanted to do it in the right setting. Using it in a shower in a business was just downright rude. Still, as the water ran down his body, he couldn\u2019t resist groping the large chest and feeling his fingers sink into the fleshy mounds. After a few minutes, he exited the shower, dried off, and changed into the robe while pocketing the remote. It was too valuable to leave alone. Then he headed out to the message parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was greeted by another receptionist who presented him with a tablet of available massagers. Jaune, remembering he was living as a girl, opted for two female ones rather than a male. There was no way he was going to let another man massage his precious Snow Angel, and himself though no one else would know that. He also chose some lightly scented oil before returning the tablet back to the woman. A minute later, he found himself uncovered on a message table and the employees began to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bliss. All the sore muscles in his body were being expertly handled. One woman messaged his legs while the second began on his shoulders. A couple of times there was a little pain when a large knot was reached, but it was immediately followed by pleasure. He almost fell asleep a couple of times. By the employees\u2019 reaction, this was a normal occurrence. Still, he had to admit they knew what they were doing. Weiss had a lot of stress on her back due to her previous size and large chest. Things would work out a little bit better in the long run with Blake\u2019s height.  If he kept things that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe hope you are satisfied.\u201d One of the employees said to him after they finished. Jaune stretched and then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say that was one of the best massages I have had.\u201d His body felt light and refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much for your praise, Ms. Schnee.\u201d The second one said. As Jaune was leaving, he ran into Blake who was heading to get her own. Her bow was still tied firmly to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen out of ten,\u201d Jaune answered. \u201cWould come again. Those online reviews were not kidding about this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That\u2019s good,\u201d Blake replied with a small smile. \u201cYou might want to wait a few minutes before heading to the hot spring. It\u2019s really relaxing and realistic, but Yang and Ruby are a little noisy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little?\u201d Jaune raised an eyebrow, though it was mostly Weiss\u2019s life guiding him. \u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a heads up.\u201d Blake continued past him to the receptionist desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, Jaune fiddled with the remote in his pocket. Another massage was tempting, but Weiss\u2019s body didn\u2019t need. Too many massages could actually cause problems to muscles. He eyed Blake and a devious plan entered his mind. If he Life Swapped with Blake, he could get another one without any issue. Though he might want to do a Body Swap too in case he didn\u2019t keep Blake\u2019s sore muscles. There were still technical aspects he wasn\u2019t sure of with the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next option was to go to where Yang and Ruby where. Weiss\u2019s life wanted him to either go there and reprimand them or find a place away from them to relax and not deal with it. There were other amenities after all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pretty surprised though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss is on my back about homework,\u201d Ruby explained. \u201cSo as long as she\u2019s around, I won\u2019t have any free time.\u201d Her face formed into a pout and she crossed her arms again. \u201cI really could use a break. If we only swapped bodies with her, she would just be scolding me with her new body. You know how hard it would be to not laugh at your body trying that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid laughing if it was you,\u201d Jaune agreed and Ruby lightly punched him in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if you Life Swap with her,\u201d Ruby continued. \u201cWe could hang out without a problem. Just for a little while of course. Maybe have a sleepover. I\u2019ve been wanting one for ages, but Weiss has refused to let you over, Blake doesn\u2019t seem to care either way, and Yang just keeps teasing me about you being a boy. Think of all the fun we could have together for a day or two. I love Weiss, she\u2019s my best friend, but you\u2019re my best guy friend. Plus, sometimes, I could just use a break from Weiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty sure she said the same thing about you,\u201d Jaune pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said we were besties? Yay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that idea sounds fun,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cIf Yang and Blake get suspicious, I can always hit the reset button.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, no problem whatsoever,\u201d Ruby agreed. \u201cThen I can swap with someone.\u201d She placed her hands together in front of her face. \u201cPleeeeaaase?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can,\u201d Jaune sighed, unable to resist her pleading expression. He picked up the remote. \u201cSo we go back to your dorm and the second we see Weiss, I\u2019m going to hit the button. You need to be touching the remote or you won\u2019t be aware of the swap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it!\u201d Ruby gave a mock solute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them left Jaune\u2019s room and Ruby opened hers. Weiss was just spinning around when Jaune aimed the remote as Ruby placed her hand on it. A flash of light went off and Jaune found himself sitting at Weiss\u2019s desk. He turned around to receive quite a sight. Weiss was standing where he had been, minus the remote now in his hand. Instead of her elegant thigh-length strapless dress with a faint color gradation from white to pale blue at the hem, which was stitched to resemble snowflakes, she was wearing Jaune\u2019s old t-shirt and pants. While funny, there was something Jaune didn\u2019t expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer white hair, which used to be long and pulled into an off center bun tail on her right side, was not short, blond, and messy. For some reason, their hair also switched during the life swap. Maybe it was some kind of indicator. It\u2019s not like Jaune knew how the remote worked. His head felt heavier on one side, so there was little doubt he had Weiss\u2019s hairdo. Ruby\u2019s pained expression of trying to hold back her laughter only reinforced his belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d Ruby added, more for Weiss\u2019s benefit now in Jaune\u2019s life. Jaune wasn\u2019t entirely sure if he could pull off acting like Weiss. He inhaled sharply and felt what would come naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time,\u201d he said, his voice a little sharper than his usual light tone, though not nearly antagonistic. \u201cYou may leave, Arc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d Weiss said nervously. \u201cIt was nice to see you, Weiss. Ruby, good luck.\u201d She backed out and Ruby closed the door behind her, before breaking out into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look hilarious!\u201d Ruby gasped, gesturing to Jaune. Jaune sighed and looked down at his outfit. He was indeed wearing Weiss\u2019s dress. The thing was, he was still in his body and was easily over a foot taller than Weiss. The dress changed to fit his frame, but a good part of his upper body was showing off his muscles. The bell-sleeved bolero Weiss normally wore was resting on the back of his chair. \u201cHer hair doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Jaune agreed and looked into the mirror. He didn\u2019t see himself though. His reflection was of his perfect Snow Angel, though her expression was one of surprise. Ruby noticed him staring and looked at the mirror too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what you look like to other people,\u201d Ruby commented. \u201cNo one would be able to tell the difference. She acted exactly like you would.\u201d She frowned. \u201cHow did you imitate Weiss so well, anyways? I know she should imitate you because the remote made her believe she was always you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain, but I\u2019ll try.\u201d Jaune fumbled for the right words. \u201cIt\u2019s like I kind of know how to act like her. Right now, I feel like I want to get you back at your desk and make you work.\u201d Ruby\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cThe feelings and desires are suppressible\u2026\u201d Ruby\u2019s face relaxed. \u201c\u2026so we can act like normal when we are alone, but I can keep in character around others.\u201d Zwei, Ruby\u2019s corgi that she was hiding from the professors at Beacon, walked up and Jaune scratched him behind the ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat remote is so convenient,\u201d Ruby said and Jaune couldn\u2019t help but agree. \u201cSo now that we are free, what should we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Usually we just meet her for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat means I don\u2019t have to act like Weiss,\u201d Jaune sounded relieved. Not that he didn\u2019t like Weiss, it was just acting like someone else for an extended period of time seemed like a hassle. \u201cWhat kind of things did you have planned when you finally arranged a sleepover?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have some card games,\u201d Ruby informed him, her eyes sparkling. \u201cI wanted to play this one two player one, but it\u2019s supposed to be really long and Yang won\u2019t stick around to actually finish. We got video games, snacks, and comics. It\u2019s going to be great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like the sound of that,\u201d Jaune agreed. \u201cAnd if Yang or Blake asks why Weiss is doing this with you, I\u2019ll say you made me promise to if you got your work done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m smart,\u201d Ruby puffed out her chest. \u201cI just don\u2019t like homework. Writing essays isn\u2019t like fighting Grimm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t argue with that,\u201d Jaune said with a nod. Ruby opened her mouth to ask what he wanted to do first, when her Scroll buzzed. Her eyes widened when she saw who the message was from and she jumped to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor Goodwitch is asking me to see her immediately!\u201d Ruby cried out frantically to Jaune. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jaune replied. \u201cYou better go. It\u2019s not smart to keep her waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Ruby assured him. \u201cComics are in the bookshelves to keep yourself occupied.\u201d Jaune waved goodbye as she zipped out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now alone in the room and needed to decide what to do to kill time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune didn\u2019t really want to read comics alone. He could do that anytime. Instead, he stood up and tugged at his underwear. While the clothes changed size to accommodate his body, female underwear didn\u2019t change to fit his male genitals. The rich silk felt nice and, every time he moved, it rubbed against his dick, which only made the problem worse as it grew. If Weiss\u2019s dress wasn\u2019t so poufy at the bottom, his erection would be extremely noticeable. There was also the tightness around his chest he wasn\u2019t use to. Making sure the door to the room was locked, he tugged at the dress and looked down to see a strapless white bra clinging tightly to his chest. There was no reason he should need it, but Weiss had been wearing one when they swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune couldn\u2019t resist anymore and ran into the adjacent bathroom. Locking the door behind him, he stood in front of the mirror and gazed at Weiss longingly. She was beautiful with pale skin and white hair, like a doll. Jaune didn\u2019t have her body, but he could at least see it. Slowly, he pulled off the dress as he stared at the mirror. The reflection of Weiss wearing only her white undergarments stared back. Jaune took a deep breath to steady his nerves and unhooked the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat took longer than he would like to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is like a dream,\u201d Jaune muttered, as he posed in front of the mirror. As long as he stared at the reflection, he was in heaven. If he looked down at himself to see his male body wearing only Weiss\u2019s socks and underwear, he lost all desires. Slowly, he grabbed the underwear and pulled it down. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d That was the only word he could mumble as he stared at a virtually naked Weiss. Unable to resist any longer, he grabbed his dick and started to furiously stroke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t sure how the reflection would react to this. Would Weiss just be stroking midair or not? To his surprise and pleasure, the reflection showed Weiss inserting her fingers into the pink folds of her vagina and started masturbating too. That only fueled Jaune\u2019s lust and, moments later, he exploded and sent cum spraying into the sink and on the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u2026 that\u2026 was amazing.\u201d Jaune panted as he leaning up against the counter. He blinked and realized what he had done. \u201cOh, shit. Oh, shit!\u201d White cum was all over the sink and he could hardly leave it there. Rummaging around frantically, he finally found a washcloth and started scrubbing everything down. Once satisfied, he put everything back on the bathroom counter and gazed at the naked reflection of Weiss one last time. He already started to get hard again, but resisted the urge and instead put his clothes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, that bra gave him so much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the bathroom much more relaxed, if not a little ashamed. Ruby had still not returned and Jaune figured now would be the time to learn a little about Weiss. Maybe there was something he could learn about her to get on her good side. He tried to access her life like he did with acting and couldn\u2019t find any motivation of writing in a diary. With no leads, he started going through her clothes and dresser drawers. While he tried not to look extensively at her bra and panties, he couldn\u2019t resist sneaking a peek. Naturally, everything was organized perfectly. Her scroll on her desk caught his eye and he thought about using it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was wearing an orange tank top which showed off the top of her well-developed chest, along with a pair of tight workout shorts. As she walked to the closet, she flipped her long blonde hair back. Muscular, large breasts, curves, and an ass to die for, Yang loved to strut her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was called into Professor Goodwitch\u2019s office,\u201d Jaune replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch.\u201d Yang flinched. \u201cI feel sorry for her. What are you doing then, Weiss Cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust finishing a review of the material we covered today,\u201d Jaune lied, letting Weiss\u2019s life instincts take hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClass just ended,\u201d Yang protested and rolled her lilac eyes. \u201cYou got to learn to lighten up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have plenty of fun,\u201d Jaune retorted. <i>If only she knew what Ruby and I have planned</i>. \u201cSo, how was your workout?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots of sweat pumping irons.\u201d Yang flexed her muscles. \u201cGot to work hard to keep this temple in shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d Jaune didn\u2019t need any help rolling his eyes. \u201cYou should get to work on your homework or you\u2019re going to wait until the last minute again. I\u2019m not letting your copy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlenty of time.\u201d Yang waved a hand dismissively. \u201cBesides, you know you\u2019ll help us out at the last minute anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp, not copy.\u201d Jaune was surprised how easy it was to act like Weiss. All he had to do was relax and let instincts take over. He just knew what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might want to think about working out more too,\u201d Yang suggested. \u201cWould help with endurance and\u2026 lack of other assets.\u201d Jaune froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Jaune actually felt angrier than he should have. Weiss\u2019s instincts really didn\u2019t like it when Yang pointed out Weiss\u2019s chest. Ruby even said she had a complex about. Jaune was irritated Yang was insulting his Snow Angel\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder?\u201d Yang faced Jaune and lowered her body while using her arm to lift up her chest. Jaune\u2019s face flushed from his embarrassment and Weiss\u2019s life\u2019s anger. Yang laughed and pulled out a new top. \u201cGlad training rooms have a shower, but I have to remember to bring extra clothes when I go right after class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune glared at her, but diverted his attention as Yang started to change. He got a glimpse of her bright yellow bra and part of him wanted to watch. Jaune bit the corner of his lip and then smiled. <i>If Yang\u2019s going to make such a big deal about her breasts, maybe things should change?</i> He raised the remote discreetly as Yang\u2019s back was turned and clicked the Body Part Swap function. There was a flash of light and then Yang turned around after finishing changing. She noticed Jaune watching at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, Weiss,\u201d Yang said. \u201cYou got really nice breasts. I never developed any, so I have to work on keeping the rest of my body in shape.\u201d She slapped her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was trying really hard not to laugh. Yang was washboard flat now, as she had his chest. Jaune on the other hand now had two amazing breasts of his own. They were heavy, but Weiss\u2019s bra and dress adapted to the new shape. Because of the way the dress was designed, most of the top was revealed. When he looked down, he could see the crevice and the bra. His eyes glanced back up at Yang. Even without her breasts, she still had a killer figure. Her hips curved in the right places and she was right about that chiseled ass of hers. Her reflection showed exactly the same thing, so everyone would see her with his chest, not Weiss\u2019s, even though he was living her life. Of course, people would consider it normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of us are born with it,\u201d Jaune replied. \u201cYou still look good though.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s in a good mood,\u201d Yang commented and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to meet up with a friend, so I\u2019ll see you and Ruby at dinner.\u201d She bent down and rubbed Zwei's belly for a moment. Jaune nodded and when she finally left, Jaune collapsed into his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was close,\u201d Jaune said to himself and then chuckled. \u201cWell, I\u2019m a guy, living the life of Weiss Schnee with her clothes and possessions, and now I took Yang Xiao Long\u2019s boobs.\u201d He reached up and started rubbing one, enjoying the pleasant sensation coursing through his body. \u201cMan, these are more sensitive than Coco\u2019s.\u201d He shifted and his seat as his erection grew. \u201cDamn, I should do something about this.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNot sure I want to give it up though.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He lost track of time playing with his new breasts. He really liked the fact that when he looked in a mirror, he saw Weiss with Yang\u2019s boobs. They were a little bigger than someone like Weiss should have, but he found his movements weren\u2019t restricted. Maybe that was the remote at work again. However, the weight had been getting to him and that\u2019s why he decided to lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame thing Weiss scolds me about,\u201d Ruby sighed. \u201cHistory grade is slipping and Goodwitch wanted to make sure I corrected the problem.\u201d She rubbed her temple. \u201cThen she lectured me for an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh.\u201d Jaune tried to stifle his laughter and Ruby glared at him. \u201cShe lectures me about her combat class all the time. I feel your pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d The two of them laughed and shared a moment of unity. \u201cSo what have you been doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlaying with Zwei and reading,\u201d Jaune lied. \u201cYang stopped by and I pretended to be Weiss. Nothing else exciting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI half expected you to go out and start swapping everyone you could,\u201d Ruby pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease.\u201d Jaune scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m not your sister.\u201d Ruby couldn\u2019t stop herself from giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time we met the others for dinner,\u201d Ruby said, after calming down. \u201cSorry it took so long. Afterwards, we can do something fun, just the two of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking forward to it,\u201d Jaune assured her and he grabbed Weiss\u2019s bolero. \u201cThey headed down the lunchroom and saw Yang and Blake sitting down. Grabbing a tray of food each, they joined them. Jaune was sad he couldn\u2019t get the chicken nuggets, but Weiss\u2019s life indicated which food he was supposed to find appetizing. Way too much health food. Ruby sat down across from Blake and Jaune sat down across from a flat chested Yang. Taking the opportunity, Jaune hit the Clothing Swap button and switched bras with Yang. Weiss\u2019s strapless bra was not made to contain large and heavy breasts. He felt the straps of his new bra under the bolero. While the bra was yellow and didn\u2019t go with Weiss\u2019s theme, no one would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Ruby,\u201d Yang started off immediately. \u201cWhat did Goodwitch want?\u201d Ruby spent another five minutes berating about her experience with Goodwitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you so,\u201d Jaune said. This was too his amusement and in character with Weiss. Yang laughed as Ruby gasped at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraitor!\u201d she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything happening, Blake?\u201d Yang asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hiding away all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying having a chance to read my new book,\u201d Blake answered. \u201cBefore you drag me on some wild adventure this weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know me too well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune thought about it and decided another swap would be fun here. He nudged Ruby and gestured t other remote under the table. Ruby\u2019s eyes widened when he gestured to a button to press. Then a smile formed on her face as she obliged. When the flash of light died, Jaune repeated the action, after changing the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Weiss,\u201d Yang said to Blake. \u201cWant to come to Vale with me tonight? There\u2019s a sale I want to check out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ruby,\u201d Blake replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could stop by the bookstore too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I have time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Ruby and Jaune laughed silently as Yang and Blake called each other their names. Ruby had swapped names with Yang and Jaune, who was for all purposes Weiss, changed with Blake. The conversations changed from homework and school, to their plans for the weekend, and finally, what they were going to do this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Yang,\u201d Yang said to Ruby. \u201cWhat are you and Ice Queen up to without us to make your lives more interesting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur lives are plenty interesting,\u201d Jaune answered. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake\u2019s right,\u201d Ruby added. She managed to stop herself from laughing, but couldn\u2019t contain the smile of calling Jaune in Weiss\u2019s life Blake. \u201cWe got plans too. We\u2019re going to-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Weiss was always responsible for helping keep Ruby\u2019s antics to a minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Jaune replied. \u201cFirst time she told me anything about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise!\u201d Ruby continued firmly. \u201cLet\u2019s go J-Blake! We got preparation to do.\u201d Ruby grabbed Jaune\u2019s hand and dragged him after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think those two have something going on?\u201d Yang asked Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang might want to play games or something and somehow got Blake to agree,\u201d Blake replied, looking back down at her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like her,\u201d Yang agreed and threw her arm around Blake. \u201cYou and I are going to be the real party animals, Weissy. Eh? Eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you start off like that, I\u2019m not going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that about?!\u201d Jaune demanded, once he and Ruby were away from prying eyes and ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just thought of a brilliant idea,\u201d Ruby whispered excitedly. \u201cIf Yang and Blake, well Ruby and Weiss now, can you switch our names back?\u201d Jaune nodded and clicked the undo button twice with him and Ruby holding the remote. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to Vale tonight because Weiss wouldn\u2019t let me and you don\u2019t want to deal with Weiss\u2019s reputation, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Jaune began to have an inkling where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s Life Swap with Yang and Blake and go out,\u201d Ruby explained. \u201cWe can hang out, do pretty much what we want, while those two stay back and study in my and Weiss\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t like studying,\u201d Jaune comment with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s that, but there\u2019s more,\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cYou said you can kind of act like Weiss when using the Life Swap button. I\u2019m pretty awkward around new people, remember how we met?\u201d Jaune nodded fondly. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was pretty funny when you exploded. Crater Face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that point, Vomit Boy.\u201d They laughed and Ruby continued when they stopped. \u201cYang\u2019s always been outgoing and social. I kind of want to see what that is like. It\u2019s scary to go by myself, so I want you to come along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Ruby was Jaune\u2019s best friend and he would do just about anything for her. \u201cSure. How you want to do this? We have options.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLife Swap?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s one option,\u201d Jaune agreed. \u201cYou will be yourself, but in their life and clothes. We could also do a Life and Body Swap, so you would be in their body too. Then if you only want to see what it\u2019s like to have Yang\u2019s confidence and social skills, we can do a personality swap and I\u2019ll just follow you around as Weiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Ruby thought about it before making a decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo we have to be quick about this.\u201d Jaune and Ruby were near the front entrance of Beacon planning how to swap. \u201cYou and I need to be touching the remote during the swap. We can have you swap with Yang first, then you come back to me with the remote and I\u2019ll swap with Blake. If we wait too long, there will be some awkward questions. \u201cYou sure you want Life and Body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ruby confirmed again with a nod. \u201cI want the full experience. I\u2019m tired of being short. Time to see what it\u2019s like to be tall and confident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be with you every step of the way,\u201d Jaune assured her and she beamed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I ever tell you how great you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget it,\u201d Jaune told her and they laughed. \u201cKeep an eye out for Yang.\u201d When Ruby turned away, Jaune clicked the undo a couple more times to give the bra and breasts back to Yang. The sudden loss of weight was a welcomed relief. The reason he did that was so Ruby would indeed have the full experience. He could always get them back later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere she comes!\u201d Ruby informed him excitedly. \u201cBlake should be arriving any minute.\u201d They held up the remote when Yang drew closer and Ruby hit the Life and Body Swap. There was a flash of light and at first nothing seemed different. Until Jaune looked down and saw the remote was gone and now in Yang\u2019s hand. Yang, now in Ruby\u2019s life and body shook her head and looked at Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d Yang asked and Jaune had to resist smiling. Everything relating to the remote was gone from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to speak with Yang a second,\u201d Jaune said. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you back in our room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Yang answered and zipped off. Jaune walked over to Ruby, now in Yang\u2019s body, and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything working out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Ruby answered happily. \u201cHave to say, everyone looks smaller from up here and I\u2019m a little lopsided.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder why,\u201d Jaune muttered, avoiding glancing at Ruby\u2019s new chest. \u201cBlake\u2019s coming. Let\u2019s use it.\u201d Blake was just turning the corner when Jaune hit the remote he and Ruby were holding. A moment later, he found himself walking toward the front door to Ruby and himself, who was living as Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to go and make sure you sister is actually working,\u201d Blake in Jaune\u2019s body but Weiss\u2019s life said. \u201cYou two have fun and don\u2019t get into trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen do we ever get into trouble, Weissy?\u201d Ruby asked, already enjoying her new life. Blake rolled her eyes and left as Jaune approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll set,\u201d Jaune informed Ruby. \u201cReady to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Ruby confirmed. \u201cLet\u2019s party!\u201d She suddenly laughed as they exited Beacon and headed to the Bullheads. \u201cNormally, I would hate those kinds of things, but I see what you mean about Life Swap helping you integrate. I can let Yang\u2019s life autopilot if needed. What about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake definitely isn\u2019t a party girl,\u201d Jaune replied. \u201cShe rather go shopping for books, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t party.\u201d He gestured to himself. \u201cShe changed for the part. Probably to get Yang to stop badgering her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can believe that. Yang\u2019s very persuasive,\u201d Ruby agreed. \u201cStill all this hair is annoying. How she can stand maintaining it.\u201d She brushed the long blond hair back over her shoulder. Jaune had to admit he wondered how girls could maintain so much hair. None of his sisters had nearly as much as Yang. Blake\u2019s hair was similar in length to one of his sisters, who spent a good hour a day keeping it nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had changed from her workout clothes to her normal party/combat clothes before arriving. Ruby wore a tan jacket that revealed her midriff, with golden brown piping and short, puffy sleeves with black cuffs that feature. Under that, there was low cut yellow crop top that revealed the top of her breasts. Then there was a brown belt above a pair of black mini shorts. Her shoes were pair of brown, knee-high boots and orange over-the-knee socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was dressed in pretty provocative clothes too. Jaune was wearing a black buttoned vest with coattails and a single silver button on the front. Underneath this was a white, sleeveless, high necked, crop undershirt and white shorts with a zipper on the front of each leg. His shoes were black low-heeled boots and had full stockings with a color gradation of black to purple at his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were their combat outfits, but they doubled as perfectly acceptable party outfits too. After they climbed into a Bullhead and sat down, Ruby turned to Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do first?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As great as it was having breasts again, Jaune couldn't help but be fascinated by what the remote had done to facilitate his latest swap. Before the swap, when he looked in the mirror, he saw Weiss' reflection, and of course, anyone else (besides Weiss) would see their own. After swapping chests with Yang, he now had Yang's breasts hanging from his chest, and seeing as he still had his own body, Yang had his flat chest now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange part was what he saw in the mirror, how everyone else saw reality. Before Yang left the room, Jaune got a look at her reflection, and saw that rather than showing her chest swapped with Weiss', she had the same flat chest that he saw her with. Looking in the mirror himself now, he still saw Weiss' reflection, but now with Yang's breasts, looking a little out of place on her small frame. Jaune could only assume that his own life, now being lived by Weiss, had not been affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the remote had allowed the world to see the reality of the swap, even though, in theory, they should have seen a swap between Weiss and Yang's chests. What would happen if he swapped lives back with Weiss? Would people still see him with a flat chest, even though he still had Yang's breasts? Would they still see Weiss as having Yang's large breasts, even though she still had her own? Did swaps always work like this after a life swap, practically erasing the perceived features of the life in favour of giving the target the features of the person living the life? Was it only for certain swaps, like body parts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this had made Jaune rather curious about the exact limitations of the remote. What could it do, and what could it not? He kind of wanted to test it out, but it was be kinda rude to let Ruby in on the remote's power, only to then run off an experiment without her. No, he should wait here for her to get back. Although, if he did want to explain that he wanted to test how this sort of thing worked, he might have to admit that he took Yang's breasts. He wasn't sure how Ruby would react to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was taking an awfully long time to get back, though, and Jaune was getting antsy. As aroused as Yang's breasts were making him, he didn't exactly feel like letting it out in Team RWBY's bathroom again, partially for fear of being discovered. Perhaps there was a way he could begin to sate his curiosity about the remote. He couldn't leave without Ruby, but perhaps there was something else he could do right here in this room, something Yang had drawn his attention to when she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Zwei,\" Jaune mumbled, walking over to where Ruby's pet dog lay and petting him, much to Zwei's delight. Jaune had only used the remote on humans and Faunus so far, but perhaps the remote could do more. With Zwei right here, Jaune had the potential to test out whether or not the remote worked on animals. It would certainly be strange, and Jaune was a little worried about how this might affect Weiss' life, but the remote did have an undo button he could use if things got out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to pet Zwei, Jaune considered his options. He could try out a body swap, turning him physically into a dog. He wasn't entirely sure how that would work, given the different things a human was supposed to that a dog probably couldn't, but if the remote allowed him to swap with Zwei, he was sure it could make it work somehow. There was also the body part swap, for something less extreme. If one were to swap parts with an animal, it would almost be like becoming a Faunus, although Jaune wasn't sure whether or not his series would actually change, or whether he'd just be considered a human with animal parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were the swaps that affected clothing, being the clothing and wardrobe swaps. Of course, Zwei didn't have any clothing whatsoever, so any of these swaps performed would simply take the clothes away from him and give them to Zwei, presumably adjusting them to fit a dog's body. In theory, he could make it so it was considered perfectly normal to walk around nude. He kind of wondered how exactly the remote would manage that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was always the swap that had gotten him into the position in the first place, the life swap. This would put him in Zwei's life, leaving him to figure out how to be Weiss. He didn't exactly like the idea of making his \"snow angel\" a dog, but it would be a pretty good test, both allowing him to test how the remote worked on animals, as well as how his newly acquired breasts would be perceived after another life swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, Jaune dismissed personality and personal info. Personality seemed a little dangerous, in case he couldn't control the way he was acting after taking on the personality of a dog, and personal info wouldn't be particularly obvious after the swap, making it difficult to check whether anything had happened. In theory, he could always check Weiss' student ID after the swap, but Ruby was still on her way back, and Jaune wanted to make things quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eyeing the door once more, just to make sure Ruby wasn't about to burst him, Jaune pointed the remote at Zwei, and made his selection.</span></div></div>",

It was no mystery why, the answer sat right in front of him. Sitting exactly where he'd been before was Zwei, now far less naked than he'd previously been. Weiss' dress and bolero has shrunken down and adjusted to fit his body, and her boots sat on his hind legs. He even seemed to have the ornament Weiss used to keep her hair in a ponytail clinging to his fur. No doubt the remote worked on animals, as the wardrobe swap had made Zwei the proud owner of all of Weiss' clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Jaune had been left with nothing to cover himself up. He could feel Weiss' hair splaying across his back, no longer tied up in a ponytail, and Yang's breasts now hung freely from his chest, nothing present to hold them up. He blushed as he glanced down at himself. As expected, he was completely naked, all of his, or rather Weiss', clothes now belonging to Zwei. He quickly glanced in the mirror, and to be greeted once again by the sight of a naked Weiss, only this time with an increased bust size. He quickly turned away, not wanting to \"clean up after himself\" again in Team RWBY's room again, although if he kept doing things like this he just might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune's heart was racing. Not only had he confirmed that the remote worked on animals, opening up all sorts of new possibilities for what he and Ruby could do with it, but he'd also somehow made it normal for him, or rather for Weiss, to walk around naked. Or at least, he assumed the remote made it normal. Deciding to see how much reality had changed, Jaune decided to take a peek inside Weiss' dresser. He did feel a little guilty about snooping, but he was pleased with the results regardless. As expected, there was significantly more empty space now, Weiss' former clothes presumably now sitting at Ruby and Yang's house. In what little space was occupied, there were a few different collars, presumably the only clothing Zwei had to give in the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune crossed his arms beneath his breasts as he thought about what to do next. Ruby would be coming back soon, provided Goodwitch wasn't still lecturing her, so it would probably be wise to swap back. Then again, thanks to the remote's powers, she probably wouldn't notice anything out of the ordinary. She probably thought it was normal for Weiss to be naked, and at best, probably found it amusing for Jaune to inherit Weiss' lack of clothes, and at worst, wasn't happy about having a naked boy around but didn't think it too strange. In fact, Jaune was starting to wonder what else he could do with Zwei. Removing his clothes was one thing, but the more physical or mental swaps would certainly prove more interesting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune stood there wondering what to do. He was standing in the middle of Team RWBY\u2019s room completely naked except for a collar on his neck. He eyed the tag in the mirror and saw it was engraved with Weiss\u2019 name. It must have said Zwei before the swap. Other than that, everything was hanging free. His male genitals were dangling between his legs and Yang\u2019s breasts he now owned were sagging without a bra to support them. The whole situation was kind of arousing and he could feel himself growing hard. Before he could decide what to do next, the door to the room burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d Ruby announced. She noticed him standing in the middle of the room looking at Zwei. \u201cPhew. I was worried you were going to head off because I took so long. What have you been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing really,\u201d Jaune answered, aware Ruby didn\u2019t mention his nude situation. He did see her eyes flicker to his dick and her face growing slightly redder. \u201cJust figured I would wait for you. It was your idea to hang out and being Weiss right now\u2026 I wasn\u2019t sure if I was ready to go off on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be hard to be living her life with her being a nudist and all,\u201d Ruby agree and that was Jaune\u2019s first insight into the new reality. Her face did grow red. \u201cI know everyone else sees you as her, so it\u2019s nothing new, but\u2026\u201d Her face grew redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, right.\u201d Jaune looked down. \u201cShould I swap with someone or\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Ruby said quickly. Too quickly. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s fine. I kind of feel like it\u2019s natural now, but my\u2026 er\u2026 rational side knows something up. I\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d If Jaune was inclined to distrust people, he would have noticed something was off. As he was now, he just assumed it was the remote at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you wanted to have a sleep over, right?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Ruby looked relieved at the change of subject. \u201cWe need to go meet Blake and Yang for dinner first though. I like us all eating together to promote team unity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat make sense,\u201d Jaune agreed. \u201cWhen do you want to test out the remote some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we can use it on Blake or Yang?\u201d Ruby suggested. \u201cNot a Life Swap, you did that already, but something else. I really want to try a swap and you got to do one with Weiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune laughed and promised she could swap with someone. As the two left the dorm, several ideas ran through his mind as excitement coursed through him. He was now in the hallways of Beacon completely nude with his genitals and stolen breasts flopping around with each step.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few guys looked at him as he and Ruby passed, but didn\u2019t comment on his lack of clothes. The biggest problem was the excitement was making him pitch a tent. Walking that far with a full free hanging erection was not comfortable and Weiss\u2019s life only made it worse. When a couple guys made eye contact, he could feel himself getting harder. Subconsciously, Weiss\u2019s life was attracted to guys, even if Jaune was currently occupying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was talking excitedly to him the entire trip down. About school, about missions her team had been on, family, and school work. Nothing was off limits. It was a lot like listening to Nora with fewer exaggerations. Jaune was only half paying attention, as he was noting other people\u2019s reaction to him. His only complaint besides his erection was his boobs were beginning to hurt without a bra to hold them in place. Every stepped caused them to bounce and, while it was pleasurable early on, now began to grow sore.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHow does Yang deal with this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really debated swapping clothes with someone but decided he might as well wait until they got back to Ruby\u2019s dorm and swap back with Zwei.

Tell me your idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how I was planning to swap something with Yang or Blake?\u201d Ruby asked and Jaune nodded.

But someone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Jaune could understand this but wasn\u2019t sure why Ruby just wasn\u2019t telling him who she wanted to swap with. \u201cDid you have a target in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of.\u201d Ruby grinned at his confused expression. \u201cI was thinking of a random one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike randomly pressing a swap?\u201d Jaune asked. \u201cThat could be dangerous with personality and person info being mixed in. What if it\u2019s something unconscious we don\u2019t recognize and it changed your life down the road?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing from the guy who <i>literally </i>swapped lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing from the girl who suggested it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d Ruby shook her head. \u201cNo, not a random swap. A random target. I was thinking of standing outside the cafeteria with the remote and swap with the first person who stepped out. I wouldn\u2019t know who it was until the swap hit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune blinked at her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 sounds like it could be amazingly fun or become a disaster. What if you got someone like Cardin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwww!\u201d They both laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s an undo button if it\u2019s really bad. Right?\u201d Jaune nodded. \u201cSo, no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess?\u201d Jaune eventually gave in. \u201cWhat are you planning to swap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking maybe body or clothes,\u201d Ruby answered. \u201cIf I did a Life Swap, we couldn\u2019t hang out unless it was someone you knew. Personal Info you said had some unpredictable affects.\u201d Boy, was that the truth. Jaune\u2019s eyes flickered to his nude body. If that was just a clothing swap, imagine swapping personal info with Zwei. \u201cSo I figured it might be fun being someone else or wearing their clothes without anyone being the wiser. I use to wear Yang\u2019s clothes when I was younger\u2026 until she found out. She still mentions it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d An idea came to him. \u201cWhat about both?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBody and clothes?\u201d Ruby clapped her hands together. \u201cI could go with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Jaune shook his head and Ruby looked at him confused. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to hear me out. I like the random target idea. That has a lot of potential. What I\u2019m suggesting is you swap the body first, THEN after that person leaves, you swap the clothes of the next person to come out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it. Even if you get a guy\u2019s body, you might get stuck in a girl\u2019s clothes. Or the other way around. I would laugh for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby squinted at him as if expecting some diabolical plot. It really just made her look adorable. After a minute, she burst into a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like it. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them made their way back to the cafeteria and found a spot out of the way where they wouldn\u2019t be interrupted yet still had full view of the cafeteria door. A few students went in and Jaune felt Ruby\u2019s hand stiffen on the remote. She was nervous but they both had to be touching the remote for them to know what happened. At last the door opened and Ruby\u2019s finger pressed down on the Body Swap button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person Ruby swapped bodies with was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before Jaune or Ruby had time to recognize her, there was a flash of light when Ruby\u2019s finger pressed down on the Body Swap button. The light faded away and they saw Ruby in the distance walking away. Of course, that was just because a random girl had her body. Jaune turned to look at Ruby, who was glancing down at her hands and body. Jaune instantly identified the girl now, but there was no mirror for Ruby to look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taller, heh.\u201d Ruby stated in a new accent and then flinched. \u201cEverything\u2019s so loud now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 because you have some rather large ears on your head.\u201d Jaune pointed out, chuckling. Ruby reached up a hand and gently felt her brand new ears. These ears were on top of her head, rather than the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre these\u2026 rabbit ears?\u201d Ruby asked and Jaune nodded. \u201cI swapped with Velvet!\u201d She flinched as she wasn\u2019t used to her new enhanced ears. Velvet Scarlatina was a rabbit Faunus at their school. She had long, brown hair and brown eyes, which Ruby was now looking over at him with. Velvet being taller than Ruby, they were closer to eye contact now. \u201cWow, this is soooo cool. I\u2019ve always wondered what it\u2019s like to be a Faunus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget part two,\u201d Jaune added. \u201cYou need to swap clothes with someone else.\u201d Velvet did not look right wearing Ruby\u2019s gothic style clothes and red cloak. She normally wore brown and tan clothes that matched her hair and ears. \u201cAnd you\u2019re lucky. Looks like Cardin and his team just left, so you won\u2019t swap with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Ruby fist pumped. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin a good thing.\u201d Jaune laughed and Ruby held out the remote. \u201cReady?\u201d Jaune nodded and touched it as Ruby aimed at the door and waited.

Long, dark brown trousers with ribbons on the left side and a brown belt with cartridges covered her legs and hips. Above that, she wore another cocoa-colored belt of cartridges with a gold crosshairs buckle. What appeared to be a drape of black skirt hung on her right side. Finishing the ensemble was a pair of dark brown, high-heeled leather boots with buckles. A brown beret covered her head and pushed her ears off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou swapped with Coco,\u201d Jaune explained. \u201cI think she and her team were heading out.\u201d He looked her up and down. \u201cHave to say, seeing Velvet wearing Coco\u2019s fashion is interesting. It suits her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean it suits me,\u201d Ruby hugged and pushed out her chest importantly. Jaune held back his laughter, barely, but couldn\u2019t resist smirking. Velvet didn\u2019t seem to have a lot of confidence, so seeing her act like Ruby, who tended to act out when around her friends, was pretty funny.  \u201cI would not be able to afford expensive clothes like this. Though, these clothes feel a little restricting without my cloak though.\u201d She spun around in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the fun,\u201d Jaune told her, reminded of the fact he was standing in the nude in public. \u201cThe remote lets you see and feel things you normally wouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I guess I can stay this way a little.\u201d The ears on top of Ruby\u2019s head twitched. \u201cBeing able to hear everything is awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to go meet up with Blake and Yang now?\u201d Jaune asked, jabbing his thumb to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby answered\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once they entered the cafeteria, no one batted an eye as they took their place in line. Ruby got her normal meal which involved a large plate of cookies and milk. Jaune on the other hand wanted to grab the chicken nuggets, but Weiss\u2019s life pushed him into grabbing a chicken salad, fruit, and an ice tea. Since they were going to sit down with Blake and Yang, Jaune had to act like Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kept you two?\u201d Yang asked the moment they sat down. Blake looked up from her book and nodded in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby got distracted and I had to keep reminding her you two were waiting,\u201d Jaune answered immediately. The look of betrayal on her face was priceless. He didn\u2019t even need to tap into Weiss\u2019s life\u2019s memory. This was just him being a close friend with Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been late if you didn\u2019t explain everything like a billion times!\u201d Ruby protested, shoving a cookie into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou forgot some of the basics.\u201d Jaune answered, stabbing his fork into his salad. He noticed he was instinctively holding his fork differently. A more formal manner Weiss would be accustomed too. The two of them shared a look and then looked back at their food. It was hard not to laugh as their conversation was about the remote and not homework, which is what Yang and Blake thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are like oil and water,\u201d Blake commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are still besties.\u201d Ruby answered and Jaune shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet Ruby just took forever to decide what clothes to wear.\u201d Yang commented with a laugh. Ruby and Jaune\u2019s ears twitched, all four in Ruby\u2019s case. They just got a glimpse of how reality changed. It seems like Ruby\u2019s a bit of a fashionista here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous you can\u2019t dress this good.\u201d Ruby retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you have a body like mine, it doesn\u2019t matter what you wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you aren\u2019t upset you\u2019re lacking assets?\u201d Ruby asked and she immediately knew she went too far. Yang put her in a headlock and a noogie until she begged for mercy. That comment made Jaune remember when he swapped chests with Yang, he had been the only one touching the remote. He and Blake then made eye contact for a moment, before going back to their own devices. Yang and Ruby fake fighting like that was a common occurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he let Weiss\u2019s life lead for the most part. Normally he hated salads, but Weiss seemed to like it and he found it a lot tastier. His eyes traveled over to Yang and Ruby. Even when Yang was giving Ruby a noogie, she was careful to avoid Ruby\u2019s sensitive rabbit ears. He was curious if Ruby was considered a Faunus or a human in this reality. It was something to check out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran down his spine. Being in an open room with AC, completely nude, was a little chilly. His penis shrunk and he knew people would laugh if they noticed. However, he could feel the nipples on his breast harden. Probably from the cold and a little excitement from sitting in the cafeteria completely nude. His only complaint right now was that his boobs were beginning to hurt without any support. If they were smaller, a lack of a bra wouldn\u2019t matter. Yang\u2019s boobs were just that big and needed some help. He didn\u2019t really want to lose them either. Plus, letting his dick hang freely was awesome. It was freedom most guys would wish for.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruby would try to drag us into playing too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it that game that can take eight plus hours to play with experienced people?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d Yang confirmed. \u201cWe tried it at home once and eventually grew tired of playing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU grew tired of playing.\u201d Ruby corrected her. \u201cSo where are you heading, Yang?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you, I promised Blake I wouldn\u2019t make any cat puns for a week and if she would come clubbing with me,\u201d Yang answered and grinned. \u201cKept my end of the bargain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have said ALL puns.\u201d Blake groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t be like that.\u201d Yang threw her arm over Blake\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know several awesome clubs. We can hit the dance floor, you shake your Bellabooty, and all the guys\u2019 jaws will drop.\u201d Blake rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t force Blake to do something that makes her uncomfortable,\u201d Ruby reprimanded. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get Weiss to play a game, but you just want to embarrass her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Ruby.\u201d Blake assured her. \u201cIt\u2019s only one night and there\u2019s nothing wrong with an outing once in a while.\u201d She stood up and tucked her book under her arm. Yang grinned and stood up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will catch you too later then,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if we are staying in Vale overnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, don\u2019t let her travel if she gets too drunk,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cThe last thing we need to hear about is a crashed Bullhead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not flying it.\u201d Yang pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast thing we need!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune watched with interest but found his eyes falling onto Blake\u2019s backside as she walked to deposit her tray. It was a nice butt and Blake wore skintight shorts when not wearing Beacon\u2019s uniform which consisted of skirts. Getting a devious idea and noticing Ruby and Yang arguing slash teasing each other, Jaune aimed the remote and hit the Body Part Swap. There was a flash of green light only he saw and he felt his backside shift. He blinked, knowing that he couldn\u2019t try to look at his butt in public, so he turned towards Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell, but Blake\u2019s ass looked a lot less curvy in the right places. It was the small details. Jaune shifted in his seat and felt the difference. He would have to wait until he came across a mirror to take a look.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s the reason we are leaving this early, since the clubs won\u2019t open until around nine.\u201d She glanced over at Yang, who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy partner needed to place some orders for certain types of ammo and a book,\u201d she explained. \u201cMight as well drag her to have some fun while she\u2019s out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re fun tends to be harmful to others.\u201d Jaune said, earning laughs from Ruby and Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was Weiss cold,\u201d Yang responded, earning collective groans from the others. \u201cHey, that was a great pun after her burn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d Blake explained. Ruby\u2019s lips twitched when Blake called Jaune a she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEt tu, Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune laughed along with the others. Their bickering was a little more insulting than his original team\u2019s talks, but just as entertaining. Since no one really means anything bad from it, except maybe Weiss from time to time, so no one was really offended. Still, Jaune felt a twinge of guilt at leaving his team behind. Even if this was only temporary, he still joined Team RWBY. His mind continued to wonder how Weiss was handling his life as they stepped out onto Beacon\u2019s ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking barefoot on the pavement would have been a little painful to Jaune, if he didn\u2019t have Aura. Thanks to that, it was merely uncomfortable, as he didn\u2019t have any padding. The weather was nice and being naked wasn\u2019t a deterrent. The problem again rose with every step he took. His boobs would bounce up and down, just like before. It started off pleasant and he got slightly turned off on by it, then annoying, then painful. Without something to hold them in place, the strain against them grew unbearable. He truly understood why girls wore bras now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look.\u201d Jaune felt a nudge against his side and saw Ruby pointing to the Bullhead. Turns out they weren\u2019t the only ones heading to Vale. \u201cIt\u2019s Velvet and her team. I can see myself and Coco is wearing my clothes.\u201d Jaune also laughed at the site, only to be drowned out by Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Yang greeted loudly to Coco. \u201cFun trip to Vale?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy favorite store just notified me of a new shipment,\u201d Coco replied. \u201cGot to check out their stock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make the Gothic look work.\u201d Yang pulled Blake over. \u201cBlake and I are hitting the clubs tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice, maybe I should join you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d Ruby moaned and covered her face with her hands. She wasn\u2019t the only one. Velvet, who looked like Ruby thanks to the remote, was mirroring her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose two were a lot of like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Ruby\u2019s distraction into account, Jaune decided to do another small swap. While he enjoyed being naked, he really wanted shoes to protect his feet and a bra to support Yang\u2019s boobs he now had. Funny enough, having his genitals hang free didn\u2019t bother him at all. The only downside to those was Ruby sneaking a peak once in a while. There were a lot of people around but he narrowed it down to three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was Yang. He had her breasts after all and she had his chest, which meant she really didn\u2019t need a bra. He wouldn\u2019t feel guilty about it. Her boots would also be comfortable. The next target was Ruby herself. That mean he would take Coco\u2019s bra and her high heeled boots. They weren\u2019t as high as Weiss\u2019s before he swapped with Zwei so they would be easy enough to manage. He would feel a little guilty about letting Ruby walk around without shoes or support, but he could give it back anytime. The last option was Coco, who was wearing Ruby\u2019s clothing. The temptation to wear Ruby\u2019s bra and black combat boots in front of her without her knowing was strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his decision and clicked the button.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One flash of light later, Jaune\u2019s boobs were securely held by a black and red bra. Black combat boots with red trim reached a couple inches below his knees. He felt a lot more in control of his body now with his chest fully held in place. Underwear being shown in plain sight still didn\u2019t cause any problems and he and Ruby made their way back to the dorm. Ruby didn\u2019t seem to notice anything, even with Jaune puffing out his chest now held by her former bra. Not walking barefoot was nice too, even if he felt a little guilty leaving Coco to walk around without shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll set up the game in just a minute.\u201d Ruby told him and rushed into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune shrugged and decided to see how Weiss\u2019s property changed. Zwei was rubbing against his leg, still dressed in Weiss\u2019s white and blue dress. Even her socks and shoes shrunk down to fit him and Zwei was somehow still wearing them. Jaune scratched him behind the ears and then quickly looked through Weiss\u2019s dressers. The only clothes that existed in there were the collars and bras. They had to be Ruby\u2019s bra because they were all in shades of red and black. She really needed a little more color in her outfits. Jaune then went over to the closet and saw a backup pair of boots, tennis shoes, and some heels that were in Ruby\u2019s area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be seen going through girls\u2019 property, Jaune walked over to the mirror on Weiss\u2019s desk. The reflection in the mirror was showing Weiss, not him, like usual. He couldn\u2019t see his own dick, but his breasts were there on her body, covered by Ruby\u2019s bra. The only piece of clothing Weiss\u2019s reflection had besides the collar and boots. Remembering what he didn\u2019t get to see, he turned and glanced at Weiss\u2019s backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass looked amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, it was Blake\u2019s but it was full and curvy in all the right places. No wonder Yang named it the Bellabooty. He grinned to himself and shook his but a bit, admiring the reflection. His dick was getting hard and he couldn\u2019t risk doing anything as Ruby was in the bathroom right next to him. His intuition was right on the mark, as Ruby popped out not ten seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll start setting up,\u201d she volunteered. \u201cIt takes a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hit the bathroom then too.\u201d Jaune saw her nod and then slipped in, locking the door behind him. He was now alone and realized he could examine himself a little closer if he wanted to. That was risky, as Ruby now had enhanced hearing. He really should just do his business and get out. The Undo option was also an option, as he was back in the room and wasn\u2019t wandering around. He could go back to being naked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He decided to just pee and head back out. As he did his business, his eyes traveled to the mirror and he received a surprise. Normally, a guy peeing wasn\u2019t a bit deal to aim, though some people needed to practice a little more. It helped that male genitals were designed that way. Girls did not have that luxury and thus usually sat down. However, while Jaune had male parts, his reflection was purely Weiss without them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was relieving herself standing up and somehow aiming perfectly into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune gaped at the reflection until he finished. It was the little things that made this remote so amazing. Besides warping reality and all that. It fixed itself to make the adjustments easier. Jaune washed his hands and reached the door, before pausing. He could go out and hang with Ruby or he could do another swap real fast. He could take something like Ruby\u2019s rabbit ears so HE would have the enhanced hearing. Or jut swap something personal. Then there was Zwei, who was still in the room. A swap with the dog allowed him to walk around naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many options.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He decided to enjoy the time with her. Even if he was naked except for a stolen bra supporting stolen boobs. He walked out into the room to find the floor covered in a board, some plastic pieces, dice, and cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ruby started, gesturing to the other side where some face down cards laid. \u201cThe goal of this game is for you to create a kingdom from scratch while the Grimm constantly press down upon you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s historical?\u201d Jaune asked, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, but you can name your own kingdom.\u201d Ruby told him and started explaining the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed pretty straight forward but there were a lot of rules. Eventually he learned enough to start and the two of them played. Roughly an hour later, cards spread out over the floor, Jaune had just fended off a Grimm attack, barely. Ruby had not been so lucky. Her settlements had been overrun due to bad draws and worse luck with dice. She was going to be way behind for some time. It was obvious she was getting a little flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to take a break?\u201d Jaune asked and Ruby huffed, before nodding. It was pretty funny watching Velvet pout. \u201cHow do the swaps feel now that you have Velvet\u2019s body and Coco\u2019s outfit for a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love the hearing,\u201d Ruby replied excitedly. \u201cBut loud noises close by make me jump. I think Nora slammed the door access the hall and it was loud. As for the clothes?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cKind of cool, but I think I like mine better. Can we swap them back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, let me grab the remote.\u201d Jaune turned around and picked up the remote. Knowing he needed to use the Undo option, he had to reset the small Clothing Swap he made. Otherwise Ruby would realize he stole her bra and boots. Blocking her view, he undid the swap before letting Ruby hold onto the remote. Jaune lost Blake\u2019s ass in the process, but Ruby didn\u2019t seem to notice. After a few swaps, Ruby found herself back to normal in her outfit. Jaune was still naked and had Weiss\u2019s boobs. \u201cBetter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Though I may want to try out some swaps with other people too.\u201d She looked down at the game and her position. \u201cWant to do something else for a bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to continue because you\u2019re losing?\u201d Jaune teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are on!\u201d Ruby grinned. \u201cI just need a short break to charge my mojo and I\u2019ll be back to creaming you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even if he maintained some of Weiss\u2019s skills, fighting nude in his condition was going to be problematic. His dick hanging freely was one thing, but boobs bouncing all over the place? If he agreed, he may have to sue the remote to help him out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d Ruby asked and grinned. \u201cChicken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.

Aiming quickly, his finger hit the Clothes Swap, but focused only on a few choice pieces. One unnoticeable flash of green light later, Jaune found himself walking in Ruby\u2019s boots again. Holding his boobs in place once more was her red and black bra. The third and different article of clothes was her red and black panties. He needed something to hold his dick and balls in place while they faught. While it did help to some degree and the fabric was comfortable, the shape of woman\u2019s underwear was not designed to support male genitals. Biting the corner of his mouth as they stepped into the locker room, Jaune made a decisive decision and pressed the remote once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of his panties suddenly became less full as his member vanished. In its place was a young girl\u2019s vagina. Ruby on the other hand, not sported a small bulge under her skirt. Jaune felt a little bad about it but remembered it was her idea to spar knowing she would win. It wasn\u2019t like he planned to look at it. Ruby was one of his best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, it\u2019s weird walking without anything between my legs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune found himself not needing to leave as much space between his legs as he walked. It felt a little weird, but the opposite way growing boobs had felt. It was losing something he was used to versus gaining something he wasn\u2019t. Suddenly realizing he was standing in front of a locker, Jaune reached in and picked up Weiss\u2019s Dust Rapier. Well, it was now technically his he guessed. He picked it up and it felt like it was made for him. A little confused at the feeling, his finger clicked the button and the cylinder rotated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink you can use it?\u201d Ruby asked, walking over to him. Jaune had to avoid staring to see if he could notice her being commando now. The bulge in front of her skirt grew slightly larger. She must have been pitching a tent for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe so?\u201d Jaune flicked the rapier in his hand and did a short thrust. \u201cHuh. Weiss\u2019s life just guides me through it. I bet I can use her Glyphs too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not as amazing as my baby,\u201d Ruby protested, pulling Crescent Rose, her scythe and sniper rifle. \u201cYou know you wish you could use something this amazing. If you ask nicely, maybe I\u2019ll give you a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Crescent Rose is incredible,\u201d Jaune told her. \u201cYOU made it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s eyes widened and her cheeks flushed slightly. If Jaune had been paying close attention, the bulge under her skirt grew even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, let\u2019s get going! We only have a short time before curfew.\u201d She started making her way to the door and Jaune helped up the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m going to enjoy watching you talk up a different weapon than your own, Jaune thought. There wasn\u2019t anything malicious there, it was just going to be amusing watching Ruby think Weiss\u2019s Dust rapier Myrtenaster was the greatest thing on earth. There was a flash of light and Jaune was holding Crescent Rose in its scythe form. He followed Ruby into the ring and transformed Crescent Rose into its scythe mode. \u201cReady?\u201d He asked and swung Crescent Rose once, noticing how natural it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh.\u201d Ruby laughed and held up her Dust rapier. \u201cYou will soon fear the terror that is Myrtenaster. You\u2019re scythe is cool, but nothing to the refined craftsmanship of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrescent Rose has a lot of tricks up its sleeve!\u201d Jaune countered, trying not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Ruby raised an eyebrow and grinned. \u201cThen how about we make it more interesting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoser gets to make a swap with the winner and doesn\u2019t have to switch back for twenty four hours, unless they want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune blinked. He didn\u2019t think Ruby would make any insane swaps and he could have some fun if he won. His eyes fell on her boner pushing up her skirt, shoeless feet leaving her open to sliding on the ground with her socks, and a weapon that was the opposite of what she was used to. This was his best chance at winning now that he had Weiss\u2019s skill and Ruby\u2019s amazing weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This would have been the end of Jaune if Weiss\u2019s life didn\u2019t react instantly. His hand shot down and a white glyph appeared to send him flying up into the air. He aimed Crescent Rose at Ruby and fired a shot, which she narrowly avoided. Myrtenaster clicked in Ruby\u2019s hand and a jet of fire flew at Jaune. Jaune swung his scythe upwards and fired, using the propulsion to shoot back toward the ground and dodge. The moment he landed, Ruby was already switching the Dust in her weapon to send a wave of ice at him. Jaune avoid most of it, but got his leg stuck. Ruby charged and at the last second, her shoeless foot slipped on the ice and she lost her balance. She slid forward, waving her arms, and head-butted Jaune in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune fell backwards, stars spinning around him, and Ruby landed on top of him. Only for her to crash down on Jaune\u2019s knees between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe currently had Jaune\u2019s genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby squeaked and fell over next to Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them just laid there as their Aura began to heal their pain. Jaune had to laugh silently at the cause of the tie. He had stolen Ruby\u2019s shoes and underwear, which kept his parts protected and caused her to slip on the ice in socks. Ruby had then landed on her new penis and the pain prevented her from winning. It was comedic in a way. The weapon switch also made Ruby cause her own downfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Jaune gasped at last. \u201cTie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Tie.\u201d Ruby grudgingly admitted.

Using the remote, we could and I can examine it in details. Weapons are so cool.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou have to switch back, no matter how cool you find Myrtenaster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d They swapped a moment later and Jaune watched Ruby dart around the training room swinging her weapon and firing shots at dummies. Knowing it was her weapon originally, Jaune couldn\u2019t help grinning as she acted like it was the first time she ever touched it. Not to act suspiciously, Jaune tested out a few Dust attacks with Myrtenaster and did a few fancy melee combos combined with glyphs. Eventually, Ruby landed down next to him, a little sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDecided what you want to swap?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune debated it for a moment, he really had everything he needed from her. His first thought was swapping genitals just to give her own vagina back but make her believe that Jaune\u2019s dick was her true equipment. The next option he considered was some kind of person information. Just to cause some change they could laugh about. The third option was swapping eyes. Ruby had really pretty silver eyes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she finally touched the remote, he pressed the button. There was a flash of light and Jaune felt the familiar weight between his legs, though constricted by Ruby\u2019s stolen panties. \u201cWell? How do you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026weird,\u201d Ruby mumbled, her face crimson. \u201cLet\u2019s get going so we can swap back.\u201d Jaune laughed and they put their weapons away, knowing they would go back to the right lockers after they undid the swap. The trip back to the dorms was tough for Ruby and hilarious for Jaune. \u201cWhy are you so unaffected buy it?\u201d She demanded. Her walking was a little off, like she wanted to compensate for a dick but kept realizing she didn\u2019t have one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just use to swapping I guess.\u201d Jaune answered truthfully. Ruby stuck her tongue out at him and they finally reached the dorm. The moment they entered, Ruby grabbed the remote in his hand and pressed Undo twice. \u201cWoah, easy there, Rubes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d Ruby cried out in relief and patted the front of her skirt. \u201cI feel complete again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune almost broke down into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep playing.\u201d Ruby said pointing to the game still on the floor.

If he pushed his luck, he might be able to get her to concede something before they left. \u201cSure you aren\u2019t subconsciously wishing I was your partner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d Ruby protested and flailed her arms. \u201cI really want to spend time with her. We get along now\u2026 somewhat. So this is a chance to deepen our bond. If anything, I wish you would swap places with Yang. It\u2019s so annoying having your older sister watch over you like a hawk. And her jokes? Don\u2019t get me started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune began to get an inkling of a plan. The trick was to get Ruby to agree to it. That shouldn\u2019t be too hard if he worded this right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I could help,\u201d he relented. \u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of forcing Weiss to do something she doesn\u2019t want, but it would be for a good cause.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you get to go to a tropical island. The best we can hope for is a trip to my parents. Pyrrha\u2019s too famous back in Mistral, and Ren and Nora are orphans, so they were just planning to stay here or go with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Ruby rubbed her chin and Jaune had to force himself not to grin.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nIt\u2019s working.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cI got an idea!\u201d Ruby announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on?\u201d Jaune replied, trying very hard not to let his amusement show through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you swap with Weiss and get her to agree,\u201d Ruby started off hesitantly. \u201cWe can have you swap lives with Yang and you can come along.\u201d Her eyes brighten as she continued. \u201cNot only would I have my two bestest friends with me, I won\u2019t have to deal with Yang\u2019s humor either. It\u2019s perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jaune said, pretending to hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease!\u201d Ruby pleaded. \u201cYou would get a cool vacation for free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Jaune laughed. \u201cBut might I suggest just a team swap? Rather than a Life Swap? This way we won\u2019t have any\u2026 awkward situation if we have to use the same\u2026 changing area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 right.\u201d Ruby\u2019s face flushed. If Jaune was living as her sister, they would be expected to stay in the same room and change together as they were both considered girls. \u201cGood idea. Do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get Weiss to agree to the trip today,\u201d Jaune told her. \u201cThen tomorrow, right before you leave, we swap. You need to touch the remote too to remember the swap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis remote is so awesome,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cI know I said that before, but it still is. Maybe we can test it out a bit while we are there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet we will.\u201d Jaune pulled the remote out of his pocket. \u201cShall we go see Weiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them headed back to Ruby\u2019s room where they found the door open. They could hear Yang and Blake talking with Weiss about the situation and promising everything will be fine. Weiss looked on the verge of saying yes, but needed that one final push. Jaune aimed the remote with Ruby touching it and hit Life Swap. There was a flash of green light and Jaune found himself living Weiss\u2019s life once again. He still felt silly in her clothes and swore he could hear Ruby laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you two are so insistent,\u201d Jaune said, sounding like Weiss by letting her life guide him after Blake and Yang stopped talking. \u201cI\u2019ll go. I can\u2019t let a little fear stop me from living my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnew you would see it our way.\u201d Yang said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom was quite insistent on bringing my entire team.\u201d Blake added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second their back was turn, Jaune stepped out into the hall where Ruby was. She grabbed the remote and he hit the undo button. A second later, he was back in his life and saw Ruby talking to Weiss. Appearing satisfied with something, Weiss went back into their room and Ruby zipped over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt worked!\u201d She told him eagerly. \u201cShe\u2019s going. I need to go pack, but I\u2019ll meet you tomorrow so you can swap positions with Yang. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it.\u201d Ruby left and Jaune was free to plan his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things a little interesting, since he was going to swap teams with Yang, why not swap with someone beforehand? Ruby didn\u2019t have to know and it would just make his time there a little more interesting. He could go as someone completely different, maybe a Faunus? It was Menagerie after all, their continent. Or maybe he should go as another person? His team members or possibly another team. Then there was the option of becoming a teacher.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had a small market he could get some fruit native to his hometown that was harder to find at the regular supermarkets. A few of the shop owners knew him and. because he didn\u2019t harbor any ill will to Faunus, they welcomed him.  He walked down the streets along the familiar path and entered the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Jaune.\u201d A kindly old man welcomed him.

Funny enough, this was true. Nora told him the way they exploded made it even more fun. The reason he was there just happened to be different this time. \u201cHow\u2019s business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWent down a little, but now that the White Fang is actually settling down and working with the Vale council on peace talks, it\u2019s picking up again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time,\u201d Jaune agreed. \u201cWe have the Grimm out there.

The current leader of the White Fang?\u201d The man looked at him incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Jaune apologized. \u201cBeen stuck in Beacon doing a lot of training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. I suppose fighting Grimm does keep a young boy busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this Sienna Kahn, is she still in the city?\u201d Jaune asked, an inkling idea beginning to form. The White Fang did originate in Menagerie\u2026. So maybe swapping with the current leader would be entertaining?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, she\u2019s bound to be returning to her hotel there.\u201d He pointed toward a large building in the middle of Vale. \u201cLot of security, but she should be doing a press release shortly. You might be able to catch the end of it if you hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do just that,\u201d Jaune said, throwing some Lein on the counter. \u201cThanks for the fruit and info!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome back anytime.\u201d The main waved as Jaune dashed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune ran through the city, making his way to the hotel.

Surprisingly, being a Hunter-in-Training was actually a benefit. The person checking ID and making sure they didn\u2019t bring any contraband actually looked impressed the younger generation was taking an interest in politics. Jaune entered the room and looked around as he took a seat in the back. He wasn\u2019t lucky or important enough to get a close seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of the room was what he imagined it to be. There was a podium with tables on either side. Reporters and cameras were set up in the first few rows. Behind them were the wealthier looking individuals. Behind those people were everyone else who bothered to come. A quick glance told Jaune there were a great many Faunus here looking and chattering eagerly. The rich folks looked a little uncomfortable and the amount of police presence leaning against walls and waiting by doors was probably stationed there for their protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026we were forced to turn to violence to gain attention,\u201d the young female currently at the podium was saying. \u201cSome of us took it too far. We do not desire a war against the humans; we only fight for equality\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was Sienna Khan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSienna was a female, Bengal tiger-based Faunus with orange eyes, dark complexion and wild black, chin-length hair with an asymmetrical bob style. Her Faunus trait manifested as an extra pair of ears, and her body was adorned with numerous tattoos resembling tiger stripes.[2] She wore four golden earrings on three of her ears, one each on her Human ears, and two on her left Faunus ear as well as a small jewel on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was seen wearing a form-fitting black dress with light green accents on the rims of the outfit; the dress left most of her back open, had two long splits on the side which revealed a pair of black shorts. Over the dress, she wore a back-revealing red cape with gold accents, as well as a green waist cincher with red rims that had a black belt over it, which fastened a green pouch on her right hip. Aside from that, she wore black stockings in conjunction with green sandals that had red laces which were tied to her calves, as well as a black elbow length fingerless glove on her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/f/f6/Sienna_V5_Profile.png/revision/latest?cb=20171024152536\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was temporarily captive by the woman\u2019s voice and passion, before he shook his head and pulled out the remote.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One green flash of light later, Jaune had to hide a snicker as he saw himself standing up on stage talking passionately about Faunus rights. The reason it was so funny was because he saw himself up there wearing Sienna\u2019s black dress and accessories. He tried to keep a straight face though, because he didn\u2019t want people to think he was laughing at her. Now that the swap was done, it was time to go, but he couldn\u2019t leave just yet. The room was crowded and he had just arrived. It would be suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he had to sit there for over an hour listening to her talk about Faunus rights and taking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t like Faunus rights. Jaune actually supported them. It\u2019s just when you live near Blake, you heard a lot of the talking points already. The violence against Faunus was an issue and Jaune swore he would help anyone he saw getting bullied, human or Faunus. While he was there, he figured he might as well listen and learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother benefit he had, now that he possessed Sienna\u2019s body, was the fact he had a new set of ears. It was like Ruby had mentioned to him before when she swapped with Velvet. You could hear so much more and even small background sounds were noticeable. It took a little bit of time to get used to some of the people shouting and he flinched when someone near him yelled suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, Sienna stepped down and some of the people began to leave. Jaune followed their example and left. He wasn\u2019t too worried about his body. Sienna had a number of guards and was a high profile person. It was getting late and Jaune had to hurry back to Beacon. Ruby was supposed to meet up with him early in the morning before they left to swap with Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back to Beacon, Jaune did take the opportunity to admire his new body. Sienna was fit and flexing revealed how acrobatic she was. It kind of reminded him of Blake and Pyrrha in that regard. Agile fighters rather than brute force users like Yang and Cardin. He pulled back the sleeves of his hoody and revealed more stripe tattoos on his skin.  A ghost of wind hit him and he reached up to brush some of his new black hair out of his eyes. Night began to fall and he could still see perfectly fine, even in areas with less lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaunus night vision was handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune finally made it back to his room and saw the rest of his team already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back,\u201d Ren said and noticed Jaune\u2019s arms were empty. \u201cDid they not have the issue you were looking for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr... no.\u201d Jaune replied, thinking fast. \u201cI must have misread the notice online. They were only taking pre orders and it\u2019s not coming in until later this month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be more careful, Jaune-Jaune,\u201d Nora replied, looking up from her bed. She was wearing a tight black shirt with the word \u2018boop\u2019 on it in white, with the second o in pink. Pink booty shorts with white dots finished her PJ ensemble. \u201cPyrrha was getting worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I was delayed because I stopped by to listen to Sienna Khan give a speech about Faunus rights.\u201d Jaune answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe current leader of the White Fang?\u201d Pyrrha asked, turning to him. She had been brushing her hair while wearing a white tank top with red booty shorts of her own. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were interested in politics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know Oobleck\u2019s been giving us assignments about current events right?\u201d Jaune asked, glad he had a valid excuse to give. \u201cIf he assigns us another one as a surprise again, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d Pyrrha looked impressed. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you taking the initiative, Jaune.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Pyr.\u201d Inside, Jaune felt like garbage as he was lying to her face. He promised to make it up for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s our fearless leader for you,\u2019 Nora said to Ren. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for his next team outing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither can I,\u201d Ren agreed. \u201cThey always turn into something interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaune got ready for bed, he realized something as he changed into his own pajamas. It wasn\u2019t Sienna\u2019s naked body that distracted him though. She was hot, don\u2019t get him wrong. It was just he had seen several naked girls bodies recently and learned to control himself a bit. It was just her body reminded him of something. He mentally kicked himself for forgetting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should have swapped wardrobes with Sienna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis previous experience with body swapping should have told him that. It didn\u2019t bother him now, but eventually he would need a bra, not to mention other clothes like swim suits. Menagerie was an island nation. His eyes traveled to Nora and Pyrrha. They were the two optimal choices.  Nora\u2019s clothes consisted of a lot of white and pink outfits, while Pyrrha had a lot of red. Either would work. If he swapped tonight, he would be all ready for tomorrow. If he waited, there might be a window of opportunity to swap with someone else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nora on the other hand was now writing in her notebook wearing Jaune\u2019s sweatshirt and jeans. Jaune took a moment to glance down at his skin. His tanned legs had the black tattoo stripes too. They weren\u2019t restricted to his arms. He felt the restrictiveness of Nora\u2019s bra on his chest and adjusted it slightly. Sienna had an average size chest, but Nora had a pretty impressive, if you didn\u2019t compare it to Yang. The swap adjusted the clothes, but the position had been off slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune slumped back into the bed and he saw Nora get up. He found it interesting that Nora had originally changed into pajamas, but was now changing into Jaune\u2019s blue Pumpkin Pete onesie out of her part of the closet. She did change in the bathroom and then jumped on her beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora,\u201d Ren admonished. \u201cPlease try to avoid doing that. If the strings break, you won\u2019t be able to sleep comfortably.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh.\u201d Nora waved him off. \u201cAs long as I got my onsie, I\u2019ll be comfortable and warm anywhere I go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is kind of cute,\u201d Pyrrha admitted. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you ate enough boxes of cereal to win one of those.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Nora,\u201d Ren reminded her. \u201cShe won it in a contest for eating cereal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as good as pancakes,\u201d Nora added. \u201cSorry, Pyrrha. I know you were their mascot for a bit, but that cereal wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t very healthy either.\u201d Pyrrha agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune laughed quietly to himself and talked with his teammates late into the night. Since he was going off with Ruby\u2019s team tomorrow morning, he wouldn\u2019t see them for a few days. Team JNPR had always been close, like a family. Ren the quiet one, Nora the crazy fun one, Pyrrha the polite yet unbeatable one, and Jaune, their leader. Why he was made a leader still escaped him. Still, he was glad to have met them all. Everyone began to fall asleep and Jaune quietly waited until he heard the familiar noises indicating they were really asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand began to reach down between his legs and began to massage his slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Sienna\u2019s naked body turned him on and it took a lot of self-control to avoid doing something at that time. Now that he was wearing tight form fitting clothes he stole from Nora, he could see how sexy Sienna looked. He couldn\u2019t help himself. Two fingers entering were all it took and Jaune shoved his other hand into his mouth as he came. Smiling to himself, he fell asleep almost immediately afterwards.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following Saturday morning, there wasn\u2019t anything that required their immediate attention, so Team JNPR had a lazy morning. Nora had woken them up early and they were playing cards while taking turns in the shower. She was wearing a black low cut shirt with red trim and a long crimson skirt. Jaune was currently wearing a pink shirt with a white heart on the front and a white skirt. It was something simple he found in his wardrobe. A knock on their door interrupted their game, and Jaune jumped to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door he saw the person he expected, Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost forgot I promised to help Ruby with something real fast before her team leaves,\u201d Jaune called over his shoulder. A little white lie wouldn\u2019t hurt. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a couple minutes.\u201d Pyrrha nodded and Nora waved to him, so he was given the go ahead. Shutting the door behind him, he turned to Ruby. \u201cSo, same plan or you have something different in mind? I know we plan for me to take Yang\u2019s place, but how do we want to do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLife would make everyone see you as her, right?\u201d Ruby muttered and Jaune nodded. \u201cIt would be weird to see you as a girl, but it might make things go smoother if all of us are girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then your team would all have to change in front of me,\u201d Jaune reminded her. This was actually a little funny, as he had a female body, but everyone still saw him as a boy. It wasn\u2019t like he still had a dick. \u201cWhile the rest of your team won\u2019t notice, you would. If we use a Personal Information Swap, then it would be like I was part of your team the entire time. Blake and Weiss would consider a guy being on the team as normal and I would be able to change and sleep separately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might be a little weird to have you and Weiss on the same team,\u201d Ruby pointed out. \u201cWith your attempts to court her in all.\u201d She grinned as Jaune looked embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still think she\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to respect her wishes that she doesn\u2019t feel that way about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s really mature of you.\u201d Ruby complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say that,\u201d Jaune reminded her. \u201cRight before we use a reality changing remote to get rid of your sister for a friend so you can have fun and don\u2019t have to listen to puns.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was mature.\u201d Ruby protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you should drink more milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Jaune elbowed in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo whatever we decide.\u201d He continued. \u201cJust make sure both of us are touching the remote.\" Ruby nodded and went back into her room to get Yang.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jaune and Ruby grasped the remote tightly as Jaune hit the Personal Info Swap button. There was a flash of green light and then nothing. Jaune and Ruby looked at each other. Nothing seemed to have changed and neither of them felt different. Until Yang turned to address them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy address, she ran forward and wrapped Ruby in a bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy little sister is going off on her own without me for days,\u201d Yang said, as Ruby struggled to get out. \u201cDon\u2019t get into trouble while I\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGettoff!\u201d Ruby yelled into Yang\u2019s chest before finally escaping. \u201cI\u2019m not on my own. I\u2019m with my team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of them is a boy,\u201d Yang reminded her and then turned to Jaune. She put an arm over his shoulder. \u201cListen, I know you wouldn\u2019t take advantage of Ruby, but I have to threaten you with bodily harm if you do. It\u2019s a sister thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool. I have seven of them too. We are friends and the trips more for Blake to meet her family.\u201d Jaune felt nothing but relief when Yang let go. It wasn\u2019t like he still had his original body. Sienna was a full blown female, not that Yang could tell. In her eyes, he was still Jaune. A boy and close friend with Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, make sure to take plenty of pictures. I want to know all about the trip.\u201d After Ruby promised her, Yang walked into Jaune\u2019s old room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was\u2026 weird?\u201d Jaune said to Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid it just swap rooms or\u2026\u201d Ruby trailed off as they entered her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was immediately answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the room looked the same, but Yang\u2019s bed above Blake\u2019s had a bright pink trunk that was packed with clothes that Jaune recognized as Nora. The nearby desk had all of Jaune\u2019s books, notebooks, and magazines. He only swapped clothes with Nora after all. Ruby realized all of Yang\u2019s stuff was gone and as far as she remembered, Jaune had always been a male with a female body, tanned skin, tiger ears, stripe tattoos, and a tendency to wear white, pink, and orange clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time!\u201d Weiss snapped at them, causing them to jump from her surprise appearance. Jaune\u2019s tiger ears slammed against his head at the sudden noise. They were so sensitive. \u201cWe need to get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to catch the Bullhead in\u2026 30 minutes.\u201d Blake informed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo last call to make sure you dolts are packed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Jaune shared a look before rushing to their luggage.

A quick check showed all the clothes, his hygiene kit, and other person items, like comic books, were already packed. Yang must have been about done and when the remote swapped them, it had been if Jaune packed. As he zipped up the pink trunk and followed the others, he began to see flashes of memories from during their time living together and initiation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby caught his eye and snickered and he figured she was experiencing the same memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was now Blake\u2019s partner and their first meeting hadn\u2019t been ideal, but it could have been worse. Blake had stumbled him stuck to the tree by Pyrrha\u2019s spear and unlocked his aura. She didn\u2019t speak a lot to him still, but they had conversations in this reality. Blake finally began to open up and he was learning she was quite funny when she wanted to be. She and Ruby had at least shared a laugh at Jaune\u2019s pitiful attempt to flirt with Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the memories showed their relationship was pretty similar to his old team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly difference was a couple times either he walked in on or someone walked in on him in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was usually his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bullhead was a short ride to Vale, but it didn\u2019t make it any less comfortable for Jaune. He still had motion sickness. Swapping bodies with Sienna didn\u2019t fix that. As much as Ruby liked him, she sat far away from in along with Weiss. Blake had joined them, though that was more to protect her book in her hand. He didn\u2019t blame them. Not after the first meeting he had with Ruby and Yang, giving him the nickname Vomit Boy. He closed his eyes and that helped a little. Weiss and Ruby were talking excitedly and Blake occasionally explained something about Menagerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured he would have to catch up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat they transferred too was rather large, but it wasn\u2019t a giant ship by any means. It was designed with enough weapons to defeat the occasional Grimm and travel the seas from Vale to Menagerie. The first thing the four of them did was check in and find their room and drag their luggage in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of small.\u201d Weiss said immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry it\u2019s not a luxury cruise,\u201d Blake replied curtly. \u201cThere are only a few ships willing to travel to Menagerie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d Weiss stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake chuckled and the tension dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean, but we are only going to be on here for a day. At least there are four beds and they all have mattresses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would suck if they were just canvas.\u201d Jaune agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLearned from experience?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Jaune rubbed the back of his head. \u201cHaving some work done on the house and we had to adjust. My room was unlivable so I slept on the floor while my sister got the couch. A sleeping bag isn\u2019t much support if you don\u2019t have some kind of padding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a much better older sibling then Yang is,\u201d Ruby complimented. \u201cShe would have stolen the couch immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad she\u2019s not on our team,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cSorry, Ruby. Her jokes are insufferable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d Ruby replied and caught Jaune\u2019s eye. He had to hold back a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss missed it, but Blake\u2019s eyes darted between the two of them. She knew something happened between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we are settled in, it\u2019s time to explore the ship!\u201d Ruby declared. \u201cCome on, Weiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you dolt!\u201d Weiss cried out, but to no avail. Ruby grabbed her wrist and pulled the poor girl after her. Jaune and Blake chuckled at her expression before she vanished from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to get some fresh air on deck.\u201d Blake informed Jaune before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jaune had to decide what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While he joined the team due to Ruby\u2019s request, it wasn\u2019t like this was their first time hanging out. She was going to treat him like normal. They were friends on a trip. Who knows? Maybe they might decide to make this a permanent thing. He might as well treat it like it was always the case until he and Ruby find another use for it. He locked the room behind him and headed toward the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was leaning against the rails as the ship began to depart. A few other passengers were milling around, but most were probably below deck in their room. Jaune walked over to her and, instead of saying anything, just leaned up against the rail next to her. The salty sea breeze felt nice and he just relaxed. He could feel Blake stiffen next to him but relaxed the moment she realized he wasn\u2019t forcing her to talk. Minutes passed and Jaune lost track of how long the two of them were standing there. Part of him believed he heard Ruby and Weiss shouting below deck a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI left Menagerie without letting my parents know.\u201d Blake said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo join the White Fang,\u201d Blake answered in a low voice. \u201cBack when they were peaceful. Then once things started getting bad, I left for Beacon. I wasn\u2019t sure when I would go back home, if ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going back now.\u201d Jaune pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 probably because of you and Ruby\u2026 and a little of Weiss.\u201d Blake replied and actually let out a soft laugh. \u201cThe three of you\u2026 really helped me open up. Ruby\u2019s innocence, your loyalty, and Weiss\u2019s acceptance of who I really am.\u201d She sighed and reached up to the bow on her head and slowly untied it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going back home, I won\u2019t need this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it helps, I think you look better without it.\u201d Jaune offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rolled her eyes, but she was definitely smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cIf you\u2019re that good at pickup lines, what happened with your attempts courting Weiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 that was completely different. I wasn\u2019t trying to pick you up\u2026 very funny.\u201d He noticed the amused look on her face and she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little joke,\u201d she assured him. \u201cMy mom will probably like you. Especially Ruby. My dad is a little\u2026 intense, but he\u2019s still very kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me you made sure to let him know we are just friends.\u201d Jaune begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hilarious.\u201d The fact she could say that with a straight face and somewhat of a monotone actually made it funny. \u201cI\u2019m still a little worried about Weiss here though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause of her family?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Blake nodded. \u201cA lot of Faunus don\u2019t like the Schnee family and some may blame her for what her father did. You and Ruby might experience some fallout too, for associating with her and being humans.\u201d She turned and looked at the ears on his head. \u201cYou might be able to pass as a Faunus due to your ears. Ruby won\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune made a mental note that while that knew him knew he was a human, Sienna\u2019s body might cause confusion to others. This could be a blessing and a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Jaune assured her. He could tell that\u2019s what she wanted. \u201cAnyone who meets Ruby will become her friend.

The four of them talked a bit more than Blake and Weiss went to talk about something in private. This let Jaune and Ruby catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying the trip so far/\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby\u2026 we haven\u2019t even gotten the Menagerie yet.\u201d Jaune reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Right. Hehe.\u201d Ruby tapped her head. \u201cI just really want my best friends to have fun.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cSo what were you and Blake doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalking.\u201d Jaune shrugged. \u201cIn this reality, seems like you and I really helped Blake come out of her shell. So she and I are pretty close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClose?\u201d Ruby looked worried for a moment. \u201cHow so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like she confesses in me about things.\u201d Jaune shrugged. \u201cI assume it\u2019s probably similar to what she and Yang shared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Jaune still didn\u2019t notice Ruby seemed to be down about something. \u201cIt probably helps that even though you\u2019re human, you have tiger ears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 did come up.\u201d Jaune confirmed. \u201cSoooo\u2026 did you want to use the remote? Have a little fun on the boat ride?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d Ruby hugged him. \u201cSo what should I swap? I\u2019m thinking something with Blake or Weiss. Everyone else is a stranger except you, and we swapped a lot of stuff already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you thinking of swapping?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d Ruby stared at their friends across the boat. \u201cMaybe Blake\u2019s ears? We could match then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve tried Faunus ears already,\u201d Jaune reminded her. \u201cHow about taking Weiss\u2019s clothes? You could practice using heels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwww.\u201d They both laughed. \u201cWhat if we try something more intangible? Like a personality or persona info swap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Jaune rubbed his chin. \u201cThey can have some unexpected consequences, but if I don\u2019t swap and can watch you, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ruby decide on?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She may wear lady stilts, but that\u2019s part of the challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Jaune mumbled, amused, as Ruby aimed the remote with his hand on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light and Ruby was wearing Weiss\u2019s white and blue dress, along with her high heel boots. Immediately, Ruby stumbled and Jaune grabbed her arm to stabilize her. Jaune took the opportunity to glance over at Blake and Weiss. Weiss was now wearing Ruby\u2019s red and black gothic style dress and combat boots, along with her signature red cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid stilts.\u201d Ruby mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can feel the ocean breeze over my legs a lot more,\u201d Ruby commented, looking herself over and then straighter the tiara on her head that use to belong to Weiss. Ruby usually wore really tall black stockings \u201cLuckily it\u2019s not cold out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the world of skirts.\u201d Jaune told her, not that he didn\u2019t find out that a little while ago. He was wearing Nora\u2019s clothes now. His skirt was just a simple white one, while Ruby now had Weiss\u2019s expensively designed one. \u201cPlus, heading south helps a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd my chest is a little cooler, she should cover up more.\u201d Ruby suddenly went red when she realized she was talking to Jaune. \u201cEep! Forget I said anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget what?\u201d Jaune asked, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 Ah, you\u2019re such a doofus, Vomit Boy.\u201d She punched his shoulder playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as big as you Crater Face.\u201d Jaune replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for being my friend, Jaune.\u201d Ruby said seriously. \u201cI mean it. You helped me build confidence when I enter Beacon. I don\u2019t think I would be able to have talked to Weiss if I hadn\u2019t met you first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime.\u201d Jaune assured her and gave her a won arm hug. He didn\u2019t notice how red Ruby\u2019s face became. She still saw him as male, just with a female tiger Faunus body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though, they were mainly looking at Weiss, with some at Ruby. No one seemed initially hostile, but if they were directed at him, it would be uncomfortable to say the least. Maybe it was what Blake mentioned back on the ship. She was a Faunus and he looked like a Faunus, so at a distance people would think he was one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIgnore them,\u201d Ruby said and spread her arms wide. \u201cLook at how cool this place is. The water\u2019s crystal clear, lots of beaches, tropical fruit stalls everywhere. I want to see it all.\u201d Walking around at night in Weiss\u2019s heels finally got her use to them. She was able to keep up at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you give you a tour, Ruby.\u201d Blake promised as they made their way to town. \u201cBet you don\u2019t know which one of the houses is mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe big one up on the hill?\u201d Jaune teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake faced him immediately, with her mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Jaune gaped back. \u201cIt\u2019s the big one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Blake,\u201d Ruby gasped. \u201cYou never told us you were rich.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always wondered how you afforded all those books,\u201d Weiss muttered to herself. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t rich,\u201d Blake told them, her cheeks slightly red. \u201cJust well off. My dad\u2019s\u2026. the chief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh political figure.\u201d Weiss nodded her head. \u201cWealthy, but not rich. You can afford a lot of stuff, but nothing everything.\u201d Blake nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are your parents like?\u201d Ruby asked, as they drew near the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s rather large,\u201d Blake described. \u201cHe can be kind of intimidating, especially since he doesn\u2019t talk a lot. He\u2019s nice though and unless you really do something wrong, he\u2019s not going to hate you. My mom is\u2026 intrusive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIntrusive?\u201d Ruby and Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooo.\u201d Jaune flinched. \u201cI got a sister like that. She\u2019s going to want to know everything that happened and try to show us baby pictures isn\u2019t she?\u201d Blake nodded and looked at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake as a baby,\u201d Ruby squeaked. \u201cI bet she was adorable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see either.\u201d Weiss agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake glared at them and Jaune winked at her, earning him a glare. He tried to act sorry and the ears on his head flattened. They reached the house and Blake sighed. She reached up and used the large metal knocker.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first glance, this woman was obviously related to Blake. As a cat Faunus with black hair and yellow eyes, she shares several physical features with Blake, although her ears were noticeably larger in size and had more fur details. She had short hair and three gold piercings on her cat ears; two on her right, and one on her left. She wore a black hakama and sandals with white tabi socks. Over her outfit, she wore a black shrug with a long right sleeve and a short left sleeve, gold leaf trim adorning the opening on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/B56KnTyvp1j57EGz8\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/B56KnTyvp1j57E...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake! It is you!\u201d The woman ran forward and wrapped her arms around her. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you. I wasn't sure when you would arrive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never told us you had a sister,\" Jaune said to Blake before he could stop himself. Blake turned and looked at him in bewilderment. Weiss face palmed and Ruby giggled. The woman looked at him too and he began to see some age lines on her face. Even though she looked fit, age was hard to fight. Her expression on the other hand changed quickly from surprise to excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 I like him.\u201d She whispered to Blake, who flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune had heard every word too with his enhanced hearing and was equally embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d Blake hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, dear. Let me meet your friends.\u201d The woman zipped past Blake to shake Jaune\u2019s hand.  \u201cI\u2019m Kali Belladonna, Blake\u2019s mother. You can call me Kali. You must be Jaune Arc. Blake\u2019s told me all about you. Though, she didn\u2019t mention how proficient you are at flattery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was luck,\u201d Jaune replied sheepishly, rubbing the back of his head. \u201cI usually shove my foot in my mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, Blake had only good things about you.\u201d Kali reassured him. \u201cI\u2019m glad someone can stand up to my daughter\u2019s stubbornness.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know she had a partner she can count on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMooom!\u201d Blake complained as Kali emphasized the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Kali.\u201d Weiss introduced. \u201cI\u2019m Weiss Schnee. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you and thank you for allow us to visit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was no problem, dear.\u201d Kali gave her a hug. \u201cI really wanted to meet you all and see Blake again. Has she grown out of the habit of running away before explaining herself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Weiss wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMooooom!\u201d Blake was now obviously embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you must be Ruby!\u201d Kali continued, moving onto the last member of their team. Even Ruby\u2019s speed couldn\u2019t react in time and she was trapped by the woman\u2019s embrace. \u201cI saw a picture, but you are even cuter than I recall. And so talented too. Getting into Beacon two years early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 nice to meet you too,\u201d Ruby gasped. \u201cThank you for letting us crash here for a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, it was my pleasure.\u201d Kali assured her, before letting her go. \u201cCome in, come in, everyone.\u201d She started gesturing them inside. \u201cYou must be tired from your trip. Would you like to unpack, explore a bit? Maybe have a snack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could only follow silently, her face a deep crimson.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think\u2026 you showing her how much your mom means to you will help heal, and then you can apologize and elaborate. I\u2019ll calm her down a bit first, assure her this isn\u2019t serious. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hesitated and nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d She whispered and hugged him quickly, before turning around to help her mom in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby?\u201d Jaune asked, knowing on the bathroom door. \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d He heard a sniffle in her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby, let me talk. Please.\u201d The door clicked open and Ruby opened it, signs she had been crying. Jaune did the only thing he could do and gave her a hug. \u201cRuby\u2026 you know Blake didn\u2019t mean that. Sometimes, we get embarrassed or angry at our parents and complain. You and Yang complain about your dad all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Ruby nodded in his arms, wrapping her own around him. \u201cI just\u2026 she reminds me of all the stories dad told me about my mom. Kind and friendly\u2026 I want to experience that, but I can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby...\u201d Jaune stared at her incredulously. \u201cYou do realize I have an reality altering swap remote?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss is right, I\u2019m a dolt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes you are.\u201d They both laughed. \u201cSo, what do you want to swap?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruby\u2019s team was supposed to leave in like two hours so if they couldn\u2019t convince Weiss in time, Jaune was supposed to swap with her. However, about an hour later, his Scroll pinged with a message from Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She agreed to go.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune shrugged and pocketed his scroll. That didn\u2019t change his plans at all. He really didn\u2019t want to be stuck in Beacon for a week. As part of the detention, they couldn\u2019t leave the school grounds without permission. Team RWBY was leaving Beacon for a vacation and Jaune really wanted to go. He had heard of Menagerie before. It was the main Faunus city on the beach and was supposed to be beautiful, even if most of the lands beyond that wasn\u2019t the most hospitable. His plan was to sneak aboard and go along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t a monster though and didn\u2019t want to take any of the girls\u2019 spot permanently. Sure, he may swap with them periodically, but they still deserve to have fun at this festival. He forgot what was being celebrated but thought it had to do with the founding. When Ruby mentioned they were taking Zwei, Jaune hatched his plan. He was going to Life Swap with Zwei to board the ship with them. He would keep his body and everyone would see him as a dog. The only thing he had to be careful of was Ruby noticing the remote. She wouldn\u2019t notice him at all, but the remote would raise questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he decided to do a Life and Wardrobe Swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant he would have clothes and pockets to hide the remote, rather than carry it in his hand. He knew the remote worked on animals from yesterday\u2019s test. Jaune waited at a window in an empty classroom overlooking the Bullhead landing platform until he saw Ruby, Weiss, Blake, and Yang head to one with bags. Tied to a leash being led by Ruby was Zwei. Jaune held up the remote, aimed, and clicked the button. There was a flash of green light and Jaune found himself standing in the grass behind Ruby. A leash was attached to his shirt but he didn\u2019t have a collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Zwei!\u201d Ruby told him, pulling. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like Bullheads, but it\u2019s only a short flight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on him,\u201d Weiss reprimanded her and then turned to Jaune. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d She patted her legs to draw his attention. \u201cYou can cuddle with me during the ride to the docks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah.\u201d Yang waved her hand dismissively. \u201cI got some of his treats in my bag. He will be by my side the second I take it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust keep him away from me.\u201d Blake mumbled and walked into the Bullhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich girl does Jaune go with as Zwei?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She reached over and patted Jaune\u2019s head and he instantly felt bliss. He was living a dog\u2019s life so it was only natural he would like what a dog did. Ruby looked slightly disappointed but Yang didn\u2019t. Blake was just glad he wasn\u2019t anywhere near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Jaune\u2019s point of view, this was a no brainer. He finally got to spend time with the girl he liked. Of course being himself would have been better, but he would take what he could get. Thinking what a dog would do in this situation, Jaune scooted around in the seat and laid his head in Weiss\u2019s lap. She laughed and scratched him behind the ears. No one noticed half his body laying on the ground as he couldn\u2019t fit in the chair due to having his own body. Things got even better when Weiss leaned down and kissed him on the nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was their first kiss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, only he would know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls started talking about the trip and Blake explained a bit about Menagerie\u2019s festival. It was celebrating the founding and Faunus fight for equal rights. Jaune was only half listening, enjoying the intimate contact with Weiss. Yang must have gotten bored because Jaune heard a box rustle and his instincts caused him to raise his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Zwei!\u201d Yang said shaking the box. \u201cWant a treat for being a good boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was just about to fall asleep.\u201d Weiss chastised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZwei loves his treats.\u201d Ruby said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was in a pickle. He really didn\u2019t want to eat the dog treat but with everyone watching him, he had to act natural. Saliva actually formed in his mouth as Zwei\u2019s life told him he really wanted that treat. He could risk not taking it but the girls might think he was sick or something. He could also try to get out of it with the remote, but he risked someone, especially Ruby, noticing it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yang tossed him a treat and he raised his head up to grab it in midair. He bit down, chewed, and tried to swallow as fast as he could. To his surprise, it didn\u2019t taste bad, just dry. Life Swaps affected tastes. He just now remembered during Weiss\u2019s life he was attracted to healthy food. Once he ate it and discovering it wasn\u2019t bad he stepped over to Yang and stood in front of her. He felt like he wanted more and just went along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Yang put the box away. \u201cWe can\u2019t have you getting fat. One per day.\u201d Jaune felt sadness over take him and she must have noticed. \u201cCome here.\u201d She reached out, wrapped her arms around him, and pulled his face into her breasts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune accidentally spoke and was worried what would happen. However, Yang just laughed and he realized it must have sounded like a bark. Deciding to take advantage of the situation, Jaune shook his head in her breasts. He\u2019s not sure what they saw Zwei doing, but Yang didn\u2019t seem to mind and she started talking to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s how Jaune spent the rest of the Bullhead ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls would talk and eventually one of them would want him to come over and he would. He got to lay in Weiss\u2019s laugh with the occasional kiss, scratched and hug by Yang, and Ruby even gave him a tummy rub. Being a dog was awesome. No responsibilities, girls loved him, and he could do all sorts of things normal guys couldn\u2019t. Only Blake disliked him and he knew why. A bonus was he was learning a bit about each of the girls\u2019 likes and dislikes, so he might be able to use the information later, especially with Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, the Bullhead landed and the girls got off, with Ruby making sure Jaune was firmly attached to the leash. He felt kind of silly but glad the passersby didn\u2019t notice anything. He was kind of bored as they made their way to the docks and fidgeted with the remote in his hand. From what he learned, they had a long trip ahead of them across the sea. He would have more freedom then to swap if he wanted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had no enhanced senses because all he did was swap lives and wardrobe. If he did bodies, he might have had it. As he followed the girls, he was just walking normally in his clothes. No one noticed if he was on all fours or on two legs weirdly enough. As the boat came into view, Jaune finally decided on a small swap to be a little more dog like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fell on Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, her ears hidden under her bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light and everything around him became a little louder. Jaune had used the Body Part Swap to exchange ears. Now Blake didn\u2019t look different unless he looked closely. Her normal ears were slightly larger because they were now Jaune\u2019s. He on the other hand had slightly smaller ears but now had an extra set of cat ears on his head. He couldn\u2019t see them without a mirror but he reached up and felt them there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he could hear somewhat like a dog now. He\u2019ll give them back when they reach Menagerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and the girls boarded the boat and Ruby let him off the leash. There weren\u2019t many people on and the few were mostly Faunus. The girls\u2019 first stop was to head toward their rooms and drop off their stuff. After that, they were all free to do their own thing. The ship was going to serve dinner in about an hour and breakfast the following morning. Ruby immediately bolted out the door to explore the ship. Yang wanted to go the deck and get some fresh air. Weiss and Blake decided to head off and talk. Jaune then had to decide what he wanted to do. He pretty much had free reign unless he bothered someone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jaune was sure that guy was thinking Jaune would make a mess somewhere and he would have to clean it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deck had a few guests sunbathing in the last little bit of light before it got dark. Yang was one of them. Deciding not to disturb her, Jaune carried on. Another dog on the ship tried to sniff his butt and Jaune had to swat the beast away. He finished exploring the deck and descended down the stairs to explore the lower levels. There were less people here besides the ones behind closed door. Jaune was surprised how many people he could hear long before he saw them. Blake\u2019s ears were really sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hall, he heard a repetitive thud and decided to investigate since there wasn\u2019t anything else to do. As he approached, he heard some voices but couldn\u2019t quite make out the words. Curiosity prevented him from leaving and he drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah!

He was lucky everyone saw him as Zwei. \u201cTell me this then. Let\u2019s say after graduation, you become a Huntress and go out saving people from Grimm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Ruby wasn\u2019t sure where this was going. Jaune didn\u2019t either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss is running the SDC, Blake is fighting for Faunus, and I\u2019m just out traveling the world,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cWould you prefer to go off on your own or do you see someone else beside you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby went silent for a moment and then her face grew crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThought so.\u201d Yang cracked her knuckles. \u201cLooks like Jaune and I have to have a little talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooo!\u201d Ruby cried, pushing Yang back down onto her seat. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know and I don\u2019t want you to scare him off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to scare him off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune saw his life flash before his eye at her obvious lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike all the guys back at Signal?\u201d Ruby asked, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was completely-\u2026\u201d Yang tried to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not scare my friend off.\u201d Ruby stated sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Fine.\u201d Yang crossed her arms. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be watching to make sure he doesn\u2019t try anything.\u201d Jaune suddenly remembered he tricked Ruby into swapping genitals that one time and was immensely grateful she didn\u2019t mention the remote. Now he felt a little guilty sneaking into the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss!\u201d Ruby called out suddenly and Jaune and Yang turned to see Weiss and Blake approaching them. \u201cThis ship is huge! There are so many cabins and cool places to check out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s okay,\u201d Weiss admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot causing trouble?\u201d Blake asked Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, just teasing Ruby about h-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026-How hungry I am!\u201d Ruby interrupted. \u201cLet\u2019s go get some food!\u201d She rushed off to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked over at Yang, who grinned but didn\u2019t say anything. She then looked over at Blake who shrugged. The three of them followed Ruby and Jaune went after them. It wasn\u2019t like he could get food on his own in his situation. He would be chased away. No one would allow a dog to pick up food. The second they entered the mess hall, Jaune could smell fish being cooked. Blake\u2019s expression suddenly changed and there was a thin line of drool in the corner of her mouth. Unlike Beacon, each guest got a plate of food rather than a buffet style. Dinner consisted of fish, potatoes, carrots, a small salad bar, and a couple choices of desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was sad they didn\u2019t have cookies, but managed to snag herself a big piece of chocolate cake. Blake looked the happiest and once seated immediately began to dig in. Yang and Weiss brought up the back of the pack. Jaune however was left to sit on the floor. The table they chose was only big enough for four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZwei! Here you go.\u201d Ruby pulled out a can of dog food and emptied it on an extra plate she snagged. \u201cDinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune looked at the brown mush he was expected to eat compared to what the girls were eating. A treat was one thing, but even with Zwei\u2019s life telling him to each it, he wasn\u2019t going to do that. Ruby was distracted and he was going to switch lives with one of them to eat dinner. The question was who. Weiss was disregarded because he would never let his precious Snow Angel eat dog food.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His clothes were now a tan jacket with a low cut yellow crop top underneath, if he had breasts it would be a lot sexier, and black micro shorts. There was a lot more hair on his head and back due to the Life Swap. A quick glance to his left and he saw Yang on all fours with her face in the mushy brown dog food. Her head lifted up for a moment and he saw bits of food on her cheeks. Her tongue was hanging out of her mouth and she looked incredibly happy. Jaune resisted the urge to laugh, knowing this was what Zwei was supposed to act like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve tasted fish cooked the right way,\u201d Blake said, patting her lips with a napkin and trying to act composed. She ate the rest of her meal a lot slower now. \u201cBeacon is okay, but nothing beats real Menagerie cooking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be lot of food at the festival, right?\u201d Ruby asked, tossing Yang a piece of fish. Yang jumped up and grabbed it with her mouth in the air. Jaune had no idea how she didn\u2019t notice him or Yang being a dog. Their size and weight was way too different. The remote really must have warped reality. \u201cAnd games with prizes? Plus the beach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsually.\u201d Blake nodded. \u201cFaunus come from all over Remnant for this Founding Festival. It lasts for an entire week, but usually after a few days it gets a little tiring.\u201d Her eyes darted toward Weiss. \u201cPeople, too. We try to make this festival like the Vytal one. We want to promote unity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it help out to have Weiss make an appearance?\u201d Jaune asked. \u201cThink about it. The SDC doesn\u2019t have a good reputation with Faunus, right?\u201d Weiss and Blake nodded solemnly and Ruby remained silent, as she didn\u2019t know much about these kinds of things. \u201cShowing that the Schnees want to reach out to Faunus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two mentioned that before,\u201d Weiss mumbled and stirred the remains of her salad. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what I do. My father runs the company. I can only make changes if I take over and my younger brother is trying to succeed. Becoming a Huntress wasn\u2019t a popular decision in my family.\u201d She gripped her fork tightly. \u201cMost of all though, I rather people see me for me, not a family name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww!\u201d Ruby leaned over and wrapped Weiss in a hug. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be my bestie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off of me, you dunce.\u201d Weiss growled, pushing Ruby back. Jaune had just taken a big bite of fish and was enjoying the taste when Blake spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d There was a glint of amusement in her eyes. \u201cThen why do you reject Jaune so much? Pretty sure he didn\u2019t know your name when he met you.\u201d Jaune\u2019s ears perked up. All four of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss rolled her eyes but didn\u2019t answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s now out of principle,\u201d Jaune whispered cosmetically loud to Blake so the others could hear. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to admit she made a mistake.\u201d Yang\u2019s life was guiding him to say this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d Weiss said and pointed her fork at him. \u201cIf he gets within the top three of the class in academics and combat class, plus can show he\u2019s matured, I\u2019ll think about giving him a shot. Just one shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot nicer now than when we first met.\u201d Ruby stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be rubbing off on her.\u201d Jaune commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026I have always\u2026nice\u2026\u201d Weiss spluttered as the others laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune decided to take her advice to heart and not try to flirt with her so openly like with the guitar and song. They all eventually finish eating and headed back to their rooms. Jaune made sure to swap back with Yang once Ruby wasn\u2019t paying attention. He really didn\u2019t want to eat dog food and was planning to alternate with people during meal times. The sun had set and they spent some time on deck gazing at the stars before finally going to back to their room. Jaune got an eyeful as the girls all changed. Once they were all in bed, Ruby patted the spot next to her and Jaune took that as an invitation. The second he got into the bed, Ruby wrapped her arms around him and promptly fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night passed without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was fast asleep, when a loud shrill noise caused him to bolt upright. He looked around in a panic and saw Ruby with a whistle in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise and shine, team!\u201d Ruby announced. \u201cLet\u2019s get dressed and get some breakfast before we land. The captain said we made good time through the night and will be there in less than two hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe really did,\u201d Blake mumbled, rubbing her eyes and looking at the clock. \u201cIt normally would take at least three to four. We must have had perfect wind conditions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMumph.\u201d Yang mumbled something incoherent and pulled the covers over her head. Ruby rolled her eyes and pushed her with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up, Yang. Don\u2019t make me get the bucket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have to use the whistle every morning?\u201d Weiss groaned, sitting up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to disturb the other passengers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all won\u2019t get up if I don\u2019t!\u201d Ruby protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was busy cradling his cat ears. That whistle hurt. He reached into his pocket and selected the Undo Swap button. Blake got her ears back and didn\u2019t look all that happy at Ruby having a whistle either. However, the girls grudgingly got up and changed, even if Yang took some work. She hogged the bathroom to do her hair and they finally managed to leave with under an hour before arriving at Menagerie. The mess hall was serving waffles and Jaune laughed at how Nora would react to learning there was no pancakes. However, his stomach churned when he realized Ruby was going to try to make him eat dog food. His hand reached into his pocket and an idea came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is there a way to just swap food and not lives? Not that lives isn\u2019t cool, but maybe I should try some new stuff with the remote while I\u2019m out here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully hiding the remote, Jaune aimed at Blake and selected the Personal Information option. He wanted to swap their diets. There was a flash of light so something had to have happened. Nothing appeared to have changed and Jaune sat down next to the table. That\u2019s when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby slipped a second plate of waffles onto the floor in front of him before pouring copious amounts of maple syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, Zwei.\u201d She told him. \u201cEat up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune looked up at her and then down to his plate. He didn\u2019t get any forks so it was going to be messy, but he didn\u2019t mind. To everyone else he was a dog and thus allowed to make messes. He picked up one waffle and bit into it, enjoying the sweet taste. When he heard a can opener and looked toward the source. Blake was next to Yang and using a hand can opener on a can of dog food. Once it was open, Blake dumped it all into a bowl. She used a finger to scrap the inside of the can and then stuck it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune couldn\u2019t take his eyes off as she picked up a spoon, dug it into the brown mush, and took a big bite of the dog food without any change in expression. Yang, Ruby, and Weiss didn\u2019t notice or comment. The remote made it a common occurrence and a perfectly normal thing for her to do. As Jaune ate his meal and listened to the girls talk about the trip and their plans, a thought kept creeping into his mind at what he did to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is it racist to make her eat dog food?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune swapped back once they were done with breakfast and follow the girls back to the room. They had to make sure everything was packed so they could leave once they landed. He quickly got bored of this and left to go hang out on deck. For the most part he just enjoyed the sea air but a couple kids saw him and tried to pet him. He was going to ignore them when one of them pulled his ear and he had to flick the brat in the forehead. Land came into view in the distance at last and he leaned up against the railing. The girls came out with their luggage and when they ship finally docked, they all left together.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked like something his family would use. The Arc name was pretty well known and his family was well off. It was just the fact of his parents having eight kids that you had to have a large house. Menagerie itself was really interesting. The city they were in was Kuo Kuana. Near the coast there were shops and busy streets. Now that they were traveling deeper in, there were a lot more trees and residential houses. Blake\u2019s house was the bit one in the middle. The weather was hot and humid and a lot of Faunus passing them didn\u2019t wear a lot of extra clothes. Jaune was really keen on exploring, but would prefer to do so in the evening when it was cooler. He wasn\u2019t use to the heat yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long has it been since you\u2019ve seen your parents?\u201d Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I came to Beacon,\u201d Blake answered. \u201cI\u2019ve sent a few letters and my mother encouraged me to invite you all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you weren\u2019t planning to come here?\u201d Yang asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Blake admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool here,\u201d Ruby stated looking around. \u201cI mean the scenery. The temperature is kind of hot. Not that it\u2019s bad, just hotter than Vale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Blake assured her and laughed. \u201cI do hope my parents are home. We are here much earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they aren\u2019t, you can just show us around.\u201d Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded and when they reached the front door, she took a deep breath and knocked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first glance, this woman was obviously related to Blake.  As a cat Faunus with black hair and yellow eyes, she shares several physical features with Blake, although her ears were noticeably larger in size and had more fur details. She had short hair and three gold piercings on her cat ears; two on her right, and one on her left. She wore a black hakama and sandals with white tabi socks. Over her outfit, she wore a black shrug with a long right sleeve and a short left sleeve, gold leaf trim adorning the opening on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/CMWS1HEM5PkRtkg79\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/CMWS1HEM5PkRtk...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune might have thought Blake had an older sister, if there weren\u2019t a couple age lines on the woman\u2019s face. She had to be Blake\u2019s mom, but Jaune could appreciate how amazing she looked. Thin, but more along the lines of lithe rather than malnourished. Her eyes were kind but somewhat surprised. Really, she had to be the textbook definition of a MILF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake! It is you!\u201d She ran forward and wrapped her arms around her. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you. I didn\u2019t expect you for another couple of hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe trip was shorter than they expected.\u201d Blake hugged her mom back and then gestured to the others. \u201cI want to formally introduce you to my team at Beacon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Blake,\u201d Yang said instantly. \u201cYou never told us you had an older sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked confused for a moment and then her amber eyes glared at her partner. The woman tilted her head slightly, put her hand over her mouth, and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I like her.\u201d She walked forward and shook hands with Yang. \u201cI\u2019m Kali, Blake\u2019s mother. You must be Yang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s told you about us?\u201d Yang asked surprised, which didn\u2019t help Blake\u2019s glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has even sent a picture,\u201d Kali added, gesturing them inside. \u201cYou must be Ruby, Blake\u2019s team leader.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d Ruby confirmed proudly and puffed up her chest importantly. Yang and Weiss rolled their eyes. \u201cBlake\u2019s been a great teammate once we got over the\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwkward introduction phase.\u201d Weiss supplied helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake\u2019s always been rather hesitant to open up,\u201d Kali commented, ignoring Blake\u2019s protest. She then turned to Weiss and shook her hand. \u201cAnd you must be Weiss,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d Weiss replied. \u201cThank you for having us at your lovely home.\u201d Jaune could tell she seemed surprise at how honest Kali\u2019s words were. There was no hint of Faunus versus Schnee hostility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my pleasure, dear.\u201d Kali pushed them all toward a table set in the middle of the living room and brought out tea in record time. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to seeing Blake and her friends ever since she told us about you.\u201d Her eyes fell on Jaune and he froze. Blake hated him. Well, she hated Zwei because Zwei was a dog and Jaune assumed it had something to do with being a cat Faunus. He wasn\u2019t sure how Blake\u2019s mom would react.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He really should have tried to do something, but he really liked behind scratched there. It was a dog thing and he was living a dog\u2019s life. Plus his head was in an attractive woman\u2019s chest. What wasn\u2019t there to love? \u201cWhy would I? Look how cute he is.\u201d She leaned down and kissed Jaune on the nose. No one noticed Jaune was taller than her and she leaned down only because he was leaning his head into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, he loved this remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Blake doesn\u2019t like dogs\u2026\u201d Yang said slowly, not wanting to offend Kali. Kali blinked and then laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. Just because we are cat Faunus, doesn\u2019t mean we have a dislike to dogs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali sat down at the table and pulled Jaune into her lap. He wasn\u2019t sure if she was just that strong or the remote made him weaker to simulate Zwei. Either way, he was now sitting on Kali\u2019s lap while she wrapped her arms around him. Because he was taller than her, she had to lean to the side to look around him. This wasn\u2019t odd to anyone there and Jaune just continued to observe. Talking would just sound like barking and he didn\u2019t want to accidentally get kicked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake just had a run in with an aggressive dog when she was younger,\u201d Kali continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t like them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that makes sense.\u201d Weiss agreed. \u201cChildhood trauma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026mangy little things\u2026\u201d Blake muttered in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say, Mrs. Belladonna,\u201d Weiss stated after sipping her drink. \u201cThis tea is really good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Weiss.\u201d Kali beamed at her. \u201cIt\u2019s a local island blend, and please. Kali is fine. Mrs, Belladonna makes me feel old.\u201d Ruby not so inconspicuously put a lot more sugar in her tea before drinking it. She always preferred sweet things and Kali didn\u2019t seem to take offense at all. Jaune quickly understood Blake\u2019s mom was a very kind and understanding person. She would go out of her way to make others feel welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Yang started to say and no one missed the mischievous tone of her voice. Blake\u2019s expression immediately became alarmed. \u201cYou have a family album with Blake as a kid, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Blake cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Kali declared and it took Jaune a moment to realize she had slipped out from under him to pull out a large album from a bookcase. \u201cI captured everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d Blake\u2019s face had gone crimson and she made to stand up, but Yang wrestled her back down. Ruby and Weiss were already next to Kali and Jaune moved to look over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Blake in the tub with a fish?\u201d Ruby asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s precious!\u201d Weiss added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe loved that toy,\u201d Kali explained, as Yang held back Blake who looked like she wanted to burn that picture. \u201cBrought it everywhere with her. But like all kids, she grew out of it. I\u2019m sure you all had toys you don\u2019t even think about anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby had a teddy before she eventually discovered weapons.\u201d Yang agreed. \u201cI think she called it, Mr. Sn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep!\u201d Ruby waved her hands in distraction. \u201cWe have a lot of pictures of Blake to look through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s one at her first birthday and we gave her cake.\u201d Kali said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d Yang cried and dashed over. Blake slammed her head on the table and eventually gave up trying to get them to stop. Jaune felt bad for her. Having a big family, he was used to his mom showing off embarrassing pictures. He was debating if there was something he could do to help her or just let things play out until a better opportunity arose.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At some point, Kali did close the album and put it away. She started asking them questions about their families, how Vale was, and what all they did in Beacon. Jaune noticed they \u2018mistakenly\u2019 left out some of their antics, including going after Roman Torchwick. Again, he found himself in Kali\u2019s lap, being scratched all over. It was like she knew exactly where his weak points were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs dad busy with the festival?\u201d Blake asked, noticing he hadn\u2019t arrived yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was planning to be here for dinner,\u201d Kali replied. \u201cIf I had known you were all going to be early, I would have prepared everything for lunch. I had to make Ghira promise to be here. You know how he is. He would work himself ragged to make this a success.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your dad like?\u201d Weiss asked, Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs mom said, he\u2019s a hard worker and can get rather focus,\u201d Blake said. \u201cHe can also be rather intimidating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because he\u2019s so big,\u201d Kali added. \u201cUnder that tough exterior, he\u2019s a real softy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs anything set up with the festival yet?\u201d Ruby asked excitedly. \u201cWe saw stalls and stands but we didn\u2019t get a good chance to really explore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are some stands that are opened,\u201d Kali said, putting a finger to her chin. \u201cMostly for the people who arrived early like you did.\u201d She turned to her daughter. \u201cWhy do you show them the sites? They didn\u2019t come here to be cooped up inside with their friend\u2019s mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Yang said shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re awesome, Kali. Besides, I need to hear all those amazing stories about Blake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent idea, mom!\u201d Blake stated loudly, standing up. \u201cI\u2019ll show you all around. There\u2019s a lot to see.\u201d Weiss hide a slight chuckle and decided to follow. Ruby looked excitedly to go and Yang did too, though there was a tiny bit of disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Yang.

Make sure your friends enjoy themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune smiled at their touching reunion and was about to head out of the house when Ruby stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Zwei!\u201d She said firmly. \u201cYou have to stay here for a bit. I promise to take you to the beach tomorrow if you behave yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jaune gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby must have taken his gasp turned bark noise as consent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye, Kali!\u201d She called back, racing after the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed behind her before Jaune\u2019s brain kicked back into the on position from the surprise. It was so easy to forget he was Zwei to everyone and people didn\u2019t take dogs with them everywhere. That meant he was stuck here unless he slipped out on his own. Before he could think of what he was going to do, he felt Kali\u2019s hand on his head. He looked over at her and saw she had to reach up to touch him like that. To her, she was probably reaching down to pat a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Zwei.\u201d Kali reassured him. \u201cYou can keep me company. I don\u2019t have anything to do today until dinner.\u201d She held a hand up to her cheek. \u201cI hope my husband returns soon though. I want to tell him all about Blake\u2019s friends.\u201d Jaune followed her into the living room. \u201cI was worried she wouldn\u2019t make any friends, but they are so close. Even with Weiss. When I first found out, I was so surprised. Vale really has changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune realized she was talking to herself as she sat down on the couch and turned on the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into his pocket and touched the remote. Ruby suddenly forcing him to stay made him forget about the power at his fingertips for a moment. Otherwise, he could have swapped with someone. His only target was Blake\u2019s mom, who was watching the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought was just something simple to pass the time. Maybe a Body Swap. Kali was definitely very pretty and he bet she had Blake when she was young. With a Body Swap, Jaune would still be Zwei, but everyone would see him with her body. Another option was a combination of Body and Life Swaps. The reason for this combo was Life Swap would let him be seen as a person and give himself some more freedom. The Body Swap would then let him Have Kali\u2019s body while she had his living Zwei\u2019s life. It would only be temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother possible option would be venturing into unknown territories. He could swap Person Info with Kali. The question was which swap. If he did something like Swap Children, would Blake become the daughter of Zwei, since Jaune was living his life. How would that work? Would they no longer be staying at the Belladonna resident? If he swapped positions, would Zwei be considered the wife and Kali would be Ruby\u2019s pet? There were so many weird possibilities he could test out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A quick look down at himself was all it took from to realize it worked. His black hakama covered his lower body like a long skirt and he could see new boobs pushing against the white undershirt wrap over his chest. Everything quickly became louder as he received a second set of ears. They seemed to be just as sensitive as Blake\u2019s, if not more so. He stood up and stretched, ignoring the TV. His initial thoughts about Kali seemed to be right on the money. Her body felt tone and lithe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to see what happened to his old body and life, Jaune glanced over where he had been. It was a little unnerving to see himself, walking around on all fours, sniffing everything. That\u2019s what a typical dog does, sure, but it was his body. Deciding not to think about it, he walked into the kitchen and stared into a mirror. Kali\u2019s yellow eyes and kind face stared back at him. Jaune grinned and made some kissing faces and a few poses, like putting a hand on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, Blake,\u201d he muttered, enjoying Kali\u2019s voice. \u201cYour mom is <i>hot</i>. I see where you get it from. You definitely don\u2019t have to worry about growing old.\u201d He grabbed Kali\u2019s boobs, well his boobs now, and bounced them in his hands before stopping and growing slightly red. This felt a little wrong, but at the same time, he understood that reality changed to fit the remote. Once he swapped back, it was like it was them all along and he did nothing. There were a lot of ethical implications here that hurt his brain to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of doing something perverted, he could go out into Menagerie now that he had a human life. Kali\u2019s life would help him blend in. Then of course there was seeing what all she was planning to do for them when Team RWBY got back. He could stay at home and live her life a bit, just to try it out. It was a brand new experience and maybe that was something he could do with the remote. Try out different lives and see what they were like.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

During the boat trip here, the girls changed in front of him and that was an amazing site for him. Maybe he was a little bit of a voyeur. While Kali was related to a friend of his, she wasn\u2019t a close acquaintance. That might have been why his will was so weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice pad,\u201d Jaune commented, as he entered the master bedroom. It was rather empty, but there was a large bed, dressers, and a family portrait from when Blake was younger. On the wall across from the bed there was a large mirror. \u201cPerfect.\u201d He walked over to the bedside closest to the mirror and stared at his reflection. Kali\u2019s reflection stared back and then imitated his movements as he took off the cloth covering his shoulders \u201cIt\u2019s now or never.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali\u2019s voice saying this turned him on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly undead the belt and removed the skirt and chest wrap. When he saw Kali\u2019s reflection in the mirror, his body froze. There was only so much he could see looking down. The mirror was a much better indicator. Kali was wearing pretty basic black bra and panties, though they didn\u2019t cover a lot. Jaune felt a little hot in embarrassment, before reaching behind his back to unclasp the bra. This might have been impossible without Kali\u2019s life aiding him. The piece of cloth fell to the ground and the panties followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was standing alone in Blake\u2019s parent\u2019s bedroom completely naked living as her mom. He reached up and cupped his boobs. They weren\u2019t as large as Yang\u2019s but they were big enough they fit comfortably in his hand. Slowly, he reached down and felt between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a jolt of pleasure, forcing him to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand was wet and slightly sticky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the point of no return.

This wasn\u2019t the first time he had breasts, there was the time he stole Yang\u2019s, but he was warming himself up in Kali\u2019s body. His other hand reached down between his legs and began to rub the area around her slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp gasp escaped his lips as he felt a wave of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s sensitive.\u201d Jaune whispered, slowly rubbing his hand up and down between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure was building up and by doing it slowly, it was manageable. Growing bolder, fingers began to find their way into the lips of Kali\u2019s pussy. The more his fingers explored, the greater the pleasure.

Being in Kali\u2019s body and life he must have acquired her mannerisms. Still, hearing her make a cat noise nearly caused him to release right there. Refusing to give up so soon, he inserted another finger and began to pump vigorously. The warm wet inner walls made a slapping sound with each thrust from his hand and the pleasure kept building. The other hand that had been messaging his boob laid forgotten and he fell forward. His eyes glanced up at the mirror to see Kali staring back at him, red faced while on her knees and arm. Her other arm reached back between her legs and continued to masturbate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this was the final straw for Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis back arched and he gasped in ecstasy before collapsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarm liquid dripped on his hand.

He didn\u2019t know how much Kali pleasured herself. Her body had just been extremely sensitive. The thought of masturbating a bit more crossed his mind but he decided he really needed to get her cleaned up. There was no way Jaune wanted to deal with her husband coming home while he was enjoying her body. Slowly he climbed off the bed and walked toward the bathroom, still completely naked and dripping a little from between his legs. He shut the bathroom door behind him and turned on the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarm water flowed over his body as he stepped in. He just stood there, letting himself bask in the pleasant feeling. The cat ears on his head automatically pressed down but the water still felt nice on them. Jaune reached for the body wash to give his new body a scrub. Kali\u2019s life knew which one was hers without even looking. He took particular enjoyment lathering up and making sure his boobs were clean, plus rubbing his abused vagina again. While in the shower, he inserted several fingers and brought himself to orgasm again before finally letting up and getting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrapped a towel around his chest and it just barely covered the upper part of his legs. He looked in the mirror and grinned at the sight of Kali in nothing but a towel with wet hair. Somehow, it was more erotic than just being naked. Quickly diverting his eyes before he made another mess, he finished drying himself off, even using a hair dryer, and then went back into the bedroom to get dressed. Once everything was back to normal, using the towel to wipe any residue from the bed, he thought about what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali\u2019s life told him that he should pick something special up for Blake and her team to enjoy for dinner. She had everything else and the meal would be nice, but something more would make them feel at home. Jaune of course thought about possibly exploring the island a bit as Kali. The locals would know her and her life could guide him. The third option was to stay inside and relax. Sometimes just being lazy was the best idea.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the very least, he wanted to check out the surrounding area today. Glancing in the mirror, he saw his hair was still wet and let Kali\u2019s life guide him to prim himself up before leaving the house. The second he was outside, heat overtook him. Staying inside with the AC made him soft, but he got used to it faster than he thought he would. Another perk of the Life Swap probably. Even being in a somewhat unfamiliar body and outfit, he had no problems walking because of the remote. He even had a rough idea where he should be heading, letting the life he was living guide him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Jaune noticed was how popular he was. People were calling out to him as he passed and greeted him like an old friend. Kids would run up and quickly tell him about something that happened to them. At first, it was a little overwhelming. When he replied, the words just poured out of his mouth. It was a lot like back home if he was honest with himself. The village wasn\u2019t huge and everyone seemed to know each other. Kali, being the wife of the chief, was probably one of the most well-known people there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he found himself before a bakery and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKali! What do I owe the pleasure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA portly man greeted Jaune the moment he stepped into the building.

I\u2019m sure Blake and her friends will love it.\u201d <i>Mental note to self, make sure to try it as someone if I leave Kali\u2019s life.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cLet Blake to stop by,\u201d the man said, packing up the cake. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since she was a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to tell her.\u201d Jaune replied, smiling and handing over a few Lein.  Once he left the shop, dessert in hand, he headed back toward the house, taking in the sights around him. Tomorrow he was going to go have some fun at the beach as someone. Who was still up for grabs. When he reached the house, he discovered\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After jumping slightly at seeing himself charging towards him on all fours, he reached over and scratched Zwei behind the ears for a moment before making his way to the kitchen. He set the desert down on the counter and checked the time. He preheated the over and took out the roast Kali had prepared for dinner. It would take a couple hours to cook so he was supposed to start it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure everything Kali had to do was done, he went back to the couch and turned the TV on. Kali\u2019s life wanted to watch some romance dramas, but Jaune was still himself, only living her life. He flipped to the cartoons and laughed along with them. The heat did get to him and he just wanted to rest on the couch. His tiredness could also be attributed to Kali working hard the last few days to make the place presentable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored, laying on the couch, and watching TV, his hands began to explore himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped as one hand found its way between his legs and the other one groping his breast. This wasn\u2019t something he should really be doing, but he was a teenager at heart. This kind of thing was only naturally. However, right when he was getting started, Zwei sat up, barked, and ran toward the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune sat up, straightened his outfit and tried to make himself presentable. The last thing he needed was to get Kali in trouble by having someone catch her masturbating in the middle of the day.

The man was tall and muscular with black hair, a beard and yellow eyes. He wore an open dark violet coat with white fur trim, exposing his hairy chest. Over his beige pants was a matching sash that wraps around his waist and is secured with a large, silver metal buckle. On the shoulder of his coat was a silver metal spaulder, which through a pair of curved strips across the chest attaches as a clasp on the opposite front panel of the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune instinctively knew this was Ghira, Kali\u2019s husband and Blake\u2019s father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe belongs to Blake\u2019s friends,\u201d Jaune answered. \u201cIsn\u2019t he just the sweetest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are here already?\u201d Ghira asked. \u201cI managed to leave work early because I hoped to meet them.\u201d He reached down and gave Zwei a quick scratch, which instantly made the dog happy. \u201cIs she doing okay? Are her friends-\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are a lovely bunch of people,\u201d Jaune assured him, letting Kali\u2019s life lead the conversation. \u201cRight now, Blake\u2019s giving them a tour around the island and they should be back for dinner. Please, take the next hour or two and relax. The last thing a daughter needs to see is her father stressed out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 have to admit, I\u2019m nervous seeing her again,\u201d Ghira admitted, scratching the back of his head. \u201cIt has been a long time, but I\u2019m glad to know she\u2019s doing well. I look forward to meeting her team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune suddenly felt the area between his legs grow hot and Kali\u2019s life was telling him to kiss her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, crap. I don\u2019t know if I can do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand reached into his pocket and grabbed the remote. His first reaction was to undo the swap and go back into Zwei\u2019s life while Kali took over hers again. This would let him watch without being involved. Of course, part of him didn\u2019t find it disgusting to console Ghira now that he was technically Kali. He only had a moment to decide what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the way things are working out, this year\u2019s festival might be the best one yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not because your daughter is back too?\u201d Kali asked, eyes glinting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 yes.\u201d He nodded slowly. \u201cShe\u2019s my little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a softy,\u201d Kali purred and grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ghira asked, noticing she was overly clingy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been so\u2026 hot all day.\u201d She smiled and her face grew predatory. \u201cIt must have been because I was reminded of Blake as a baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh\u2026 I think I messed up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune realized that after swapping out of Kali\u2019s life, he probably left her really horny. When he left a life, the person must rationalize anything he did in their body. Kali believed she was really horny because Blake came back and they had looked through the photo album. This was a big discovery. Taking over someone\u2019s life and being careless could have far reaching implications. There were also some positive inclinations too. What would happen if he had Weiss\u2019s life and started getting closer to his own life? Would she start falling for him or at least seeing him in a better light? That was something he could try out another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, everything was pushed out of his mind a moment later at what was happening in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Kali whispered seductively to Ghira. \u201cThe kids won\u2019t be back for a bit and I need you to attend to me\u2026 down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGhira\u2019s eyes widened and he let himself be dragged toward the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune\u2019s mouth fell open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, what do I do now?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The violet coat and beige pants he now wore were looser than he originally thought they would be. It might have helped with the heat. Before the door closed behind them, Jaune had one last look at Ghira, now living as Zwei, watching them. A tinge of guilt ran through him but was quickly replaced by excitement as Kali pushed him onto the bed. He looked up at her and she grinned at him before slowly beginning to remove her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what you see?\u201d Kali whispered seductively, as her black hakama fell to the floor, leaving her in nothing but her black underwear. Jaune nodded and her smile grew. \u201cSo, Ghira, care to join me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune couldn\u2019t remember how he managed to throw off the coat and pants so fast. The next thing he knew he was sitting on the bed in nothing but his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my Teddy Bear.\u201d If the situation hadn\u2019t been so serious, Jaune might have laughed at the nickname for Ghira. However, when Kali unhooked her bra, his eyes and thoughts were completely focused on her. He had seen everything before, but gazing at her body from this side was a thousand times better. \u201cCome here.\u201d Kali joined him on the bed, both of them only had on underwear covering their lower areas. She leaned forward and kissed Jaune on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune kissed back, feeling their tongues colliding against each other. Kali\u2019s arms wrapped around him and he had to keep himself propped up with one of his arms. Her breasts pushed up against his chest and he could feel the hardened nipples. It wasn\u2019t like he was experienced with sex. He kissed a girl before, but that was as far as he got. He was a virgin, but Ghira was not, obviously, so he let his life take control mixed with some of Jaune\u2019s own desires. His free hand wrapped around Kali and began to grope her but. She let out a small moan and broke the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s getting frisky,\u201d Kali whispered and purred. Her eyes darted down to Jaune\u2019s boxers. \u201cI\u2019m ready, but I think you need a little pick me up.\u201d Jaune\u2019s eyes widened and words failed him as she yanked his underwear off. Her hand than gripped his hardening member and began to move slowly up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing.\u201d Jaune gasped and his eyes fixed on Kali, his hand still massaging her butt. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were always such a sweet talker,\u201d Kali mused and kissed him again while continuing her stroking. Once the kissed broke, she lowered her head, opened her mouth, and took his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarm and moist, it took all his strength not to blow his load straight away. Kali knew how to use her tongue and he was experiencing things he would never have been able to do himself. Those late nights he hid in his room were nothing compared to this. He wanted it to last forever but all good things have to come to an end. She was much more experienced and a little over a minute later, he released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must have been holding that back for a while.\u201d Kali commented and swallowed before wiping her mouth with her free hand. \u201cSeems like you\u2019re all warmed up now.\u201d She scooted back on the bed and whipped her own underwear off. \u201cNow, how about you satisfy me now?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kali\u2019s body twitched and she gripped the bed frame. Jaune slid in and out of her vagina a few times, making sure the walls were lubricated and then thrusted himself deep within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Kali let out a cry. \u201cOh, yes! Harder, Ghira!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune began to pump in and out vigorously as Kali began to gasp and cry out happily. Pressure began to build up in his balls, but because he had released moments earlier, he had time. Right now, he was going to bask in the moment of the greatest pleasure he had felt in his life so far. He kept thrusting into her and her expression told him she was feeling just as good as he was. Inspiration struck him and he wrapped his arounds around her. In response, she wrapped her arms around him. Her claws dug into his back and he winced slightly, but didn\u2019t stop. He lifted her up and started thrusting upwards as she moaned in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali grinned and pushed him so he fell on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy turn to be in control.\u201d She told him and began to bounce up and down on Jaune\u2019s shaft. \u201cAh! Ghira! You can\u2019t understand how much I needed this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted this\u2026 too!\u201d Jaune gasped. He reached a hand up, but Kali slapped it away. She placed her hands on his chest and began to pump faster. Not too much longer, Jaune couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cKali\u2026I\u2019m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a safe day.\u201d She assured him. One of her hands reached around back and cupped his balls. \u201cGive me everything you got, honey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou asked for it!\u201d Jaune declared and relinquished the control he was only barely able to maintain. Everything shot deep into Kali\u2019s vagina and she slowed down on his deflating genitals. They both panted a few times and Kali collapsed next to him. She smiled as their eyes met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI needed that.\u201d She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d Jaune answered, sliding an arm under her so he could wrap it around her. She took the cue and snuggled against him, kissing his cheek. They laid next to each other for a while. Jaune was in heaven. Not only did he finally have sex, he had it with a hot older woman and it was even his own body. It was every teenagers dream. The thought of staying like this crossed his mind. Swapping was a powerful drug and could be very addictive. He was spared thinking about it anymore when Kali\u2019s cat ear\u2019s twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the girls are back,\u201d she said, sitting up. \u201cWe need to get dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away.\u201d Jaune agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune threw on Ghira\u2019s clothes scattered on the floor. Even though he was hurrying, he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes from Kali as she got dressed. His gaze tended to linger on her shapely ass. They just finished getting dressed when he heard the front door opening. Now he had a choice, stay as Ghira for a little while longer, swap back to his spot as Zwei and wait for a new opportunity, or think of something else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jaune noticed her hair was a little messier than before, but otherwise she looked completely normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe island is amazing,\u201d Weiss stated immediately. \u201cThe water is so much clearer than Vale or Atlas. From the number of stalls being set up, I can tell this festival is going to quite large.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the founding of Menagerie,\u201d Kali reminded her. \u201cPeople come from all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was able to say hi to a few people I remember,\u201d Blake said. \u201cThings haven\u2019t changed much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that my daughter I hear?\u201d Ghira asked, stepping into the room with his arms outstretched. Blake smiled and ran up to hug him. \u201cAnd these must be your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d Ruby greeted excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m Ruby, team leader of Team RWBY. Blake\u2019s an amazing teammate and friend. She\u2019s helped us kick so much Grimm butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Weiss, Weiss Schnee.\u201d Weiss bowed respectfully. \u201cThank you for letting us stay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was no problem at all.\u201d Ghira assured her. There wasn\u2019t any animosity in his eyes because of her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap, Blake!\u201d Yang shouted. \u201cYour dad\u2019s huge. How much can you bench? Think you can take me in arm wrestling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake glared at her partner and Ghira stared for a moment, before laughing. Kali chuckled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we rest and chat in the living room?\u201d She suggested. \u201cI\u2019m going to check on dinner, but it should be ready soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune followed the rest of the group, but he was more preoccupied thinking about the remote. From what he heard, no one was going to do anything the rest of the night. It was the perfect opportunity to try out the remote to its fullest. So far, he\u2019s mainly been doing Life Swaps and Body Swaps. He hadn\u2019t done much with Personality or Personal Info ones. Personality still worried him. Even if he knew he swapped, how different would he feel? Maybe he wouldn\u2019t want to swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonal Info Swaps could have unknown results. If he really wanted to test that, he could use that to make some major swaps. What would happen if he, currently as Zwei, swapped parents with Blake? Would they be here because Zwei was the Belladonna\u2019s daughter? Would he change races or would they? That seemed like a bigger effect than the other swaps, but since the remote can manipulate reality, nothing was off the table. Maybe he could test swapping races beforehand. He was technically living the life as Zwei, so would the remote see him as a dog?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he could take a break from swapping for a bit after what he did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the middle of some down time and there were people he knew nearby so he could see their reactions. There probably wouldn\u2019t be a better opportunity. The last thing he wanted to do was mess up some big event with random swapping. He fiddled with the remote in his pocket. He still had to avoid Ruby seeing it. She knew what the remote was. It wasn\u2019t going to emerge until he was ready to swap. His mind had already been running over multiple ideas in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first idea he came up with was swapping positions. Not lives, but something similar. He, as Zwei, would take place of one of the girls and the girls would take his place as the pet. That was the idea anyways. He would still be seen as a dog, but would be one of the four members of the team. Whoever he swapped with would still be themselves, but be considered Ruby and/or Yang\u2019s pet. Would be pretty funny to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next was to swap races. He was technically a dog in the reality. The Life Swap should swap his current race and not his body\u2019s race. It would be fascinating to see someone turn into a dog and then to see if he actually changed into a different human resembling Zwei, or if it would just be in his reflection. Order seemed to matter, but he wasn\u2019t sure of the rules for overriding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last idea was for a big swap. Swapping parents with Blake. That would make Zwei the child of Ghira and Kali. He had no idea how that would work or what changes this would result in. The remote seemed to make the minimum amount of changes to make the new reality fit, so there might not be a lot of differences. The photo albums would obviously have Zwei instead of Blake for example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune took a deep breath, made sure Ruby wasn\u2019t watching and made his choice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thinking about it, since Zwei was Yang\u2019s and Ruby\u2019s pet, he wanted to see them react. That left the choice between Blake and Weiss. Blake came here to spend time with her family, so he decided to respect that. That left only Weiss. There was a flash of light and Jaune found himself sitting where Weiss had been. At first it might have seen like a Life Swap, but he wasn\u2019t wearing Weiss\u2019s clothes nor did their hair change. Weiss was simply sitting on floor between Ruby and Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, he wasn\u2019t sure what changed. His reflection in the mirror showed him as Zwei in his clothes still, even though he saw himself as normal. Sitting in the chair was just like a normal person to him, but his reflection showed him sitting like a dog would. Everyone else was still talking and Kali set down a couple glasses of iced tea for the girls. Funny enough, she set one down in front of him and not Weiss, so the remote did something. The trick was to figure out what exactly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI normally make it unsweet,\u201d Kali told them. \u201cWould anyone like some sugar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Ruby replied immediately. Jaune and Yang laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take some too.\u201d Yang added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame.\u201d Jaune said, testing how much they would hear. Since he was still a dog, it should only sound like barking to them. Imagine his shock when Kali passed him the sugar. \u201cThank you.\u201d He responded automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my pleasure, Zwei.\u201d Kali told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, okay then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTest one a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs dinner almost ready?\u201d Weiss asked from her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be in a little bit,\u201d Ruby assured her and then, to Jaune\u2019s amusement, patted Weiss on the head like she would a dog. Weiss sighed, but the shadow of a smile at Ruby\u2019s gesture appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they can understand both Weiss and me, Jaune realized. Fascinating. Do they treat her like a dog or just a pet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how long have you been the big man on campus?\u201d Yang asked Ghira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have elections.\u201d He informed her. \u201cThis is my third term.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be doing a good job if everyone wants you back.\u201d Ruby commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s far too modest,\u201d Kali said with a laugh and then the phone began to ring. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d She left the table, leaving Ghira alone with the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink we can see more of Blake\u2019s baby pictures?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang\u2026\u201d Blake growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsk Kali.\u201d Ghira answered, avoiding the blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGhira!\u201d Kali called from the kitchen. \u201cCan you come here for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you show your friends to your room, Blake.\u201d Ghira suggested, standing up. \u201cThis might take a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Ruby stood up excitedly, causing Weiss to jump. \u201cBlake, I totally want to see your room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet there\u2019s tons of embarrassing stuff, huh?\u201d Yang whispered, elbowing Blake lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to regret this.\u201d Blake sighed and waved them after her. Jaune followed the pack with only Weiss behind him. Her expression was passive and it was like she was used to following. He might need to investigate more on how Weiss became Ruby and Yang\u2019s pet in this world.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Memories that he definitely knew he never witness. They were more like he was watching them through a mental TV of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The reason he, Zwei, was selected to be a Hunter in this reality was because he was the first animal to unlock his Aura. He lived with the Arc Family as a pet until the day Grimm attacked. His sisters, former right now, were about to be killed when he saved them, but nearly died in the process. The shock had caused him to awaken his Aura naturally. The reason Ruby and the others could understand him was that his Semblance, maybe, gave him increased intelligence and the ability to speak in human language. Ozpin decided, rather than being experimented on, to bring him into Beacon as a test candidate. If other animals could unlock Aura, it would give them a much larger force against the Grimm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019s situation was a little confusing. From what he found out from Ruby in this world, Weiss had been disowned from her father due to her desire to treat Faunus as people. Someone, she found her way to Patch and met Ruby\u2019s family. Things got blurry there. Somehow, adoption was off the table and instead, Weiss was considered a pet to the Xiao Long-Rose family. It didn\u2019t make any sense to him now, but everyone else considered it normal. If he wanted to, he could try to learn more information to figure out exactly what happened.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nShaking his head, he plopped at the end of Blake\u2019s bed while others sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver think about doing a little decorating?\u201d Yang asked Blake, spinning around in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang!\u201d Ruby admonished, sitting on the side of Blake\u2019s bed. \u201cThat was rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang has a point, even if she could have said it in a more diplomatic way. The thing was Yang was hardly considered diplomatic. Blake\u2019s room was pretty bare with only the essentials. She had a bed, bedside table with a bookmarked book and lamp, a desk, a computer, a bookshelf crammed full to burst, and a single rug on the woodened floor which Weiss was sitting on. Other than that, it was pretty empty. There was a closet and a dresser for clothes but both were simple brown and did not stand out. Yang was probably commenting on the fact there were no posters of anyone, fancy curtains over the window, or anything cluttering her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all fairness, Blake hadn\u2019t been living here for the past months. She had been at Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never really liked collecting things besides books,\u201d Blake replied. \u201cDue to my past\u2026 I moved around a lot and couldn\u2019t take stuff with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded and then the conversation swapped topics to the beach they were going to visit tomorrow rather than the serious conversation about Blake\u2019s time in the White Fang. Eyes were off him and Jaune fiddled with the remote. If he didn\u2019t really care about the specifics on how this reality worked, he could do another swap with one of the girls. Start having some fun tonight. He could also not swap and just enjoy the experience of being part of their team for now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls began to talk and Jaune was only half listening, occasionally giving his input. He already knew about Blake\u2019s time in the White Fang and how she left them. Ruby was interested in the older White Fang, while Yang focused on the details about Blake leaving. Blake was obviously a little hesitant talking about it, but her time with her friends really helped her. Being home to connect to her roots didn\u2019t hurt. Jaune had a sneaking suspicion Weiss would have been a little more antagonistic if she wasn\u2019t currently Ruby\u2019s pet. For the most part, she just asked a question or two and then remained silent. Though she did reprimand her once or twice when Ruby started to sprawl out on Blake\u2019s bed to make herself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bored with the conversation, Jaune\u2019s thoughts naturally turned to the remote. There was time, nothing important was going on, so why not try out some more swaps? His first thought turned to what he debated trying out before. What would happen if he swapped races with someone? From what happened to Weiss when Jaune changed positions, the order of his swaps prioritized swapping Zwei\u2019s information. So whoever he swapped with should become a dog and Jaune\u2026 maybe he would see a person when he looked in the mirror? That might change the reality a bit, as he no longer was a talking dog with Aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea came to him as he looked around. He was debating swapping ownership of personal items with Blake. It would be funny to see her room become distinctly boyish, along with all her clothes becoming his. He imagined people would consider Blake to be a tomboy, even as she still remained really hot. If her mom was an indication, her future was going to be good to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were plenty of other girls to target. Ruby, Weiss, and Yang provided ample swap targets. The remote was really only limited to his imagination. However, he probably only had time for one quick swap and check it out before dinner would be called.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thing was because he was Zwei, personal belongings belonged to him too, not Jaune. He was too use to just following and forgot that all he had swapped with Zwei was clothes. After the light faded from the swap, Jaune looked at a much more barren room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was sitting on a pillow on the ground, legs crossed, wearing Jaune\u2019s t-shirt and jeans. It was very boyish compared to her normal clothes, but Jaune really didn\u2019t try to be at the height of fashion. He was wearing her black buttoned vest with coattails and a single silver button on the front. Underneath this was a white, sleeveless, high necked, crop undershirt and white shorts. His shoes had been taken off at the front door, but stockings with a color gradation of black to purple covered his feet. He shifted himself on the pillow to adjust the panties he was wearing over his junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else was sitting on pillows too, except Ruby. There was a large circular dog bed strangely large enough for a human to sleep in that she was sitting on. The desk with the computer was gone, though the closest and dresser remained. Since Blake had his clothes, she would need a place to put them. In the corner, there were some tennis balls, a couple rubber shew toys, and a thick rope. There was no bookshelf full of the novels Blake normally spent countless hours reading. Her toys now were simple dog ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune snapped back to reality when Yang said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when are you going to buy more stuff? You always keep the absolute minimum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoving around a lot meant that the more you had, the more you had to carry.\u201d Blake explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut couldn\u2019t you like\u2026 keep stuff in our room at Beacon?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s something I got used to. I still update my wardrobe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith boyish clothes.\u201d Muttered Weiss and Ruby had to stifle a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that horrible onesie.\u201d Yang added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Blake glared at her. \u201cThat onesie may now be the most fashionable, but it\u2019s warm. I hate the cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess living in Menagerie would make you use to the heat and weak against cold.\u201d Jaune said reasonable and Blake smiled at him, glad at his understanding. His motivations were a little selfish though, as he liked the onesie and got upset when others made fun of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs talk resumed and time ticked away, Jaune eyed any changed in Blake and thought about what to do. Should he fix it? Since Blake didn\u2019t really have his possessions, or maybe make another swap to add to this one. Of course, he could stop and just see how this reality unfolds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mr. Belladonna.\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would love too, but are you sure you want me to?\u201d Kali replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on and have some fun!\u201d Yang declared. \u201cAfter cooking for us all, you need some downtime.\u201d Kali looked at Ghira, who smiled and nodded at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll do the dishes and then head to bed. Early day tomorrow for me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d She stood on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek while Yang wooed in the background. After he left, she pulled up a seat. \u201cSo, how do you play?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time for Ruby to explain the rules, but it virtually came down to the four nations of Vale versus the Grimm. It was a four on one game. Yang took over the Grimm and she loved crushing their forces. Jaune focused on providing everyone with resources and, surprisingly, it was Kali that saved them time and time again. She was good at planning. Ruby kept falling for Yang\u2019s traps and Blake was probably the most normal player. They were having a lot of fun and night began to fall. There were a few yawns, but everyone wanted to finish. While they were distracted, Jaune decided he needed to have some fun with the remote and tried to think of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first main idea was to swap with Weiss. The reason was tomorrow they would be on the beach and people would flirt with her. Even though he knew they would say no, no one should be allowed to flirt with his Snow Angel. Since she was already a pet, Jaune was debating about swapping races with her. If the remote worked like he thought it would, Weiss would become a dog and he would be seen as a human. He kind of wondered what kind of dog Weiss would be. Probably beautiful and flurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis second option was swapping pets with Ruby. That would make Weiss his pet, which just sounded weird when he went over it in his head. He was a dog, who unlocked Aura to become as smart as a human, owning a human as a pet. While he had his body, he was living the life of Zwei and no one saw it. He wondered how Weiss would treat him as her master and a dog. Probably she would want to snuggle with him all the time. He liked that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plenty of other options and maybe he should go with something less severe. Personal Info Swaps had some unexpected results.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once the game was finished, Jaune selected the Race Swap option under Personal Info and aimed at Weiss. There was a flash of green light and, while Jaune felt no different, he instantly noticed the change in Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to notice the white dog standing where Weiss had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog had a beautiful white coat with pale blue eyes and a red collar. That was probably due to Ruby\u2019s influence. She wasn\u2019t very big and could be easily carried in someone\u2019s arms. Zwei hadn\u2019t been very large either and Weiss was probably slightly larger due to her longer legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Weiss.\u201d Ruby called, gesturing up the stairs. \u201cTime for bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss barked and followed. Blake glared at the dog and scooted over by Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you, that dog is out to get me.\u201d Blake muttered. Jaune rolled his eyes but decided to try to figure out how reality changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, he wasn\u2019t a dog. Catching his reflection in the mirror, he saw himself this time, except with short brown hair. The remote must have taken into account his Life Swap from so long ago. The next thing was his memories had changed again. It actually started to give him a headache. He had never been a dog and passed initiation like he originally did. However, instead of Pyrrha finding him first, Ruby found him stuck to a tree. The remote was combining the real world and these alternate worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should be worried about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, his name was still Zwei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby and Yang come from Patch,\u201d Jaune reminded Blake, deciding to focus on the present for now. \u201cThey don\u2019t have many Faunus there. Besides, sometimes dog\u2019s just don\u2019t like people, but it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s out to get you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she tore up one of my books, and I\u2019ll find a way to prove it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout being able to actually talk, it seems Weiss couldn\u2019t reconcile with Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls\u2019 entered Blake\u2019s room and Jaune headed toward the bathroom. From his memories, he always changed separately from the girls. Yang always joked he could stay and change, but Ruby would always flush whenever it was mentioned. Blake remained quiet, but Jaune was pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t\u2019 be too pleased with him doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be tough being on a team with three girls,\u201d Kali mentioned, meeting him in the hallway as he waited for the others to let him into the room. \u201cI would like to say, you are a real gentleman to be willing to go so far to accommodate them. Many boys your age would try to take advantage of the situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom raised me better than that,\u201d Jaune replied, flushing a little at the praise. \u201cPlus I have a lot of sisters, so I\u2019m used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents must be proud.\u201d She patted him on the cheek. \u201cWell, good night. If you need more blankets, the hall closet has a few.\u201d She turned around and Jaune\u2019s hand touched the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe debated swapping bodies with her. She had a really nice one and Jaune was kind of tired of his. Maybe it would be fun to stay as someone else for the remainder of the trip. Kind of like a challenge. Or, he could just hit the sack. He was pretty tired.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only was it incredibly hot, Yang would make fun of him. Simple shorts and a t-shirt was the way to go. The door to the bedroom opened and he was able to enter. Yang was in shorts and an orange tank top, Blank had her kamino style nightgown, and Ruby had had a black tank top with a heart-shaped Beowolf design on the chest and long white pants decorated with pink roses. Blake was sleeping in her bed, but several inflatable mattresses had been set up. It was lucky her room was pretty barren or they wouldn\u2019t all fit. Yang was next to her and Ruby and Jaune were on the far side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatigue finally hit and even Yang wasn\u2019t talking much. They all crashed and the room grew silent. Dog Weiss was sleeping next to Ruby's bed, curled up in a ball. Jaune was almost asleep when Ruby whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZwei? You still up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Ruby?\u201d Jaune muttered, rolling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a question for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you could swap anything with anyone, what would it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jaune\u2019s eyes snapped open, but he remained still. Ruby shouldn\u2019t know he was Jaune with the remote. He had been careful not to show her it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike with no repercussions,\u201d Ruby continued. \u201cClothes, name, anything you can imagine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune mentally sighed in relief. He was pretty sure Ruby was just thinking about what to swap when she got back to Beacon and met up with Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 maybe your weapon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Ruby sounded a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Crescent Rose is amazing. Would be fun to have her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is hypothetical,\u201d Ruby whispered hastily. \u201cYou can\u2019t have her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Jaune replied and pretended to go back to sleep. A few moments later, he hears her gentle snoring.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His body was overexcited and he really needed to do some\u2026 personal business. He had done a little bit in Kali\u2019s body and maybe that was why he was feeling that way. Her body might still be a little horny from the sex Jaune had with her. There was only one option for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up slowly and quietly, to not disturb the others, he made his way to the bathroom. With Blake\u2019s hearing, he couldn\u2019t do it in their room. As he passed an open door, he saw the back of his original body in there. Thinking to himself it might be easier to have some release in his own body, he pulled out the remote. There was a flash of light and Jaune felt his pants tighten in the front. He had only swapped genitals. That meant he was in Kali\u2019s body with his own dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the bathroom door behind him, he grabbed a couple tissues and looked in the mirror. Kali stared back, wearing his t-shirt and shorts. Her toned thighs stood out when Jaune lowered his pants. Reaching down and grasping himself with one hand, he reached up with his other hand and started groping his boobs. Slowly increasing his strokes, he kept his eyes on his reflection. Kali\u2019s face was growing red and he could feel the pressure building. Finally, he released with an audible gasp and was relieved he decided to take precautions from being over heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI needed that,\u201d Jaune muttered, making sure he was clean before flushing the tissues down the toilet to destroy the evidence.

He had completely forgotten he had Kali\u2019s body. The last night was a little bit of a blur due to being tired.

Swimming and boating had to be away from ports. When they finally reached the beach, they weren\u2019t the first ones there. Plenty of Faunus were sprawled out along the beach. In fact, they might have been the only humans there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChanging rooms are over there.\u201d Kali pointed. \u201cThe men\u2019s room is on the far side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, too bad Zwei.\u201d Yang slapped Jaune on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow will I ever live now?\u201d Jaune asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their group headed toward the changing rooms, Jaune has an opportunity to use the remote.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had a sexy MILF\u2019s body right now and no one noticed. He could see as much as he wanted at any point in the future. Separating from the rest of the group, Jaune entered the male changing room and began to get undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a little ashamed at getting turned on by the fact he had a female body except for his junk in front of other guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his shirt and his boobs were set free. No one batted an eye and he pulled out his swim suit. That\u2019s when he remembered something important. He only had trunks.  No upper part to hold his breasts. While Kali\u2019s boobs were huge, they would start to feel burdensome like he found out boobs had before. There wasn\u2019t much he could do now, so he pulled on his trunks and left to set up the beach umbrella since girls took a lot longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for finding us a good spot, Jaune,\u201d Ruby stated, beaming as the girls approached. She was wearing a simple two piece bathing suit, red of course.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/eTeGkTx8oqhD76b59\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/eTeGkTx8oqhD76...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Blake made a noncommittal noise and sat her bag down, a book noticeably on top. She was wearing a black two piece.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/Wrg6tc3FvG8MNR469\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/Wrg6tc3FvG8MNR...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about reading,\u201d Yang warned. \u201cYou have to swim at least a little bit.\u201d She was wearing a two piece bright yellow one. Her sunglasses adorned her head.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/2G9d3woFHQDtofQZ6\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/2G9d3woFHQDtof...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be sure not to bother the other guests too much,\u201d Kali told them cheerfully. \u201cBut have fun and enjoy the ocean. I might join you in a bit.\u201d She was wearing a one piece black swimsuit, though Jaune had to look away. He couldn\u2019t see his body with a skintight suit like that. He would burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he debated joining the others, the remote in his bag caught his eye. If he wanted to swap something, like the top of a suit to make it easier for him, he should do it now. He wasn\u2019t sure if the remote was water proof. He could also swap something more if he desired or just avoid swapping now and have fun. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn\u2019t take long for Jaune to make his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, his chest was heavier, but supported by a bright yellow bra with an orange flame symbol in a rough shape of a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis reason was simple. Ruby and Blake hadn\u2019t done anything to him. Kali had been wearing a one piece and Jaune had his dick on her body. If he swapped, it would probably be uncomfortable being trapped in there. Yang\u2019s dis last night about his onesie had sealed the deal.  Rather than just taking the top of her swimsuit, he showed her a little mercy. He understood the pains of letting a large chest bounce free for too long. That earlier swap still <i>weighed </i>on his mind.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nOh, god. I\u2019m turning into Yang.</i> He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune stretched and examined Yang\u2019s situation before shoving the remote deep into his bag. She was now topless with slightly smaller boobs that originally belonged to Kali. Jaune now had Kali\u2019s body with a few improvements. He had his dick instead of her vagina, and now Yang\u2019s larger boobs and top. Man, if he saw a woman like that, he would love to meet her. However, the rest of the world saw him as a guy, so other guys wouldn\u2019t see him as a hot MILF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, Zwei!\u201d Ruby yelled, causing Jaune to flinch slightly because of his sensitive cat ears. She grabbed his arm with one hand and the other hand grabbed an inflatable inner tube. Jaune let her pull him at high speeds to the water\u2019s edge, leaving the others behind. He was her partner, so this was to be expected. The second she touched the water, she jumped. \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d Jaune said, rolling his eyes before making his way in. It wasn\u2019t that cold, but standing on the hot sand made it feel a lot more so. He slowly made his way in along with Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss barked at them from the shore, but wouldn\u2019t go any further into the water than her feet getting wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying the water too, Weiss?\u201d Ruby asked, laughing and splashed her. Weiss jumped back and barked again, sounding a little irritated before stepping into the water again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Jaune sighed and began to float on the water. His chest was helping a lot with that, but no one would notice. \u201cThis is nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe.\u201d Ruby climbed into her tube and floated next to him. \u201cI know, right? The beach is great. Patch has them, but they aren\u2019t nearly as nice as Menagerie. It\u2019s rockier except at a few ports.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus the water isn\u2019t freezing cause we are so far south,\u201d Jaune added. He stood up and his feet just barely scraped the sandy floor. He grinned and splashed Ruby out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Ruby squealed and then started splashing him back. \u201cJerk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have the high ground!\u201d Jaune protested, increasing the intensity of his splashing. \u201cA sneak attack was required.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe SS Ruby will never sink!\u201d Ruby declared, splashing as fast as she could. Jaune was outgunned because of her speed semblance and only had one option. He moved closer to her though the waves of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo tip her tube over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Ruby screamed before hitting the water. A second later she resurfaced and punched Jaune in the shoulder. \u201cThat was mean.\u201d She started treading water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad to being you down to by level,\u201d Jaune replied. \u201cSo, what now? We are on even grounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby answered\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

People of all ages were playing, some younger then them, some older.  They had to wait for a free net, but eventually some kids tossed them the ball and headed toward the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go easy on you!\u201d Ruby declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh.\u201d Jaune stretched a little. \u201cTaller people have the advantage here. You won\u2019t have the high ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll never miss a ball with my speed!\u201d Ruby shot back and served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Jaune had been right. His height let him hit the ball and even make spikes, while Ruby mainly lob the ball over, trying to get to the back line, forcing Jaune away from the net. However, Jaune kept hitting it back. Yet he could never get it to hit the sand. Ruby would vanish in a blur and reappear under the ball almost instantly. It was becoming a battle of endurance. Jaune would normally have the advantage. Ruby was running around in the sand a lot more than him, which would drain her stamina faster. The problem was Jaune had miscalculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had some extra weight on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone time he jumped or darted to the side, the boobs he stole from Yang kept bouncing. It was oddly distracting plus the weight was a little inconvenient. There was also the fact Ruby was bouncing around in front of him. Even though she was a little younger than him, she was cute. Her chest wasn\u2019t as big as Blake\u2019s or Yang\u2019s, but it was respectable. Those distractions caused Jaune to miss a couple easy saves, putting Ruby in the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Kingdom of Rose is about to cause the complete destruction of the Zwei Empire!\u201d Ruby called out, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Zwei never surrenders!\u201d Jaune countered. \u201cPlus, I have a secret weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 I don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed at him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she had been wielding Crescent Rose, a large scythe blade might have been held at his neck at the angry look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Jaune quickly reassured her. \u201cAura, remember? Besides, we shouldn\u2019t use our training on people. Let\u2019s just go. We are causing a scene.\u201d The blow wasn\u2019t hard enough to leave even a bruise, which was lucky. He didn\u2019t want to ruin Kali\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Ruby glanced around and saw people staring.

He had to be careful and went through the Undo Swap button slowly. If he accidentally undid the swap with Zwei, he would find himself back at Beacon with no way to swap back here.

He finally realized what he had done and was glad there didn\u2019t seem to be an repercussions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZwei really does like her,\u201d Yang commented. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t lick me that enthusiastically.\u201d Even when he acted out, everyone saw it as a normal dog thing. Jaune began to think how he could abuse this. Maybe get more intimate times with one of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a noble breed who recognizes a true Huntress.\u201d Weiss replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe really is such a well-behaved and intelligent dog,\u201d Kali added and looked at Ruby. \u201cHow did you family come across him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Ruby answered and immediately began telling it. Jaune zoned out and slouched down, snuggling up against Weiss as she fed him some beef. It was just like his dream, minus the fact Weiss thought he was a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does everyone like him?\u201d Blake muttered dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune looked around and thought about what kind of bizarre swaps he could perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he mostly had been doing up till now was swapping himself with people. However he began to notice going from one person to another tended to make weird combinations. What if he purposely tried to swap other people by using a triangular swap style with himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kali and Ruby, he began to devise a plan. Ruby always said she was an adult, so what if he put her in that position? It took a moment to think about how to do it. Once he settled on the plan, he waited until Ruby go up to throw her trash away before making the swap. The first thing he did was perform a Life Swap with Ruby. There was a flash of green light and Ruby was walking on all fours, topless, around the others while he was wearing her swim red swim suit. He looked really weird and the swimsuit felt uncomfortable around his crotch. It didn\u2019t bother him too much as he knew no one would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next swap was targeting Kali. Instead of a Life Swap again, he perform a Personal Info Swap. The target this time was children. There was a flash of green light, but Jaune didn\u2019t stop to see what happened. He immediately Life Swapped back with Ruby and found himself lying on the corner of the blanket. Ruby returned and sat down. Nothing noticeable had changed yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was good.\u201d Yang sighed and patted her stomach. \u201cThe beach really takes it out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was much, just a few things I scraped together.\u201d Kali replied. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go swimming for 30 mins after eating though, even if you are Huntresses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with just talking.\u201d Weiss stated. She reached over and scratched Jaune behind the ears. \u201cI haven\u2019t had this much sun in a long time and need to reapply sunblock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor Weiss cream is melting.\u201d Yang teased and Weiss rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Yang really doesn\u2019t let up on the jokes.\u201d Blake sighed to Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune\u2019s ears picked up on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to grow up with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m old enough to know the jokes, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune held a hand over his mouth as he tried not to laugh. Ruby was two years younger than Blake, and yet in this reality, Ruby was somehow her mother. He wasn\u2019t sure how that was possible. Though, if Ruby was the mom, that naturally made Yang the aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is your dad?\u201d Kali asked Ruby. \u201cI was hoping he would come along. We haven\u2019t seen each other in years. Ghira was looking forward to it.\u201d So it seemed they were invited because Kali and Ruby\u2019s dad knew each other. The remote altered enough memories so they could still be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncreased Grimm activity near Patch required him to stay behind,\u201d Ruby replied. \u201cHe wanted to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how is it being on the same team with your sister and daughter?\u201d Kali asked Ruby. \u201cGhira and I never had kids. There was just too much going on at the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much different than at home,\u201d Ruby answered. \u201cWeiss was a little upset at first, as she was the odd one out, but I totally got her out of her shell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy exploding!\u201d Yang called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d Weiss muttered, face palming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoose dust.\u201d Blake explained to a confused Kali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune laughed. No matter how much things changed, everyone stayed the same. Perhaps he should take some time to learn about this reality where Ruby was Blake\u2019s mom. There were questions to discover, like who was the dad? How do they explain the age difference? Was Blake just adopted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with everyone distracted, now was the perfect time to make another weird swap. Maybe one to benefit himself?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a dog, he could eat, sleep, and follow cute girls around without anyone being the wiser. If he wanted specific food, he could just swap for it. No. He wanted something that had always escaped him. Even if it would only be because of the remote, Jaune wanted to see what it was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fell on Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, she never gave him the time of day and Jaune had begun to accept that. There were other girls out there, but he still considered her beautiful. He was sure if he could just spend a little time together in a relationship, the remaining feelings could finally be let go. The question was how was he to go about that? If Weiss was dating someone, he could have just swap with the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jaune had to be creative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swapped Ruby back to herself and Kali as Blake's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the girls\u2019 talked, he stood up and walked around. No one paid him much attention, as they figured he was just stretching his legs. The beach was full of couples and Jaune wanted to select the right one. Skipping over families, he found his target. A cute girl with antlers was kissing a boy with a horse mane. Jaune carefully aimed the remote at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of green light and their romantic relationship was swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the girl pushed the boy away and walked over to Jaune. Before he could do anything else, she started kissing him passionately. Surprised by the suddenness of the action, he couldn\u2019t react. When the girl finally broke free, she smiled at him and Jaune took the opportunity to Life Swap with her. He found himself standing opposite of the now topless girl. She was wearing only his swim trunks and he was wearing her two piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She asked, but Jaune ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly aiming at Weiss, another Romantic Relationship Swap was made. The girl in Zwei\u2019s life now turned and headed back toward Jaune\u2019s friends. Before she got very far, Jaune life swapped back with her. The girl no longer had anything to do with him or Weiss and left. Though did not make out with the boy again. The boy didn\u2019t seem to be interested in her either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were simply a casualty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf things went as Jaune wanted, he and Weiss were now in a romantic relationship. There was no way to know exactly what the depth of their relationship was. He chose that couple because they seemed to be in love and were bold enough to make out in public. Weiss\u2019s personality may change that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wrapped his arm around her dainty waist and just basked in the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see blossoming relationships, regardless of race.\u201d Kali beamed at them. \u201cWe still have some time before any of the main festival attractions start.

The door opened and Ruby answered. As she opened her mouth to say hi, Jaune hit the button. There was a flash of light and nothing seemed to have changed. Jaune was still standing outside the room while Ruby was standing inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Jaune,\u201d she greeted him cheerfully. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t have to stay long. Weiss isn\u2019t in the best of mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it about me?\u201d Jaune asked hopefully and Ruby giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of us,\u201d Ruby answered. \u201cMy grade in history is slipping and your combat skills need some\u2026 fine tuning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Jaune sighed dejectedly and Ruby patted his arm. That was one of the nicest ways of saying he was terrible and he appreciated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe and I are just best friends, so she helps me out,\u201d Ruby continued. \u201cSince you\u2019re her team leader, she\u2019s going to be really tough on you. Don\u2019t expect her to go easy on you anymore with your training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnymore?\u201d A memory flashed through Jaune\u2019s mind that he knew didn\u2019t exist before that moment. It was like reliving a scene though a TV. During initiation, Weiss decided to be his partner over Ruby and he was made leader of Team JYBS (pronounced Jaybirds.) Things had been rocky but Weiss had finally opened up to Jaune and Ruby over time. Weiss had been training him, but his constant losses were testing her patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was weird, Jaune thought, rubbing his head. Wish I had more details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ruby asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little headache,\u201d he reassured her. \u201cProbably going to be worse by the time Weiss gets through with me.\u201d Ruby smiled sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe means well, you know.\u201d Jaune nodded. \u201cWell, I\u2019m heading back to my room. Good luck.\u201d Ruby waved goodbye and Jaune stepped into what was formerly Team RWBY\u2019s dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed was the bunkbeds they had set up were still up. It was just Ruby\u2019s bed, also known as the hanging death trap, above Weiss\u2019s bed was much more stable and didn\u2019t look like It was about to fall down. Jaune recognized an X-Ray and Vav comic he owned on the top bunk, indicating that was his bed. One of the desks had all his books and writing stuff scattered around on it. Other than those two details, the room looked the same as normal. The remote changed everything to fit the new information. All of Ruby\u2019s stuff was probably in his old room now. One of Yang\u2019s bras was even lying out in the open on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom door opened and Jaune turned to see Weiss stepping back into the room. She was wearing her traditional thigh-length strapless dress with a faint color gradation from white to pale blue at the hem, which was stitched to resemble snowflakes, and a white bell-sleeved bolero. Their eyes met and she glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d She shouted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Jaune apologized by instinct. His fear was that the remote only switched his and Ruby\u2019s perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all that training we\u2019ve done,\u201d Weiss scolded, marching up and slapping him upside the head. \u201cYou\u2019ve only gotten your defense fixed. There were so many times that brute Cardin telegraphed his attacks and left himself wide open. You need to learn to be more aggressive and counter attack. Just because you use a shield and have a high amount of Aura doesn\u2019t mean you can just turtle the entire match.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was true. Pyrrha said the same things to him. Jaune liked to defend and leave offense to his team members, like Nora. The issue was people won\u2019t attack him if he\u2019s not a threat and, unless he attacks them in that situation, he won\u2019t be useful. Intercepting and counter attacking would be the preferred method of fighting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 eh?\u201d Jaune wasn\u2019t use to being alone with Weiss for this long, let alone her going over his match with him. \u201cI take it you have an idea of what to do?\u201d Weiss smiled sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going down to a training room and you aren\u2019t leaving until you successfully counter attack me three times in a row.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune gulped.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was wearing a black hoody underneath a white chest plate and his shoulders were protected by spaulders. In front of him, Weiss stood before him in a fencer pose. Her rapier held up and pointed directly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Arc,\u201d she replied. \u201cThat would defeat the purpose of training.\u201d A white glyph appeared behind her. Her semblance. Out of nowhere, without even changing her footing, she charged forward. Jaune raised his shield to intercept the blow and felt himself being pushed backwards. Weiss wasn\u2019t that physically strong, by the momentum caused by her glyph increased her striking power. He felt another couple blows batter his shield. \u201cCome on. You can\u2019t hide behind it forever.\u201d Peaking over the shield after deflecting another blow, Jaune raised his sword and yelled as he swung downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stepped back to avoid the blow and pelted his arm with her rapier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to bait you into attacking,\u201d she reprimanded, her gaze stern. \u201cYou need to control the battlefield and not listen to your opponents antagonizing you.\u201d Jaune nodded and they repeated the process. After thirty minutes, Weiss was growing frustrated in his lack of improvement. \u201cAttack me seriously already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying!\u201d Jaune protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re holding yourself back. That\u2019s the worst thing you can do in training. You need to go all out. It could end up costing you and your team their lives if you don\u2019t know your true capabilities.\u201d Jaune gritted his teeth at the thought of Weiss falling because of his stupid mistakes. He raised his shield and sword once more. Something about him must have changed, because Weiss\u2019s expression grew serious. She bolted forward using another glyph and, this time, Jaune was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw his shield into her as she accelerated forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH!\u201d Weiss was not expecting that action and she was forced to batter the shield away with her rapier. The motion took away all of her attack power and Jaune took advantage of her confusion. He charged forward and rammed his shoulder into her stomach, knocking the air out of her. \u201cOomph!\u201d As Weiss fell back, Jaune landed on top of her and brought his sword down next to her head. A loud clang echoed in the training room as his sword hit metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot you,\u201d Jaune declared from above her. Weiss glared at him, but there was a hint of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time,\u201d she said. \u201cNow can you get off of me?\u201d Jaune scrambled to his feet at held out a hand to help her up, which she accepted. \u201cThat was... unorthodox to say the least and it showed my own inexperience. Next time, that won\u2019t work against me, so you need to keep practicing. You can\u2019t be afraid to strike back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we done?\u201d Jaune asked cautiously, noticing Weiss was walking back toward a bench to grab a towel. \u201cI thought I had to do it three times in a row?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to avoid a lucky strike from you flailing around,\u201d Weiss informed him. \u201cThat was more than luck, so you pass today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew.\u201d Jaune collapsed on the bench next to her and removed his chest plate. He then raised his hoody and wiped the sweat from his face. Weiss was merciless and the workout was exhausting. As she watched him, Jaune realized something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still in Coco\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he wiped his face, he inadvertently revealed his breasts. He had changed into his combat attire in the male locker-room and had been partially in a daze Weiss was spending time with him. Besides, all he really did was throw clothes and armor over his shirt. No one else was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shall practice here tomorrow after class for at least an hour tomorrow,\u201d Weiss told him in a tone saying he had no choice. There was no hint she even registered his female form. \u201cI\u2019m cutting training time today because you participated in Professor Goodwitch\u2019s combat class. Can\u2019t have you collapse from exhaustion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss,\u201d Jaune said sincerely. \u201dThanks for all the help. I really mean it.\u201d This left him time to think about what he learned. Body Swap definitely did not change people\u2019s perspective of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph.\u201d She sniffed loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do. We can hardly have our team leader be weak, regardless of how well your planning skills are.\u201d Jaune blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Weiss just compliment him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m heading back to the dorm. If you decide to stay back and train, don\u2019t push yourself too much.\u201d Jaune nodded and watched her head toward the female locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were right. She didn\u2019t hold back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of petals, Ruby appeared next to him. She was wearing her usual black long sleeved dress with red trim on the sleeves and skirt, a black waist cincher with red lacing up the front, a pair of thick black stockings, black combat boots with red laces, and her signature red hooded cloak.  Crescent Rose, her signature weapon, a high caliber sniper rifle that could transform into a large scythe was currently in its compact mode on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem in a better mood though,\u201d Ruby commented, looking at his face closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI passed today\u2019s practice,\u201d Jaune said proudly, puffing out his chest. This accentuated Coco\u2019s chest, not that Ruby noticed. She only laughed at his bravado. \u201cWeiss may be strict, no not may, is, definitely is. But she\u2019s not unreasonable. We know we need the help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ruby admitted. \u201cShe can just be a bit\u2026 intense. Less shouting wouldn\u2019t hurt too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jaune mused. \u201cShe managed to kick my butt into gear that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re having fun.\u201d Ruby rolled her eyes. \u201cI came here to see if you needed cheering up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Jaune raised an eyebrow. \u201cWell, I appreciate it, Rubes. What were you going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Ruby twisted her foot onto the ground nervously. \u201cI thought you might like a chance to shoot Crescent Rose a few times. Since you don\u2019t have a range weapon and all.\u201d Jaune\u2019s eyes widened at the offer. Ruby was very protective of her weapon and rarely let anyone tough it, let alone use it. She really wanted to cheer him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby\u2026 I\u2026 thanks.\u201d Jaune wrapped her in a one arm hug. \u201cThat means a lot, Crater Face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust for that, Vomit Boy,\u201d Ruby replied and stuck her tongue out at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t get the honor today!\u201d She disappeared in a flash of rose petals only to appear twenty feet away. Her Semblance was high speed movement that for some reason left those petals behind. Her expression softened and Jaune knew if he pressed the issue, she would let him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back to normal Jaune. Let me know if you ever want to hang out. I\u2019m going to go see if I can find Pyrrha.\u201d Ruby turned around and Jaune reached for the remote in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opportunity was too good to pass up. He could swap their weapons, or their Semblances, not that he discovered his yet, or something else. Whatever he swapped could always be given back once he had his fun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he tried, he probably would lose a foot. Her speed Semblance on the other hand was something he really wanted to try. Any Semblance actually would be fun to try out, as he didn\u2019t have one. There was a flash of light and Jaune didn\u2019t feel any different. Ruby exited the training room and he was left all alone.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWhat do I do now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune wasn\u2019t sure how to activate the Semblance. Did he just will it, was it something to do with Aura, or did it take a specific stimulus? Jaune tried to relax and let him mind inform him on what to do, like what happened when he switched team positions with Ruby. There weren\u2019t memories, but more like a flash of insight this time. He looked to the other side of the room and stepped forward. Everything around him blurred and he nearly fell over. In an instant, he crossed the room.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThis is awesome.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune tried again and bolted across the room at speeds that human eyes couldn\u2019t follow. Ruby had been told several times by their professor to try to avoid repeating the same attack patterns, even with her speed. Now that he experienced it firsthand, Jaune understood he had to plan the route out ahead of time. He repeated moving in a straight line a few more times before trying to turn. His first attempt at this ended up with him slamming into a wall. It took a minute to clear up the disorientation from the impact. He tried again, letting his body move on instinct like someone who had used this Semblance before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it down!\u201d Jaune cried out, as he began to spin in circles around the room. Unlike Ruby, who had to learn this from scratch, Jaune had swapped an experienced Semblance. It was like trying to build a table and then just watching a show of someone building a table you own. Takes a lot more work to build one. Now, he didn\u2019t think using this is combat would be effective, as he was inexperienced with it. \u201cWhat should I do now? It\u2019s still early and tomorrow is Saturday. There\u2019s so much time to try everything.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could give back her Semblance then. There was no danger of fighting Grimm without it. Tonight, he was zipping along the halls like Ruby always did. No one gave him any strange looks, just like when it was Ruby. This was a regular occurrence. How she did this in a skirt was beyond him. Jaune was relieved he was wearing pants. The biggest issue was Coco\u2019s breasts were rubbing against his shirt and they were getting uncomfortable. He really either needed to swap for a bra or give them up. As luck would have it, he rounded a corner and saw Velvet and Coco with his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This works our perfectly</i>, Jaune thought, hitting the remote and swapping his body back with Coco. He couldn\u2019t just hit the Undo or Reset All buttons because that would switch his and Ruby\u2019s positions back too, as that swap happened later. Now, the only two swaps still in effect were with Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Velvet,\u201d Jaune greeted, slowing down as he passed them. Ever since Jaune stood up to some bullies for her, they had been friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Jaune,\u201d Velvet replied kindly and smiled at him. Her bunny ears stood up excitedly. Jaune grinned back and then bolted off. \u201cI\u2019m always surprised how fast he is,\u201d she said to Coco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully he\u2019s not too fast in bed,\u201d Coco replied and slapped Velvet\u2019s butt, earning a high pitch eep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the two of them know, Jaune didn\u2019t leave.

Naturally, his first thought was swapping for the two fluffy brown rabbit ears on her head. The reason wasn\u2019t racist in the slightest. He was just wondering what having an extra set of ears were like. Really, any Faunus part interested him. A human never got the opportunity to have them. Besides, they looked really cool to Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next option was swapping bodies with her. Jaune liked the feeling of the female body. It\u2019s just, if he did it this time, he should combine it with a wardrobe swap. That way, he would have the support needed. Velvet was pretty well-endowed. He didn\u2019t want to use a Life Swap this time, because it would put him on another team instead of the leader of Weiss\u2019s team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother possibility was swapping some personal information or personality. The thought of swapping races with her was tempting. Would be gain rabbit ears in his own hair color, or would he have a different Faunus trait? It was something he could experiment with. Of course, that meant Cardin and his team would pick on him twice as much. For some reason, they didn\u2019t like Faunus.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He now had two sets of ears, the normal human ones and now the rabbit ones. Coco and Velvet continued on their way, talking as if nothing had changed. To them, it hadn\u2019t. He could hear them talking from a much larger distance than he would normally. When he focused on those two, he could make out their conversation. Their exact words didn\u2019t interest him too much right now though. He disappeared in a flash of rose petals and bolted to the nearest restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into a mirror, he reached up and felt his new ears. They were soft and sensitive, yet warm. Concentrating, he could change the way they were pointing to listen to everything around him. He smiled, impressed at their usefulness. It was then he noticed something and turned his head. His original ears seemed a little smaller and he leaned forward to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Those aren\u2019t my ears,</i> Jaune thought. When he selected ears with the Body Swap function, the remote switched all the ears. These ears were smaller because they also used to belong to Velvet.<i> I guess it doesn\u2019t matter. They aren\u2019t pierced or anything and there\u2019s not much difference. </i>He felt his new bunny ears one last time and then a thought occurred to him. His hand reached into his pocket and pulled out his student ID. It still listed him as a human. <i>So I\u2019m a human with rabbit ears. Okay, not the strangest thing today.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the bathroom, he once again heard everything around him as much higher volumes. These ears were like sonar and Jaune took the opportunity to see if he could detect anyone he knew from a distance without using his eyes. There were a lot of conversations in the hallways and they jumbled together. It took practice to separate the voices. Finally, he heard one of his friends and made a beeline for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did he find?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was just thinking of looking for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard you down the hall,\u201d Jaune answered, pointing to his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and your amazing hearing,\u201d Yang sighed and rolled her eyes. From her reaction, everyone knew about his ears and considered it normal. The remote was indeed powerful. Yang probably finished some training, as she was wearing an orange tank top, some tight black workout shorts, and sneakers that left nothing to the imagination. With her figure, large chest, and outgoing personality, she liked to strut her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby having fun on her team?\u201d Jaune asked, curious as to what Ruby\u2019s life was like with his former team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay to much sometimes,\u201d Yang confirmed. \u201cPart of me wishes we were on the same team, but it\u2019s good she\u2019s spreading her wings.\u201d She threw her arm around Jaune\u2019s shoulders. \u201cPlus, she\u2019s so much fun to tease.

Your first fight lasted, what? Thirty seconds? Now it goes on for a couple minutes and you even drop his Aura ten to fifteen percent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m letting the team down sometimes,\u201d Jaune admitted. It was how he felt on his old team. His new team still had to rely on him as a leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got other skills,\u201d Yang assured him. \u201cThanks to you and Ruby, Weiss is bearable. Then there was that insane plan you came up with during initiation to take down the Nevermore. Heh, you put on some more muscles and girls would find you hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink Weiss would get jealous?\u201d Jaune asked hopefully and Yang rolled her eyes before patting him on the shoulder sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to do a lot more to impress her,\u201d Yang informed him. \u201cNot saying you have to give up, just that you need to know the long road ahead of you. First impressions are important and you blew yours.\u201d Her voiced lowered to imitate his. \u201cHey, Snow Angel. How about you and I be on the same team?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it, I get it.\u201d Jaune didn\u2019t need to be reminded of that and swore he would do something to embarrass Yang back. The remote in his pocket was itching to be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, enough talking,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cI\u2019m starving. Let\u2019s go get some grub. I sent a message to her a few minutes ago saying we should meet for dinner. Blake too. Haven\u2019t seen here since after class though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ran into her in the courtyard.

The hardest to resist was the bulge in his pants as they walked to the cafeteria. Yang was leading the way, her shorts clinging to her swaying ass every time she took a step. The pants Jaune was wearing hid it a little bit, but if Yang caught even a hint of that, she would mock him mercilessly. Or hit him. Fifty-fifty. However, that gave Jaune an idea on what to swap. Slowly removing the remote from his pocket, he aimed at Yang and clicked the Body Part Swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the front of his pants loosened as the symbol of Jaune\u2019s manhood disappeared to be replaced by Yang\u2019s vagina. His first urge was to examine it, but this was neither the time nor place to do so. It wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Running away would also be suspicious. Besides, he wanted to enjoy the show. He and Yang entered the cafeteria to see Blake in a corner table with a book in hand and a barely touched plate in from of her. She must have just sat down, was waiting for them, or got involved in her book that she forgot about her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was having a difficult time with Jaune\u2019s fully erected dick. While she didn\u2019t say anything and no one else mentioned it, her steps were a little wider to accommodate. When she turned, it took all of Jaune\u2019s strength not to burst out laughing. Those tight shorts of hers did not charge much in size, so it was wrapped tightly around his, well now Yang\u2019s dick. There was a significant bulge and the online of his full member was clearly visible. Yang occasionally reached down and pulled at her shorts discreetly to adjust them. However, it was no use, as those shorts were already tight on her and were not made to contain dick and balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to act normally as they grabbed their food and headed toward Blake. He wanted to keep watching Yang struggle with a male erection but he couldn\u2019t get caught looking. She would hit him. The noisy cafeteria didn\u2019t help much either with his new sensitive hearing. Jaune sat across from Blake and Yang sat down next to her. Jaune mentally noted that when Yang sat down, her legs were open more like how men sat, rather than closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Blake,\u201d Yang greeted. \u201cWere you waiting long?\u201d She shook her head, her eyes on her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see Weiss?\u201d Jaune asked. She shook her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Yang said with a sigh and reached over to push down Blake\u2019s book. \u201cYou\u2019ve been reading that book all afternoon. Talk with us.\u201d Blake sighed and grudgingly obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat book was really interesting,\u201d Blake said to Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat smut?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not smut!\u201d Blake countered. \u2018It\u2019s artistic literature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo smut?\u201d Jaune asked and he high fived Yang. Blake glared at him. \u201cI have seven sisters and I saw the title of that book. I know the series. It\u2019s smut Blake, even if it has good plot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve read it?\u201d Yang stared at him in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the first few books in the series,\u201d Jaune replied with a shrug. \u201cThere were times I had to hide from my sisters and those were the only things around to pass the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you only read comic books,\u201d Blake admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI prefer comics,\u201d Jaune corrected her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to judge your tastes in literature, if you don\u2019t judge mine. And before you say anything, comics are literature.\u201d Blake had opened her mouth and closed it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe read you like a book,\u201d Yang commented. That terrible pun received boos from both Blake and Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Weiss.\u201d Jaune notified the others and they turned around. He waved to his new partner and received a nod of acknowledgment. Weiss joined them a few minutes later after getting a chicken salad and an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did our leader do in training?\u201d Yang asked immediately and Jaune buried his face in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming along,\u201d Weiss stated and her gaze fell onto Jaune. \u201cHe\u2019s still got a way to go, but he\u2019ll be able to beat that brute Cardin soon for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice.\u201d Yang gave her a thumbs up. \u201cI have to restrain myself all the time from punching that pompous asshole in the face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw Ruby enter the cafeteria with Pyrrha. Both of them looked like they were having fun and Jaune was glad his swap didn\u2019t cause them any problems. Ren and Nora hadn\u2019t returned yet, but that was pretty normal for them. Jaune\u2019s hand reached down and touched the remote in his pocket. If he wanted, he could do another swap.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The power was kind of addicting and he wanted to do another swap. Even if it wasn\u2019t big, there was just something about being able to. He still needed to examine his new genitals before giving them back to Yang. It wasn\u2019t like anyone would be upset if he kept it for a little bit. Tonight was going to be fun. He glanced at each member of his team in turn, and then the people at the surrounding tables. His eyes eventually returned back onto Blake\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were bright amber with black irises. Occasionally, when she got irritated, they tended to resemble cat eyes. Now that Jaune knew she was a cat Faunus, it made sense. Most Faunus also had extremely good night vision. Deciding it would be fun to have her eyes for a while, he did a quick Body Part Swap. Blake\u2019s eyes turned blue when the flash of light faded. Jaune glanced down at his spoon and saw his reflection. His eyes were now amber and he blinked. His sight seemed to be a little better than normal and people farther away were a little clearer to him. Not much, but it was noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bunny ears twitched in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing his team was finishing up dinner, Jaune shoved the last few bites into his mouth and dumped off his tray with them. They were planning to go back to their dorm room and this would be Jaune\u2019s last chance to do another swap with the people in the cafeteria, unless he decided to stay behind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the most part, the remote\u2019s selections were pretty straight forward. The only thing Jaune couldn\u2019t completely predict was people\u2019s reactions to the swap. While everything was considered normal, there were some differences in reactions, like Yang pointing out his ears or trying to walk with an erection. Funny enough, it had gone down while they were talking and Yang was having a much easier time dealing with his dick. The bulge was still there though and only grew when some hot guys passed and she took the opportunity to examine them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Life Swap button hadn\u2019t been used yet, but Jaune didn\u2019t have any immediate plans to try it out yet. He was already the team leader of three very attractive girls and his school life hadn\u2019t changed much. He was sure to try it out at some point though. The Body Part Swap was the one he was abusing the most, and he had received a pair of ears, new eyes, and a vagina as a result. His hand moved down automatically and he had to mentally berate himself for thinking of touching himself in public like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swaps with the most interesting outcomes were probably the Personal Info ones. He had Ruby\u2019s speed Semblance and her team leader roll. Yet, the universe corrected itself as if those swaps had always been. Jaune wished he knew how it worked, but figured it was far beyond the limits of what he could comprehend. Most of the Personal Info Swaps were pretty straight forward except for one. It was Perceived Gender Swap. Gender Swap was obvious, if he swapped with a girl, he would become a female version of himself and they would become a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does the perceived mean?</i> Jaune thought and shrugged. He might as well try it out. The undo button existed for a reason. As he left the cafeteria with the others, he aimed at a random girl with light tan skin and dusky rose hair who was wearing a red and white jacket with a beanie. There was a flash of light letting Jaune know it worked, but he didn\u2019t feel any difference. The girl didn\u2019t look any different either and carried on with her team. <i>Weird. I guess it didn\u2019t do anything?</i> He felt a little dejected and headed back to his dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the door closed behind them, Yang pulled off her top and tossed it on her bed before heading to the closet. She was wearing a bright yellow bra underneath the tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang!\u201d Weiss cried out. \u201cShow some decency!\u201d Jaune was torn between turning away in embarrassment and staring at the amazing sight before him. Every move Yang made, her boobs jiggled and he was amazed that bra could contain them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Yang asked, smirking. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t go prancing around naked,\u201d Weiss declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Yang challenged, gesturing to her bra and bulging shorts. \u201cI still have clothes on. Besides, it\u2019s just us girls here.\u201d Jaune froze and stared at Yang in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Blake added. \u201cYou know the rules, Weiss. I mean, you\u2019re the one that said she just couldn\u2019t prance around naked.\u201d Weiss sighed and rubbed her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026 just try not to make a scene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, Ice Queen,\u201d Yang assured her. \u201cI\u2019m just changing because I\u2019m heading over to watch a movie with Ruby\u2019s team tonight. You all are welcome to come.\u201d Her eyes fell on Blake, who tried to ignore them. After a minute, she realized the effort was futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Blake relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m heading to the library to pick up a book I need,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby\u2019s going to miss her BFF,\u201d Yang chided and Weiss rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, Jaune was trying to process everything. The others considered him a girl, yet he hadn\u2019t changed at all. He looked into the mirror and noted he looked exactly the same, and then it dawned on him. Perceived must have meant it\u2019s just how people see him. They all believe he\u2019s a girl, regardless what he looked like. This required a test to make sure. He walked over to his dresser and pulled out a pair of shorts and a t-shirt. If Yang could change clothes openly and he was a girl in their eyes, he should be able to too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arm shook, as he took off his shirt. The only sign anyone noticed was Weiss, who diverted her eyes due to her embarrassment of nudity. Smiling, Jaune then changed his pant into shorts, fully aware of his lack of equipment down below. The rest of his team was leaving, so he had some choices of what he could do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He would be able to enjoy the peace and quiet of an empty room for at least an hour, if Weiss\u2019s normal library visits were any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun,\u201d Jaune replied with a grin and she narrowed her now blue eyes at him. He gave her a thumbs up and she rolled her eyes in response, though her expression lightened. As they began to leave, Jaune got another idea and held up the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he felt a little guilty, he was in a school with a lot of girls that could pass as supermodels. Now that he was also rooming with three of them, one of whom being his long time crush, his needs only got worse. He was planning to have some \u2018me time\u2019 and much needed stress relief when the girls were out. Plus, as the world saw him as a girl, why not take the opportunity to see what it\u2019s like for them. As Yang was about to leave, he hit the Body Part Swap button. His chest exploded outwards into two large breasts, while Yang\u2019s deflated. Both of their shirts immediately adjusted to their new sizes. None of the girls noticed that the most well-endowed girl among them was now completely flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I never thought I would get to play with breasts like this</i>, Jaune thought to himself. He felt Yang\u2019s former breasts through his shirt. They were soft, yet firm enough they didn\u2019t droop even without a bra. Checking to make sure the door was locked, he finally took off his shirt so he could see them in a mirror. It was the strangest site he ever saw. Jaune was mostly himself, minus his cute rabbit ears and amber eyes. The breasts did not belong with his frame, yet there they were. Every move they made, they bounced or jiggled. He reached up and started messaging them. A soft moan escaped his lips as pleasure coursed through him. \u201cYang, your breasts are perfect,\u201d Jaune muttered and eyed one the slightly darker nipples. He gentle squeezed one and nearly jumped. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong shock ran through him at the sensitivity. No longer able to control himself, he climbed onto his bed and tore off his pants. His new vagina was soaking wet and he glanced down at the shiny pink folds. He reached a shaking hard down to it, not truly believing what he was about to do, and lightly stroked it with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis entire body shivered and he had barely done anything. The pleasure was too great for him to turn around now. Moving by instinct, he slipped a finger into the slippery hole. He gasped, but kept moving his finger in and out with a squishing sound. His free hand started rubbing his breast and he stuck a second finger into his vagina. The walls were sucking on his fingers as he moved them in and out, pleasure shooting through his entire body. He moved them faster and arched his back, as he felt his lower body tremble and begin to build up pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m about to-\u2026!\u201d He never finished that sentence as he released all over his hand. A moment later, he collapsed back onto his bed, still panting. His other hand was still pinching his nipple lightly. \u201cI think that was the best orgasm I ever had. Beats being a guy by far.\u201d He tilted his head up slightly and watched his breasts move up and down. \u201cNot sure if I ever want to give this back, but I feel bad for Yang. She is a friend and should give her stuff back. Maybe there\u2019s someone else I can swap with?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess that\u2019s okay. I can get Blake\u2019s eyes anytime I want.\u201d He hit the Undo button four times. The familiar equipment between his legs returned as he lost the additional weight on his chest. His eyesight also returned to normal. It would be a lie to say giving everything back to Yang was purely out of the goodness of his heart. A small part of him didn\u2019t want to see a girl with his dick, especially one he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring Weiss would wonder where he was, Jaune left a note on her desk saying he had to run into Vale real quick and would be back later tonight. Curfew was extended on Friday and Saturday nights, so he had several hours. Making his way out of Beacon, he boarded the first available Bullhead. Not enjoying the ride over due to motion sickness, he used the remote to swap Personal Info with a random student. He suddenly felt fine and no longer had the urge to vomit. The other guy looked a little green, but it wasn\u2019t serious. The second the Bullhead landed Jaune pushed himself to the front and exited, excited about his new prospects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears twitched excitedly in every direction as he took in the surroundings. The sun was just beginning to set, so most of the street lights were still off. Plenty of people were running around working, shopping, or just hanging out.

A Friday afternoon meant they would be crowded and plenty of possibly targets for a swap. If he didn\u2019t want to do any swapping, he might as well have a little fun. It wasn\u2019t hard to find one, not with the glowing neon signs. Jaune stopped near the entrance and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on, it\u2019s just like back home. Go in, get a drink, relax, and then jump onto the dance floor. You\u2019re a Hunter in training, so you can actually drink alcohol if you show them your ID. It will loosen you up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune walked into the club and immediately regretted it. The booming music caused his rabbit ears to curl back in shock and he stumbled for a moment. The club was a lot noisier than back home. In hindsight, he should have expected that. The dance floor was packed and, rather than fighting his way through, he sat down at the bar and flashed his ID. Jaune wasn\u2019t the strongest drinker and ordered a mix drink to help settle his nerves, while his eyes scanned the crowd. There were a lot of attractive girls and many guys trying to hit on said girls. The bartender passed Jaune and put down a couple drinks in front of two girls. Both were probably in their early 20s and decently hot. Not as much as Yang or Weiss, but above average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ear twitched and he caught some of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.courtesy of the gentlemen over there,\u201d the bartender informed the girls, gesturing to a group of four guys maybe a year or two older than Jaune. The guys waved and one of the girls gave a short wave back. The other one rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only good thing about going to these places is the free drinks from idiots like those guys,\u201d the second girl said. \u201cWhy they think they can get with us after buying a drink is beyond me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that,\u201d the first girl said. \u201cWithout people like them, we would have to pay for stuff ourselves.\u201d Both of them laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s get going. If we wait too long, they might get the courage to talk to us.\u201d The two of them drained their glasses and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr that loser next to us.\u201d Jaune gritted his teeth when he realized they were talking about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let\u2019s see you manipulate guys as one</i>, Jaune thought, hitting the Personal Info Perceived Gender Swap button. Nothing happened except a flash of light, until Jaune looked at his ID. It was back to saying he was female, rather than male. The two girls, well one girl and one guy, left and Jaune noticed the guys they passed were only glancing at one of them.  <i>With luck, everyone will think they are a couple and neither will get any drinks.</i> Jaune was proud of himself on teaching a couple mean girls a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey giiirrrrllll!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune nearly fell out of his chair when a cheerful voice spring up right behind him. He turned around to see a young girl around his age with a light complexion. She had green eyes and red-orange hair done up in four pigtails with light blue streaks in her bangs. A pink tail indicated she was a Faunus. The girl\u2019s outfit was an assortment of bright colors. She was wearing a light blue cropped tank top over a dark purple bra, dark purple short shorts under a pink combat mini-skirt, and a white belt. She also had a white cat bell collar around her neck along with white and black gloves that reached her elbow.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/84/dc/ae/84dcaeadd0b9e693c6f9e63f9f72b9d0--neon-katt-rwby-red.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/84/dc/ae/84dca...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d the girl apologized. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to scare you.

Her outfit was a little more revealing and Jaune didn\u2019t know where to look without offending her. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just thought you looked lonely,\u201d Neon admitted, grabbing a seat next to him. \u201cNo friends to hang out with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh.\u201d Jaune quickly wracked his mind for a believable excuse. \u201cOnly one of my friends is really into these kinds of places and she\u2019s visiting her sister.

Neon caught his eye and grinned at him. He knew what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was challenging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune grinned back. Neon had no idea who she was messing with. He wasn\u2019t the champion back home for nothing. It was time to up his game. This was not the time to hold back. Jaune started breaking out all of his moves he learned over the years and the crowd loved it. Neon\u2019s eyes went wide and her grin grew. Her dance moves increased in complexity too and the circle around them grew larger. Most people had stopped dancing and were watching the dance off. When the song finally ended, the two of them stopped dancing. They stood there panting and sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd\u2019s roar of approval caused Jaune\u2019s ears to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you learn to dance like that?\u201d Neon demanded as they sat down. Her eyes were sparkling. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone keep up with me for years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I have a lot of sisters and learned how to dance from them,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cThere was a club back home I went to a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure know how to party, girl.\u201d Neon laughed and ordered them a couple drinks. \u201cThose dance moves were super crazy awesome! Next round\u2019s on me. I think we need it after that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch appreciated,\u201d Jaune agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl before him sure knew her way around a club and she started talking about a few raves she participated in back home. The girl was way more than Jaune could handle on a normal basis, but for one night? She was a great guide. His mood was interrupted a little when a couple guys came over. Jaune could understand them hitting on Neon, but one of them tried to hit on him too. Even if they did see him as a girl, it was a bit disconcerting. Neon stood up and chased them away, her tail flickering over the table. Jaune couldn\u2019t resist the temptation presented right in front of him and selected Body Part Swap again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next second, he flickered his new pink cat tail back and forth. The fact his jeans now had a hole in the back for his tail wasn\u2019t lost on him. Neon was wearing a skirt and her tail had been right above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d Jaune asked and Neon\u2019s eyes glowed with mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could stay here, hit another club nearby, or\u2026\u201d She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr\u2026 what?\u201d Jaune said, knowing she was purposely baiting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one exclusive club we could try to get in,\u201d Neon informed him. \u201cIt\u2019s called Junior\u2019s. There\u2019s always a line of people trying to get in. Sometimes girls can cut in front. The rumors are the parties are amazing, even if the club is a little rougher than this one. Want to try?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Neon slapped him in the back in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI pegged you as the adventurous type the moment I saw you,\u201d Neon told him, as they got up and left the club. \u201cI bet you break all sorts of rules back at Beacon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe.\u201d Jaune rubbed the back of his head. The fake transcripts, food fight, and all the times they either cover Nora\u2019s antics or went along with them flashed through his mind. \u201cYou could say that. Property damage happens a lot around a friend of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe sounds like a blast.\u201d They two of them made their way to the bus stop right when the bus pulled away. \u201cDang it!\u201d Neon moaned and checked the schedule on her phone. \u201cWe have to wait thirty minutes for another one? That\u2019s like, forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know where the club is?\u201d Jaune asked and Neon nodded. She held up her phone and Jaune made note of the direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? You have a car hidden somewhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cBut I have another mode of transportation. It\u2019s not too far, so I should be able to carry you.\u201d Ruby carried him before with her speed Semblance, so he should be able to carry Neon. Neon tilted her head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean carry-\u2026?\u201d She never finished her sentence as Jaune grabbed her and disappeared in a flash of rose petals to anyone looking at them. He was moving at speeds normal eyes couldn\u2019t follow. In only a few minutes, he stopped and set Neon down about a block away from Junior\u2019s.  She stumbled to her feet and stared at him, her mouth hanging open slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, probably should have given you some warning, huh?\u201d Jaune rubbed his head sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Neon agreed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll forgive you\u2026. BECAUSE THAT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME!\u201d She hugged him. \u201cYour Semblance is amazing. I bet you had fun first discovering it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d He felt guilty about stealing it from Ruby now. \u201cShall we get going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Neon skipped forward so suddenly Jaune had to half run to catch up. She had not been kidding. There was a huge line of people forming up. There were people around their age all the way up to easily in the thirty to forties. \u201cNervous?\u201d She elbowed him in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little,\u201d Jaune confirmed. \u201cNever been to an exclusive club.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust follow my lead,\u201d Neon reassured him and walked forward. The bouncer turned two guys away before Neon reached him. She waved to him and leaned forward to show off her cleavage. The bouncer rolled his eyes and let her in. Jaune couldn\u2019t believe how easy it was to get in, with all the people waiting. He stepped forward and the bouncer in a suit and red sunglasses stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 I\u2019m with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack of the line, girl.\u201d He growled. \u201cClubs full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u2026\u201d Jaune began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack of the line!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune sighed and stepped back, reaching for his phone. He could call Neon about another way to get in or just leave and let her enjoy herself. His hand touched the remote and that gave him a third option.</span></div></div>",

A few more guests were allowed in before a couple people from the line were allowed. Two less attractive guys were ejected from the line, along with a plump girl. Jaune was beginning to get a glimmer of an idea on how to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There\u2019s a certain level of attractiveness, importance, or popularity to get in. The bouncer is weeding out less desirable people based on the clubs direction most likely. They are letting a few normal people in, probably so their reputation spread. So to get in, all I need to do is swap with someone who they want. Not like waiting in line is going to be feasible.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent a moment surveying possible targets when one woman caught his eye. She was obviously rich based on her elegant long black dress and her large sunglasses obscured most of her face. She was getting out of a limo and someone from the club came out to greet her. Jaune acted quickly and hit the Personal Info Swap button as he walked forward toward the bouncer again. This time, he swapped attractiveness. If he was right, he should be able to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer waved him in immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knew it,</i> Jaune thought. Once he was safely inside, he hit the undo so the woman could get in. He had been told his looks were average, maybe slightly above. If the world saw him as a girl, he would only be an average one. Switching attractiveness meant he was considered beautiful and the bouncer let him in. The music was loud and thumping, but he was used to it now. He looked around and saw Neon at a table talking with a guy who looked like he was hitting on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s my friend,\u201d Neon informed the guy. \u201cI\u2019m hanging out with her today, so go ahead and scram.\u201d The guy didn\u2019t look too depressed and left. \u201cAbout time. I figured you got lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad to convince the bouncer to let me in,\u201d Jaune explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you didn\u2019t do anything too extreme,\u201d Neon said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, he was understanding.\u201d Neon raised an eyebrow but didn\u2019t press the issue. Jaune then noticed two shots were already on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigured we could take one before hitting the dance floor,\u201d Neon explained, holding up her glass. Jaune held up his and they clinked the glasses together before downing them. \u201cAlright, girl. Let\u2019s show these squares how to party!\u201d She grabbed Jaune\u2019s hand and pulled him toward the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the next thirty minutes dancing and were drawing a crowd again. This time, a lot of other girls and some guys joined in. Everyone was having a blast. Eventually, Jaune and Neon needed a break. The crowd was a little disappointed, but Neon promised they would be back. She and Jaune sat down and ordered a few drinks from the bar. They quickly learned several guys had paid for their drinks ahead of time while they were dancing. The two of them downed two shots each before sipping a cosmopolitan. It was kind of a girly fruity drink, but Jaune liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Girls are lucky they can drink this stuff without being judged,</i> Jaune thought and rubbed his temple. The loud music was getting to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything wrong?\u201d Neon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust have sensitive ears,\u201d Jaune replied with a shrug. \u201cI get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo, I can see how that would damper your mood,\u201d Neon said sympathetically. \u201cDon\u2019t see too many humans with animal parts like a tail and ears. Usually, it\u2019s just Faunus.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut who am I to talk. I\u2019m a Faunus without any animal trait.\u201d Jaune was pretty sure biology didn\u2019t work like that, as only Faunus had animal parts. The remote, however, must have altered reality to make that excuse reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re already pretty enough,\u201d Jaune assured her and she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlattery will get you everywhere,\u201d Neon told him. \u201cIf only you were a guy. I would totally date you after tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could change that,</i> Jaune thought to himself and then remembered Weiss back at beacon. <i>Nah, I love Weiss. I\u2019m not going to date anyone else and it would be rude to date her without being serious.</i> Still, Jaune felt like using the remote again. As he reached for it, a loud commotion drew his attention. A guy was kicked, knocking over a table. Before him stood a pair of black haired, green eyed twin girls. One wore a red strapless dress with black fur over her shoulders, while the other wore a white strapless dress with a white feathered scarf. The girl in white was the one to kick him.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/0/06/Malachite_Sisters.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130915164536\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/vill...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe told you to get out,\u201d the girl said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to ask again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need your kind here trying to grab the female customers,\u201d her sister in red said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ever come back,\u201d the first sister said. \u201cIt will be the last thing you do.\u201d The guy scrambled away and out the front door as fast as possible while the crowd laughed and cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cServes that pervert right!\u201d Neon yelled. Jaune fiddled with the remote. He now had two more targets.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jaune wanted to leave the older sister in white alone so that she could still perform her job of watching out for the patrons in the club. Now that Jaune chose his target, he had to decide what swap to do. The alcohol must have been getting to him to make him bolder in his swap targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t any specific body part that stood out. Both girls were highly attractive and any part he swapped with them would be worth it. Jaune eyed their chests as he sipped his drink. A full Body Swap was an option too, but Jaune would lose his ears and tail unless he immediately swapped them back. He wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to lose his dick again in a public place like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him wanted to try the Life Swap. If he read the remote\u2019s guide correctly, he would still be in his body, but in her clothes and everyone would see and treat him as her. He didn\u2019t know anything about her, or even her name, but the remote was supposed to help out with that like it did for the position and Semblance swap. Wardrobe would also be interesting to try. True, he didn\u2019t necessarily fancy wearing dresses and girls\u2019 clothes. It would just be funny to wear her clothes in front of his friends and have none of them notice. The thought kind of made him feel like an exhibitionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonal Info was always a fun swap to use. He could change his name, position, friends, school, or even sisters. He laughed silently at the thought of the girl in red suddenly having seven sisters. How the remote would make everything seem normal and the girl in white now being his sister was sure to be entertaining. He could also be bold and try the personality swap, thought he didn\u2019t know anything about the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat swap did he make?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a little disconcerting to find himself halfway across a room instantly. The dress he was wearing felt weird, as it really wasn\u2019t made for his large male body, yet it didn\u2019t fall or slip. There was tightness on his chest he figured had to be the girl\u2019s bra and her panties were not designed to accommodate his nether region. It was like when Yang had his dick. Things were constricted and he shifted slightly to try to ease the pressure. The high heal boots he was wearing was also uncomfortable and he was afraid he would trip when he tried to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat trash was supposed to be screened before they came in,\u201d the girl in white huffed, walking toward the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jaune said, unsure how to address the person. That word was obviously the wrong one, as the girl turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, Miltia?\u201d At least Jaune had a name now for his new life. He tried to relax the nervousness he was feeling about messing this up. It took only a moment for him to remind himself, even if he did mess it up, he could swap back without repercussions.  This thought freed him a bit and he could immerse himself in the life he now had. Words came out of his mouth almost effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnoyed that we get stuck picking up the slack, Mel.\u201d Jaune replied. The other girl laughed and Jaune had a flash of insight at her name. The girl was called Melanie Malachite, nickname Mel. Obviously, both of these girls were strong-willed and confident. Miltia was a little more subdued than her sister, but that didn\u2019t change her overall attitude that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent point,\u201d Melanie agreed. \u201cLet Junior\u2019s thugs handle the vermin while we enjoy ourselves. Standing out here only attracts the nobodies who are stupid enough to think they have a chance with us.\u201d She wrapped her arm with Jaune. \u201cLet\u2019s get drunk off our ass tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more!\u201d Jaune responded enthusiastically. That remark might have been more from Miltia\u2019s life more than his desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t nearly as buzzed as he had been before the swap, which implied drunkenness stayed with the life, not the body, when swapped. People parted as the two of them made their way to the bar. The normal cliental knew who they were. Jaune took the moment to glance back at Neon and Miltia in his life. The two of them were laughing and finishing their drinks. Miltia looked weird in a simple shirt and pants, compared to what she normally wore. It wasn\u2019t like Jaune could really talk. He looked even stranger in her dress. The black fur on his shoulders felt kind of nice though. Jaune sat down next to Melanie and Jaune glanced into a mirror behind the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltia\u2019s face gazed back at him.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nSo this is how people see me</i>, Jaune thought, as Melanie ordered them a bunch of drinks. He realized the reflection didn\u2019t have his rabbit ears, even though he still had them. <i>So new swaps override older ones, or maybe it\u2019s just the life swap overriding the body. I\u2019ll have to test it out back at Beacon.</i> He picked up a shot glass the bartender placed in front of him, made eye contact with Melanie, and simultaneously gulped it down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Miltia must have developed a strong tolerance working at a club. Jaune and Melanie sat with their backs to the bar, sipping more alcoholic drinks, as they watched the other customers come and go, dance, or just socialize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of these people need to learn how to dress,\u201d Melanie whispered to Jaune, pointing people out and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho dressed him, his mom?\u201d Jaune replied. He wasn\u2019t a mean person in the slightest normally and knew next to nothing about fashion. Living as Miltia, he just kind of knew which people didn\u2019t dress well and had the desire to be mean to them. His onesie back at the dorm came to mind and he nearly gagged at the thought. <i>The others were right. Regardless how comfy it is, I can\u2019t wear it around others.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cWant to go tell them to their faces?\u201d Melanie asked, a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to stay here and get drunk?\u201d Jaune asked. \u201cBeing an alcoholic and all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh.\u201d Melanie sniffed indignantly. \u201cI just know how to have a good time. You haven\u2019t gotten laid in, what? Months? Maybe a good fucking would get that stick out of your ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeast I can remember my booty calls,\u201d Jaune retorted. He had no idea what he was talking about. The words just flowed out without conscious thought. \u201cYou wake up next to how many guys you don\u2019t remember meeting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to be a common occurrence for the twins, as Melanie didn\u2019t seem to foster any hostile feelings. Jaune didn\u2019t either. Instead, her eyes roamed the crowd again and stopped on a group of guys who just entered the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook who just walked in,\u201d Melanie told Jaune, licking her lips. \u201cSeems the help outside actually listened to my instructions. I\u2019ll make sure to tell Junior to give him a raise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Jaune didn\u2019t know exactly what was going on at first, but his dick started hardening when he looked at the guys. <i>Oh, fuck no.

Neon didn\u2019t look much better, as she was laughing at every little thing and half her words were slurred or just outright garble. Jaune shook his head and turned toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we had a little to mush to drink,\u201d Jaune told her, slurring his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, maybe!\u201d She leaned back in her chair. \u201cTonight wash great! We shhould party more together while I\u2019m here...hic\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think\u2026 I need to cut you off,\u201d Jaune mumbled and they laughed. Neon slapped him lightly on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThosh twinsh over there,\u201d Neon continued. \u201cTheir outfitsh are shexy ash hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah they are,\u201d Jaune agreed and clicked the remote\u2019s Wardrobe Swap option. He found himself wearing Miltia\u2019s red dress and fur scarf again. It was his time to have fun. He would have preferred blue, but white was not his color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne triesh sho hard,\u201d Neon continued, swaying in her seat. \u201cThe other likesh it shimple.\u201d Jaune had to admit she had a point. If someone compared the twins, Melanie would normally stand out with her elegant white dress. Miltia on the other hand was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. Admittingly, she filled it out much better than he did. The shorts clung to her hip and her breasts pushed at his shirt. Without a bra, the outline of her nipples were visible. Because Jaune used the remote, Miltia would still get the same attention as if she had her old clothes. \u201cThey have the right idea,\u201d Neon suddenly exclaimed. \u201cLet\u2019sh go hit on guysh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d Jaune said and got them a couple glasses of water. \u201cDrink up and I\u2019m going to help you get back to Beacon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not ash think as you drunk I am,\u201d Neon protested, though she drained the water down in a single gulp. Jaune chugged half of his glass and set it down before standing up and moving over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp you go,\u201d Jaune said, pulling her arm over his shoulders. Neon leaned most of her weight on him and they left together. He wasn\u2019t thinking too clearly either and forgot he was still wearing Miltia\u2019s clothes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t get motion sick anymore, but alcohol in a moving vehicle could cause some messy situations. When they arrived at Beacon, the first order of business was finding Neon\u2019s room. Jaune had no idea where that was or how to get a drunk Neon to tell him. As luck would have it, her team leader met them outside the main entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiii, Flynt!\u201d Neon called out to a boy with dark skin and sun glasses.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After everything Jaune did for Neon getting her back, a little swapping was definitely in order. He clicked the Body Swap option and the world seemed to grow taller. What really happened was that he shrunk almost a foot. Neon wasn\u2019t nearly as tall as him. Jaune looked down at himself and saw that the red dress he was wearing fit his new body much nicer than his old body. On his right arm, he noticed a rainbow tattoo wrapped around his arm ending in a star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So tattoos are considered part of the body,</i> Jaune thought and looked back at Neon in his body. He was walking into Beacon\u2019s main entrance with Flynt and Neon, so he could examine her. Skipping past the weirdness that was his body in her clothes, he noticed she had her tail back and Velvet\u2019s ears. <i>So once I Body Part Swap, the parts will be affected by an entire Body Swap.</i> Jaune felt rather attached to the ears. They were amazing for finding people and listening to things far away. He immediately swapped them with Neon\u2019s ears and the sound of chatter in the distance increased. Because he liked her tail too, he swapped that back. It was rather interesting that Miltia\u2019s dress could form a hole for the tail and patch it up when he swapped it away instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019ll see her again and give her body back when I feel like it</i>, Jaune though and staggered a little. He was still rather drunk and the trip back only helped him sober a little. He tried to think of all the swaps he currently had going. From Ruby he had her Semblance and team. Velvet's ears adorned his head. Some random girl in Vale was perceived to be a man, Miltia\u2019s entire wardrobe belonged to him, and now he had Neon\u2019s entire body, including tail. So many swaps and it had only been one afternoon. It was getting late and people were beginning to retire for the night, Jaune was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway to his dorm was deserted and he took the opportunity to give his new breasts a squeeze through the dress. They weren\u2019t nearly as large as Yang\u2019s. Neon had a sportier figure, so his hand didn\u2019t sink into them. They were a lot firmer. Still, they felt good and he spent a minute or two rubbing them in the hallway. He didn\u2019t want to risk testing out his lower half in case someone showed up out of nowhere. He also took a moment to look at his reflection in the scroll. Neon\u2019s face stared back and Jaune reached up to play with his new abundant red-orange hair in four pigtails with blue bangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She\u2019s really cute</i>, Jaune thought and smiled. <i>I love this remote so much</i>. He paused outside of his dorm and then let himself in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hair was let down out of the ponytail and she was wearing a short sleeve nightgown as pajamas. Blake and Yang were also in the room in their pajamas. Yang just wore a tank top and some black boy shorts while Blake had a more elegant black, long-sleeved, yukata-style shirt with white edging over a purple undershirt, and a matching skirt. Weiss was at her desk, Blake was reading on her bed, and Yang was playing some game on her scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you waiting for me?\u201d Jaune asked surprised. \u201cI left you a note.\u201d It was not lost on him that he now had Neon's voice. Switching bodies had given him her vocal chords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaying you are going to Vale is hardly informative,\u201d Weiss pointed out. \u201cSo let me repeat, where have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe smells like alcohol,\u201d Blake commented and Yang bolted upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune actually went to a party?\u201d Yang asked in shock. \u201cWow, what happened? I thought you would be reading comics all night until Weiss made you study.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do the same with video games,\u201d Blake pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush, kitty cat.\u201d Blake scowled at Yang\u2019s comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to do anything tonight,\u201d Jaune admitted and then transitioned to a lie. \u201cBut then a friend of mine messaged me he was going to be in Vale tonight and wanted to catch up. I met them at a dance club and then we parted ways.\u201d He scratched the back of his head. \u201cSort of hit it off with a girl and we went around to a couple clubs. Somehow she got us into a club called Junior\u2019s.\u201d Yang started coughing. \u201cYou know the place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 been there once a twice,\u201d Yang muttered, not looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like there\u2019s a story behind it,\u201d Blake commented, still annoyed at Yang\u2019s cat comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou caused a lot of property damage, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Weiss sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might have happened,\u201d Yang admitted. Weiss rubbed her temples and then turned to Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do want to thank you for at least leaving a note for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThough, if you\u2019re planning to get back late, let me know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes the same go for us, Mom?\u201d Yang asked and Jaune snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of people disappearing at night and none of us know where they are,\u201d Weiss stated firmly and Blake looked guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a point,\u201d Jaune added, before Yang could start arguing. \u201cAs a team, we should know if someone\u2019s going to be out late. Stuff happens and we might need to cover for each other. It\u2019s not asking much just for a message or something.\u201d Weiss looked pleased at his insight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can go along with that,\u201d Blake said and flipped a page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Yang agreed. \u201cThinking back, when Ruby first started going off on her own, I always wanted to know where she went.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of Ruby,\u201d Jaune said, striking up conversation as he rummaged through his new wardrobe. <i>Seriously, that girl\u2019s clothes are like ninety percent dresses, and they\u2019re all shades of red.</i> \u201cHow was the movie with her team?\u201d He pulled out a dark semitransparent nightgown and started changing. It was a good thing he switched back to being a girl. Weiss would not have accepted a guy changing in front of them. His bra and underwear were a darker shade of red and were probably expensive. He wished he had some alone time to explore his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe movie was pretty good,\u201d Yang replied. \u201cLots of action with enough romance scenes for Blake and Pyrrha.\u201d Blake flushed slightly. \u201cWho knew Pyrrha was such a big fan of that stuff? Next thing you know she\u2019ll be over here borrowing Blake\u2019s smut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen maybe I can find someone who appreciates good literature,\u201d Blake said, keeping her voice calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid the library have that book?\u201d Jaune asked Weiss, as he climbed up to his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cYou might need to use it though, as I got the last copy. Don\u2019t put off your work to the last minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Jaune promised and laid back in his bed. \u201cWe have training tomorrow and I\u2019ll do my homework after that.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cYou know Yang\u2019s going to try to get us to go somewhere tomorrow night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fault,\u201d Weiss stated matter-of-factly. \u201cComing back from a club and not inviting her. Besides, you\u2019re the team leader. You\u2019re supposed to think of teamwork building activities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can hear you!\u201d Yang called over. \u201cJaune and Blake aren\u2019t the only one with good hearing. I trained preventing Ruby from sneaking into the kitchen and stealing cookies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds fun,\u201d Jaune said and then yawned. His fatigue was reaching his limit and he reached up to undo the ties in his hair. As part of the hair swap, some information on haircare seemed to be swapped too. \u201cI can totally see Ruby doing something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love her,\u201d Yang replied. \u201cBut she was a handful and I\u2019m not used to leaving her alone. I\u2019m trying to, but it\u2019s tough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can give you a little break</i>, Jaune thought and clicked the remote, swapping sisters with Yang. <i>Have fun with\u2026seven\u2026 </i>Everything went dark as Jaune crashed. The next thing he knew, someone was trying to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was probably his worse hangover yet and he buried his head under the pillow. He really didn\u2019t drink much. Neon was just that persuasive and now he was regretting it. If he could just sleep it off, that would have been his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune,\u201d Weiss\u2019s voice called out. \u201cGet up.

I\u2019m up!\u201d Jaune finally relented and pushed himself up.

Here for Jaune again? Shouldn\u2019t you hang out with your team instead of your big sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d Ruby protested. \u201cBut I want to keep up with family.

Jaune thought and the conversation was finally sinking in.<i> Wait\u2026 I\u2019m her sister? When did that happen? Was I that drunk last night?

You promised to come watch me test out a new attachment for Crescent Rose.\u201d Jaune gulped at the thought of what crazy thing Ruby added to her scythe. He was fighting a hangover and really needed to be on high alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA loud noise would wake her up,\u201d Yang suggest to Ruby. Jaune flinched at the thought of Ruby using her whistle right now. Knowing who to target, right when he entered the bathroom, he aimed the remote at Yang and swapped the hangover status. Yang literally fell back into her bed as Jaune instantly felt better. \u201cServes her right.\u201d He felt a little guilty, but she should be fine in a few hours. From what Ruby had said, this wouldn\u2019t be her first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune jumped slightly when his eyes met his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What did I swap last night?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t remember swapping with Neon last night, but the proof was in front of him. Her sparkling green eyes stared back at him. Muttering under his breath, he ran through what other swaps he still had. He had Ruby\u2019s team, Semblance, and being her sister, Velvet\u2019s ears, some random girl\u2019s perceived gender though that didn\u2019t matter right now, and then there was what he was wearing. Neon looked weird wearing the red and black dress that formally belonged to Miltia. Her bright outfits fitted her style better. Jaune smiled as he put his hands under his breasts and lifted them up slightly before letting them fall back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still, not bad.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the opportunity, Jaune unhooked his dress and let it drop to the floor. If he still had his dick, it would have immediately been standing upright.  Looking at his reflection, all he could see was Neon\u2019s developed athletic body wearing red and black bra and panties. Long red stockings covered his feet and a good part of his legs.  His bunny ears were standing upright indicating his excitement. The pink tail attached to his butt flickered back and forth. Jaune licked his lips and cupped one of his new breasts. He moaned quietly, enjoying the moment. His other hand reached up and rubbed his sensitive ears. The feelings caused the area between his legs to grow warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune!\u201d Ruby called through the door. \u201cYou coming!?\u201d Boy, if she only knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d Jaune cursed under his breath. He had almost forgotten about her. Slightly disappointed at the interruption, he slipped the dress back on and straightened the scarf around his neck. Jaune splashed some cold water on his face and thought about what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality had him promise Ruby he would go with her. He wasn\u2019t sure if Yang had promised before the swap or reality altered in unforeseen ways. Besides, he liked hanging out with Ruby and being sisters could be interesting. Another option was swapping out with someone else so he could get some sleep. He wasn\u2019t currently using a Life Swap. Sure, he already had a lot of swaps going, but with one click, he could reset everything. Another option was to see if he could talk his way out and find some alone time with his new assets.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Figuring he might as well go with Ruby, Jaune waved goodbye to his team and left with his \u2018sister.\u2019 As they walked toward the training arena, Ruby went on and on about all sorts of combinations and attachments she had been toying with. Jaune tried to listen, but most of it went over his head. He found himself slowly zoning out. Wondering how this reality differed being Ruby\u2019s sister, memories began to flood into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune grew up in Patch under Ruby\u2019s mom and dad. That was kind of a shock to him. He thought he had only swapped sisters. Did he swap places in their families instead while drunk or did reality change so that everything worked out. Whatever the reason, he had grown up with Ruby in the country while Yang grew up with her seven sisters in the Arc household. A memory of Yang telling him that at one point was how he knew. He had never been interested in being a Hunter until Ruby nearly got killed by a Beowolf. At the point, he decided he wanted to be a Hunter to protect her and others. His \u2018dad\u2019 Tai, called in a favor to help him get into Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This way was better than faking a transcript I guess,</i> Jaune thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune!\u201d Ruby\u2019s thoughts interrupted his memory exploration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere you listening to me?\u201d Ruby asked, pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what did I just say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Jaune didn\u2019t have a good answer. \u201cI kind of dozed off on the way here. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph.\u201d Ruby huffed indignantly as they reached the locker rooms. \u201cI forgive you. You had a long night.\u201d Jaune nodded. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re going to be speechless when you see Crescent Rose\u2019s new addition.\u201d She pulled him in after her and he realized his predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was entering the girl\u2019s locker room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was worse was he was entering it with Ruby, who was only fifteen!<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nCalm down,</i> Jaune thought, deliberately looking away from Ruby. <i>You\u2019re a girl now in both body and perception. No one is going to say you don\u2019t belong here.</i> His pep talk didn\u2019t change the fact he knew this was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body walked automatically toward his new locker and he opened it. The familiar sword and shield were in there like they always were. This time a red dress hung instead of his armor, which was very similar to his current outfit, but made of a lot more durable material. He could hear Ruby humming happily and beginning to change behind him. Trying to avoid temptation, he focused on himself. He changed outfits and picked up his weapons. There was a weird naked feeling without his chest plate. A shield only covered so much. Ruby zipped out of the locker room before he could say anything to her. She really was anxious to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Looks like I get to learn to fight as a girl,</i> Jaune thought to himself. <i>You have Ruby\u2019s speed, so it\u2019s already an unfair fight.</i> Curiously grew within him as he wondered how Ruby was going to fight without her Semblance. <i>I\u2019ll find out soon enough. </i>He stopped by a mirror and looked at himself with Neon\u2019s body. His hair looked a little untidy, even if it was still in their pigtails. He needed a shower, which the locker rooms had. Training would give him a convenient excuse to examine himself more closely. He left the locker room and saw Ruby lining up several targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Jaune asked. \u201cWhat do you want to show me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis!\u201d Ruby hit a button on her scythe and it collapsed into its gun mode. She held it up and pressed the trigger while holding another switch. Jaune\u2019s mouth fell open as a torrent of flame shot out, engulfing three targets in a cone around ten feet away. \u201cHow cool is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou added a flamethrower?\u201d Jaune gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Ruby puffed her chest out proudly. \u201cI added a compartment for a fire dust crystal and can release it in controlled qualities. It was something I learned from Weiss. You won\u2019t believe how many times it exploded in my face until I got the measurements right. Isn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is amazing,\u201d Jaune repeated. \u201cYou never cease to amaze me, Rubes. Best little sister, ever.\u201d Ruby beamed and then bolted toward him to embrace him with a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always supported me,\u201d Ruby reminded him, though it was more of a news flash than one. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to come this far without you pushing me to see how far I can go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know me.\u201d Jaune laughed and placed a hand on her head. \u201cBest friend, best bro-\u2026sister, you name it.\u201d Ruby laughed too. \u201cWhat\u2019s the next step in testing it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looked up at him and smiled deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCombat practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is.\u201d He should have seen that coming.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was hard enough dealing with the high powered sniper rifle since he didn\u2019t have a range weapon. With a flamethrower for close to medium range combat, he had no good option to face Ruby with. He didn\u2019t slip the remote out of a hidden pocket in his dress from spite though. It was for his own protection. As Ruby was skipping to the other side of the ring, Jaune clicked the button and it was followed by a flash of green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the monstrosity of engineering and death was in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lighter than it looked Jaune realized, as he gave the scythe a practice swing or two. He had no idea how to actually fight with it, but his body did. He spun it around a couple times and held it in front of him. Ruby drew his former sword out of the sheath and then transformed the sheath into the large shield. It was pretty funny watching Ruby, who Jaune was used to seeing wield her giant scythe, now use a normal weapon. The Arc crest on the shield didn\u2019t really suit her. The shield also covered the vast majority of her tiny frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady when you are!\u201d She called out, holding her shield up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune couldn\u2019t lie and say he wasn\u2019t excited.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune started off with Crescent Rose in its rifle mode. With Ruby on the other end of the arena, he had a chance to fire a couple rounds before she could get anywhere near him. Jaune flinched after every shot because of his enhanced bunny hearing. Guilt coursed through him as he used Ruby\u2019s own weapon against her, but that passed when each bullet reflected harmlessly off her shield. That kite shield really did protect most of her body. He backed up, keeping some distance between them. Ruby kept pressing forward adjusting her shield so deflect each bullet, while keeping an eye on Jaune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all the lessons Pyrrha imparted in him about not using his shield to hide made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, sis!\u201d Ruby called out. \u201cYou have to do better than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you insist,\u201d Jaune answered, shifting his weapon into its scythe mode. It felt so natural. Smiling to himself, he stepped forward using Ruby\u2019s speed Semblance. In an instant, Jaune appeared behind Ruby, opposite side from her guard. He brought down the scythe to hit her in the back. This was something he would never do if Aura wasn\u2019t involved in protecting them. However, right when his scythe came down upon Ruby, something unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red Aura flared up and waves rippled across her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune felt like he had struck steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden stop disoriented him allowing Ruby to swing her sword back and strike him squarely in the chest. The strike had more power behind it than he was use to with Ruby, but that might have been reality altering itself to fit their new weapons. Jaune was blindsided and tried to use his weapon to block the flurry of strikes coming from Ruby. Thinking fast, he used his Semblance to bolt away to the far side of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah!\u201d Ruby laughed at him. \u201cDid you forget my Semblance? Aura Amplification? I can do more than heal you know. I can amplify my Aura to act as a shield or increase my attack power.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI wish I had your Aura reserves though. They are so much greater than mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026 Yeah, I forgot about that,\u201d Jaune lied. <i>Wait, we swapped Semblances, so that has to be my Semblance! She unlocked it already? Or was it because reality fixed itself when I swapped.</i> Jaune held Crescent Rose up and shifted it back to its gun mode. Ruby raised her shield and deflected a couple more bullets, slowly making her way towards him. Jaune waited patiently until she was around ten feet away. \u201cDid you forget something?\u201d Jaune asked, smiling sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Ruby asked, peaking over her shield and Jaune made an over exaggerated movement hitting a switch. Her eyes widened. \u201cOh, crap\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlames poured out of the end of Jaune\u2019s weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHot, hot, hot!\u201d Ruby gasped, hopping backwards while using her shield to block most of the flames. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI showed it to you before we started!\u201d Jaune countered. Of course, Ruby had showed him the attachment before the swap. He just assumed with the new reality, he showed Ruby it. From her expression, that actually happened. A light flashed on Crescent Rose and the flamethrower died. \u201cWell, it was only a test. Looks like the Dust crystal ran out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid it now?\u201d Ruby asked. This time, she was the one smirking. Jaune gulped and realized his mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby won the battle a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result was obvious. Even though Jaune had a new weapon and a cool Semblance, he hadn\u2019t had the years of practice to use them to their full potential. He knew as much about fighting with the scythe as he did a sword. It made his attacks predictable. Ruby, as his sister, knew all of his attack patterns. Plus, even though she didn\u2019t have the Aura reserves to make full use of her Semblance as Jaune could have, she knew how to maximize its effectiveness. This led to Jaune eventually losing, though he did get her Aura down to 80%, more than he had done in the past. Jaune sat on the bench, leaning against the wall. He was upset at his loss, but feeling better than he had in the past after one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ruby\u2019s weapon is amazing, he thought. Plus her Semblance is perfect with it. I don\u2019t have the experience or skills to be as good as she is. Velvet\u2019s ears were actually a hindrance during that fight. The sound of bullets firing was intense. Couldn\u2019t even tell I was in Neon\u2019s body. It moved the same way mine did. These sports bras really hold breasts in place.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cThat flamethrower almost got me,\u201d Ruby told him. \u201cYou should let me see if I can figure out how to increase the duration. Long range you can take them out with the sniper, midrange a flamethrower, and close range your blade. You\u2019ll be unstoppable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like an idea I have to try,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cSo we done for now? Think Weiss expects me back soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should get back to my team too,\u201d Ruby agreed. \u201cNora might come looking for me, thinking I was kidnapped and forced to join your team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jaune added, pretending to think. \u201cI suppose we have room due to our bunkbeds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d Ruby stuck her tongue out at him and they laughed. \u201cI\u2019m going to get changed and head out. Cya, Jaune. Stop by anytime to play games or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune watched Ruby start to head to the locker room. He was going to wait a bit for her to finish showering and head out under the disguise of checking something with his weapon. There was no way he was going to risk seeing her nude. She was his closest friend at Beacon and even if the current reality considered them sisters, he was still a guy at heart. It would feel wrong. Besides, being up so early on a Sunday, he could have the locker room to himself. He wanted to explore his new body a bit and he needed a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultitasking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers fiddled with the remote. If he wanted to give Ruby back her Semblance and weapon, now was the time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune slowly opened the door to the locker room and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was nowhere to be seen and there was no noise coming from the shower stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt a lot more inappropriate going into the female locker room by himself. The first time was because Ruby dragged him in after her, which sounds a lot more erotic than it had been. Jaune kept looking around nervously. If anyone had been there they would have questioned why he was acting so weird. He eventually made his way to his locker and slowly peeled off his combat dress before hanging it up. Living with seven sisters before swapping with Yang, he knew how to keep female clothes in pristine condition. They would never forgive him if he messed up their clothes. He untied the laces of his long red boots with heels and placed them in the locker. The hair ties were the next to go, letting Neon\u2019s orange hair fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sitting on a bench in nothing but except for black and red underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the locker, a folder towel with some cleaning products rested. Jaune had a towel in his regular locker when he was a guy. He figured a female version of him would be like his sisters and keep shampoo/conditioner in the locker room just in case. Slowly, his hands removed the bra strap from his shoulders and placed the bra in the locker. The underwear followed shortly behind it. Embarrassment was evident on his face and he was glad no one else was around as he picked up his tower. He wrapped it around himself, covering his chest and lower half. Grabbing the bath supplies, he made his way to the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male showers were just a big open room with multiple shower heads. There was no privacy. The woman\u2019s shower had individual stalls with openings at the bottom where you could only see their feet. This was perfect for Jaune to get some privacy, in case anyone else came in. He passed a mirror and paused to get a good look at his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeon\u2019s face stared back. Back when they met at the club, Neon always had a confident outgoing expression. The reflection he saw now he barely recognized. Jaune had a nervous and embarrassed expression as he gazed at her naked body wrapped in only a towel. The pink tail flickered from his back side from under it. Velvet\u2019s ears on his head kept twitching and turning slightly. Even if he took someone\u2019s body, Jaune\u2019s nature kept showing through. He smiled and Neon\u2019s radiant expression reflected back, giving Jaune confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune took a deep breath, hung up the towel and stepped into the stall, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here goes nothing,</i> Jaune though excitedly. Unlike the time he stole Yang\u2019s breasts and vagina, he still had his own body. Now he possessed the body of a very attractive girl with a few additional parts. Deciding to take care of the necessity first, Jaune turned the water on. A stream of lukewarm water drenched him instantly. Adjusting the temperature, he waited until the water was nice and hot before beginning to wash his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeon had a lot more hair than he did, so it took a little time to lather, rise, and repeat. Time was also added because of his sensitive new bunny ears. He took a little extra time making sure they were nice and clean. They felt nice if one wasn\u2019t pulling them. Once that was finished, he reached for the body wash. Smiling to himself at what he was about to do, he began to run his hands all over his body. His hands moved to his chest and clamped over his breasts. As he began to massage them, he couldn\u2019t help moaning a little. The nipples were beginning to harden and he spent a minute pinching them lightly as he kneaded the mounds around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did I wait so long?\u201d Jaune gasped quietly. The erotic moans that kept escaping his lips in Neon\u2019s voice only turned him on more. They weren\u2019t as big as Yang\u2019s, but no one could deny they were attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, his hands worked down his body. Neon had a lithe and athletic body, so there weren\u2019t a lot of large muscles. Her abs weren\u2019t as noticeable above her flat stomach area, but Jaune could feel the strong muscles beneath the surface. The thighs were the next target of his hands and then he groped his sturdy butt. He spent a little time just rubbing it. It didn\u2019t really feel anything special, it just amused him. His hand then rubbed his tail. There was a tingling sensation when he stroked the wet fur. Finally building up the confidence for what was to come next, he lowered his hand between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar shock ran through him as his wet hand began to rub the area around his vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuuuccckkk!\u201d The curse escaped his lips as he embraced the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same feeling he remember when stealing Yang\u2019s. He glided his fingers of the slit a few times. The rhythm and continuous stream of water was slowly causing his pleasure to rise. Unable to resist after coming this far, Jaune inserted two fingers deep inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time a purr escaped his lips after the initial shock vanished. It was Neon\u2019s body after all and she was a cat Faunus. Jaune had one hand on the stall wall and the other between his legs. He wasn\u2019t ready for the bucking movement his body did automatically from the sudden burst of pleasure. It took a few deep breaths to steady himself. Laying in bed fingering himself wasn\u2019t the same as standing up in a shower. Or maybe Neon was more sensitive than Yang. Jaune didn\u2019t care at that moment. He was too distracted. Once he regained hold of himself, he slowly moved his fingers in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do\u2026.ahhh\u2026. feel\u2026. Shit\u2026 so good!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to talk as his fingers moved faster and faster, the pleasure rippling through his body. The strength in his legs was vanishing and he could feel a pressuring building up that he could barely contain. His vagina was clamping down on his fingers and the dampness wasn\u2019t just from the water. He moved his fingers faster and faster hearing a wet squelching sound. The pressure was increasing until he couldn\u2019t contain it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body slammed against the stall wall while he climaxed, feeling the hot juices drip from his ravished vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I\u2019m never going to get used to a female orgasm,\u201d Jaune gasped. \u201cYang\u2019s and Neon\u2019s were so much better than being a male.\u201d He continued to pant, trying to regain his energy, as the water washed away all traces of his erotic activities. This also gave him time to think about what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before he could figure out what to do next, he heard the locker room open. There was no way he could continue what he was doing with other people nearby. Shutting off the water, he grabbed his towel and began to dry himself off as fast as possible. Staling wasn\u2019t really an option now and he wrapped up his body like his sisters always did when leaving the bathroom, making sure to cover up the important bits. He took a deep breath and left the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think anyone else would be up this early on a Sunday.\u201d A drawl female voice stated. Jaune froze and stared at the familiar individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman was sitting on the bench, lowering her phone as her bright amber eyes gazed at him. She had fair skin and long ashen-black hair which was pushed to one side. She was wearing gray pants and boots, a beige leather, sleeveless jacket, and brown gloves. Cloth was wrapped tightly around her chest and another piece wrapped around her waist, just sticking out above her pants. Jaune believed it was called a sarashi or something. She may have been a couple years older than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby, my sister, wanted to spar a bit and\u2026 here I am!\u201d Jaune held out one arm to his side, using his other hand to keep his towel up. \u201cI was just enjoying a shower.\u201d His head tilted slightly. \u201cCinder, right? I saw you in Goodwitch\u2019s class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Cinder confirmed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Jaune\u2026 Arc, I believe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, you even got my last name.\u201d Jaune stepped over to his locker and began to pull out his clothes. \u201cSo why are you up so early?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying the peace and quiet,\u201d Cinder answered. \u201cI was merely exploring Beacon\u2019s beautiful campus.\u201d She smiled. \u201cGetting away from two of my teammates constant bickering was only an added bonus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been there,\u201d Jaune sympathized. \u201cThat\u2019s never fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like babysitting two children.\u201d Jaune nodded in agreement. \u201cWell, don\u2019t let me keep you. I was going to do a little practicing this morning. Don\u2019t want to get rusty before the Vytal Tournament.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf, course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune turned away and started putting on his bra and underwear. Normally an impossible task for males, but Jaune\u2019s knowledge of being perceived as a girl came in handy when he slipped it on without much hassle. After that he slipped on the red and black dress before starting to tie his hair back up into Neon\u2019s normal pigtails. It was then his eyes fell onto Cinder. She had been finishing a message on her scroll with her back to him. When she stood up, he received a full view of her well-toned ass in those tight pants. Jaune gulped and his hand reached for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could swap with her a bit just to see how her body is different than Neon\u2019s, </i>Jaune thought. <i>It\u2019s just a little exploring. </i>His previous swaps ran through his head and he frowned. <i>Body Swap doesn\u2019t change stuff like fatigue and injuries. It\u2019s only the appearance that changes. If I want to be fresh, I would need to do a Life Swap, but then I would still be in Neon\u2019s body, just in Cinder's life. This would require a combination of Life and Body Swaps. Easy enough. Still, is this right? I kind of pushed the boundaries already. Maybe I should just go back to my team.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned around to see Neon finish putting on her boots and leaving the locker room. Everything was much quieter without Velvet\u2019s ears. Jaune briefly thought about swapping them to Cinder\u2019s body, but decided against it. Once he was done with Cinder, he would just swap back with a quick undo. Smiling to himself, he walked over to the mirror and posed with his hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes had a mature look most of the students didn\u2019t have. The dangerous and mysterious aura of hers attracted a lot of guys. The outfit she was wearing was kind of tomboyish, even if it revealed a lot of skin. Her scroll buzzed again and his eyes darted down to it. The message just said to continue his mission. He had a feeling it was important, but pushed it aside. A few minutes of goofing off wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone. He turned to the side to get a look at his new butt and then slapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh.\u201d He couldn\u2019t resist laughing and then he remembered his fight with Ruby. \u201cI wonder what her Semblance is.\u201d Not sure if this would work, the instructions had been pretty vague on how he would know how to act during a Life Swap. He concentrated on finding out that particular piece of information. A memory and feeling ran through his mind and body. He held out a hand and a small flame appeared, about the side of a baseball. \u201cHoly shit. She has Pyrokinesis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat power was so OP. No wonder she never used it in combat class. It would draw so much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jaune had some choices available to him. He could spar with a few training drones and try out using her fire ability and maybe some Dust. There were several vials in her locker after all. Another option was to go out and figure out what she was supposed to be doing. Something in the back of his mind kept saying there were better things to do then stay here. His eyes flickered to the mirror again and he licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did it once. Why not go another round?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Under normal circumstances Jaune would respect a woman's privacy. Sure, he might glimpse at a passing female student, and he was far from innocent, having had dreams of the fairer sex - hormones did that to a man. But he'd still respect them and certainly not treat them like a piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow times had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Jaune didn't <i>respect</i> Cinder, or Neon, or anyone else he might spend time as. Nor did he see any of them as just a piece of meat, even as he leaned towards the mirror, pushing his new chest between his arms and accentuating his breasts. Puckering his lips and giving a sultry smile he chuckled, heat rising to his cheeks as he looked down and ran his hands over his new svelte form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe respected them enough to not try and actively ruin their lives, or go out and humiliate them, but that didn't mean he was about to start a streak of abstinence. Whether through becoming intoxicated by the remote or finally having an outlet for his hormones, Jaune couldn't resist. And now that he was alone in the showers once again with a fresh body already beginning to prepare for some \"exploration\" how could he resist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding off his boots and leaving them just outside a stall he took his time undressing himself, making something of a game out of it. His hands slid up his toned stomach and crested his breasts, rubbing the tops briefly before slipping off the beige vest. He ran his hands over Cinder's arms, marveling at the smoothness of her skin and the surprising muscle beneath. <i>She's in really good shape. A lot like Pyrrha, I bet.</i> Briefly entertaining the idea of trying out his partner later he shook his head, giving his cheeks a smack and deriding himself for such a thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangers were one thing, friends and teammates were another. Even if he'd already violated that rule, and Yang, earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands fumbled with the cloth at his chest and he eventually found a clip binding it in place at his back. His fingers deftly unlatched it and Jaune peeled the cloth away to reveal two modest, beautifully round breasts. Smaller than Yang's but larger than Neon's, they accentuated Cinder's savory figure. Two dark nipples stared back at him, areolas like unblinking eyes. Watching Cinder's reflection run its hands over her breasts, teasing the nipples and tweaking them, face flushed, Jaune felt a warmth steadily building inside of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just arousal either...\" Cinder was a pyrokinesis user so it'd make sense she'd feel warm, probably. Jaune hadn't the foggiest clue how a Semblance like Cinder's operated beyond making flames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some remarkable measure of restraint he resisted tending to his burning loins then and there. The sarashi joined his vest on the floor, and his pants shortly after. Wearing only crimson red panties and brown gloves he stepped back to better admire his new figure. With wide hips, a flat, defined stomach, his mouthwatering breasts and a smoky gaze that made his newfound heart beat wildly it was a small wonder he - or rather, Cinder, didn't have half of the school's population clamoring for her. Weiss might still be his idea of a goddess but Cinder was a dangerously tempting second. Licking his hips and groaning watching Cinder mirror his action he grinned, sliding his hands down his chest and stomach then hooking his thumbs in his panties for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill meek as a mouse but compelled by hormones Jaune turned himself around, sticking out his shapely ass and leaning over. \"Like what you see, Jaune...?\" he cooed, embarrassing and arousing himself at once. With a chaste wiggle of his hips and a furious blush he dropped his panties, mouth watering as he revealed Cinder's rear and her vagina, already slick and dripping, ready to be explored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods...\" Jaune ran his hands over himself again, reverently exploring himself like Cinder was some fine piece of art. She basically was, flawless in every sense of the word. Or was that his new life telling him he was perfect? \"Maybe Cinder's a narcissist...\" he mused, smiling as he cupped his breasts and gave them a squeeze. A pleasurable jolt raced along his spine and he chuckled. \"Well, it's not like she's completely wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike any good piece of art Jaune intended to admire it, and goodness knows he'd put that off long enough. After giving his breasts another squeeze he slipped into the same stall he'd only just used, flicked his hair behind his back and turned on the water. His lips parted and a pleasant sigh escaped as hot water cascaded over him, dribbling down his salacious form and chasing away soreness he hadn't known he'd felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he didn't feel that dirty - at least not in the physical sense, Jaune went right to work. His hands roamed around his breasts, squeezing them and pressing them together. On a whim he lifted one and tried to bite his own nipple, huffing in dissatisfaction when he couldn't quite reach. \"Oh well...\" He grinned and pinched both nipples instead, tossing his head back and groaning. His hardening nipples only served to make him more eager and he pinched them again, rolling the hardened nubs between his fingertips and pulling them. Wonderfully firm and full he gave his breasts another squeeze, legs quivering and fluid mixing with the water running down his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, let's get to the main course...\" His red-painted fingers dipped down and found his wanting pussy with ease, palm brushing against clean-shaven skin. Parting the lips he rubbed a finger along his inner folds, hissing through clenched teeth and curling his toes on the tiled floor. Using the heel of his hand and letting Cinder's life guide him somewhat he ground into his clit, letting out a delicious moan that echoed in the virtually empty showers. Feeling his entire being quiver in anticipation he reached out blindly and held one hand against the stall, black hair falling and framing his face, blocking his view of everything except for Cinder's wanting figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne finger went in first, more to explore than with any intent to pleasure. After feeling around for the sweet spot he grinned, letting a second join it. His walls clenched almost immediately and he tossed his head to move hair from his vision, giving his head a shake to clear away water. As his hand pumped vigorously he watched his breasts rock on his chest, nipples like tiny flags signifying his blatant arousal, miniature peaks on the mountains that were his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shit... Feels like... Gah, I need more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune's legs shook and he glanced down before sitting himself on the floor of the stall. Spreading his legs wide he continued to thrust his fingers, panting heavier as he went. Listening to the wet slopping he snuck his other hand between his legs and found his clitoris, pinching at it and rubbing away. The moans that escaped his lips were intoxicating, as was the pleasurable throbbing between his legs. They kicked against his will and he leaned back into the stall's door, chest heaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-More...\" Somehow he managed to slip in a third finger, gasping, then groaning when his walls filled, digits striking his g-spot as the pumping resumed. While his hips bucked he saw to his breasts once more, groping one roughly and again lifting one, finally managing to get a nipple to his lips. Wasting no time he bit down on one and squealed, muffled slightly by the breast stuffed in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow depraved did this look? Cinder's life told him it was hardly the first time she'd 'relieved' herself like this, though certainly the first time she'd done so in a shower stall of all places. Jaune hardly cared, far too enraptured by the building pressure between his thighs. Hot, heavy breath washed over his erect nipple and he curled his fingers, rubbing his inner walls and bucking his hips with each thrust. Another cry of pleasure, another barely muffled moan, and Jaune's eyes rolled back into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed he could only describe as a veritable explosion of pleasure. Jaune's back arched and pushed his fingers deeper still, incidentally pushing his thumb against his clit. His body shuddered and his legs spasmed as warmth spilled over his hand, trickling down his thighs and mixing with water before disappearing down the shower drain. His breast fell back against his chest with a wet 'thud' and he cried out, hardly caring for discretion as he rode the high of his orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what an orgasm it was. Like an earthquake his body was ravaged by residual tremors, twitching as a plaintive whine passed his full lips. Only once it ended and he was left sat on the floor, panting and drenched in water and juices both did he remove his hand, admiring the sticky fluids before licking his fingers clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Not bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one had beat Neon's by a long shot, and if he had to compare it to Yang's... Yeah, it beat hers too. Smiling and fully satisfied with himself Jaune lazily ran his hands along his body, rubbing his aching breasts and chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder could almost go again, but did he really want to? Cinder's Life was practically yelling at him now to get back to... Whatever she had been doing before, and while he could ignore that voice in his head it was a bit annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was curious about what walking around Beacon as he was would be like now too. It might be fun, turning heads and seeing the school from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, as he sat in the shower, warm and basking in his afterglow, Jaune decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Velvet's ears were interesting, Jaune decided that he'd rather liked having a girl's body. He may have just given Coco her body back, but he was already ready to switch his out again, only this time with the proper support for his lady bits. Besides, Velvet's ears were a part of her body, so he'd get to experience them regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two quick clicks of the remote, Jaune was blinded for a brief moment, before everything suddenly felt different. Looking down the hall at the girls he'd passed, Jaune saw Coco walking away alongside what appeared to be himself, dressed in his usual outfit. Of course, he was standing right where he'd been previously, and the person walking away was actually Velvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jaune noticed most of all, however, more than what he was seeing, was how much louder everything seemed. His hearing had definitely grown more sensitive. Reaching up slowly, Jaune's hands felt something soft and furry, and though he was reaching up above where his head ended, he could feel his fingers brushing against something that was definitely a part of his body. This excited him, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get a better look at himself, Jaune sped off without bothering to take stock of the other changes to his body, looking for the nearest bathroom. As he ran down the hall, Ruby's semblance carrying him faster than he could ever have hoped to otherwise, he could already feel a multitude of changes that had occurred with his body. He had already been running around with Coco's body beforehand, so the breasts on his chest or he void between his legs didn't feel odd as he ran. However, Coco's hair had been rather short, but now he could feel it fluttering around behind him, like a flag in a windstorm. Likewise, instead of the pants he'd been previously wearing, there was a skirt flapping around his legs, the speed of travel threatening to flip it up and reveal the panties that now tightly wrapped his privates. He could even feel the strange appendages he'd felt atop his head being dragged behind him, unable to stay upright as he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his speed, he soon managed to find a bathroom, and headed inside, thankfully finding there to be no one inside. He'd hesitated a little on which to enter, but after Weiss' lack of a reaction during training, he supposed that he was still considered a man, despite what he looked like. Immediately heading towards the mirror, Jaune saw the face of Velvet Scarlatina staring back at him, as was to be expected, and the furry things he felt on his head were her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jaune mumbled, reaching up to feel his ears again. Strangely, he seemed to have picked up Velvet's accent along with her voice. He briefly tugged on one of his new rabbit ears, as to confirmed they were real, only to elicit a yelp of pain from himself. How did Velvet handle Cardin pulling on them so well when they seemed to be so sensitive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his gaze downwards, Jaune saw he was now dressed in the female school uniform, complete with a skirt flowing around his stocking clad legs. It felt strangely exposing to not be wearing pants, even though Jaune knew he was completely decent. Jaune wasn't sure he could really get used to it, especially not with the speed Ruby's semblance allowed him to run at. Of course, the clothing swap option on the remote could sort that out fairly easily if he decided he needed to. His breasts, on the other hand, felt much better supported now that he had the proper undergarments to hold them. He'd experiences none of the problems he did with Coco's breasts on his way to the bathroom. Skirt aside, taking Velvet's clothing along with her body seemed to have been a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jaune would have like to check out his new body further, a public restroom probably wasn't the best place to do that. Before leaving, though, he decided to check his student id. Curiously, despite showing a picture of Velvet, a Faunus girl, his ID still referred to him as Jaune Arc, and listed him as a human boy. Somehow, despite clearly having a Faunus trait, he was considered a human. He supposed it was much like how people had still seen him as a man when he'd had Coco's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaune exited the bathroom, he pondered what he should do next. He did kind of want to get a better look at his new body in private, and the best place to do that would be back in his room. Well, provided his team wasn't there to interrupt him, of course. Speaking of his team, perhaps he should go see some of his friends. While he wasn't sure he should really reveal the remote now, after everything he'd done with it, it might be fun to go see someone he knew to see how they might react, or fail to react, to the changes he'd made to himself. Of course, even with everything he'd already used it for, the remote proved to be an ever present temptation. There were still plenty of people around, he was sure he could find someone he wanted to swap with if he looked hard enough.</span></div></div>",

He knew how hard she tended to be on Ruby, and now that he had switched teams with Ruby, he knew how hard she was on him. Even with Coco's body, he still had the pain and fatigue of his fight against Cardin, he was in no condition to try and meet Weiss' demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along,\" Weiss said as she headed for the door. \"Your training isn't going to do itself, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune couldn't quite come up with a good response. Though this was technically his first time being in this situation, his memories told him that once Weiss had her mind set on something like this, there was practically no stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps, there was another way out. He could still feel the remote in his pocket, pressing against Coco's slender leg. There had to be some way it could get him out of this situation. He hadn't tried the personality swap yet, perhaps he could get Weiss to stop obsessing over homework and training with that? Although, that would probably just make him start obsessing over it instead, so perhaps it wasn't the brightest solution. Alternatively, there was also the life swap. He hadn't tried that yet either, but supposedly it would let him keep his body, or rather Coco's in this case, but everyone else would see him as the person he swapped with, and vice versa. Perhaps he could swap with someone else for a while, leave them to do the training in his life, and then come back later. Maybe he could even swap with Weiss and call off the training altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, he wasn't going to go through with this training session. As Weiss passed him on the way to the door, her back facing towards him, Jaune quickly pulled out the remote, and decided on which option to take.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pointing the remote at Weiss, Jaune quickly selected the life swap option. There was a green flash of light, and all of a sudden, Jaune found himself in a different place somewhat disorientingly. He was now standing right in front of the door to the room, one hand outstretched towards the doorknob, the other carrying the remote. His clothing felt a bit off. There felt much lighter, parts that shouldn't be exposed felt like they were, and it felt like he was raised up onto the balls of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could examine what had changed, he heard Weiss' voice speak up from behind. \"Uh, Weiss? I'm not really I can handle that much training right now, after today's fight with Cardin and all. Could we maybe take it easy today? I promise I'll make up for it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune didn't miss how out-of-character that sounded for Weiss to say, nor did he miss the fact that she had called him \"Weiss\". Turning around, Jaune saw Weiss standing exactly where he'd been just moments ago, only now she was wearing the same t-shirt and pants he was wearing. She also lacked the same air of confidence she usually had, seeming almost meek in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune knew what this meant. The remote had successfully swapped their lives. As far as Weiss knew, she was Jaune Arc, the leader of Team JYBS, and she was doing her best to get out of a grueling training session. Likewise, as far as everyone besides him was concerned, he was Weiss Schnee. He blushed a little at the thought of actually being his crush, but did his best to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" he hummed after putting the remote away wherever it was Weiss kept her scroll. He tilted his head downwards and put a hand to his chin, making it look as if he was considering Weiss' proposition. In reality, he was simply checking out what had changed. He still possessed Coco's body, but now he was instead dressed in Weiss' usual outfit. The strapless dress, the bolero, the high heeled boots, it was all there, adjusted to fit Coco's body. Outside of that, nothing seemed out of place, and if not for the way Weiss was acting, he'd have believed he had simply performed a Wardrobe Swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plan had went off without a hitch. All he had to do now was tell Weiss that he'd let her skip training for today, and then it'd all be settled. However, something stopped him saying that. A little voice at the back of his mind told him that he couldn't just let Weiss off like that, she'd never improve otherwise. Jaune assumed that must be his mind telling him how to act like Weiss, so that people wouldn't suspect anything was wrong when he swapped with them. He also noticed he didn't feel anywhere near as tired or sore as he had before the swap. After all, Weiss wasn't the one that get beat by Cardin today, and now he was Weiss. Perhaps he should go through with the training after all, only as the teacher rather than the student.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though it would be interesting to go through with a training session in the life of someone with far more skill and experience than himself, Jaune had far more important things to tend to at the moment. Namely, he had a reality warping remote to play around with, and he wasn't quite done playing yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh that came more from Weiss' life than it did from himself, Jaune went against what Weiss' life was trying to get him to do. \"Fine, have it your way,\" Jaune grumbled, Weiss' uptight tone sounding odd when applied to Coco's voice. \"You can have today off to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Weiss breathed a sigh of relief. \"Thanks Weiss. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" Jaune suddenly interrupted, having let Weiss' intuition take control after he gave himself the day off. \"That just means I'll have to work you twice as hard next time to make up for it. Weiss laughed nervously knowing she was really in for it when their next training session came around. Jaune was also somewhat nervous, seeing as it his life that was really in for it. He knew Weiss just wanted to see him improve, but he could only handle so much. He really shouldn't have let himself say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Weiss,\" Weiss mumbled with a sigh. She began to walk over to the adjacent bathroom, lacking the poise she'd possessed in her own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing Weiss to do whatever it was she needed to do, Jaune pondered what to do next. Obviously he wanted to play around with the remote some more, but he had an important decision to make; did he want to play around with it as himself, or as Weiss? He'd only swapped with Weiss in order to get out of a training session, but the idea of having everyone see him as Weiss instead of himself seemed kind of exiting. He wasn't exactly sure what he wanted to do with the remote, aside from the fact that he wanted to keep it to himself for the time being. He'd tell Ruby eventually, but for now, he wanted it to be his little secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss, on the other hand, knew what she wanted to do. Or rather, Jaune knew what Weiss' life wanted him to do. With the training cancelled, Weiss would have gone down to the Academy's library to take out a book to help with her homework (and to help with tutoring Ruby). While Jaune had little interest in that, perhaps heading down to the library would be better than simply wandering aimlessly. However, he wasn't entirely sure how being in Weiss' life would affect the swaps. Briefly glancing in the mirror, he saw Weiss' reflection instead of Coco's, presumably meaning that was how the world saw him now. If he swapped, for example, body parts with someone, would people see them with Coco's parts, or Weiss'? Would the swap affect people's perception of his own body, or Weiss'? Perhaps it would be safer is he simply stayed in his own life while using the remote for now.</span></div></div>",

He wanted to swap with someone he knew, if only so that it would be fairly easy to find himself to swap back later. He knew he could always just hit the undo button to reverse the life swap, but doing it this way would make it less disorienting for him when he jumped back into his life, and it would allow him to keep any swaps he'd made while in their life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Weiss asked, having turned back around to face him. She sounded equal parts confused and annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I thought I saw something weird fly past the window,\" Jaune said, scrambling for an excuse as he tried to decide on a target. There were only a couple of people he recognised down there, so he didn't exactly have a wealth of options to choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was probably just a bird, stop making excuses.\" Still facing the window, Jaune heard the clicking of Weiss' heels approaching him. He'd need to act fast, otherwise he'd not only be forced into Weiss' training session, but she'd also see the remote. Throwing caution to the wind, Jaune pointed the remote out the window, and pressed the life swap button, hoping he could hit his target from this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was he pointing the remote at?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crossing his fingers, Jaune pressed down the remote's button, mere moments before Weiss managed to grab him and turn him around. In a brief flash of green light, Jaune found himself somewhere completely different, the speed of the change disorienting him somewhat. The other swaps he'd tried had also happened just as quickly as this one, but those didn't involve him suddenly jumping between locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Jaune could tell he was now standing in the courtyard, rather than his dorm room, with a few other students milling about around him. What he noticed more than his location, however, was the long blonde hair falling into his line of sight as he moved his head. The swap had clearly occurred, although perhaps not in the way Jaune expected. Looking down at himself, he found he still had Coco's body, but it was now dressed in a female school uniform, specifically the uniform that belonged to one Yang Xiao Long, Ruby's sister and now one of his team mates. The latter was the reason he'd chosen to swap with her, as it made meeting up with his old life to swap back fairly easily. There were other people he recognised here, but with Yang being on his team, they shared a room, and he wouldn't need an excuse to visit himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jaune wasn't expecting about the swap, however, was Yang's hair. Coco kept her hair fairly short, so this sudden mass of hair hanging from his head was quite the surprise. He'd swapped hair with Blake earlier when testing out the remote, but Yang kept her hair even longer. Why had their hairstyles swapped? This didn't seem like something truly necessary for living Yang's life. Perhaps it was a way of indicating who was living who's life after a life swap had occurred, although that struck Jaune as a bit odd considering hair could be swapped on its own. After all, Yang should be living his life right now, but she'd be sporting Coco's hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, his hairstyle didn't really matter, although he had a feeling Coco probably didn't wear Yang's hair as well as Yang herself did. Wanting to get a good look at what he looked like now, Jaune headed over to a nearby window, hoping he could see his reflection. What he saw was somewhat surprising. When he looked down, he saw Coco with Yang's hairstyle, but that wasn't what he saw in the window. The reflection staring back at him was none other than Yang Xiao Long, looking the same as she always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be how everyone else sees me,\" Jaune mumbled to himself. While he still saw himself with Coco's body, the rest of the world must see him as if he were really Yang, despite what he actually looked like. It made Jaune a bit curious about what would happen if he performed another swap while he was still in Yang's life. It would obviously affect him, but would the world perceive it as affecting him, or affecting Yang? And what about when he swapped back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Jaune enjoyed have free reign over Yang's reflection, there wasn't much he could do out here in public. He turned away from the window, and idly walked through the courtyard, doing his best not to seem out of place. If anyone had noticed him staring at his reflection, they didn't make it obvious. Glancing down at the remote in his hand, Jaune pondered what to do next. He'd already succeeded in his plan to avoid training with Weiss. Sure, his life would still be going through with it, and he'd probably be feeling the pain and tiredness from it once he swapped back, but that was a problem for later. He was still curious of how exactly the remote would work while he was in someone else's life, and there were plenty of targets around here, plus a reflective surface to see what the rest of the world saw. Although, perhaps this was better tested in a more confined space. Waiting until his team were all together, back in their room, he'd not only have other people to swap with to test how it worked, but he'd also have his own life available to swap back into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he need to use the remote. Sure, he could alter reality in all sorts of crazy ways, but that didn't mean he had to go crazy with it. He'd be getting an earful from Weiss the moment he swapped back, so perhaps he should take some time as Yang to just relax for a bit. He didn't know exactly what Yang had been doing at the time of the swap, but it shouldn't take him too long to figure out. He was also somewhat curious to see how Yang would handle against Weiss in his life. He wasn't exactly the best fighter around, hence why Weiss was so harsh on him with his training in the first place. Perhaps seeing the way he fought from a different perspective, watching someone else fight the way he did, would help him find a way to improve. If nothing else, it might be amusing to watch, especially since he had a way of changing things up mid-fight.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A grin graced Jaune's, or rather Coco's, face as he looked down at the remote. He had already messed things up aplenty; he'd given himself Coco's body, and made himself the leader of what was formerly Team RWBY, only right now he wasn't himself and everyone thought he was Yang. Even with all that hanging in the air, though, the temptation to use the remote even more was far too strong. He was just having too much fun with this thing. And in the end, if something did go wrong, as long as he didn't lose the remote, he could always just undo anything he'd done, so there was nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, though, Jaune had an idea to test out. Considering the rest of the world currently saw him as Yang, even though he really looked like Coco, he had to wonder exactly what would happen if he swapped with someone in this state. Obviously whatever swapped would go onto him, but would it be perceived as affecting him, or Yang? And what about the person he swapped with? Would they gain something of his, or something of Yang's? Or maybe they'd gain something of his, but the world would see it as if it were Yang's? And if the swap gave them something of Yang's, would that affect Yang in his life? It was all rather confusing, but liking the idea of getting to be someone else from time to time, Jaune decided it would probably be best he learn how other swaps interacted with a Life Swap for future use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was a question of what to swap, and with whom. There were plenty of students milling around the courtyard, both people Jaune recognised and people he didn't, so finding a target wouldn't be an issue. The more important thing to decide was which option to test out. He'd already tried out body part, personal info, body, and life, but some of them might interact differently now that he was inside Yang's life. The wardrobe and clothing options were immediately out. Living Yang's life, the only clothes Jaune currently owned would be Yang's, which would defeat the point of trying to swap something of his own to see how it would interact with the life swap. For the same reason, personal info was also out. While he may remember which things originally applied to him, the world saw him as Yang, and the remote would affect Yang's information. And of course, life swap was out of the question. Not only would that not play into his little experiment, but he'd deliberately taken Yang's life to make it easy to meet back up with his old life, and swapping with someone else would defeat the purpose of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left him with a few options to pick from. Body swap and body part swap were both options he'd tried out before, but they might work differently under the effects of a life swap. For instance, if he swapped chests with someone, would they gain Coco's breasts, or Yang's? The distinction between them was, of course, how much was being swapped. Did he want to trade out Coco's body for someone else's, or did he want to keep her body for now and just switch out a single part? It was also worth considering that when he'd swapped with Coco, her hair came along with it, so no matter how the life swap affected the body swap, Yang's hair would be traded away. Jaune had a feeling she wouldn't be too happy about that, but thankfully the remote would prevent her from finding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still one potential option that he hadn't tried out yet, though; the personality swap. Jaune hadn't tried it in his own life, so he wasn't sure how deeply a change in his personality would affect him, or whether he'd still have his original personality under the surface, but the added life swap raised even more question marks. Despite being in Yang's life, Jaune was still acting like himself, though he could let Yang's life guide him so he could act like her. If he swapped personalities, the question of who's personality would be swapped affected not only the target, but also himself. Would the target gain his personality, or Yang's? And on the flipside, would his personality be replaced with the target's, or would Yang's personality dwelling at the back of his mind be the one changed? There were a lot of variables at play here, but for some reason, Jaune found that somewhat exciting. Of course, he hadn't tried it yet, so maybe it would be best to wait until he was back in his own life before trying it, so he knew how it normally worked first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich swap does Jaune decide to use?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a bit of deliberation, Jaune ultimately decided that the body swap would be the best test. Personality swap had too many unknown variables, what with him not having tried it out prior to the life swap, and body part swap, while an appropriate test, was too small of a change to really be sure of the results. If he were in his own body, he could fairly easily tell if, for instance, the person he was swapping with got his chest or Yang's, but he wasn't in his own body right now, he was in Coco's. There were differences between Coco's body and Yang's, sure, but the differences were more subdued, and difficult to tell without getting close up. A full body swap, however, should definitely be obvious enough to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had his test decided, Jaune needed a test subject. He had grown rather fond of Coco's body in the short time he'd had it, but he was willing to let it go for his test. He did, however, want to find a similar body. Sure, he could always swap with another guy, but after having hopped over the gender fence, he didn't want to hop back so quickly, not when he hadn't even experienced the half of what this side had to offer. With that in mind, he set about looking for a woman to swap with, preferably one that he knew for the sake of relocating things later if he wanted to swap things back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, as he strolled through the school grounds, he happened across such a person. Amongst the crowd of students, Jaune spotted the green hair and tan skin of Emerald Sustrai, or \"Em\" as Yang called her, a student from Haven Academy who was here for the Vytal Festival. Oddly enough, though Jaune knew he was familiar with her, he realised that he hadn't met her in his original life, and had only done so as the leader of team JYBS, as well as through Yang's life. Regardless, Jaune wasn't as close with her as he was with some of the teams from Beacon, but he decided she was a good enough subject for this test. After quickly glancing around to check whether anyone was looking at him, Jaune pulled at the remote and carefully aimed it through the crowd, and pressed down the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, the changes happened almost instantly, and Jaune was quick to notice. While there wasn't a dramatic difference, Yang's unruly blonde hair on the edge of his vision was replaced with much straighter, greener locks, and he'd lost a couple inches in height, alongside a handful of smaller differences that were only really noticeable if he payed attention to them. A quick glance down was enough to see his new skin tone, and confirm that he did in fact have Emerald's body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that wasn't the true test. Looking back over at the crowd, it didn't take him long to spot the mess of blonde hair amongst the other students. Though it was a little difficult to tell from so far away, judging by the height and bust, it seemed as if Emerald had received Coco's body rather than Yang's. Jaune found that to be somewhat intriguing. Though it should have been expected that Emerald would receive Coco's body, as that was the body that was doing the swapping, the rest of the world didn't see him as having Coco's body, they saw him as Yang. Possible theories about how exactly the swap had functioned were already starting to appear in his head, but he'd need to check the second half of his test before he was ready to call it certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back over to a nearby window, Jaune was looking for his reflection. In theory, since it was Coco's body that Emerald had received, Yang's body should be unchanged, save for the hair, and his reflection should reflect that. Half groaning, half chuckling at his unintentional pun, Jaune peered into the shiny surface of the glass, only for a suprised expression to appear on his reflection. What he saw was not Yang's body with Emerald's hair, it was just Emerald's body, the body he had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jaune was confused. The swap had not only affected his body, but also the perception of Yang's body, as people now saw Yang with Emerald's body. What did that mean for Emerald? She had Coco's body at the moment, but did people see it as Coco's, or as Yang's? She was unfortunately too far away to far away to check her reflection, though she was still in sight, Yang's hair really making her stand out. Perhaps tailing her for the time being would give him the opportunity to check her reflection and see for sure how the world saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another option, however; keeping Emerald's body and going off on his merry way. He would hope that a remote this advanced would have safeguards in place to make sure parts, or perceptions thereof, wouldn't be able to be simply erased, and thus, he could figure out how Emerald was perceived when his team met back up at their room, by simply checking Yang's reflection, the reflection of his own life. That did mean he might have to hold back on the swaps a bit for now, though, seeing as he didn't want to mess things up too bad before confirming his hypothesis. Still, he had Yang's life and Emerald's body, there was plenty of fun that could be had with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with this current test having somewhat stumped Jaune on the exact properties of the remote when a life swap was involved, perhaps it would be best to simply swap back for now, and test this again in a more controlled environment, where both his test subject and his original life weren't about to run off. Emerald's body felt nice, but keeping it would just muddle things further if he wanted to make further swaps, and he wasn't sure he wanted to go through the stream of undoing everything if he found that this had affected perception in a way he wasn't happy with. Besides, this swap had stripped Yang of her golden locks, and while she wouldn't know the difference, Jaune found it hard to imagine her without them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After glancing over at Emerald as she slowly walked away, Jaune shook his head. He doubted he'd be able to follow her closely enough to be able to spot her reflection once she walked close enough to a window. She'd spot him eventually, and then he'd be left having to explain exactly what he was doing, and why he was following her. That said, he also didn't really want to swap back just yet. Looking over his reflection, he found he actually rather liked Emerald's body, and being less familiar with her than he was with Coco, he wouldn't feel as bad about anything he might decide to do with her body. It also probably helped that Emerald's hair was much less unwieldy than Yang's, and didn't feel like such a dead weight hanging from his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis decision made, Jaune began to wander off in the opposite direction Emerald had headed as he pondered his next move. He knew he'd need to complete his test eventually by checking the reflection of his old life, but his training session with Weiss should still be going for some time now, so that could be handled later. For now, he still had time to kill. The training session could be worth checking out, though. Not as himself, of course, but in Yang's life he could go and watch, passing it off as wanting to see how much his leader had improved. He could even use the remote to make things more interesting he wanted. The remote didn't seem to be able to swap things between other people, only between himself and a target, but if he used himself as an intermediate step, he could swap things between Weiss and Yang as they fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was something else Jaune had been itching to do since he had first acquired Coco's body, and that desire had only increased after taking Emerald's for a spin. He simply hadn't had a good opportunity, lacking the time alone to fully get a handle on his new form. Now, however, he had the perfect opportunity. Weiss and Yang in his old life were busy training, and Blake was probably still reading outside. He could have the whole room to himself, with no one to interrupt whatever he wanted to do. That said, while he did have a perfect opportunity right now, it wasn't as if this was the only time he'd ever be able to have some alone time, and getting to see himself, or rather Yang in his life, train wasn't exactly an everyday occurrence either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pondered which option to take, however, Jaune seem to stop his hand from drifting back to the pocket that held the remote. He knew he should try to limit his swaps so as not to change the world's perception of Yang too much before he had a chance to see how it had affected himself and Emerald, but there was something about the remote's power that was just incredibly alluring. Surely another swap or two wouldn't hurt, right? After all, the undo button was right there, he could have everything back to normal, or whatever he decided would be the new normal, in a heartbeat. Why not let himself have a bit more fun messing with reality?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The choice was somewhat obvious. As cool as it would be to see what it was like to be a faunus or a girl, Jaune's heart won out in the end. Despite how many times she rejected him, Jaune still pined for Weiss. She never seemed to accept any of his attempts to woo her, but Neptune was a different story. Maybe it was his looks, maybe it was his approach, but for whatever reason, Weiss seemed to like him. Maybe if he took Neptune's body, he'd stand a chance. Of course, it was just as likely that Weiss would treat him the same as always and not notice the change in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the outcome, Jaune had made up his mind, and pointed the remote at Neptune, before pressing the body swap button. In an instant, Neptune was replaced with a copy of Jaune, wearing Neptune's clothes. As for Jaune himself, he didn't feel very different. He'd clearly changed, as he seemed to have gotten a little taller, and his skin tone seemed a little darker, but for the most part, he felt pretty much the same. Perhaps a bit more in shape, but otherwise, switching with Neptune hadn't changed much. Obviously his face and hair had changed as well, as he could see a bit of blue hair falling into his line of sight, but that didn't make him feel any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I look different, at least,\" Jaune muttered to himself, hearing Neptune's voice escape from his mouth. It was odd, but that was about it. Regardless, he was wearing a different face now, which was what he'd wanted before he showed up in front of Ruby, so now it was time for him to go. As he headed over towards the dormitories, Jaune glanced down at the remote, wondering what he should do with it. He still hadn't quite decided whether or not he should tell Ruby about the remote or not, especially now that he'd tried it out a couple of times, and possibilities were forming in his head regarding what he could do with it if he didn't have anyone questioning his decisions. Perhaps it would be a good idea to put it away somewhere safe before meeting with Ruby.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of the remaining functions left to test, Jaune decided that the life swap option interested him the most. He'd already seen physical changes after swapping hair with Blake, and while a body or wardrobe swap was certainly a more extreme change than that, he felt it wouldn't exactly be as surprising. The life swap was a completely different story. While he had seen small mental changes after swapping names with Blake, having the entire world see him as a different person would be an interesting without a doubt. Sure, it would make meeting up with Ruby and telling her about the remote a little difficult, since he'd have to convince her he was really Jaune if he didn't swap back first, but he wanted to try it out regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was a matter of deciding who he should swap with. He didn't really have anyone in mind, he just knew he wanted to try out the life swap, and he had already left Blake behind. Perhaps he should just have a walk around and see who he could find. Perhaps one of them would catch his fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaune mulled about the courtyard, he saw a variety of people, both students and faculty, both known to him and unknown. Thanks to the upcoming Vytal Festival many students from other kingdoms were staying here at Beacon for the time being, allowing him plenty of choices. Many of the students walked together with who he assumed to be their teams. That made things a little awkward for Jaune. If he swapped lives with someone amongst their team, he'd immediately be forced to try and act like whoever he swapped with to avoid suspicion, even if he knew nothing about the person he was swapping with. It made swapping with someone who was by themselves a fairly appealing option, as it would give him some time to get used to who he was first, but swapping with someone in a team would let him immediately see whether or not they saw him as the person he swapped with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of this was related to swapping with students, there were also a few teachers around the courtyard, perhaps heading to another class, or perhaps heading back to their office to do whatever it was teachers did when they weren't teaching. While it would be odd swapping with someone a decent amount older than him, and the teachers at Beacon had more responsibilities to take care of than the students, Jaune was already starting to get a few mischievous thoughts. He could just imagine how good of a prank it would be to go see Ruby while he was in a teacher's life, and act like she was in trouble for something. The look on her face would be priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Jaune was spoiled for choice when it came to who he could swap with. After scanning the crowds, he decided he'd try swapping with...</span></div></div>",

While the authority and how he could use it to prank his friends was a really nice benefit, they were usually pretty busy and he might be forced to teach some class as Professor Port or Goodwitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the student options again, he saw that the only group he really knew was team CRDL. Quickly ruling them out, he was able to recognize a few people moving through the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one Jaune picked as a potential target was the monkey faunus, Sun Wukong. The guy was pretty cool from their interactions so far and he had that cool monkey tail. Pyrrha always encouraged him to be more confident as team leader. Maybe spending a bit of time in the life of someone who was already confident in themselves could help him grow in that department. Plus, Sun was on an all-male team. As much as he enjoyed spending time with Nora and Pyrrha, it was a bit awkward at times living with two ladies.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/8/88/Vol_6_Sun_Wukong.png/revision/latest?cb=20190105050539\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother candidate he saw was the leader of Emerald and Mercury\u2019s team, Cinder, was her name if he recalled correctly. Jaune knew much less about her than he did with Sun for sure but from what others, mainly Ruby, told him, Cinder kept to herself usually. It might be easier for him to impersonate her while swapped since she interacted with people much less. And, like Sun, she was also the leader of her team. He could pick up a few things from living her life to help his team out in the long run.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/TwUbT4Y7Nmt2CzSX6\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/TwUbT4Y7Nmt2Cz...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of which one he picked though, Jaune could also do a bit of scouting and learn a lot about his target and their teammates to prepare for them in the Vytal Festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a decision, he selected....</span></div></div>",

In an instant, he found himself partway across the courtyard mid-stride and almost fell over. Managing to maintain his balance, Jaune began to examine the differences caused by the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, he was mildly shocked by the long, wavy, black hair obscuring part of his face and tickling the back of his neck. While he wasn\u2019t completely unfamiliar with hair like this, having swapped with Blake earlier, this time though, he wasn\u2019t expecting it. Was this a part of the life swap? Looking down, apart from the hair, the rest of his body was still his normal male self. Though, now it was dressed in the same attire that Cinder was just wearing earlier. He had on her sleeveless brown jacket and gloves, the bandage wrapped tightly around his chest and tight gray pants. Everything was adjusted for his larger body compared to it\u2019s original owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Cinder, Jaune turned his attention to the spot that he was at earlier and saw a rather unusual sight. Cinder was now dressed in the armor, hoodie and jeans combination that he typically wore as well as his short, blond hairstyle. While she still had that same mysterious charm to her, the hair and clothes definitely dampened that a fair bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile doing his observation of her, he began to notice a sharp pain building from his groin. Realizing that it was because he was very much a male but his clothes, while resized to fit his larger frame, was still meant to be worn by a female and so the crotch did not have the room that he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the urge to tug at his pants in public, he recognized that he had two easy solutions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at Cinder, the simplest answer was that he could swap clothes with her to give him back his usual stuff while still in her life. It would provide the most comfort for him. However, that would mean he was basically just himself but responding to the name Cinder. It sort of defeated the purpose of his swapping lives in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other way to deal with the growing pain was to swap bodies with Cinder. It would provide the full experience of being her for sure plus the clothes would fit since it would be back on the body of it\u2019s intended wearer. But was he really going through with having a girl\u2019s body? Jaune was taught to respect a girl and their privacy while growing up with all his sisters and swapping bodies would be a definite violation of that privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he could just keep everything as is and learn to deal with the discomfort. It\u2019s been said that enduring pain would help increase tolerance for pain and anything that could improve his combat performance was a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he settled on....</span></div></div>",

Just like before, there was a change in perspective though not as drastic as before. His eye-line had dropped a bit thanks to his reduced height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw before him was what appeared to be himself from head to toe except for the long hair which was the only thing that remained of Cinder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter fix that.\u201d Jaune muttered in his new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly aiming the remote and using the body part swap to fix that, he once again had that same black hair partially over the side of his face. He was now for all intents and purposes, Cinder Fall, and she was now completely Jaune Arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself again, he was now greeted by a sight that he never thought that he would see from this perspective. On his chest, were a pair of breasts. Subconsciously, reaching up slowly, he cupped them tentatively. It had some weight to them and looked rather large in his now smaller hands. Turning his attention lower, he felt, or to be more precise, no longer felt, the sensation of having something between his legs. Dropping one of his hands down in front, he lightly patted the front of his pants as if to confirm what he already knew. It was very different to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly remembering where he was, he quickly pulled his hands away. Putting off the close inspection for later, Jaune had to figure out what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could figure out where Cinder and her teammates were staying in the dormitories. He somehow knew that her teammates were out in Vale. That easily gave him a private place where he can explore his new situation better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to head to where the dorms were, for some strange reason, he had the sudden urge to go to the arenas. He didn\u2019t really see a reason to go there himself so he guessed that it was Cinder\u2019s life instructing him to do so though he didn\u2019t have the slightest clue why she wanted to go there.</span></div></div>",

As soon as he looked their way though, they quickly looked away. He started to get really self-conscious from all the looks he was drawing. Even though he knew that everyone saw him as Cinder and that was normal, he felt like people were seeing right through his appearance and saw him for the impersonator that he was. This made him notice all the differences between Cinder and himself even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, his current body had a natural way of walking that was quite different from when he was his male self. Clicking down the hall in his heeled boots, with every step he took, his feet placed themselves one in front of the other. This caused his now wider hips to sway and the insides of his legs to rub together each time. It also served as a constant reminder to Jaune of what was now no longer between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, having long hair was an unusual thing for Jaune. He had tried having long hair earlier when he first used the device on Blake but swapped it back a few moments later so this was a relatively new experience for him. The slight extra weight on his head, the feel of it brushing against his neck and left shoulder where it currently hung and ended right at chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of his chest, even though it was tightly bound, there was a slight bounce to them. It was barely noticeable just by looking at it but feeling them move was a different story. They were almost like having two fleshy balloons strapped to his chest. It wasn\u2019t an unpleasant feeling by any means. Just strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the little things like how tight and more revealing his current attire was, the way the wind felt across his smoother bare skin just served or how taut and limber he now felt. There was even a warmth that radiated from his body which he never felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these differences just served to emphasize to Jaune that he was very much not himself at the moment and that this was a conscious decision that he made. It was just a little bit overwhelming and distracted him as he was walking through the halls of Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatter of fact, he was so distracted that he didn\u2019t notice that....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without even realizing it, he had already stopped walking. Jaune was now in a hallway lined with doors, just like the one leading to his team\u2019s actual dorms. Unlike that hallway though, he somehow knew that the dorms in this area were where students from Haven stayed for the festival. One door in particular, the one he was standing in front of, Jaune instinctively knew as belonging to Cinder and her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This is it, Jaune. You can do this.\u2019 he thought, giving himself a pep talk. \u2018Your team deserves better and you need to be better. Doing this will make you better. Once you step through that door, you\u2019ll have to live as Cinder. No freaking out and going back just because you\u2019re uncomfortable with what\u2019s happening.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, no one else was in the halls at that time so his standing around awkwardly wouldn\u2019t be questioned by anyone. Taking a deep breath, he pulled her scroll out of his pants, he used it to open and enter the room. Once inside and after shutting the door, he was slightly disappointed by what he saw. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect to find but it definitely wasn\u2019t this. He was hoping for something that would tell him a bit about the people he\u2019d be staying with or about Cinder herself. Unlike the posters in team JNPR\u2019s or the death trap called bunk beds of team RWBY\u2019s rooms, there wasn\u2019t really much of a personal touch here. Placing the Scroll and the remote, which he\u2019d been holding the entire time, into the same pocket, he moved into the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn an initial look around the room, it just had the standard four beds with identical sheets, some bookshelves, a desk for studies, two doors leading to a bathroom and closet. The only real unique item he could see was a single painting hanging over one of the beds. Stepping closer to get a better look, he could see that it was a depiction of a forest done in a few different shades of red and black. It gave him an uneasy feeling. Almost like there were Grimm hiding behind the trees, ready to pounce on him. Turning his head away from it, he sat down on a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What do I do now?\u2019 he mused. \u2018Really wish there was more to look through in here.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, that was when his eyes wandered over to one of the two doors at opposite ends of the room. The closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Maybe her team\u2019s stuff is in there. Worst case scenario, I find a bunch of their clothes and that tells me where they like to hang out.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that point, his gaze landed on the other door. The bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That\u2019s another place I could check.\u2019 Eyes glancing down at his chest briefly, he blushed hard. \u2018If I\u2019m gonna be her for a while, I\u2019ll see it eventually so may as well get it over with now and see what she looks like.\u2019 The same heat that radiated throughout his body now spread to his cheeks and between his thighs.</span></div></div>",

Considering how beautiful the different ladies he called friends were, someone else might think he had the strongest of wills to not step over the line with any of them. Looking down once more at his taped chest, he let his male hormones lead the way, figuratively speaking. He tried to stand up to go to the bathroom but lost his balance and fell back on the bed, feeling the extra padding of his rear cushion him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Ugh, heels!\u2019 He said, taking the shoes off, giving him instant relief. \u2018She must have been wearing them all day.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing a foot to ease some of the pain,  he noticed that both of his new smaller feet had their nails painted a deep red. Taking off his gloves, he saw that his fingernails had a light brown finish to them instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Strange. Don\u2019t girls usually match the colors?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the thought aside for a moment, he stood up once again, this time successful and stepped into the bathroom. Turning up the light, he saw that the bathroom was entirely identical to the one in his usual room. A single shower with a sliding door, a lone toilet, a sink with a mirror hung above it and four small separated cabinets underneath the sink. The only different thing there from his room were the different towels folded up on a rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the mirror, for a split second he expected to see his usual male self until it confirmed the fact that he was definitely Cinder right now. Despite everything he had felt up to that point, something about seeing her reflection really hammered it home to Jaune that he was now someone else. Now that he\u2019d finally seen himself properly though, Jaune couldn\u2019t help but think that something was off about the face in the mirror. He wasn\u2019t quite able to place what it was exactly but it felt like that just wasn\u2019t quite right. However, after a few moments of twisting and squirming around, he still couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong so he decided to put it off for a later time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging trains of thought, he started turning around slowly to get a good look at himself, he took in the different details that he missed earlier. The way his long hair came over one of his eyes, giving him a mysterious, almost forbidden, allure. How the wrappings went around his chest and waist then disappeared behind the hem of his clothes, as if inviting you to discover what was hidden underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting his gaze down to his body, he began working on said clothes. First, taking off the pauldron on his shoulder and unbuckling the belt and pouches around his waist. Once they were off, he placed  them on top of the sink. shrugging the vest off his shoulders, he then slid one arm out followed by the other. Dropping it to the floor, he shifted his hands downwards and unbuttoned his pants. Keeping his eyes on the reflection in the mirror the entire time, he placed a hand each side and slowly slipped it off his hips and shapely legs then stepped out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune couldn\u2019t help but suck in a breath at what he was doing. He\u2019d never even gone on a proper date before going to Beacon and here he was about to see a woman\u2019s body in all her glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was happening...</span></div></div>",

Besides, the practice arenas were pretty close by and if he couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly he was supposed to do, he could always try out using her weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything else, he placed the remote in the same pocket that he found Cinder\u2019s scroll in. Taking a large step in the same direction that she was originally heading, Jaune stumbled and tripped, falling to the ground in a rather undignified manner, landing on his more cushioned rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGahhh!\u201d He yelped in his borrowed voice. Embarrassed about his fumble, a blush crept up his cheeks. Feeling a few stares on him, Jaune looked about and noticed a few people eyeing him after what just happened. Why were they just staring at him? Why\u2019d there have to be so many of them? Why won\u2019t they just leave already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heat building up in him, \u201cWhat are you all looking at?!\u201d he burst out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any answers, the crowd dispersed, leaving him alone on the ground. Looking towards his feet to see what he may have tripped on, it was then Jaune realized that his new footwear had some particularly high heels on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully standing up, he brushed back some strands of hair that had fallen in front of his face with a gloved hand. Checking over himself for any dirt or mess and finding everything to be good, he then took smaller, more even steps as he continued to the arenas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, he noticed that as long as he didn\u2019t think about it too hard, this body knew how to walk in heels pretty effortlessly. It was almost like the skills were ingrained into the body. This gave him the opportunity to reflect back on what happened earlier. Not him falling down and embarrassing himself. That was pretty typical for Jaune. Rather, how he reacted after that caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Where did that come from?\u2019 He mused. \u2018Was that Cinder\u2019s life acting up? She must really hate looking bad. I would have been terrified if I was still me and saw what happened. I guess it makes sense. I mean her team did come over from Haven for the Vytal Tournament so they\u2019re pretty strong for sure and she\u2019s their captain so she\u2019s probably the strongest one of them all. Still though, probably should have handled that better. I need to be more careful while I\u2019m her. Wouldn\u2019t want to harm her reputation because of me being clumsy and messing up so much.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these thoughts going through his mind, Jaune manages to get to the locker rooms leading up to the practice arenas without further incident. Pulling Cinder\u2019s Scroll out from a pocket, he used it to access her locker to make it easier to find. Hearing a door crack open from one of the back rows, he moved towards it and spotted the now open door. Inside, he saw a beautiful identical pair of jet black curved swords. They both had sharp edges along the end of the inner curve and near the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Jaune had a few options available to him. The obvious one presented to him was to try out Cinder\u2019s weapons. They looked really simple but maybe if he could figure out what her semblance was, it could open a ton of possibilities for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of possibility, he still had the remote with him. That was literally a doorway to unlimited options. Why limit himself to just trying out Cinder\u2019s things when he could mix it up. He could combine different weapons and semblances to see how well they worked together. He could even borrow some of the best ones for the actual tournament when it starts.</span></div></div>",

He had to try it out. With that in mind, he turned his attention away from the other students, and instead focused on the few teachers amongst the crowd. There were a few he didn't recognise, as they came from the other academies with their students, and if he didn't recognise them, then Ruby probably wouldn't either, making his prank pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat unfortunately didn't leave him with many options. On the far side of the courtyard, he saw Professor Port, their teacher in Grimm Studies. Port was certainly amongst the less serious of their teachers, what with him frequently filling entire lessons with exaggerated tales of Grimm hunts he'd been on in the past. He and Ruby seemed to have been on somewhat good terms, what with Ruby's avid interest in weapons and combat. Perhaps she wouldn't exactly take a scolding from Professor Port seriously, or perhaps it would catch her off guard more than any of the other teachers would.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/4/48/Vol2_Port_ProfilePic_Normal.png/revision/latest?cb=20141211231644\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPort seemed to have been having a conversation with Professor, or rather \"Doctor\" Bartholomew Oobleck, though the two were currently parting ways. Oobleck was their teacher for History, a subject Jaune tended to struggle in. Likewise, Ruby wasn't particularly good at studying, resulting in her grades dropping a bit. As such, he might have some actual material to get her in trouble for. Swapping with Doctor Oobleck may even help him discover how he managed to move around so fast. It couldn't just be coffee, could it?<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/7/77/V4_04_Oob_Template.png/revision/latest?cb=20161121065546\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from the other two teachers was Professor Glynda Goodwitch, their Combat Instructor. Goodwitch was by far their strictest instructor, and was probably the teacher Ruby would be most intimidated by if confronted with. There were only two real problems. One was that, unlike him, Ruby was actually rather skilled with her scythe, and hadn't really had any issues with Goodwitch in the past that he knew of, meaning he'd have to make something up if he wanted to pretend she was in trouble. The other issue was that Goodwitch was a woman. While he'd already swapped with Blake, it was a much smaller swap, and everyone still saw him as a man. Swapping with Goodwitch would mean everyone would see him as a woman and treat him accordingly. It was a daunting prospect, but an exciting one nevertheless.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/5/56/Glynda_Profile_Volume_3.png/revision/latest?cb=20151115165500\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already mentally committed to this prank, Jeane observed the three Beacon teachers that walked through the courtyard, doing his best to decide on who he should swap with before they left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Throwing caution to the wind, Jaune decided to swap with Prof. Goodwitch. She was certainly the most interesting of his options, and would probably elicit the best reaction from Ruby, provided he could come up with something to pretend she was in trouble for. Besides, it wasn't like this was permanent, the remote did have an undo button, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiming the remote at Goodwitch, Jaune pressed the life swap button, and after a brief green flash, he suddenly found himself standing over the other side of the courtyard. He still felt the same, but his clothes definitely felt different. Unfortunately, there were still a great many people milling about the courtyard, and he'd no doubt draw attention if his simply stopped and examined himself. So instead, he continued to head towards the main build, as Prof. Goodwitch had been doing before there swap, somehow managing to not trip in the high heeled boots that had appeared on his feet. A side effect of the life swap, he supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at himself as he walked, Jaune couldn't help but feel he looked a bit ridiculous right now. He was wearing a white blouse with a fairly large opening at the front that would certain have exposed some cleavage had he any to expose, a black skirt that only seemed to come down to around the middle of his thighs, a pair of brown stockings, a pair of black high heels boots that came all the way up to just below his knees, and a black and purple cape that almost seemed shredded into ribbons towards its end. A refined lady would have pulled off the outfit well, as Prof. Goodwitch certainly did, but on Jaune's male body, it just looked silly, even with everything adjusted to fit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of adjustments, Jaune was more concerned with the physical alterations made to his body to fit Prof. Goodwitch's life. Normally, his ears were not pierced, but Prof. Goodwitch wore earrings, and right now, he could feel them dangling beside his head, clearly piercing through his earlobes. His vision was perfectly fine, but Prof. Goodwitch wore glasses, and looking over the frames that now rested on his nose, he could tell his vision without them was a bit blurrier than it used to be. The strangest change, however, was probably his hair. For some reason, though he had kept his own body otherwise, he had gained Prof. Goodwitch's hair, turning it a brighter blonde, and being tied up in a tight bun at the back of his head. Jaune couldn't quite fathom why that had happened. Perhaps hairstyle was counted as clothing, or he needed to Goodwitch's longer hair to have the same bun she did. Perhaps it was just part of the life swap, showing whose life you were really in regardless of what clothes you were wearing. Neither option really made sense to Jaune, but he supposed he didn't really understand how the remote worked in the first place, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away, just about to enter the main building, he briefly glanced back at the courtyard, hoping get a look at Goodwitch in his life. Unfortunately, all he got was a brief glance at an adult woman with short, messy hair wearing a male school uniform. He didn't get to see any more before she walked off, vanishing from sight. Jaune supposed he'd have to hunt her down if he wanted to swap more with her, outside of reversing the life swap. That didn't really matter right now, though. He had the life he was looking for, now he just needed to think of what he could say that would send Ruby into a panic. With that on his mind Jaune entered the main building of Beacon Academy, remote still tightly gripped in his hand, having thankfully traveled with him during his jump across the courtyard.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jaune walked through the halls of Beacon Academy, he couldn't help but feel like there was something he was forgetting, something important. The closer he got to the school's dormitories, and thus the further  from the classrooms he got, the stronger the feeling got, and the clearer it became. It wasn't him that was forgetting something, it was Goodwitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Jaune was still himself, it seemed he was not entirely free of any mental changes. He hadn't noticed it before, but it seemed he was able to pick up on Prof. Goodwitch's personality and memories, presumably to aid him in living her life. Right now, it seemed as if Goodwitch's instincts were screaming at him, telling him he had a class to attend to, and this detour towards the dormitories was going to make him late if he didn't hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune should have expected something like this. He didn't know why he didn't. He may have been done with classes for the day, but his class wasn't the only one in Beacon, and of course, classes needed someone to teach them. By swapping with Goodwitch, he'd just busied his schedule with a bunch of combat classes, only with him being the one instructing the fights instead of receiving a beating. That wasn't part of his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Jaune saw it, he had a few options available to him. Though Goodwitch's instincts were urging him to hurry up and get to the next class, he didn't actually have to obey them. He could always just ignore them and go through with his plan anyway. He would feel a bit guilty though, seeing as that would likely get Goodwitch in trouble, through no fault of her own. The other option was to find someone else's life to try this with. The remote had an undo button, so he could immediately jump back into his own life if he wanted to, and then he could find a new candidate. However, he didn't actually know what Goodwitch was doing in his life, seeing as she'd walked off by herself. It could be a bit disorientating to suddenly wind up somewhere unknown doing something he didn't know about, but Jaune had a good feeling Goodwitch wouldn't be doing anything too dangerous while she was him. He didn't have to use the undo function, though. There weren't as many people here as in the courtyard, but there were still enough that Jaune could probably find someone else to swap with. That would leave things a little muddled, leaving them in Goodwitch's life while Goodwitch was in his, but it was easily fixed, and he was the only one who'd notice anything different in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, just because he wanted to surprise Ruby by showing up in someone else's life, that didn't mean he had to do it right this moment. It could be interesting seeing how a combat class played out from the perspective of the teacher, especially if he could rely on Goodwitch's life to do the teaching for him. He could just teach the rest of her classes, and then he could go see Ruby once Goodwitch had some free time. Whatever he decided on, though, he should probably decide quickly. The clock was ticking, and the longer he waited, the higher the chance of Goodwitch being late to her own class.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune shook his head. He couldn't stay in Goodwitch's life right now. He wanted to surprise Ruby by showing up in someone else's life, and thanks to Blake, he knew where Ruby should be right now. If he wanted to go through with this, he should probably do it now. By the time Goodwitch was done teaching classes, he'd have no idea where Ruby would be anymore. He could go see Ruby regardless of the classes he had to teach, but as much as he didn't have a problem with borrowing Goodwitch's life for a while, he didn't want to get her in trouble. Missing or being late to a single class probably wouldn't be enough to lose her her job, but it would probably still attract the attention of Professor Ozpin, and she'd be forced to come up with an excuse for his actions. Jaune didn't want to be responsible for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the remote out again, Jaune looked around at the people around him, his thumb hovering over the remote's buttons. He had two options now; to undo his swap, or to swap again. There was a good handful of people milling around the halls, though none that would likely get as good of a reaction out of Ruby as he would if he showed up as Goodwitch. In fact, there was not a single teacher to be seen, likely because they were already at their classes, and not dawdling around like he was. Regardless, he could probably still find a good target if he looked hard enough, and he could just leave them to handle Goodwitch's life until he decided to reset everything, if he ever did. Of course, if he couldn't find anyone that piqued his interest, the undo button was still there. he'd just jump back into his own life, and then he could start anew. He'd just need to hope that Goodwitch wasn't in the middle of something dangerous or embarrassing in his life. There was also the chance that if his life was currently with someone, they'd notice the remote suddenly appearing in his hand, he'd have to be careful about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other functions of the remote were somewhat tempting now that he had the remote out. Aside from the life swap that he was currently using, he'd only done a few small tests with the Body Part and Personal Info options. There was still a world of fun he could have with this, but right now, he needed to resist that temptation. He needed to get out of Goodwitch's life so she could get to her class. Doing his best to ignore the other options on the remote, Jaune looked around at the people walking around him, hoping a good candidate would show themselves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune looked at the remote, unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be completely honest, the idea of a reality altering device sounded too farfetched. It was most likely a joke from someone (possibly Cardin) and they were waiting for him to try using the remote and laugh at him by believe for even a second that it was real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most logical part of his brain wanted to throw away the object, before his reputation plummeted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother part of him though wondered 'What if it is true?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a non-zero chance the remote truly worked. Yeah, the possibility was still close to none, but there was no harm in trying it, was it? The worst it could happen was be a laughing stock for the rest of the day. Nothing new there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Blake, whose attention was only in her book, Jaune considered what to swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be something minor as a clothing swap, but Jaune felt it would be a lackluster waste of potential, no he decided that the swap should be bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds of deliberation, Jaune finally settled his finger in the body swap button. It was the choice less likely to backfire to him if he messed up somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiming at the unsuspected Blake, Jaune pressed the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any obvious sign of something had happened. No flash of light or mysterious beam. Everything remained the same, no one looked at the nonexistent commotion and even Blake remained in her place reading her book, unconcerned. It was just, that 'Blake' was now a blonde scrawny teenager dressed in a girl's uniform. Once again, no one batted an eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was the exception, his gaze was transfixed in what was his body, or used to. Looking at the hand holding the remote, he was greeted by the sight of a dainty and feminine hand. Nails done cutely and painted black. Then the the hair blocked his vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the hair go out of his way it finally hit Jaune the realization that the remote was real. Oh, and he now possessed a girl body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral strange sensations made themselves known. The wind hitting his long black hair. A new pair of auditory organs. The unfamiliar weight of breasts unsupported. The lack of bulge in his pants and the loose his briefs felt. And lastly, the difference in size. Jaune was smaller, but he felt powerful, fast, agile, ready to pounce over his enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was so new and weird, but Jaune couldn't say he hated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his now yellow and feline eyes, toward his body under the tree, Jaune felt trepidation as he started making way in Blake direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't took more than a few seconds to reach her position and draw Blake's attention. She looked from her book toward him, showing no signal of noticing anything wrong with seeing herself from the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So it seems no one else, even those affected by it notice the changes to reality.' Thought Jaune, greatly relieved to know the remote worked as intended and he wouldn't have to worry about other getting mad at him for any swap. Still, Blake was looking at him with her blue, so familiar eyes, waiting for him to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, Heeeey Bla~ke, do yo-you know where Ruby is.\" Stuttering at first due the unfamiliarity of his new voice, Jaune amended himself quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she said she was going to spend all the day in the workshop tinkering with her weapon.\" The act of listening his own voice from a different perspective was pretty surreal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Blake you were of great help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are welcome, Jaune.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating after completing his objective, Jaune considered his options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne one hand he could go meet with his team and swap with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could look for Ruby and talk with her about the remote, he just needed to tell someone of such an awesomeity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly he could search for Schnee Angel and use the remote to arrange a date with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, the remote has unlimited potential. </span></div></div>",

Blake\u2019s body was smaller than his, but much more lithe and athletic. It was quite astonishing how fast he felt he was going. The extra set of cat ears on his head were picking up conversation and noises he would never have heard normally. The only people who glanced at him did so because he was running. The cat ears on his head went unnoticed.

Now!\u201d Jaune grabbed her hand and pulled her after him into his room across the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait up!\u201d Ruby cried, not used to being the one being pulled. She was used to pulling others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Jaune asked Ruby. He was glad the rest of his team were out. \u201cNotice anything different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ruby looked completely confused. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why did we have to rush to your room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Ruby.\u201d Jaune pressed. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice anything different? At all?\u201d He gestured to his head and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you, like get a haircut?\u201d She asked and he face palmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can\u2019t really blame you,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cThe instructions did say people wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNotice what?\u201d Ruby actually looked interested now. \u201cWhat are you hiding? Tell me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold this.\u201d Jaune told her and she looked at the device in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a remote?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me. Hold it with me. I\u2019ll exlain everything in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOookay?\u201d She did so and Jaune hit the Undo Button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s jaw fell open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 you were Blake!\u201d She cried out when finally finding the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I just had her body.\u201d Jaune corrected her. \u201cThere\u2019s a Life Swap option for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere... but\u2026 how!\u201d Words were failing Ruby again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Jaune a bit to explain. He told her how he came across it, what the instructions said, and he only tested it on Blake because she was nearby. He also didn\u2019t expect it to work. Ruby asked dozens of questions, most of which he couldn\u2019t answer. He had only been part of one swap. There had been no time to do anything else, let alone explore Blake\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, why show it to me?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 kind of wanted to show it to someone,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cThis remote was too awesome to keep to myself and since you are my best friend, I figured we could have some fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looked at him for a moment, before a huge smile appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!

He could swap lives with Weiss, thus reversing their roles. Then ask Weiss in his life to a date. He could think later about the next steps.

A few steps later he stopped, his clothes a bit uncomfortable in his current frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I still have Blake body.' Jaune realized. To be honest, he had forgotten, he didn't felt that different after swapping. Looking at the remote, he quickly found the Reset button. In an instant he was himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Blake remained unperturbed, still reading her book (likely smut).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune ran to the dorms.

Something was happening and he couldn't help but feel curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he wanted to met Weiss immediately, there was no guarantee she was in her room. He could always met her the next day. On the other hand, whatever was happening in the hallway wasn't likely to last long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe he could practice with the remote a bit more before enacting his plan. He knew very little about how life swap worked after all. He could try it on his team first. For safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune stood there a few seconds, mulling over his options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It would be a lie to say Jaune wasn't interested on what was happening nearby. He was a teenager prone to mischief and meddling on others business. The fact that he applied to Beacon with false transcripts should say it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can always swap with Weiss tomorrow. She isn't going anywhere so I can wait.' Thought Jaune trying to justify his actions. His mental gymnastics finally over, he turned left, straight to the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Jaune reached the small crowd and saw for himself what had garnered so much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone, please!\" Cried a young girl with bunny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, animals shouldn't roam these hall without their owners, you must be punished.\" Mocked a burly built boy, pulling said girl ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Cardin was bullying Velvet again, just like that time on the cafeteria. The rest of Cardin team were close standing in a way to impede others from interfering. Not that anyone tried of course, a bystander atmosphere had enveloped the zone and everyone just stood there watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune by his part felt angry. After the altercation in Forever Falls, Cardin stopped trying to blackmail him. In fact other than in combat class they stopped interacting. It seemed that Cardin went for another target, the bully! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin needed to learn a lesson. But not through violence. Jaune had gotten better than when he started but still was not match for Cardin. He could last longer on their spars, but he had yet to win a single time. Backed with the rest of his team Jaune was outmatched. Or he would, if he hadn't a reality altering device on his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking a bit, Jaune took a few seconds to think what to swapp. Then it hit him like an epiphany. Maybe Cardin should experience being a faunus. It would serve as payback for all the things he forced Jaune to do back then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the Personal Information option and selecting species Jaune aimed at Velvet. The next instant Velvet stood there, now an ordinary human girl, while Jaune was a rabbit faunus. But reality hadn't time to reassert itself before Jaune aimed at Cardin this time and pushed the same button. Jaune returned back to normal and beheld a bizarre sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin with two rabbit ears. Jaune had to hold his laughter, not wanting to attract attention to himself, least that of Cardin. It wouldn't end good for him after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was of course unaware of all changes his swap truly caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet was now the adopted human child of the Scarlatina clan of rabbit faunus. Not much going on there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin however received the most significant changes of all. The Winchesters were die hard human supremacist. Having lost many members during the faunus wars created a grudge that has yet to vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got complicated when Sandra Winchester gave birth to a faunus child. It would have been an scandal if they hadn't hid the information and kept the boy a secret. They wanted to kill the child, but Sandra felt a bit remorseful and they just kept him isolated in a safehouse from the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up was hard for the rabbit faunus. The Winchester didn't even grant him a name. The constant abuse by the servants in charge of him and his curiosity about the outside led him to his escape, a search for freedom. But the outside wasn't as nice as he thought. Faunus discrimination wasn't as widespread in Vale as it was in Atlas, yet the kid experienced the harsh truth of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have died outside in the cold streets, in the winter when he was not even ten years old yet. But he was saved by a passing faunus who took him to the local branch of the White Fang, where he was inducted on his early years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin proved himself to be above the average recruit and quickly climbed the social leaders till his current position as lieutenant. His latest mission is to transmit intel on Beacon to the Fang for future operations under the alias of Cardin Belmont. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are more things going on there, but they are unrelated to Jaune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the daze of reality rewriting itself finished, Cardin turned around and walked out of the zone. The rest of his team followed behind, but now looked cowed, somehow resigned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small crowd dispersed too, and Velvet passed next to Jaune who still was rooted on the spot. He heard her murmur something but couldn't grasp it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation now diffused what should Jaune do next. </span></div></div>",

Fumbling with it quickly, he shoved it into his pocket and pulled out his Scroll. Blake didn\u2019t even glance up as he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Mr. Arc.\u201d A middle-aged man with tousled silver hair and thin brown eyes stared at him through black spectacles.

A couple Grimm near a small town need to be exterminated before the day to day activities are interrupted. Normally, the militia would be able to handle this, but I volunteered your team to help out. Think of this as not only an opportunity to gain real world experience, but to make up for the damage your enthusiastic team member caused to our statute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune flinched as he remembered Nora and Yang drawing pictures on it last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it would help get Glynda off your back,\u201d Ozpin added. \u201cYou are free to not accept-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we will.\u201d Jaune interjected. He could only imagine what Nora would say if he declined the chance for them to go on an adventure. Ren would go along with her and Pyrrha would go with whatever Jaune decided. Besides, having Glynda Goodwitch, deputy headmistress, think better of them was a huge boon. \u201cIs there anything else we should know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe mission will last 3 days,\u201d Ozpin told him and passed over a folder. \u201cAll the information about the city and surrounding area is there. You need to take care of the Grimm problem within that time. If you don\u2019t, I will have no choice but to count it as a failure and it will be a black mark on your record. If you finish early, take the opportunity to relax in the area. The Bullhead leaves in two hours so that you will arrive in the morning. Please prepare yourself accordingly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood, sir.\u201d Jaune took the file and left the office.

Nora waved and Ren gave a short nod. Jaune had just stepped outside when the door across the hall opened and a familiar girl with short black hair and red tips exited. Her gothic red and black dress was recognizable anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Jaune!\u201d Ruby Rose greeted brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSup, Rubes.\u201d Jaune replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Ozpin gave us a mission to clear some Grimm around a farming town,\u201d Jaune answered. \u201cWe are finishing packing and leaving tonight.

It\u2019s so expensive I think she has to be putting actually silver in her hair.\u201d The two of them shared a laugh. \u201cSo why are you out here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was\u2026\u201d Jaune paused. He couldn\u2019t say he wanted to test some magical remote that swapped things between people. That sounded bad in his head and his phrasing ability would only make it worse. Ruby would be a perfect test subject for him after all. He just needed her to look away and decide what to swap. \u201c\u2026getting some last minute exercise before we get on the Bullhead. Going to be stuck in one for most of the night with Nora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t being with Nora an exercise on its own?\u201d Ruby asked innocently, causing Jaune to snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but being in a cramped compartment with motion sickness is going to prevent me from moving around any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yeah.\u201d From the look on her face, she didn\u2019t envy anyone sitting next to him. The memory of him puking on Yang\u2019s shoes was still vivid in their minds. The two of them turned down the hallway and walked together. \u201cSoooo, there was a new Dust bullet released this week that\u2019s supposed to have twice the piercing power. Grimm with thick hides won\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing Ruby loved about Jaune was he didn\u2019t think she was weird for loving weapons and weapon accessories. That was mostly due to the fact he admired that she was so passionate about something. As she went on and on about the new ammunition, Jaune secretly pulled out the remote and aimed it at her. It probably was going to work, but curiosity forced him to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he decide to swap?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thinking the first test should be something cosmetic so he wouldn\u2019t be worried about adapting to a new body, he aimed at Ruby\u2019s hair and hit the Body Part Swap option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune\u2019s jaw virtually fell to the floor in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby continued talking as if nothing happened. At this point, Jaune wasn\u2019t even trying to listen Sure, her short black hair with red tips weren\u2019t much longer than his short blonde hair, but she had to have notice something. Even unconsciously like running her fingers through her hair. Jaune could see the black strands of hair out of the corner of his eye. He really wanted to check himself out in a mirror. Apologizing to Ruby, he managed to convince her he had to go back to his room to pack something he forgot. She seemed to believe him, as she had been guilty of the same thing before and continued on her way. Still a little jealous of his good fortune on procuring a mission for his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back,\u201d Ren greeted him. \u201cNora\u2019s almost done and then we can head down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t all fit.\u201d Nora complained, trying to push her bag shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will only be gone for a couple days,\u201d Pyrrha reminded her. \u201cDo you really need all of that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Nora replied. \u201cYou never know what we might encounter.

Pyrrha and Jaune mouthed to Ren, who only smiled and shook his head letting them know it was better not to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved he wasn\u2019t asked to participate in anything, Jaune slipped into his team\u2019s bathroom and locked the door behind him. He stared into the mirror to get a good long look at himself. It was exactly as he imagined. He looked exactly like himself except his hair was slightly longer and black. He fingered a few strands and silently admitted it didn\u2019t look that bad. It actually looked natural. He also noted none of his teammates noticed the difference. Seems the user manual was right about reality changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fell to the remote in his hand and he just stared at it for a moment. The potential of this remote was endless. If he played his cards right, there was nothing he couldn\u2019t do or try out. Everything could be reset back to normal with a single press of a button. Still, there was still work to do before he could mess around. His team had an important mission. As the leader, he needed to be focused.

Before he could even hope to discover the answer to any of them, Pyrrha knocked on the door to see if he was ready. They needed to get going. Jaune pocketed the remote and hurried out of the bathroom. He figured after the mission was done he could do more tests with the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, he tried to stick with that plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemptation was a powerful mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his defense, the ride was boring, even with Nora\u2019s imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the Bullhead landed at the farming town, Jaune had made three swaps. The first swap was a Body Swap with Ren. He figured swapping bodies with another guy wouldn\u2019t be too invasive. It was rather unnerving though to see himself from another perspective, especially wearing Ren\u2019s green tailcoat and white pants. It wasn\u2019t like he could really talk though, as he had swapped clothes with Nora. So now he was in Ren\u2019s body wearing a white sleeveless top and pink skirt while she was wearing his black hoodie. Glancing at himself in the mirror, he secretly admitted Ren could pass as a girl without much trouble if he grew his hair out. The last swap was with Pyrrha, since he wanted to involve his entire team in something, while testing out the remote. He did a Personal Info Swap and changed their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas rather interesting being called Pyrrha by the others and it took focus to remember to react when someone said his new name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they landed, met the mayor of the town, learned about the situation, and set their gear at the inn, Jaune hit the Reset button to fix everyone. They all needed to be in top shape for when they went to face off against the Grimm. The mayor informed them that it was a boy from one of the farming families on the far end of town who first spotted the Grimm. He might be able to help them figure out where they came from. The other option was for them to go off on their own. They had studied maps of the land before they came and they learned about Grimm behavioral patterns in class.

If the terrain proved problematic, they might need him as a guide and that would just put him in harm\u2019s way. Besides, they had a pretty good idea where to check. Most of the area was flat fields, so if the Grimm weren\u2019t there, that only left the woods on the east side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the details on this map,\u201d Ren informed the others. \u201cI suspect they would be around this area. The natural formation would be an ideal spot for caves to form. The Grimm would rest there during the day and come out at night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo Grimm even sleep?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir \u2018sleep\u2019 is more of them taking a break,\u201d Pyrrha explained. \u201cThey have been observed resting after long travels or battles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we find them we have to wake them up first,\u201d Nora said. \u201cIt\u2019s cowardly to attack them when they are sleeping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they are in a cave,\u201d Ren pointed out. \u201cMost likely they will hear us coming early on. We just want to be careful about being surrounded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan, Fearless Leader?\u201d Nora asked Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 we can cover more ground in groups,\u201d Jaune decided. \u201cBut Ren is right about being careful. So let\u2019s travel in groups of two. If you find them, let the others know. Don\u2019t engage them by yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Nora gave a snappy salute. \u201cYou don\u2019t want us to have all the fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Jaune muttered exasperatedly under his breath and Pyrrha giggled. \u201cYes, Nora. That\u2019s exactly right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ren!\u201d Nora ordered. \u201cLet\u2019s show off our amazing tracking skills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Ren told the others. \u201cShould we just split the area in half?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you two take the north side.\u201d Ren and Nora left before Jaune turned to Pyrrha. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s just us, partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind you of initiation?\u201d Pyrrha asked, as the two of them starting moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little,\u201d Jaune admitted, steeping over a large tree root. \u201cAt least this time I\u2019m prepared.\u201d They both laughed and went to work trying to locate the Grimm.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pyrrha imitated his action but before she had a chance to ask why he was preparing himself, a black beast lunged out from behind the foliage at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha pushed Jaune out of the way and took the force of the blow on her shield. She leaped backwards, rolled on the ground ,and sprung to her feat, sword in the ready position. Jaune only had a second to admire her form before two more Beowolves entered his line of sight. One went for him and the other went after Pyrrha. Claws slid against the metal of his shield with a mind numbing screech. He stepped backwards from the force of the Grimm\u2019s attack and slipped on a root poking out from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis agility was nowhere near Pyrrha's and there was no way he could imitate her.

It took only a moment for him to realize what the swap was, after his brain overcame the shock of what he saw. Before him, he stood. Well, his body. The way it was walking on all fours, eyes flashing dangerously, and growling acted exactly like a Grimm.  The weirdest thing was seeing himself doing all that\u2026 while naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, it was just a body swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune stepped to the side in his new powerful Grimm body. Beowolves may have resembled wolves, but they could easily stand on just their back legs. His height didn\u2019t change very much, but his legs and arms felt much stronger. Strangely enough, his face felt the most unusual. Having a nostril and a mouth extending out of his head was something new. There wasn\u2019t a mirror, but Jaune could imagine how strange he must look: A Beowolf in human clothing and armor, wielding a sword and shield. Besides his face, his body moved like he was used to and slowly circled along with the Beowolf. While the Grimm was in his body, it was still a Grimm and would try to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clawed hands\u2026paws? Whatever they were now gripped his weapons tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What should I do? If it forces me to kill it, can I switch back? Should I try to subdue it? Make a break for the remote?

A spear flew over his shoulder and impaled the Grimm in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune tried to yell out, but some weird combination of growling and howling replaced his words. Grimm could not talk and the vocal chords were swapped along with the body. All he could do was stare in horror as the Grimm in his body fell to the ground. Jaune was just conscious enough of the situation to see that his body wasn't bleeding, but was disappearing in black smoke like normal Grimm did when they died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Pyrrha apologized. \u201cI got a little overzealous and took it down before you got a chance. I know you can handle yourself.\u201d She fidgeted. \u201cNora has been rubbing off on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap!\u201d Jaune cried out and grabbed his head with his clawed hands. \u201cPlease tell me it still works!\u201d Again, rather than words, growling and snarling was what he heard with his ears. He raced over to where the remote laid and picked it up, examining it closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes what work?\u201d Pyrrha asked, moving with him and glancing over his shoulder. Somehow it seems like she could understand him. That was probably due to the remote. It was a good sign it was still working. \u201cWhat do you have there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accidentally packed a new remote for the TV,\u201d Jaune told her in his weird Grimm growling language she somehow understood, pocketing the remote quickly. \u201cForgot I had it and while I was fighting the Grimm, it fell out. Cost a bit so I was a little worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d There was a little skepticism in her eyes but it disappeared quickly enough. She didn't have a reason to doubt him. \u201cWe should let Ren and Nora know we took care of these. There might be more though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned away, Jaune reached into his pocket and pressed the Undo button. Nothing happened. He pressed the Reset button. Again, nothing happened. He was beginning to panic. His body was gone, the remote didn\u2019t seem to be working, and he was trapped as a Grimm. He had to know if the remote worked. Pyrrha was the only one nearby he could test with and he fumbled with the remote as he pressed a button lightly with his claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of green light and Pyrrha was holding his ancient shield and sword, while he had her red and gold smaller shield and spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It works! </i>Jaune thought relieved and then sobered up at once.<i> I only couldn\u2019t swap back because my body is gone. The Grimm died and now I\u2019m stuck as one of them. Yet everyone seems me as myself and even understands me. Things could be a lot worse, but I need to be careful. I can\u2019t accidentally drop the remote. For all I know, the remote could have swapped us and I never would have known.</i> He pressed the undo button and swapped their weapons back. <i>Seriously, this is so messed up. I thought this remote would be fun.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped the remote into his pocket and flexed his arms.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWell, this body isn\u2019t bad. I could get use to this.</i> Jaune smiled in an eerie Grimm way. <i>Huh. I was always told Grimm didn\u2019t have sexes. I wonder if that still holds true.</i> With Pyrrha looking ahead of them, Jaune pulled at his jeans, which had fortunately adjusted to his new body, and glanced down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Scientists couldn\u2019t determine the sex of Grimm. Yet, dangling between his legs was a large symbol of manhood. Sure it was covered in some black hair near the base and it was oddly redder than his own, but unmistakable in what it was. This might not be a natural occurrence though. Maybe the Body Swap had weird effects on Grimm. As he and Pyrrha made their way back to town to meet up with Ren and Nora, Jaune tried to get use to his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a little taller, though not by much. His muscles were strong and well-defined. Weirdly enough, he felt like more of a Hunter now. This was the power he had been training with Pyrrha all this time to obtain. Ironic thought this was. He even had his sword, armor, and luckily, it was only a Body Swap, he kept his clothes. Being a male Beowolf also helped him adjust quicker. It would have been awkward, more than it was now, to be a female. There was only one difference that annoyed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beowolf body\u2019s dick was significantly larger than his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it was massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky!\u201d Nora complained, after Jaune and Pyrrha told her about the Grimm encounter. \u201cPhooey, you probably killed the only ones out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did spend some time chasing those squirrels.\u201d Ren reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to see if they picked up anything cool and hid it back at their nests.\u201d Nora replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur mission is probably complete,\u201d Pyrrha said. \u201cBut we should patrol at least once or twice a day while we are here to make sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could do it in shifts too,\u201d Jaune suggested. \u201cOne group in the morning, the other in the afternoon?\u201d Again, it amazed him how the others could understand the growls that escaped his throat. He wondered if he swapped voices with someone, would he talk like them and they growl? It would be interesting to experiment more with the remote. He was stuck in a monster\u2019s body. There probably wasn\u2019t much he could do to make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamous last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink we can check out the animals now?\u201d Nora asked, giving them an amazing set of puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Jaune answered. Who was he to deprive Nora of animal fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should probably inform the mayor first,\u201d Pyrrha suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would probably be prudent,\u201d Ren agreed. The two of them took off.  Ren powerwalked to keep up with Nora skipping. Pyrrha and Jaune lagged behind and she leaned over to whisper in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t interested in seeing the animals,\u201d she suggested. \u201cWe could do something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Something else probably meant training</i>, Jaune thought, aware they didn\u2019t have stuff like comics here. Still, he could probably think of something for them to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was just being considerate of him. After Ren informed the mayor of the situation, they were given permission to wander around the farmlands. Most of the farmers were happy to allow Nora to see the animals up close. She was just supposed to be careful. Funny enough, Nora actually was great with animals. It was inanimate things she usually broke. Crashing through doors was one thing, holding a chicken under an arm just enough so it wouldn\u2019t fall was another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure we can\u2019t keep one?\u201d Nora asked Ren. \u201cThink of all the fresh eggs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat chicken belongs to the farmer here,\u201d Ren replied patiently. \u201cHe said as long as you don\u2019t hurt any, you can play with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would never hurt this cutie.\u201d The chicken clucked as Nora ran a finger delicately under its chin. She set it down and it ran off. \u201cOoo! Cows!\u201d She bolted to the pasture and the others followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always liked cows,\u201d Pyrrha said to Jaune, leaning on the fence. Nora had hopped over and was walking over to one confidently. The cows began to move away from her but they knew she wouldn\u2019t give up. \u201cEver since I was a kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI managed to milk them a couple times,\u201d Jaune bragged. He leaned on the fence too and it moved a little bit under his new Grimm weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an annual fair back at my village where everyone got to milk a cow,\u201d Jaune explained. \u201cNot trying to brag or anything, but I was a natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha\u2019s laugh was musical and she turned to watch Nora trying to climb on one of the cows. She brushed a strand of hair back over her ear and Jaune found himself staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune took the opportunity to pull the remote out of his pocket while she wasn\u2019t looking. He could swap something with her. As his partner, the odds of him losing anything would be slim. She was also super strong and wouldn\u2019t be defeated by anything. His eyes then darted to the field where Nora was playing around with Ren nearby. Swapping something with her might be fun. He aimed his remote.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s a tough ol\u2019 girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Ren asked Nora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Nora told the farmer while she jumped up and down in excitement. The man smiled and went to get a bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune began to get an inkling of what was happening, but turned around to confirm it. To his surprise and fascination, he saw a cow in his clothes standing next to Pyrrha. She was talking to Cow-Jaune like nothing happened. Jaune glanced down in a panic and saw the remote still in his hand, but without clothes, he had nowhere to hide it. He kept it wrapped up in his paw to make sure he didn\u2019t lose it. The last thing he wanted was to be trapped in the life of a cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could really process his situation, the farmer returned with a bucket and put it under him, along with a stool for Nora to sit on. He put a hand on Jaune\u2019s head and spoke softly. This was only possible with Jaune\u2019s Grimm body because he was down on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, girl. It\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune\u2019s mouth fell open as Nora plopped down on the stool and began to reach for him. She was going to try to milk him because the world saw him as a cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really needed to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast!</span></div></div>",

If someone saw and grabbed it, they might break it or accidentally swap. Pyrrha and the cow living his life had come closer to watch and Nora was in a very precarious position. Jaune wasn\u2019t sure what to do and just stood there. It wasn\u2019t like he had an udder for her to grab. He hadn\u2019t swap bodies with the cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he remembered that his Grimm body was male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nora\u2026 there\u2019s nothing there,</i> Jaune thought. <i>There\u2019s only\u2026</i> \u201cShit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora had a tight grip on his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, lass.\u201d The farmer told her. \u201cShort tugs, don\u2019t pull too hard. It takes a few moments to get started but then it just comes out naturally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Nora agreed and nodded. Her hand began to jerk up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, Nora,\u201d Jaune moaned. \u201cDon\u2019t continue or I\u2019m going to\u2026fuck!\u201d The farmer nodded, taking Jaune\u2019s words as mooing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pressure belt up within him much faster than he had ever experienced before. He was a teenage boy and there were nights he explored his body. The speed of which the pressure built up wasn\u2019t what he was used to. There was no time to control himself. It only took like ten seconds for him to feel his genitals release. A metal clang told him Nora had aimed into the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you just keep it going,\u201d the farmer told her. \u201cConstant rhythm and you will have this girl milked in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nKeeping it going?</i> Jaune thought in shock. <i>I can\u2019t keep going like that. I got like two, three shots max before I\u2019m dry. </i>He really didn\u2019t get any choice in the matter as Nora kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. Somehow he wasn\u2019t running out and Nora kept making him shoot his load into the bucket. Maybe the remote had something to do with it to make them all believe he really was a cow. The blessing and curse was each time he released he had a mini orgasm, so he was experiencing it over and over and over again. His arms and legs began to shake and when Nora finally stopped, he breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThat was\u2026 intense. Holy cow\u2026 heh. Glad Yang isn\u2019t here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPyrrha?\u201d Nora asked. \u201cWant a turn? It\u2019s really fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Pyrrha replied. \u201cI\u2019ve never done something like this before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t either until now,\u201d Nora informed her, and started pushing Pyrrha closer. \u201cBut you have to try new things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was still reeling from the countless orgasms he had just received thanks to Nora\u2019s firm grip. He didn\u2019t even get a chance to look into the bucket and see what really came out. It was hard to turn around in his position to see the bucket under him. Did the remote really make milk come out from his dick? He wasn\u2019t thinking straight and wasn\u2019t sure if he could go another round of countless orgasms. Remembering the remote had an Undo Button didn\u2019t even cross his mind. He decided he either needed to accept his faith or swap lives with one of the girls to get out of this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being so close, his aim wasn\u2019t off and he was careful to poke the right button with his claw. There was a flash of light and Jaune found himself standing upright again. He was wearing her white t-shirt with a heart cut out on the chest, the black vest, and pink skirt. Pink and white shoes had grown considerably to fit over his Grimm feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him, Pyrrha was sitting on a stool next to Nora, who was completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMooo.\u201d Nora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do it, Pyrrha!\u201d Jaune egged on. He felt so\u2026 happy and excitable. Nora\u2019s life was so hyper and it took some work to quiet it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust keep calm and imagine you\u2019re practicing a rhythm.\u201d Ren suggested. The cow in Jaune\u2019s life mooed and Pyrrha glanced back at them. She nodded and reached under Nora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first thing Jaune noticed. Cow\u2019s had udders for milk. When Jaune was living the cow\u2019s life, he had been in a Grimm body, but his genitals had somehow performed the same function. Did that mean Pyrrha was going to be messaging Nora\u2019s vagina for milk? From his position, he couldn\u2019t see between Nora\u2019s legs. Her butt was pointed at him and he could see a little of her ample bosom dangling down. A twinge of guilt ran through him seeing Nora in that position, but he reminded himself that he was actually living Nora\u2019s life. The cow just had her body. Temporarily of course. Jaune was going to swap back. Part of him really wanted to see how this was going to work out from this side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened when Pyrrha reached under Nora and grasped her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, alternate,\u201d the farmer reminded her, though Jaune had never heard him say anything of the sort. Reality had indeed been altered. Pyrrha nodded again, a look of concentration formed on her face, and she began to tug up and down on Nora\u2019s breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilk began to shoot out into the bucket and Nora mooed again. The bucker was already partially full from Jaune\u2019s turn and it indeed looked like milk. He wasn\u2019t going to drink that particular batch though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee,\u201d Ren stated calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying yourself?\u201d Jaune asked, eyes still fixed on the site. Nora had a pretty rocking body. Ren was a lucky guy, even if they kept saying they were only together and not together-together. Watching Pyrrha tug on her breasts was pretty hypnotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is pretty fun,\u201d Pyrrha admitted and continued for another couple of minutes before standing back up. \u201cWhat next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow in Jaune\u2019s life mooed and Ren nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora,\u201d he said, turning to Jaune. \u201cYou wanted to see the animals. What do you want to visit next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune didn\u2019t even have to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s visit the chickens again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora\u2019s life was very adamant on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them waited for the farmer to let the cow move around freely again and lead them to the chicken coup, Jaune fingered the remote in his skirt\u2019s pocket. He really should swap everyone back, but there were other things he could do. A cow was living his life and Nora\u2019s body was being used by the cow. Maybe he could swap his team with animals while they were here. He would just have to be careful not to choose anyone about to be eaten. As he followed them, his mind kept racing through possibilities.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cow was now in Nora\u2019s life, wearing her white t-shirt, black vest, and pink skirt, while he was back in his clothes, still a Beowolf towering over his friends. <i>Now, who's next?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow in Nora\u2019s life was already moving faster than any cow Jaune had ever seen move. Ren followed immediately while he and Pyrrha trailed after them, leaving Nora in the cow\u2019s life at the barn. The cow immediately began walking among the chickens while Ren stood nearby. Figuring he was as good of target as any, Jaune aimed at the rooster. It wasn\u2019t likely to be eaten during their short stay. The reason he had to aim at the chicken first was he couldn\u2019t swap Ren and it at once. He had to do a triangle swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the flash of light, Jaune found himself naked where the chicken had been and a chicken was standing next to Pyrrha wearing his clothes.

The two of them left Cow Nora and Chicken Ren alone. When they reached the field, Pyrrha leaned on the fence and looked at the horses passing by. There were around three dark brown ones nearby and in the distance. They saw two kids in their teens, probably a few years younger than them, riding other horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are pretty majestic.\u201d Pyrrha commented, watching the horses prance around.

It\u2019s not like she would know and she did like horses. Of course, he could take the initiative instead and see if the farmer kids would let them try riding horses. There might be a problem with his Grimm body though. Funny enough, when he talked he stilled growled, but he didn\u2019t even notice it anymore. Maybe the world already adjusted to the Body Swap. He could also tell Pyrrha about the remote, after switching everyone back. It might be worth having someone to explore it with.

A second later, he found himself out in the field on all fours, He felt like he could stand up, but didn\u2019t want to. Beowolves could run on all fours or on two legs, so he was okay with either way. His eyes darted back to Pyrrha. He suddenly realized she would be out in the field completely naked like Nora was. That alone almost prevented him from making the next swap. It was only the realization no one would notice and think it was natural that he continued. He was also a teenager and seeing naked girls was something he secretly desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe aimed the remote on the ground and clicked the button again. Now he found himself back on the outside of the pen wearing all of Pyrrha\u2019s clothes. All the clothes adjusted because of the remote, but a Beowolf wearing a corset was not something Jaune would normally imagine. Next to him in his hoody and jeans was the horse. Seriously, his clothes seemed to fit it perfectly. Jaune sighed and swapped again. Rapid Life Swap were a little disorienting because he jumped from place to place like he was teleporting. Now the horse was wearing the corset and it looked extremely odd. He had to resist laughing, though a few chuckles escaped his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was back in his life and the rest of his team were animals. Nora a cow, Ren a chicken, and Pyrrha a horse. The world should see them all as normal except for him. His eyes traveled to Pyrrha now on all fours in the field, naked as the day she was born. She was prancing around in a circle without a care in the world. Even from this distance, Jaune could tell how hot his partner was.

The Pyrrha living the life of a horse, not the horse currently next to Jaune. In her hand she had a large saddle. As the girl approached Pyrrha, Pyrrha turned and started walking toward her. It became obvious the girl was the horse\u2019s owner. Pyrrha didn\u2019t move much as the girl strapped the saddle on her back. Once it was securely in place, she put a foot on it and heft herself up on Pyrrha\u2019s back.

However, some other ideas came to him. The first was he could swap with the girl. If he took her life, he could be the one riding Pyrrha\u2026 well the horse\u2026 and experience the reality a little more in depth. He would probably have to swap bodies too, as a Beowolf sitting on a human was probably not going to work. The remote might allow it, but it would be awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third option that came to him was swapping himself with Pyrrha. It would put her in his life and his in the horse\u2019s. This was only an idea at first, but the more he considered it, the more it appealed to him. He could see what it was like to be an animal again and observe how reality altered to make everything seem normal. There had only been a few glimpses when he accidentally swapped with the cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was riding Pyrrha away so he had to decide now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He glanced over his shoulder and saw a Beowolf with medium length blonde hair wearing his clothes next to a horse wearing Pyrrha\u2019s clothes. He looked down at his outfit and saw a simple pair of jeans and a checkered long sleeve shirt. The girl whose life and body he now inhabited was only beginning to develop and Jaune wasn\u2019t a pervert to check it out. No, he did this purely to see if a human swapped with a horse could support a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was still underneath him walking forward without a care in the world. Jaune held the reins and tugged, letting his life guide him. Pyrrha veered to the right and he quickly figured out how to turn. It was weird. Jaune could feel his feet barely off the ground. Swapping bodies had been a good idea. There was no way Pyrrha was used to walking on all fours, yet there was no issues with actually riding. Looking around, he saw the other kids near a small obstacle course or track. He wasn\u2019t sure what they were officially called, but one of the obstacles required them to jump over a bar a couple feet above the ground. Thinking quickly and trying to figure out if this girl was skilled enough, he directed Pyrrha toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Sally!\u201d One of the boys called out. \u201cYou want a turn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Jaune called back. \u201cJust one jump for me, then I think I\u2019m going to take it easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune waited for one of them to finish and he took his place. Letting the girl\u2019s life guide him, he tapped the side of Pyrrha and she began to run. At the last second, Jaune jerked the reigns and Pyrrha leaped into the air, far higher than Jaune expected. He almost fell off and stumbled when Pyrrha landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah.\u201d Jaune muttered. \u201cThat was\u2026 pretty intense.\u201d He guided Pyrrha toward the fence and dismounted before tying her to a post. A couple brushes were hanging by nails and he picked up one to brush her hair. Mud was already caked on Pyrrha\u2019s hands and feet and part of her arms and legs. On a normal horse, it wouldn\u2019t be so noticeable. Pale human skin revealed mud much easier. Now that he had his fun and experimented with the remote, it was time to decide what to do. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even if nothing was going to come from it, he knew what he did. Deciding now was as good as time as ever, he hit the Reset Button. There was a flash of light and a slight disorientation before Jaune found himself leaning up against the fence where he and Pyrrha had been before. Pyrrha was no longer a horse nor was a horse in her clothes. In the distance he could see Ren following Nora. Everything was back to normal. Well, except his Grimm body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stuck in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is nice,\u201d Pyrrha commented. \u201cMaybe we could find some time to visit the rural cities more often. Like on break?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t a lot of missions send us out to places like this?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes.\u201d She nodded. \u201cBut we may not always get downtime like this. Hunters and Huntresses can spend days or even weeks out in the field without seeing civilization.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch.\u201d Jaune flinched. \u201cI\u2019ve been camping before, but weeks?

He wasn\u2019t worried. Pyrrha was the nicest girl he knew. \u201cWith our luck, I expect a Grimm invasion to happen soon or Nora to knock down a farmhouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen should be able to keep that from happening,\u201d Pyrrha assured him. \u201cShe can behave when visiting places. With all the exercise she\u2019s getting, she won\u2019t go overboard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but I bet she gets into some kind of trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one at Beacon would take that bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both burst out laughing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He lost his body, but that was because he had been stupid. There really was no harm in this.

To his credit, while he stiffened a little at her boldness, he wrapped his arms around her to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt helps you\u2019re taller than me too,\u201d Pyrrha hummed. \u201cMost guys aren\u2019t and it\u2019s nice to be able to cuddle like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad my chest is comfy,\u201d Jaune laughed, partially thanking his fluffy Beowolf body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune\u2026 I have to warn you because it wouldn\u2019t be fair otherwise,\u201d Pyrrha whispered. \u201cDue to my fame, there are people who are going to talk about you. Paparazzi is going to want to follow you around. It will be difficult to go into public on dates. A lot of celebrity\u2019s have trouble dating normal people because a lot of people can\u2019t handle the pressure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t say what the future holds,\u201d Jaune admitted. \u201cBut if we can\u2019t go out, we can watch movies in our room wearing pajamas and eat microwave popcorn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds romantic and I can\u2019t wait.\u201d Pyrrha said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, we happen to have a remote that can let us\u2026 bypass those fame restrictions.\u201d Jaune reminded her and Pyrrha\u2019s eyes shot open as she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026 you\u2019re right.\u201d Pyrrha stared at him. \u201cWe can spend time together without other people recognizing us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, and if I\u2019m with you, it\u2019s sure to be fun.\u201d Jaune smiled at her and she could only stare into his blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, her head moved forward and their lips locked together as Jaune leaned against a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT HAPPENED!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energetic cry caused them both to jump and they saw Nora and Ren peaking out from behind another tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, we just noticed.\u201d Ren apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you two are together!?\u201d Nora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha and Jaune looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d They said in unison.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their relationship has spread pretty quickly thanks to Nora and Ruby. It didn\u2019t bother her as much as other rumors did. This rumor was one that actually made her happy. Most people were encouraging and she noticed Jaune was popular among the guys, yet he never tried to brag about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, he was a great boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we got to skip class today,\u201d Jaune continued. \u201cI was exhausted.

With you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha blushed and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m not interested,\u201d Pyrrha admitted. \u201cI only experienced the Body Swap. What did you do again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBody Part, full body, and life,\u201d Jaune recited. \u201cPersonal Info was warned that there could be side effects to make things work out. Personality I was worried because I was alone and wasn\u2019t sure how I would feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonality does seem dangerous, but as long as only one of us does it, I could see it being interesting,\u201d Pyrrha admitted. \u201cMaybe start small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo like a Body Part or clothes?\u201d Pyrrha suggested and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just thinking it would be funny to see you in girls\u2019 clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune thought about it for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it for you. Who do you want me to swap with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Pyrrha asked. \u201cI was just joking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, you seemed interested and I want to have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he was still in the body of the Beowolf and only he knew it. So to him, it would just be a Beowolf in girls\u2019 clothes, which would still be funny. The body did have some nice bonuses. He was physically stronger and faster, didn\u2019t tire easily, and had enhanced senses like smell. During training that day with Pyrrha, they focused on technique, rather than the foundation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re sure,\u201d Pyrrha said slowly. \u201cHow about swapping clothes with\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pretty sure it\u2019s a girlfriend privilege to wear their boyfriend\u2019s hoodie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha laughed at that and swatted his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to swap?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll do any swap you want.\u201d Jaune assured her. They touched the remote and Jaune pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, Pyrrha was wearing his jeans, sneakers, and Pumpkin peat hoodie. Jaune on the other hand was wearing a light red and gold shoulder less top with tight pants. Of course, Jaune was a Beowolf, so the outfit was even weirder on his body. His feet were covered by large white woman\u2019s shoes.  Clothes adjusted to fit the body. Even if he still had his male body, it would have looked weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha snorted and covered her mouth as she looked at Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d Jaune sighed and licked her cheek. It was hard to kiss with a snout. \u201cYou still look amazing in my clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are my clothes?\u201d Pyrrha asked, controlling herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine except for one small\u2026 large problem.\u201d Jaune muttered, and gestured to his crotch with his clawed hand. Pyrrha looked down and flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a huge bulge and then a large rod moving down along the inside of the pant. Jaune\u2019s Beowolf had a very large cock and balls, so tight women\u2019s pants were not designed to accommodate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Little did Jaune know, Pyrrha was imagining Jaune pushing her against a wall and ravishing her with that monster. \u201cDo you\u2026 want to switch back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little uncomfortable, but I can last for a little bit.\u201d Jaune rubbed his chest. \u201cYour bra is weird since I have no breasts.\u201d Pyrrha giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want, you can try swapping it away to someone for a little bit,\u201d Pyrrha suggested. \u201cSO we can keep wearing each other\u2019s clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Jaune mused. \u201cMight be funny to give it to someone in a skirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just mean.\u201d Pyrrha giggled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The front of her skirt was lifted up, revealing her panties as the balls were exploding out of it. It was like she was wearing a bra several sizes too small. The bright red dick was on full display except for the head hidden by the hem of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Jaune and Pyrrha whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Weiss didn\u2019t notice a single thing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then they both touched the remote as Jaune pointed it to Pyrrha and pressed the Life Swap and Body Swap options. There was another flash of light and they swapped positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune felt top heavy all of a sudden as the weight on his head increased. He shrunk a bit and was not looking at a Beowolf wearing his clothes. Pyrrha was looking down at herself and stretching a bit. Jaune looked down and examined his new body. Right now, he WAS Pyrrha Nikos and Pyrrha WAS him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow you feel?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I could dominate you at video games.\u201d Pyrrha laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not fair at all.\u201d Jaune protested and couldn\u2019t help chuckling.

It\u2019s not a sleepover right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, there\u2019s class tomorrow.\u201d Pyrrha reminded him. \u201cJust\u2026 Yang\u2019s probably going to want to spar if you DO go training, there\u2019s a chance they just want to grill me on our relationship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, I hope your life saves me.\u201d Jaune moaned and blinked. \u201cHmm, I can feel your life telling me I should get ready for the girl\u2019s night and change out of these old clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I would do,\u201d Pyrrha replied. \u201cProbably shower too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 change, but I can\u2019t do a shower, probably.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune, I told you, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Even with a Beowolf face, she looked embarrassed still. \u201cIf you have any questions, try to use my life to help out. If it\u2019s bad, use the remote and reset. I\u2019ll handle it. You can reset any time you feel uncomfortable, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to get you in trouble.\u201d Jaune promised. Pyrrha licked his cheek and they split up.

Nothing between his legs, top heavy, and his clothes felt fighter with Pyrrha\u2019s bra constricting his chest under the top and the pants were hugging his curves tightly. However, there was more. He had his girlfriend\u2019s life and he felt confident. No longer was he weak, but a strong fighter who worked hard to get to where he/she was. Then he felt the emotions within him, about having a boyfriend who truly cared for him/her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Jaune realize how much Pyrrha loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped he could live up to her expectations. It was a little nerve wrecking walking though Beacon seeing GUYS staring at him. He had to remind himself that everyone saw him as Pyrrha and it was only natural guys would look at a beautiful girl like her. Smugness welled up a little bit inside him as HE was dating her. Of course, he would never take advantage of that position. The pride was still there though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get away from the stares, he quickly made his way back to Team JNPR\u2019s room and slipped inside. Now he understood why Pyrrha kept to herself when she wasn\u2019t with him, Nora, and/or Ren. The room was thankfully empty and he slipped into the bathroom. Taking a few deep breaths, he stared into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha stared back at him, in all her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still find it hard to believe she loves me,\u201d Jaune muttered, hearing Pyrrha\u2019s voice. He paused a moment and smiled. \u201cMy name is Pyrrha Nikos and I\u2019m dating Jaune Arc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic to his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes traveled down to the top he was wearing. It covered his now feminine chest, but it was simply a piece of fabric. Pyrrha\u2019s amble bosom size was clearly visible.His eyes stared at them for a little while longer, refusing to glance away. His hands were twitching and he knew what he wanted to do, but his gentleman side wouldn\u2019t allow it. Even though he had done it to Nora back on the farm in a panic, this was now the body of his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s your girlfriend.\u201d He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But she said it was okay,</i> His mind told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have permission.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to argue with his subconscious desires, Jaune slowly reached up and, with just a moment of hesitation, had his hands grip his new breasts gently. Pleasure began to run through his body and he sighed happily. They felt amazing. He shook his head and let go. Now he was debating if he should go a little further\u2026 or stop for now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to have top grades, expert fighting abilities, and believed she would easily become a team leader. Reality came crashing down and instead, her partner, fifteen year old Ruby, received that honor. For a long time, Weiss wondered why Ozpin gave Ruby the position instead of her. Over time, it slowly became apparent and Weiss no longer hated her partner. She actually liked her. What she hated was when Ruby and her sister Yang took over the room and made so much noise she couldn\u2019t work on her homework. While it was only Friday and classes ended roughly an hour ago, Weiss liked to get an early start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have gone to the library, but instead decided to take the opportunity to get some fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf only she would put half as much effort into her studies as she does her weapon,\u201d Weiss continued to rant. \u201cShe could easily become a prime example of what a team leader should be.\u201d Her footsteps faltered when she saw something sparkle in the sunlight. \u201cAre people leaving junk out here? Why can\u2019t they throw stuff away like a proper person?\u201d As she drew nearer, the object became clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why is this out here?</i> Weiss thought. <i>What possible reason would someone bring a remote out this far.</i> She reached down and picked it up, briefly noting a folded up piece of paper under it. The remote was unlike any other remote she had seen before. Instead of letters or numbers on the buttons, there were pictures. One looked like a t-shirt, another an arm, a third had a rough outline of a body. The rest of the buttons were designed in similar fashions. Not sure what its use was for, she unfolded the piece of paper and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your Guide to the Swapping Remote</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d Weiss stated at the stupidity of the information before her. \u201cSo someone bought this piece of junk and threw it away when they found out it didn\u2019t work? This is something Ruby or that dunce Arc would do.\u201d She spun the remote in one hand while her eyes skimmed the note. \u201cStill, this instructional guide seems to be a little more detailed than a normal prank should be.\u201d Suspicion conflicted with common sense. \u201cI could just test it out for the hell of it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss glanced around the school grounds, trying to reconcile the thoughts bouncing around her head. All logic and common sense dictated that there was no way something like this could work. Coming from Atlas, she was very familiar with the latest technology, and nothing even remotely close to this had ever been developed. However, the instruction manual was so detailed, and the remote so meticulously crafted, that her curiosity couldn't help but be piqued. That was the only reason she hadn't bothered to simply throw this away like the trash it was yet. The longer she stood contemplating, though, the more the other students nearby would find it odd that she was just standing around holding a TV remote. She didn't exactly want her fellow classmates to think her strange, and especially didn't want to leave a bad impression on the students visiting for the Vytal Festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, clearing her thoughts. \"This is ridiculous,\" she mumbled to herself. \"Something like this could never work.\" She decided to simply humour her curiosity quickly before tossing it. There was no sense trying to plan something out for searching for a target. There were enough students milling about that she could just point the remote at one of them and press a button. Despite not believing that the remote would actually work, Weiss at least had the sense to try something small. A body part swap should suffice. She didn't particularly care what part swapped, seeing as the remote was clearly a farce anyway, and she didn't see the worth in taking yet more time out of her day to decide on which part of herself she'd be willing to hypothetically swap away. She'd recognise whether it was or wasn't working all the same. And so, as she began to walk over to the nearest trash can, Weiss pointed the remote at a nearby crowd of students and pressed the button for a body part swap, and selected a random option, not bothering to pay attention to what she'd selected or who she'd targeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat part did she inadvertently end up selecting?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss' finger pressed down on the button the moment she reached the trash can, and as she did, she immediately stopped dead in her tracks. Not because she was about to throw the remote away, but because she could tell something was wrong. Something was very wrong. Something that would stop her from throwing it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shaky hand, she slowly reached up to the top of her head, eyes wide in panic. Her hand recoiled as her fingers brushed against something furry. Gathering what confidence hadn't fled her, she sent her fingers back in, taking hold of the furry mass. She couldn't just feel it grasped between her fingers, she could also feel her fingers pressing against it, as if it were a part of her. Easing her hand up it, she found it to be somewhat thin, but very long. Once she reached the tip, show slowing lowered her hand once more, pulling whatever this furry thing was into view. If Weiss' eyes could get any wider than they already were, they did just that as she saw what it was she was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinched between her fingers was the tip of a fluffy, brown rabbit's ear. Not only that, she could tell from the sensations her body was giving her that it wasn't just some random prop ear that had somehow wound up on her head, it was a part of her. Somehow, she had sprouted a pair of rabbit ears from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss's grip loosened as the colour drained from her face, allowing the ear to spring back up next to its partner. \"Impossible...\" she mumbled. Against all laws of science and reality, the remote had worked. Considering she'd selected a body part swap, she surmised that she must have selected \"ears\", and she must have targeted a faunus, resulting in swapping not only their normal human ears, but also the animal ears they possessed. As the shock of the situation slowly began to wear off, Weiss realised just how much louder everything sounded now that she possessed two sets of ears. In fact, her ears twitched slightly as she picked up a nearby conversation, a conversation involving the person she guessed was her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the source of the noise, Weiss saw the second year team, Team CFVY, seemingly having just come back from town, engaged in conversation. Their conversation wasn't what Weiss was paying attention to, however. Something was very clearly missing from this picture. Velvet, the lone faunus of the team, was present amongst the group, but what wasn't present were her ears. The long, brown rabbit ears that usually sat atop her head were missing, and Weiss knew why. Velvet must have been the person she'd accidentally targeted. She seemed none the wiser, as did the rest of her team. It was as if she'd never had those ears to begin with. In fact, the same seemed to hold true for Weiss herself. Looking around, no one seemed to be looking at her strangely, as if she'd always had these rabbit ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... This is incredible. How...?\" Weiss was at a loss for words. She looked down at the remote in her hand. There was certainly no way she could trash it now that she knew it worked, but in place of her scepticism, she now found her head full of all sorts of questions. Who made this remote? Why did they leave it there in the courtyard? How was anything it did possible? She had a feeling, however, that she'd never get the answers to those questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, though, was the question of what to do next. Glancing back up again, Weiss felt the colour drain from her face again as she realised her accidental target had disappeared; Team CFVY had retreated inside the building, out of Weiss' view. Instead of rushing after them, however, Weiss managed to keep a cool  head and think things through carefully. The remote accounted for situations like these. Verifying her memory, she checked the manual again, a small smile appearing as she got to the part about the undo and reset buttons. She could give Velvet her ears back and de-faunus-ify herself whenever she wanted to. Speaking of which, she wasn't sure how this swap would affect the rest of her life. Her parents were both human before the swap, so was she a faunus with different parents now, or was she still considered a human, but with rabbit ears? Perhaps that was worth exploring. Alternatively, now that she had tested the remote first hand, there was no longer any question of whether it worked or not. She could perform any sort of swap she wanted, so long as it was detailed in the manual, and there were still plenty of targets nearby.</span></div></div>",

She blushed at the feeling but reveled in her new power. With this remote she could be perfect. At least that\u2019s what she thought. As she looked around she didn\u2019t see any traits she wanted from anyone else so she moved back to her room but her massive boobs made it hard.

I mean this can't work, right?\" She thought. She contemplated using it before her curiosity got the better of her. She pointed the remote at Pyrrha and pressed body swap. In a flash she saw her body wearing Pyrrha's armor walking back to the dorms with team JNPR. Her eyes shift down as she now had Pyrrha's athletic and powerful body. Instinctively her hands grabbed the large breast she now had, a rush of pleasure washed over her. She quickly let go and felt her new facial features and hair. She turned her action back to Pyrrha who was still walking with her team, unfazed by her new body. Ruby pointed the remote back to her and pressed body part swap and hair. In a flash she saw her old body with Pyrrha's red ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible\" She said as she ran a hand down her torso. She held the remote close to her new chest and kept looking around. \"I can't believe Weiss would just drop this\" She exclaimed as she stood up. Her first steps were a bit wobbly but her body quickly adjusted. She confidently walked back to her room stopping every so often to see admire her reflection. </span></div></div>",

Something was wrong, Something was deathly wrong. Her body refusing to move, her eyes slowly drifted down, gazing down at her body. Nothing looked out of place, her outfit hiding everything, but she could definitely feel it. Something underneath her skirt felt very wrong. As if on auto pilot, her free hand slowly drifted down towards her crotch, but the moment it reached its destination, it recoiled back up to her chest, her pale face turning beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was close to hyperventilating. \"This isn't possible. This isn't possible,\" she whispered to herself, continuing to glare at her crotch. Against all logic and common sense, the remote worked, and she was suddenly deeply regretting not paying attention to who she was targeting, or what she was swapping. \"I... I have a...\" She couldn't even bring herself to say it. She couldn't be completely certain without properly inspecting it in private, but as far as she could tell, nestled between her legs, straining against her panties, was a fully functioning set of male genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her eyes away from where her new equipment sat, Weiss looked over in the direction she'd pointed the remote, scanning the crowd. There were several men within the group she'd pointed the remote at, and none of them seemed to be acting out of the ordinary. It was just as the manual had described. Despite the fact that, presumably, one of them was walking around with Weiss' vagina between their legs, they all continued to go about their business as normal as if nothing had changed. On one hand, that was great; the remote worked as advertised, no matter how many rules of reality it was breaking, and no one would be able to call her out on what was being done. On the other hand, though, this left her completely unable to tell who it was she'd swapped with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock had worn off somewhat, but now the panic was well and truly setting in. She stood with her legs a little further apart than usual, hoping to stop her new parts from pressing against her legs, as she scanned the crowd, searching for some way to tell who it was that was walking off with her parts. This was a completely nonsensical scenario that by all means should have been impossible, but thanks to the remote, it was happening; she had literally lost her vagina. Unfortunately, from this distance, there was no real way to tell which of the men lacked a bulge in their pants, and getting closer would give some of them time to leave. If she targeted another man in the crowd, she'd just end up with a penis all over again, only someone else's this time. There had to be something she could do, surely. She couldn't just be stuck like this. There were other girls around, maybe she could swap genitals with them. It'd give her the proper parts downstairs, even if it wasn't really her's, but was it truly right to force one of the other girls to have a penis for the rest of their life, even if they didn't realise anything was wrong? Perhaps she should simply accept her fate. She had messed around with such advanced technology without taking it seriously, maybe this was just the price she had to pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if Weiss hadn't been in so much of a panic over the new package in her panties, perhaps she'd have remembered that the remote had an undo button for situations such as these.</span></div></div>",

There was velvet who sat cross the table from coco, and finally, there was yang, who is currently waking over to talk with coco and velvet at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile standing in a corner of the courtyard, Weiss was thinking who she should swap genitals with? \"I kinda like coco and velvet a lot as friend but yang\"? Weiss said. Maybe. While she was thinking about it, Weiss came up with an answer, \"I think I'll go with yang genitals. Besides, it would be kinda funny to see yang with a cock instead of a vagina for a set of genitals and besides, I would love to see how yangs pussy will feel tonight\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for the perfect moment, Weiss decides to point the remote at yang who is currently standing near the table starting up a conversation with coco and velvet. Out of nowhere Weiss decides now is the time to use the remote on yang. Without any pressure, Weiss points and  pushes the genitals swap button on the remote as a green bean shoot strait towards yangs genitals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a green smoke had cleared away, Weiss noticed something different about herself, she notice that she doesn't feel any more of the boys genitals in her downside. Instead, she feels a big giant vagina in its place. \" this is amazing\" she says with stars in her eyes. I finally have girl parts again\". Weiss notice looking across the courtyard, yang somehow doesn't notice that she has boy genitals now, she is still having conversation with coco and velvet while when looking down at her lower area, Weiss can see a bulge in her black shorts where her original girls genitals used to be. After what Weiss saw, yang decides to held back up to the dorm room where the rest of Team RWBY is. \" I wondered if I show the rest of Team RWBY the remote i found and swap the others genitals as with myself or should I return to the room and play with my new vagina.\" Weiss said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Weiss do?</span></div></div>",

Much closer to Weiss's original vagina although Ruby was still a virgin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Weiss traded that vagina for Blake's.

She straightened out her dress and calmly walked to the door with remote in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to head out for a little bit, does anyone need anything?\" Weiss asked to no response from her team: Ruby and Blake sat quietly on their beds reading while Yang was getting ready to go workout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shut the door as turned towards team JNPR's room, she saw Pyrrha and Nora leave the room, talking to each other about class. As Weiss passed the two she was tempted to swap with them but her desire for a dick told her not to. Once the girls were gone she stopped in front of door and peered through the crack. She could see Jaune and Ren sitting across from each other talking, but she couldn't make out what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"let's go with Vomit Boy first.\" Weiss cooed as she pointed the remote at Jaune and pressed the body part swap button. In a flash she noticed the eerily familiar weight and sensation of having something between her legs. She shifted her stance slight to accommodate for it. Peering through again she noticed that Jaune was sitting with his legs together in a more feminine manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked around to ensure the hallway was clear before lifting her dress to see her white panties barely containing her new member, but before she knew it, it start to stiffen. Her face flushed red as she watched it grow, coming out her the panties. She let her dress fall down to only notice the tent it was forming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible but let's see what Ren is packing\" She sheepishly spoke touching the protruding fabric.

Even without seeing it, it felt that it was tight to much of her surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door to find Ruby and Blake still reading on their beds while Yang played on her scroll, most likely forgoing the gym. She proceeded to her desk and thought about what she could take from her teammates. The only thing she knew she was going to leave was her new vagina. After a few minutes the urge to swap was hitting Weiss like a ton of bricks. She hadn't figured out what she wanted to swap but she wanted to so badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a small swap, just to hold me over until I can think of a swap for everyone\" Weiss thought as she turned around and discretely pointing the remote at Blake. It was a fairly easy swap since the whole room was preoccupied with other things. Weiss exhaled was she pressed the race swap button. In a flash, Weiss could hear everything, even though the room was predominantly silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight and pressure of swapping died down so she could think clearly about what she wanted from each teammate. She knew she had to act once she started swapping. Before she could start swapping she had to get a good look at herself. She stood up and went to the bathroom, locking the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in front of the mirror and stared at her reflection. Not much was different except for the snow white cat ears on top of her head. A cute smile formed on her face as the ears started to wiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool. But I think it's time to get a better look at Pyrrha's pussy. or should I say my pussy.\" Weiss said under her breathe before turning her attention to her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her dress and pulled her panties down slightly to relieve a vagina with a red landing strip. The cute smile formed into a devious one as her hand drifted towards her vagina. Slowly she started to rub it as she placed a hand over her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several minutes she quietly pleasured herself in the bathroom, exploring the feeling and differences from Pyrrha's vagina compared to her own. Afterwards she pulled up her panties and left the bathroom, sitting at her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who to swap with first\" She thought holding the remote tight.</span></div></div>",

The public bathroom or locker room weren\u2019t going to be much better, as people could enter there freely. The thing was Weiss HAD to see what happened which required revealing her nether regions. Her vagina was gone and there was a large bulging package between her legs. This had to be observed. The only good option was her room and she hoped to the gods it was empty.

When she changed with her team, she kept to herself and avoided having her eyes wander. There had never been a chance to see a guy\u2019s package except in biology books.

Her white underwear covered most of it but it the budge was growing and the fabric was straining against her member. The sight of it only caused the bulge to grow faster. Weiss was getting turned on by this, even as she was simultaneously disgusted. Her legs shifted apart more to prevent touching her new accessory. Her underwear was becoming incredibly uncomfortable and she didn\u2019t have a choice. Using her other hand, she pulled it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slammed shut and she dropped her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote had given her a full penis and balls. She could feel the weight dangling between her legs, along with the heat it was giving off. Every movement caused it to flop around forcing Weiss to hold perfectly skill.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Weiss slowly calmed down, her gaze drifted back downwards. Her skirt his everything for now, but she could still feel it there, and she was pretty sure it was still standing to attention. That couldn't be arousal, right? There was no way this was turning her on. No, it must have a mind of it's own. At least, that was what she was telling herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she tried to pull herself together, she ultimately could do nothing but shake her head. \"I can't do this,\" she told herself. \"Not yet, at least.\" As much as she wished to avoid it, Weiss knew she couldn't avoid her new genitals forever. Unless she swapped them away to someone else with the remote, she'd be forced to confront it eventually. She just couldn't handle it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the remote, though, she knew it worked now thanks to her admittedly careless test. There was so much she could do with it, and no one would be the wiser, so long as she kept it a secret. Sure, things could definitely go wrong with it, as her current situation was evidence to, but as long as she was careful, there was no reason she couldn't use it a bit more. Of course, there was one thing that needed to be taken of first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down ever so slowly so as to not disturb the new anatomy between her legs, Weiss carefully reached down to retrieve her panties from around her ankles. Up they went, hesitating for a moment before they reached her crotch. Thankfully, her unintentional erection seemed to have calmed down a bit by now, and she was able to cram her junk into her panties without too much issue, though her face was still bright red by the time she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit tight,\" she mumbled, caught between wanting to adjust her underwear to be more comfortable and not wanting to disturb it any further. Theoretically, she could simply swap her newly acquired penis to someone else if she wanted, however Weiss couldn't help but feel that would be unfair to whoever she swapped with. Why should they have to suffer because of her mistake? Sure, they wouldn't exactly be suffering, as they'd never know the difference, but she still didn't think it was right to force a penis onto someone else. No, she'd just have to get used to this for now. It could be her reminder to be more careful with the remote in future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, just because she was forcing herself to keep her penis, that didn't mean she couldn't do anything about it. Surely there must be some way to make her new package more comfortable. Perhaps she could use the remote to borrow someone else's underwear, just to make it not so cramped down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the logical side of her brain was telling her she didn't have time for such frivolities. She had a reality altering remote, capable of performing seemingly impossible feats. She needed to carefully experiment to test exactly how it worked and what its limitations were, and meticulously document the results for future use. Sure, the manual described the functions well enough, but she couldn't be sure of exactly how everything would play out. Certain options held some level of ambiguity, and it wasn't clear how certain swaps would interact with each other when both were in effect. There was much to discover, provided she went about it the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, after her earlier mistake, Weiss was a little hesitant to do anything with the remote by herself. What if she messed up again and got herself into an even more unfavourable situation? Perhaps it would be to her advantage to tell someone else about the remote, and have them join in with whatever she ended up using the remote for. That way she;d have someone to reel her back if things got out of hand, or to pull her out of a situation she couldn't save herself from. Although, as she thought about the people she knew here at Beacon, perhaps that wasn't the best idea. For all she knew, some of them would only end up getting her into more trouble than she was already in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss let out a small sigh. As much as she knew she should be methodically testing the remote to figure out all its intricacies, her mind kept jumping back to the uncomfortable feeling in her skirt. She couldn't properly test things out if she was constantly being distracted by her genitals. She had to do something about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what? There was, of course, the most obvious solution, swapping genitals with another girl to reclaim the proper parts, but she had already discarded that option. It simply didn't feel right to force this upon someone, even if they wouldn't realise anything had changed. She could also have temporarily swapped it away so she could focus on her testing for now, but considering she was unlikely to figure out where her original genitals were now, she figured she should probably learn to get used to it instead of trading it away whenever it became distracting. There was, of course, a much simpler solution to all this, but in all her panic and embarrassment, Weiss had yet to realise that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss tapped her foot as she considered how exactly to deal with this. She would have been pacing if not for the very package she was trying to deal with. She did her best not to think about it though; thinking about it might cause it harden again, and that'd just make her underwear even tighter. Dealing with said underwear would be a fairly good option, seeing as it was the reason her junk was so cramped in the first place. She did rather like her own wardrobe, but perhaps someone else's would better fit her now, though she only really needed to swap underwear for the desired effect if she didn't want anything else from them. Of course, this would probably mean swapping with another boy, but perhaps she could find a girl whose underwear would fit her better than her own, considering her reasonably small curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an issue with this plan, though. Her underwear being so tight was what was keeping her junk in place. If she removed said underwear, or in this case made it less tight, she was sure it'd be flopping about again. That was far from ideal. Perhaps there were other aspects she could tackle instead. For example, her stride on the way up here had been rather awkward. She had been desperately trying to avoid her new equipment pressing up against the inside of her legs, mostly in vain. That couldn't be a problem all men experienced, right? Perhaps their anatomy allowed them to walk about without it pressing against them, perhaps in their hips or legs. Theoretically she could borrow those parts from someone for the time being so she could walk around without feeling it up against her. That might also help with how cramped it was, as it wouldn't be pressed between her legs anymore. Unfortunately, that did mean swapping with a guy again, and while it might help with her junk, she wasn't sure she liked the idea of having to deal with even more guy parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one more thing that came to mind, but Weiss wasn't entirely sure it would work, given how abstract it was; personality or personal info. With the right selections, perhaps there was a way for her to swap the way she felt about her genitals with someone else. If she swapped with a guy, that would sort everything out completely, as it should, in theory, make her comfortable with the idea of having a penis. The thought that the remote might be able to trick her brain into being fine with having a penis was a little scary, but rather appealing given she didn't know when, if ever, she'd get her old parts back. That said, this option wasn't flawless either. After all, while she wasn't forcing someone to live with the incorrect genitals, she would arguably be doing something worse. The remote could only swap, and making herself more comfortable with male genitalia meant forcing her uncomfortableness onto someone else. Weiss also wasn't sure how the remote handled making everything normal. If she had to guess, she would have assumed that the remote had made it so she'd always had a penis, rather than making everyone accept that she'd just acquired one. That raised some questions about this potential swap. Theoretically, whoever she swapped with would have lived their entire life being uncomfortable with their own genitals, so would that change anything else about them retroactively, or would they only begin to act upon that uncomfortableness now that they'd actually acquired it. It was almost enough for Weiss to want to test it out, despite the immoral implications. The main thing holding her back was that she was unsure just how easy it would be to get them back to normal if a retroactive change was made. Would swapping back turn them back to normal, or would it just give them back their comfortableness with male genitals and keep the changes made?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of what she decided to do, though, Weiss knew she needed to be more careful about this. She couldn't just go swapping willy-nilly. Rummaging around her desk, she managed to find an empty notepad and a pencil, and tucked them into her pocket with the remote. That way she could keep track of all the swaps she made, and what order she made them in, so she could put everything back to normal when she was done. Well, as normal as things could possibly be given her initial mistake. Of course, there was no sense putting in so much time mulling over what she was going to swap when she didn't have anyone to swap with. For the time being, she'd go ahead and leave the room and figure out what she was going to do while she searched for a target. Thus, Weiss headed over to the door, grimacing slightly as she felt her new parts squirming within their confines, and stepped out into the hallway again, her mind focused on the pros and cons of each option. As the walked through the halls of Beacon, glancing around at the potential targets on offer, she ultimately decided to go with a...</span></div></div>",

Looking up, Ruby and Jaune didn\u2019t notice her. \u201cOkay, maybe a slight modification is in order. This can be Arc\u2019s way of apologizing for all those pathetic courting rituals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss swapped genitals back with Jaune so she had the average size ones. She then swapped that with Ruby and was briefly distracted with the unusual sensation of having a pussy. It was short live as she swapped with Jaune. Even with the dick being much larger and straining her underwear, it felt natural. She couldn\u2019t wait to see what an erection was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Ruby had a skirt, Weiss couldn\u2019t\u2019 see any change, so she would worry about that later. She turned and briskly walked away, determined to find Yang first. Her desire to feel Arc\u2019s manhood between her legs was distracting, but she managed it. Discipline was something her father had stressed in her when she was young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of looking, Weiss looked out of the window and saw Yang out back, walking Zwei away from the main building so Glynda Goodwitch wouldn\u2019t see her. Weiss quickly raced outside and glanced around for a perfect target for Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her delight, her original swap idea was there. Professor Peter Port was lecturing Cardin about something. The old man\u2019s manhood would probably be wrinkly and ugly. That gave Weiss a second target, Cardin the Bully. He probably never washed his crotch and Yang would be stuck with it. Both were good option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she got a devious idea in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote did work on animals and Zwei was with Yang. Could she dare to do that? Yang with a dog dick?

That would raise some questions that she didn't really want to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, no one seems to notice, or at least care enough to notice something odd was going on. While Weiss was certain that, given how no one had really seemed to react to the changes that everyone would at least think that she had always had the monster in her panties, they would think that having an erection at school would be somewhat questionable, at least to Weiss. She had personally never noticed anyone in Beacon walk around with an erection, though she didn't make a habit of at looking at peoples groins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the form quietly, looking to see if any of her team had arrived in the interim. None of them had though that wasn't much of a surprise, Blake was usually at the library for at least one more hour, Ruby hung around Jaune so much it had started to make Weiss suspect that her team leader saw her her fellow team leader as more than just a good friend, and judging where Yang was, she wouldn't be finished walking Zwei for another half hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave Weiss plenty of time to experiment with her new equipment. She entered the bathroom, locking the door behind her so that none of her team could walk in and see her in the act of stimulating herself. She removed her shoes, and placed them neatly to the side, feeling the erection against her stomach as she bent down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss then grabbed both sides of her panties and pulled them down. As she removed the constraints on her genitals, the erection popped up to stick out from her, making a significant bulge in her skirt and her balls dangling down. Pulling her stick up to get a good look, her penis stood out probably about as far as physical possible for a body of her size could, the glans being nearly a foot distant from the rest of her body. If made her wonder just how Jaune kept this thing hidden from everyone, she was fairly certain that if Pyrrha had saw just how large it was, she would have been extremely blunt and forward about her feelings towards Jaune. Weiss did wonder how those would be affected now that both of them had vaginas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing back on the task at had, Weiss took her penis in her hand, which wasn't large enough to fit around the entire girth of it, and started to stroke up and down. The pleasure was different to that which she had on the few occasions that she had masturbated with a vagina but she wasn't going to make a determination if one was better or worse, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to see this through to the end, she started stroking more fervently, an urge rising as she did so. The urge to ejaculate. The urge made her almost hungry to let go and shoot her load into the toilet building more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climax was something different in just how it felt, the erection twitching as streams of white liquid shot out into the bowl of the toilet. As soon as the dick was done firing off, she felt the erection start to go limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing slightly heavily, Weiss prepared to clean up and put her clothes back on only to be interrupted by a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

While Weiss was convinced she didn't need a childish toy to reach perfection, she couldn't help but think of people who excelled in everything she lacked. And right on cue, one of those people walked by: Pyrrha Nikos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yang would've been more satisfying, Pyrrha was someone Weiss had her eyes on even before Beacon, and it was easy to see why. She was tall, stunning, and perhaps the best combatant in Beacon despite being a first year. Weiss, while graceful and talented, was barely taller than Ruby despite the age gap, likely wasn't much better in terms of bust, and nearly got beaten by a boarbatusk because of small distractions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious smirk found its way on the heiress' face. She could see it now, her with Pyrrha's body and life. Everything she ever wanted; The skill, the fame, the beauty, leading her own tea-.... Weiss' fingers slowly lifted themselves from the two buttons on the remote. Even if she was just pretending, taking on Pyrrha's life wouldn't mean being lead by the admittedly competent dolt, Ruby, but the complete mess of a huntsman that was Jaune Arc. That in itself reminded her that Jaune's only knowledge of the prodigy was her Pumpkin Pete sponsorship, and Weiss wasn't sure that was the fame she wanted. No, in fact, she wanted to prestige for her family, so taking up Pyrrha's entire life would be counter productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting more thought than necessary into the thought exercise, Weiss concluded that she'd only take Pyrrha's body, skills, semblance, and weapon... and her clothes too. While Weiss wished to keep her clothes, she doubted they'd match the aesthetic of the amazonian Pyrrha. At least she was wearing a combat skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss held the remote gently, taking aim from around a nearby corner. If anyone saw her playing like this, her team would never let her live it down. No one was in the way, Pyrrha had her back to her, it was now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a click of four buttons, Weiss was blinded by the resulting flash, but she could tell immediately that something had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes were different. No longer were they of a light fabric, but of durable armor. The amazing part was how light it all was. Even with Milo and Akouo strapped to her back, it felt like she could run a couple miles and still have the energy to stay awake in Port's rambling lectures. Looking down, Weiss was greeted with Pyrrha's sizable breasts. Impulsively grabbing them, Weiss gasped as a wave of pleasure permeated her body. She let go quickly, but couldn't help but want to around with what didn't belong to her. When else would she have breasts like this? Her gloved fingers ran up and down Pyrrha's muscular body. <i>Her body</i>. It was her body currently. Her incredible breasts, her toned legs, and her incredible figure. And that wasn't all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote lay on the floor, abandoned during Weiss' self experimentation.

Weiss was jumped, not expecting to be confronted by Pyrraha, in Weiss' old body no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyrrha! Hey... there.\" Weiss was horrible under pressure but the sudden change in voice had caught her further off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Weiss? You don't quite seem yourself today.\"</span></div></div>",

She quickly shook it off and took another look at her new body. \"I feel so incredible\" She thought running a hand along her chest, and torso.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Weiss was contemplating what to do with the remote, a group of people began to approach. Not wanting to be seen holding the remote or risk being caught trying to throw it away and littering, she pocketed the device along with the instructions in one fluid movement before heading back to the dorms. The entire time, she was thinking about what to do with it. Even if it was a joke prop, the temptation to at least try it once secretly was too great to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was going to use it and she was set on using it just to prevent any lingering thoughts on what could have been, she wanted the right target. It had to be something noticeable and preferably on someone she knew. This was to cover her bases in case the remote magically worked yet had some problem, like the other person realizing the swap. That was the reason she was heading back to the dorm. Her teammates would be the perfect targets. She did want to avoid Ruby finding the remote. Her partner wouldn\u2019t be able to contain herself around something like this and cause all sorts of problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the room, the only other occupant waved to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSup, Weiss?\u201d Yang greeted her, packing a gym bag with a water bottle and a change of clothes. As she was still wearing her Beacon uniform, Weiss concluded she was planning to change in the locker rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHitting the gym?\u201d Weiss asked, putting her own bag down at her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it.\u201d Yang flipped her hair back over her shoulder. \u201cNora and I are having a contest to see who can bench press more. She\u2019s strong, but I\u2019m pretty sure I can take her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026cultured.\u201d Weiss barely hid her obvious distaste of something so barbaric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should come and watch,\u201d Yang suggested. \u201cI need someone to cheer me on. Nora will get some of her team to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, but I\u2019ll pass this time,\u201d Weiss replied, sitting down. \u201cWhat about Blake or Ruby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake is hiding somewhere reading her smut books,\u201d Yang answered. \u201cWhile Ruby is hanging out with Jaune reading comic books or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow childish,\u201d Weiss commented. \u201cThey are supposed to be leaders of our team. Studying or training would be more beneficial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t machines,\u201d Yang told her, crossing her arms. \u201cYou have to have fun once in a while. When\u2019s the last time you did something fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have fun learning,\u201d Weiss snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNerd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter than being a brute or a child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot going to say Ruby doesn\u2019t act like a kid now and then,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see she\u2019s still the same even after coming to Beacon two years early.\u201d A grin formed on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s still funny that she thinks drinking milk means she\u2019s an adult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you gave her that idea,\u201d Weiss said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might have.\u201d Yang shrugged yet was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cBesides, you could stand to drink some more milk. If you know what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d This was a lie and the cold expression on Weiss\u2019s face revealed her true thoughts as she turned to face Yang. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you explain it to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know~,\u201d Yang sung, throwing her gym bag over her shoulders. As she straightened up, she deliberately used her free arm to prop up her well-endowed chest to make it stand out even more. A vein in Weiss\u2019 head throbbed and she reached for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is the perfect target,</i> she thought. <i>It\u2019s now or never.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAs Yang turned toward the door, Weiss hit the Body Part Swap option and there was a flash of green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019s mouth fell open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her viewpoint, Yang\u2019s chest deflated instantly to an almost unnoticeable size. Weiss didn\u2019t have large breasts, she accepted that. Compared to Yang, she was pretty much flat. Now, Yang barely had any bumps pushing out her uniform. Weiss, on the other hand, was now feeling the weight of two heavy mounds threatening to pull her forward. Before Weiss could say anything, Yang stopped and turned to her with a hand on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, Weiss Cream,\u201d Yang said. \u201cEven though you\u2019re short, you got an awesome rack.\u201d She slapped her butt. \u201cBest thing I can do is make a chiseled booty men would die for. If Blake stops by, tell her I want to meet for dinner around 6:30.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do,\u201d Weiss replied automatically, her mind still stunned at what just happened. The second the door closed behind Yang, Weiss bolted toward the mirror to examine herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reflection looked normal except now her chest had two amazing breasts. They looked a little unusual on her smaller frame then on Yang, but they still fit. What was even more amazing was her clothes adjusted to fit her new assets. The clothes Weiss was wearing now was just her Beacon uniform. The shirt and bra she had was not made for Yang\u2019s breasts. Yet, they adjusted to fit the second the swap was made. Weiss jump a little and felt her new breasts bounce up and down. Even if the size changed, her strapless bra was not designed to support a lot of weight. She would have to change. As she did so, ideas flashed through her mind on what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What should I do next?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was somewhat of a perfectionist and her brain immediately began to think of how to proceed. She needed to be systematic in her swaps to test out each of the functions. As she dug through her dresser for a bra with a strap, her mind was already running through ideas. Everything stopped when she pulled out one of her favorite bras, a silver lace one with shoulder straps. This time the cups were much, much larger than they had been before. It seems all her clothing had adjusted. Weiss smiled and quickly changed out of her strapless one. Yang\u2019s, well, her new breasts now were heavy. Weiss had no doubt she would be getting tired of the weight at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil then, why not show them off a bit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adjusted her current dress a little so the top of her new chest was clearly on display. Smiling to herself, she posed in front of the mirror, placing an arm under her breasts to push them up. It was one of Yang\u2019s favorite positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, they might be a little big for my frame,\u201d Weiss said softly. \u201cPyrrha\u2019s or Blake\u2019s would be a better fit, but there\u2019s plenty of time to mix and match. For not, let\u2019s see what else this device can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several different swaps she could try out. Limiting her options, she decided to avoid another Body Part Swap until she tested out the others. Body Swap was also crossed off for now, due to being too similar. That left Wardrobe, Life, Personality, and Personal Info Swaps available. Each had pros and cons, something Weiss began to write down in her notebook. Carefully weighing her options and choosing the best course of action was how she liked to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardrobe Swap was perhaps the safest bet. Clothing was a simple swap compared to life or intangible things, like names and personality. The downside was Weiss\u2019s clothing was all top of the line expensive goods. No one else in Beacon would have anything similar in value, except maybe Pyrrha and Coco. There was a chance whoever she swapped with would ruin her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife Swap was the next choice. From what the instructions described, she would remain the same appearance except would be living the life or the target and them her. She would be in their clothes and everyone would see her as them. Part of her wanted to see if swaps beforehand were affected by the Life Swap and what would occur after. The downside was she didn\u2019t know if she could act like someone else. The instructions said she would be able to understand how to act like the target, but it didn\u2019t explain it in details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality Swap was a risky but intriguing option. Weiss\u2019s teammates kept telling her she needed to have some more fun and just relax, but that wasn\u2019t like her. She wanted to work hard and stay ahead. Maybe swapping with someone would let her see the appeal of having time to goof off and discover a hobby. The risk was she may not want to swap back. She didn\u2019t know the full extent of what that swap would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Personal Info had the most choices, as she could theoretically swap anything she could imagine. Names, weapons, race, positions, occupations, intelligence, pretty much everything not listed in previous swaps was on the table. The risk was written down in a small subsection beneath the main instructions. It warned that some Personal Info Swaps could cause reality to alter in unforeseeable ways. Users needed to be careful. This sounded ominous with a device already capable of alternating reality and memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss examined her notes and finally decided which swap she wanted to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can buy pretty much any female clothes I want and it\u2019s not like I want to wear boys\u2019 clothes. Life sounds interesting, but I\u2019ll save that for later when one of my teammates show up. I want to observe how they act as me. So that only leaves personality or personal information. I am curious about how reality would change with these swaps.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, she really needed to find a target. The exactly swap could be decided then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss walked over to the window and looked out over Beacon\u2019s courtyard. A good number of students were heading out to the city. Among them were two familiar faces. The first was her teammate Ruby. The short black haired girl stood out with her red and black gothic style dress. Next to her was Jaune Arc, a tall blonde scraggly boy who got on Weiss\u2019s nerves constantly. He couldn\u2019t take a hint that she wasn\u2019t interested in him romantically and kept asking her out in so many cheesy ways. He was wearing typical jeans and a black hoody. Weiss had no idea what they were planning, but it was obvious they were heading to Vale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably going to pick up the new issue of the comic book or something,\u201d Weiss muttered. How they could like that trash was beyond her. Blake may have had some\u2026 exotic tastes\u2026 but she had least read adult books without pictures. Her eyes narrowed as the two of them laughed about something and seemed to be enjoying themselves. Something Yang said echoed in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have to have fun once in a while.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss glanced down at her now sizable rack and smiled. Her very first swap had been\u2026 fun. Perhaps a little more was in order. Her eyes fell onto Ruby again and she made up her mind. There was nothing she wanted to swap with Jaune. Ruby would at least return to their room and Weiss could observe how they both had changed with the swap. As Ruby and Jaune continued to move further away, Weiss didn\u2019t have long to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Personality Swap might allow Weiss to have some fun. Ruby always found entertainment in the weirdest activities. This was an opportunity to understand the appeal in such trivial things. Her own perfectionist lifestyle always held her back. It might be interesting. A Personal Info Swap was the other option. It could be something small like a name to something larger like friends. Weiss didn\u2019t necessarily want to hang out with Jaune, but maybe he would act differently if he saw Weiss as a nonromantic friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was just what Weiss was like and until she squashed the nagging feeling in the back of her head, she wouldn\u2019t want to press the button. Personality shouldn\u2019t swap intelligence, so Weiss believed she would be able to tell what was different.

The desire to have everything perfect was gone. A weight had been lifted off her shoulders. Weiss shook her head and looked around. Things were still the same physically, but seemed different. Her eyes fell onto her desk and there was no desire to complete her homework. She knew she could do it later. Her gaze then fell to her dresser drawer, still open from when she changed bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really should get some more variety in colors,</i> Weiss thought to herself. <i>Maybe some darker ones, like red or black.</i> Out of nowhere her stomach growled. She opened her desk to look for a snack, but the health bar she kept stored there did not look appetizing. <i>I\u2019m sure Ruby wouldn\u2019t mind if I borrowed a cookie or two.</i> Ruby kept a stash in her desk, something Weiss was familiar with as Ruby ate them all the time and even offered her some before. Weiss opened Ruby\u2019s desk and rummaged around in the back, to pull out a box of chocolate chip cookies. She popped one into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box was only about half full, but a few minutes later it was empty and Weiss realized what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby\u2019s going to be upset with me,\u201d Weiss realized. \u201cMaybe if I act innocent, she will think someone else took it.\u201d She rubbed her chin. \u201cI could say I was working on a new attachment with Myrtenaster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her unusual actions dawned on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desire to procrastinate, her change in color preference, the desire for sweets, and wanting to upgrade her weapon were all part of Ruby\u2019s personality. Weiss forced herself to stand still and think, even though she wanted to run off in excitement. Her intelligence hadn\u2019t been swapped so thinking this through was possible. She could remember being her old self up to the point where she had swapped with Ruby. Her originals likes and dislikes were accessible. Now, everything she did before just seemed boring. Just taking notes felt like a drag. Because this wasn\u2019t a Personal Info Swap, reality didn\u2019t seem to adjust to their new personalities. Everyone should just believe they were always like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh.\u201d Weiss chuckled. \u201cThis is kind of fun. Yang was actually right. No one should notice the sudden change, so I can take the day off and goof around.\u201d She held up the remote. \u201cMaybe do some more swaps.

It was an amazing toy she could do whatever she wanted with and no one would know unless she wanted them too. Everything could even be reset if she messed up. There was no drawback whatsoever. Sure, Weiss knew deep down these feelings were part of Ruby\u2019s personality, but she felt so free. Plus, her one inadequate part of her body had been changed when she stole Yang\u2019s boobs. Weiss pocketed the remote and left the room, looking for her next target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeacon seemed somehow grander to Weiss as she made her way through the hallways, even though she has traveled the halls countless time. She couldn\u2019t believe she managed to make it into one of the most prestigious schools in the world. She passed several students, but none of them stood out. The library where Weiss spent most of her free time didn\u2019t look appealing in the slightest unless she was looking for Blake. She passed the dining hall where a few people were enjoying an early dinner. It wasn\u2019t nearly as loud or excitable as it normally was. There was no one Weiss really knew there yet except Cardin and his team. No way was Weiss going to swap with bullies like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her wanted to visit the forge and try some new weapon modifications, but that wouldn\u2019t give her many opportunities to test the remote. Thinking she could head to the gym and visit Yang, maybe swap something else with her if no one else came to mind. Weiss turned a corner to make her way to the training wing. As she passed a training room, she heard some familiar voices and stopped. Peeking into the room, she saw three people talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha Nikos, Coco Adel, and Velvet Scarlatina were chatting, surrounded by destroyed training droids. Weiss paused and listened for a moment.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pre06.deviantart.net/424d/th/pre/i/2014/151/d/b/rwby_pyrrha_by_yurax_mae-d7kgn6g.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pre06.deviantart.net/424d/th/pre/...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/954/623/caf.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/ori...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?

You don\u2019t see a lot of people stick up for others like that.\u201d Coco continued to laugh at her denials and only Weiss noticed Pyrrha\u2019s smile appeared fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, Jaune is pretty cool when he isn\u2019t trying to flirt, </i>Weiss admitted and immediately shook her head. She had to be careful or Ruby\u2019s personality would cause her to do something stupid. The perfect opportunity to switch something with one of those three couldn\u2019t be ignored though. A quick glance down the empty hall showed she was alone and she pulled out the remote. Taking careful aim before she was spotted, Weiss aimed at\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ammo was even incorporated into her combat attire around the belt and slung over the shoulder. Her weapon was the bag she was carrying that transformed into a fully automatic Gatling gun. The long, cocoa-colored shirt with a dark brown waist cincher and dark brown trousers were coordinated perfectly. Even her dark brown, high-heeled leather boots and beret fit perfectly. The dark colors were a strong contrast to Weiss\u2019s light blue and white outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, the sun glasses she always wore made her seem mysterious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of green light as Weiss selected the Wardrobe Swap option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco had so many outfits, Weiss wanted to make sure she had the chance to try them all and see what would fit best with her body. She felt the changes instantly. Coco\u2019s clothes covered more of her body than her dress and there was a distinct lack of breeze between her thighs. Combat skirt versus trousers. The beret covered her head, but didn\u2019t interfere with her on the side ponytail. Her eyes fell down to her hands, now covered by gloves. Several necklaces weighed down on her neck. The biggest difference though was how dark everything got as Weiss\u2019s eyes were covered by sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled down the shades to the end of her nose and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I feel like a secret agent.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was due to Ruby\u2019s personality taking charge. Even though Weiss\u2019s intelligence told her otherwise, some wires were crossed because of her earlier swap. It wasn\u2019t a bad conflict, just weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Coco, Weiss was surprised how good Coco looked in her outfit. Both sets of clothes adjusted to their new owner. Coco was now wearing her white and blue dress with the high heels. Coco's boots had heels too, so there wasn't a drastic height change. Neither she, Velvet, nor Pyrrha noticed any difference in her clothes. Weiss couldn't believe how amazing this remote was..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss now had to decide what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Weiss thought about it for a brief moment before her eyes fell onto Pyrrha. Pyrrha had many things Weiss liked. She had looks, brains, skills, and more. However, there was one thing Weiss was focusing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Pyrrha\u2019s height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had always been short, one of the reason she wore high heels. Being the shortest member on her team always bothered her. Now she had a chance to rectify that. Her smile widened as she aimed the remote and hit the button. There was another green light and Weiss felt herself grow. It wasn\u2019t so much stretching, but her entire body seemed to adjust to fit her new height. Looking down at her impressive chest, it didn\u2019t seem quite so out of place on her new frame. Her eyes then traveled back to Pyrrha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was now the shortest of the three girls and the other two were several inches taller than her.

There were a lot of prejudice against Faunus, including some beliefs Weiss once held. Blake was still wearing her Beacon uniform and her face was buried in her book like normal. Her black bow covered her cat ears. Weiss thought about it and decided she would be a better target over Ruby. There were some interesting swap options with Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Weiss could go with a Personality Swap. Blake was smart like she was, but more reserved and enjoyed reading a lot more than she did. There were some slight differences that should be noticeable. Weiss could use this as a test to make sure Personality Swaps didn\u2019t affect her own mind too much. Alternatively, there was the Personal Information Swap.

Would she grow ears like Blake\u2019s, would she get some random Faunus trait, or would everyone just consider her a Faunus. This would be the sort of test she was interested in trying. Still, Yang\u2019s words kept echoing in her mind. Having a little fun wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing. Blake did have all those books and enjoyed reading them. Weiss was sure she had some hidden away to prevent the others from seeing. Probably to keep Yang from teasing her and Ruby from reading something she shouldn\u2019t see.

The White Fang had been attacking her father\u2019s company since she was a child. People she knew just disappeared or ended up dead. It also didn\u2019t help that a lot of people in Atlas looked down at the Faunus. The culture sort of just sunk in. One of the reasons she applied to Beacon was to get away from that, not counting her father. Blake hiding her Faunus identity was a shock to Weiss, especially since Blake admitted to once belonging to the White Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an understatement that Weiss had been angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually sat down and talked. Both of them explaining why they acted this way and made up. Weiss didn\u2019t hold any animosity anymore for her teammate and friend. She also knew not all Faunus were bad. Velvet, a rabbit Faunus at Beacon, was one of the nicest, sweetest girls in existence. There was no way she would ever join the White Fang. Back home, Weiss had always been told Faunus were given the same wages as humans, so they shouldn\u2019t be fighting for equal rights when they had them already. Blake had countered Faunus were usually given the most dangerous areas while maintenance and safety was ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss wasn\u2019t blind.

Her chest bounced slightly and that wasn\u2019t the only part of her that moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a twitch on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening, Weiss rushed to the mirror and looked at her reflection. On top of her head was a pair of cat ears exactly like Blake\u2019s except for the color. Blake had black ears, but the ones on Weiss\u2019s head were snow white, matching her hair. Weiss\u2019s eyes widened and she slowly reached up with one hand. Her fingers lightly brushed an ear and a shiver ran down her spine. They were soft, like fine silk. She examined herself closely in the mirror. Even with Yang\u2019s chest and now white version of Blake\u2019s ears, Weiss didn\u2019t look that different from herself. Sure, the chest didn\u2019t really suit for her small frame, but there were lots of women with that problem. The ears looked completely natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they are really sensitive,\u201d Weiss muttered, feeling them once more to experience the sensation again. \u201cNo wonder Blake won\u2019t let Ruby touch them.\u201d She frowned as she remembered Cardin bulling Velvet. \u201cThat brute pulls her ears all the time. If they are anywhere as sensitive as Blake\u2019s\u2026 She has to be in a great deal of pain.\u201d The next time she saw Cardin do that she would step in. Like Jaune did that one time. \u201cLooks like Arc was right in that case. I should commend him on that when I get the chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat to do now?\u201d Weiss mused, tapping her cheek and admiring her reflection. The ears were cute and she enjoyed looking at them. The added bonus of being able to hear things better, like the people walking past her room, was only a benefit. \u201cAh, right. Note this down.\u201d She grabbed her notebook and started writing her test results down. \u201cHmm, I need to see how this last swap alters people\u2019s perception of me.\u201d She frowned. \u201cIf everyone treats me like a Faunus, then people like Cardin will try to put me down. I wouldn\u2019t let a brute do that of course, but I need to be prepared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pep talk, Weiss set down her notepad and thought about how to proceed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Weiss had switched them out on the first day with her own. A special silk blend that wasn\u2019t as harsh on the skin. Confused, Weiss\u2019s first thought was to blame Ruby. She probably messed up the sheets when doing laundry, but quickly pushed the thought from her mind. Ruby wasn\u2019t that dumb. Figuring it had something to do with the remote, Weiss examined her desk. Most of the notebooks, and school textbooks were exactly the same, but she noticed several Dust vials were missing. Feeling she was overlooking something important, she went to the closet to check the rest of her belongings. I big surprise greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire wardrobe had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were still her clothes. They had to be. The white and blue color scheme was exactly the same. It was the outfits themselves that were different. Weiss grabbed the nearest one and looked at the designer tag. It was a brand far cheaper than her original outfit. Before the swap, all her clothes had been designer brands, these new ones were generic. It only took a minute to confirm this as she skimmed through multiple dresses, shirts, and skirts. More confused than ever, Weiss closed the closet door and walked back to her desk, thinking hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why did everything change? Think through this carefully. When I swapped with Yang, my clothes adjusted. I\u2019m wearing the school uniform, so it didn\u2019t change like the rest of my clothes did after I swapped with Blake. A race swap shouldn\u2019t have changed all the clothes. It\u2019s not like I grew a tail and needed a hole for it to poke through. The only explanation was reality altered itself in some way. The question is, how? Is it just my clothes or something more?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss pondered this for a moment and then she remembered a string of images in her mind that definitely weren\u2019t her memories.  She shook her head and they disappeared. Frowning a little more, she tried to concentrate on them. The memories flashed through her mind again and she saw herself in a past far different situation than she had been before. It turns out being a Faunus had much further implications than she could imagine. Her mouth fell open as she realized what happened in this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been disowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, Weiss was a bastard child. Her mother cheated on her father with a Faunus. No one found out until Weiss was born. The rift between her pants continued to grow and strain their relationship. When Weiss was ten, her father had enough of her and sent her away to live with others, far away from him, the company, and the rest of her family. Determined to make her father proud and hopes he would bring her back, Weiss continued to strive to perfection. When this didn\u2019t work, she decided to become a Hunter and protect the downtrodden. Due to the financial situation, her clothes couldn\u2019t be top of the line brands. Most of her income had to go to Dust for her rapier, the one thing she inherited from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only solace was her adoptive parents were kind and that her sister, Winter, maintained regular contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d Weiss stood frozen, as the severity of changes one swap made sunk in. \u201cAppearances are even more important to my father in this reality. To throw away his own daughter? He\u2019s even worse.\u201d Weiss shivered for a moment. \u201cHowever, now I don\u2019t have to focus on impressing him anymore. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to cut my allowance or pull me out of Beacon. He doesn\u2019t care what I do as long as I don\u2019t bring shame to the family.\u201d Something occurred to her and she pulled out an ID card. It indicated her name and race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? He even went so far as to have my last name changed?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She may have lost her family's money and influence, but it would give her first-hand insight into the discrimination the faunus faced. Plus, as part of the unintended side effects of the swap, she'd ultimately escaped her father, in a sense. That could be considered an upside all on its own, one she might want to explore further once she was done with this little experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, Weiss slipped the remote into her pocket for later use, and considered her next course of action. The obvious thing to do would be to go out and see how people would treat her differently after this swap. People like Cardin were sure to try and talk down to her, but for now, she was more interested in those she already had a good relationship in the first place; her teammates. Her relationship with the rest of her team had already been somewhat strained by the White Fang incident, and though the situation had mostly been smoothed over by now, she was interested in seeing how things were now that the shoe was on the other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if she wanted to go speak with her team, she'd need to find them first. Yang would be the easiest to find, since she had a good idea of where she'd be; the gym. She wasn't exactly the closest with Yang in the first place, but at the very least, cat puns would likely have made their way into Yang's repertoire. Aside from that, she couldn't really predict how Yang's perception of her would change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby also wouldn't be too difficult to find. From what she could tell from her window, Ruby had headed into Vale alongside Jaune, and Vale wasn't so large that it would be impossible to find them. While she doubted Ruby would treat her too differently, considering how little of a reaction she'd given to discovering Blake was a faunus, Jaune was another story. He'd attempted to woo her from the first day they met. Would he still treat her the same way now that she was a faunus, and didn't have her family's influence? Perhaps he'd be trying even harder now, since they were likely both victim's of Cardin's bullying to same degree now. That was certainly something worth exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Blake. She'd only just spotted Blake outside her window to make the swap, but she had no idea where Blake was headed, so it might take a while to find her. Perhaps the library would be a good place to start? Blake was a very important person in the whole affair, though. It was rather easy to forget with how deeply Weiss' life had been affected, but Blake had been changed by the swap too; while Weiss had become a faunus, Blake had become human. Since at least one of her parents had obviously been a faunus before, did that mean her parents had changed too? And what about the White Fang incident? Surely Blake hadn't been a member of the Fang now that she was human, right? Did that entire falling out even happen in this reality? There was a lot to think about, and Weiss made a mental not to be very careful with how she used the remote in the future, considering how deeply the changes could affect reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough there was certainly more she could do in the privacy of her own room, considering she still had her scroll on her, Weiss decided there was no time like the present to dive deeper into this reality. And so, her new cat ears twitching a little in anticipation, she left her room, and went off in search off...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss continued to marvel at her reflection for a moment, one arm resting beneath Yang's breasts, gently lifting them a little, while the other continued to firmly grip the remote. She had been more or less speechless since the swap had happened, partially because the remote had actually accomplished the impossible, and partially because of how surreal it felt to have her body altered in this way. Her mind could scarcely believe that she actually had Yang's large breasts hanging from her chest, and yet, the evidence was right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a small giggle, her awed expression finally breaking into a smile. \"This is amazing,\" she mumbled to herself. The logical, analytical side of her brain, the side most often in charge, wanted to test the functions of the remote out slowly and methodically, recording all her findings. There was no way she'd ever figure out how it actually worked, as far as she was concerned it was magic, but once she had gotten a grip on the limitations of the remote, and how certain swaps interacted with each other, she could start to come up with more practical uses for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, watching her new reflection, a gently smiling Weiss with an inflated rack, something else seemed to be awakening in her. Yang's words seemed to ring in her mind. \"I should have fun once in a while, should I?\" Weiss asked, rhetorically. She looked down at the remote, still held within her hand. \"You know what, I think I'll do just that.\" Sure, she could methodically test the remote, but life had just handed her a magical device capable of altering reality, and she was the only one who would know that anything had been changed. Why not have a bit of fun with it? It's not like her first swap had been very methodical anyway, she was just sick of Yang poking fun at her breasts and wanted to do something about it. The world was her oyster now, and for once, she was actually going to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, though, she needed to get changed. Her bra may have adjusted to fit Yang's, or rather HER new bust, but a strapless bra like that just wasn't built to support breasts of this size. For a moment, Weiss debating using this opportunity to examine her new assets a little better, but decided against it. Right now, she was more excited by the remote. Quickly heading over to her dresser, she fished out a different bra, grinning a bit as she saw how the cup size had changed, and began to strip. Blazer and shirt were placed on her bed, while the bra was put into her laundry hamper, eliciting a gasp as she felt her breasts bounce a bit when she removed it. She couldn't remember the last time they'd done that before the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to get redressed, lingering a bit to admire her new assets, Weiss began to let her mind wander between different things she could do with the remote. Her first thought was just to continue what she'd started with her first swap. Weiss had always been a little self-conscious about her small bust size, and now she had the breasts of one of the bustiest girls she knew. Why stop there? Her new breasts looked a little out of place on her small frame, but she could fix that. She could borrow someone's height, for instance. Or perhaps she could enhance her downstairs curves to match those on top. She may prefer to wear skirts, but that didn't mean she couldn't still have \"a chiselled booty men would die for\", as Yang had put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while Weiss was happy with her new breasts, that didn't mean she had to go overboard redesigning herself. There were plenty of other things the remote could be used for. For example, she could mess with her team some more. She'd already taken Yang's breasts, and for the time being she wasn't in the mood to give them back, but there was still more she could do to her. Ruby and Blake were also unswapped, and she was sure there was plenty fun to be had swapping with them as well. If she wanted, she could even swap lives with someone else so she could go up and talk to them without them ever knowing it was her. She could even try swapping them with other people, although to make that work she'd have to use herself as a middle step, since the remote didn't seem to be able to swap between other people, only between the user and a target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Weiss began to put her blazer back on, almost fully dressed, she began to think that perhaps she was overthinking this. Meticulously planning things out what what the analytical Weiss would do, why should the fun Weiss be coming up with a plan? Maybe she should just go out with the remote and see what targets arise, not caring about who or what she might swap with. The remote could give her experiences she could have never possibly had before, after all. She could be older, younger. She could swap with a faunus, she could swap with a boy. With this remote, she could experience anything, and so long as she didn't lose it, she could undo them at any time if she didn't like them, or if she got bored. Perhaps that was the best way to use a device like this, just keeping it with her and swapping whenever an interesting opportunity presented itself. It didn't seem like a very Weiss-like approach, but perhaps that was why the idea sounded so exciting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Weiss was fully dressed again, slightly disappointed that her uniform didn't give much of an opportunity to show off her new assets. There'd be plenty of time for that later, though. For now, she snatched up the remote, twirling in her hand a little, and grinned as she thought over what she was going to do with it.</span></div></div>",

I do feel a little bad about Yang though\" Weiss thought, releasing her chest and letting it drop. She turned towards the door and was greeted by Blake. Blake walked in with her nose in a book, not paying any attention to Weiss. Weiss stopped at the door and turned around, \"Blake, Yang said she'd be at dinner around 6:30\". Blake gave an okay and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss gripped the remote and pointed it at Blake with a sly grin on her face. Maybe just one more swap with her teammates won't hurt. She pressed the body part swap and selected butt. In a flash Weiss felt her skirt lift slightly before it readjusted for her new rear end. She could help but grab it and blush slight. \"Talk about a new ASSet\" She thought to herself before getting slightly disgusted at her own thought. Maybe she hanging around Yang too much and was starting to make puns. She looked up at Blake who was still reading her book, unfazed by it, just like Yang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Blake, have you noticed anything weird today?\" She asked with Blake giving a simple no in reply. Weiss took that as she wanted to be left alone and decided it was time to leave. She left the room, holding the remote tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss walked down the hall confidently, trying her best to flaunt her new assets. Nearly every boy turned as she walked past and she couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed. \"Is this what Yang and Blake have to deal with?\" she thought peering down at herself. Even though she was truly enjoying her upgrades she couldn't help but wince at the pain they were causing. She knew she would need a frame more suitable for her new chest from the start but not this soon. Sadly Weiss made the poor decision to walk around Beacon after the classes were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured she would try the dining hall around 6:30 since that was the best chance, in a worse case scenario she would just swap to get Yang's or Blake's. She continued to walk around campus looking for potential swaps. She kept a tight grip on the remote while she walked. Her eye's were caught by Team CFVY, more specifically Coco. She was always wearing the lasted fashion and even though Weiss had very nice clothes, she couldn't help but be a little envious even if they wouldn't show off her new body. She gave a devious grin and took out the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean Coco will still have stylish clothes\" Weiss thought as she pressed the wardrobe swap. In a flash her vision became darker as she blinded and saw Coco wearing her white and blue dress with heels. Weiss lowered her new sunglasses to get a clearer look at herself only to discover that she was still in her school uniform. It took her a little bit to realize that since she was wearing her normal school uniform and swapped that she got Coco's uniform. She thought about going back to her room to change but Blake might say something, so she decided her new wardrobe could wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss sat down on a bench in the courtyard to try and relieve the pain in her back. She couldn't believe how Yang could manage. She looked around at the remote to see if there were anymore interesting options she could pick. At this point she had only done body part swap and wardrobe swap and she was eager to test something else. \"I could swap with Team CFVY again or another team\" She thought, looking around. Her stomach growled and she looked down at her scroll and saw it was almost 6:30. \"Maybe I should go get some food first\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss got up and straightened out her skirt, heading to the cafeteria.</span></div></div>",

While not noticing this, yang decided to see how professor good witch would react being in winter's body. \" oh, good afternoon specialist Schnee, I didn't realize you were coming to see your sister.\" Professor good witch said. \"why yes professor good witch, I was coming to check up on Weiss to see how she is doing.\" Yang said from winter's mouth. \" Well she and the rest of team RWBY decided to go to vale and hang out for a while. \"Oh, Okay.\" Yang said. \"Well, it was nice to see you around again specialist Schnee\", professor good witch said, \"if you like to tag along with me, and have a chat, that's fine with me.\" Professor good witch said in a happy mode. \"Okay.\" That sound fine.\" Yang said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang decided to come up with an excuse to use the bathroom. While letting her plan come into effect. \" excuse me professor, if you don't mind going on ahead, I need to use the bathroom.\" Yang said with a cherry look in her eyes. \"Oh, okay. Professor good witch said. While starting to walk away, yang decided to pull out the remote and aim it at a back  turned professor good witch, pushes the life swap button, and a green beam shot from it and impact on an unknown  and clueless professor good witch. A green smoke covered both yang and professor good witch bodies. Yang soul is now being pulled out of winter's body and professor good witch's soul is getting pulled out of her body as well. Both soul are getting pulled toward their new bodies. Once both soul's are pulled to their new bodies, the green smoke had cleared away in seconds. Both bodies are standing in the same spot as before the switch. Professor Good witch is the first to notice this, but feels different, with her right eyebrow arching above her forehead. While on the other hand, yang is just giving a quiet giggle and hug grin as well. \"Oh, what was i trying to do  professor,\" professor good witch voice coming out of winter's mouth. \"You were trying to ask if you could tag along with me specialist Schnee.\" Yang said with her voice coming out of her teacher's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh, well okay.\" \"This was amazing\". Yang thought's said in her mind. \"Even professor good witch doesn't realize that she has swap lives with me.\" \"This is so cool.\" While both yang and professor good witch were walking down the hallway, yang decided that it is time to try something else on  the remote and redo' everything. Within a cloud of smoke, she is reunited with her body and decides to think of other stuff to do with the remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does yang use next on the remote? </span></div></div>",

It was such an excellent opportunity, surely it was wrong to waste it. With that logic in mind, Yang puts the box under her arm and strolls off and towards the dormitories, knowing Weiss would most likely be in there adamantly studying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky over Beacon was bright and blue, the white clouds lazily hanging like paintings on the blue backdrop behind them. The grass Yang walked over was slightly moist from the night before where it had rained, leaving the air that morning fresh and cool. It was still early, meaning that the heat of the day was yet to set in, making Yang pull her brown and sandy yellow duster around her body as she felt the slight chill. On top of this, she had a plan to muck with Weiss\u2026 All in all, it was a perfect day despite her earlier defeat, now forgotten in the excitement of discovering her new toy.<br>\r\nFinally reaching the room marked with the brass plaque, \u201cRWBY,\u201d she knocked before barging in a second later, not waiting for permission to enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang!

I hardly think it\u2019s called for! Why don\u2019t you stop being so rude and get some manners, otherwise I\u2019ll have to take serious action!\u201d Weiss continues, wagging  her finger at Yang as she pulls out the remote and starts to fiddle with it, trying to make her mind up on what to do to the Ice Queen.<br>\r\nWeiss sees this and frowns angrily, reaching over to grab the remote just as Yang makes up her mind to swap Weiss and Blake\u2019s voices, at least then she\u2019d be lectured with a voice she could stand to listen to.

Yang aims at Blake, silently lying on her bunk as she ignores the two, and clicks again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing seems to have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until Weiss speaks again. Gone were the posh accent, piercing pitch and annoying tone, now replaced with Blake\u2019s smooth lower voice, one that made Yang smirk slightly as she heard the bossy nature of it, reminding her of a few nights of fun she\u2019d had with the cat on the bed nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Anyway! You shouldn\u2019t play with toys! You and your sister need to both learn to grow up! I like to have faith that she\u2019ll change but you? You\u2019re a lost cause!\u201d Weiss declares as she backs off, Blake\u2019s voice passing through her lips yet she was none-the-wiser than Blake, silently reading her book, yet to speak a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 Blake?\u201d Yang smirked slightly as she across to her lover, her magenta eyes narrowing slightly in anticipation of what was to come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, yeah?\u201d Blake mumbles, still engrossed in her book, eyes never leaving the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlaaaaaake!\u201d Yang repeats, this time in a more irritating tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, Yang\u2026 Can\u2019t you wait? Yuri is about to confront Miyamoto\u2026\u201d Blake begins to explain, her voice whiny and higher pitched. This was mostly due to Weiss\u2019 voice but that wasn\u2019t helped by the way Blake was when she was disturbed from her reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Yang\u2019s smirk didn\u2019t fade. Instead she slowly raised the remote again, levelling it with Blake\u2019s head and looking over the plethora of buttons available to her. She\u2019d been careful. The remote seemed safe. Now it was her time to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clicked the body button and then spun her arm to aim at Weiss, clicking again and smirking as she watched, in the blink of an eye, the two seemingly swap places. Caught up in the excitement, Yang hit another swap; this time their hair styles, then another; their races. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally starting to slow, Yang looks at her newly mixed up friends. Weiss\u2019 body was lying on Blake\u2019s bed, thick hair flowing down her shoulders, bow in place, in the body\u2019s usual snow white colour. A pair of cat ears tricking affectionately as she intently read her book. Yang was starting to doubt if she would even notice all the changes if she was aware of the swaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake\u2019s body was sitting, an angry pout on her face as she examined the grimm biology textbook, occasionally brushing her black hair\u2019s fringe out of her face. Her body was clad in Weiss\u2019 white and light blue battle-skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small nod of approval at her work, Yang finally put down the remote and contemplated what to do next. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In reality, she was thinking about all the cool things she could do with the remote. Sharing it with her partner was her final decision, but she had to wait. Weiss was a kill joy and would ruin a good thing if she showed them both what this remote was capable of.

She looked down frantically at herself. She was still in her black and white outfit, yet her chest was much larger and she was definitely taller. Her mouth was agape as she stared at herself wearing Yang\u2019s tan jacket, yellow undershirt, and block shorts. \u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swapped our bodies.\u201d Yang told her, twirling the remote in her hand and stretching. \u201cWow, Blake. You\u2019re flexible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock that off!\u201d Blake took a couple deep breaths to calm herself. \u201cYou wanted to demonstrate this\u2026 thing\u2026 and you chose bodies as the first swap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanted something big to show you its power.\u201d Yang explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCover yourself up then,\u201d Blake hissed. \u201cIf someone sees my ears\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey will consider it normal,\u201d Yang insisted. \u201cThe remote alters reality.\u201d She grabbed her student ID from her desk. \u201cLook.

Blake saw herself as Yang and Yang saw herself as Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo no one will notice me without a bow then.\u201d Blake muttered, reaching up and lighting touching them.

Your life made me do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I know that joke was funny, but I can\u2019t really laugh,\u201d Yang muttered. \u201cSeems like you don\u2019t have a sense of humor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have one, thank you very much.\u201d Blake sniffed in disdain. \u201cYou just aren\u2019t funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s agree to disagree,\u201d Yang told her. \u201cAbout what we do now, I was thinking, why not take the chance and see what life is like for each other? We have our life\u2019s acting as a guide, so it\u2019s perfect. We spend a few hours as each other and meet up for dinner with Ruby and Weiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Blake thought about it a bit. She could feel Yang\u2019s life wanting to agree to this. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea though. Blake was normally calm and collected, but now she can let herself go a little and see what being out going was like. \u201cOkay. Just\u2026 don\u2019t go overboard, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing. Meet up for dinner at the usual time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s agreeable.\u201d Blake flexed one arm and looked down at herself. \u201cThink I\u2019m going to stop by the gym and work off a little excess energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re life wants me to go to the library or stay here and read,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go the library\u2026 man it feels so weird to say that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun.\u201d Blake told her, before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Blake was gone, a huge grin formed on Yang\u2019s face. She had an ulterior motive for doing a life swap then getting them to separate. Yang didn\u2019t know as much about Blake as she would like. This was her opportunity to snoop around. Maybe Blake had a diary or something she could read. Of course, Yang really didn\u2019t want to waste this opportunity and thought that maybe she could go around Beacon as Blake and have some fun. No idea what kind of fun, but fun was the goal nonetheless.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yang\u2019s first thought was to look over her shoulder for Blake, but mentally kicked herself that she was Blake now. Reaching a hand out, she picked up the Scroll and saw the number had a name attached. It was someone Blake knew well, so Yang had to act the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u2026mom.\u201d Yang said, trying not to laugh at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, I\u2019m so glad you picked up!\u201d The voice on the other end was very friendly and warm, quite different from Blake\u2019s usually passive tone. Yang instinctively knew the woman\u2019s name was Kali, due to Blake\u2019s life memories. \u201cI wanted to let you know that I was going to be in Vale for a diplomatic meeting and had some free time tomorrow. Since tomorrows Saturday and you don\u2019t have school, how would you like to spend some time together? We can catch up on everything at Beacon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Inside, Yang loved the idea. She could learn so many juicy secrets of Blake. The biggest problem was to stay in Blake\u2019s life through the following day. Well, for now, she just had to act like Blake and get her mom to come.  Though, she could tell Blake\u2019s like wanted to try to get out of it. That just made things so much juicer. \u201cDo you plan anything more than a couple days in advance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure your father and I planned you a couple weeks ahead of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, eww. Did not need to hear that.\u201d Yang sighed, though she was grinning ear to ear. \u201cFine. I\u2019m pretty sure my team leader doesn\u2019t have anything planned tomorrow. I suppose you want to meet my partner too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Kali replied. \u201cFrom your letters, she seems like a very nice person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Yang couldn\u2019t help asking. She would never believe Blake would write something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious how fond you are of your team.\u201d There was a pause on Kali\u2019s end. \u201cWell, I got to go! I\u2019ll call you tomorrow to let you know when I\u2019ve arrived. Bye, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy mom.\u201d Yang hung up and laughed. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad I swapped with Blake. She would never have told her mom was in town. Tomorrow is going to be a blast, but what to do until then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to go through Blake\u2019s diary, since her mom was probably a better source of information, Yang\u2019s first idea was to go explore Beacon as Blake. Even if Blake wasn\u2019t very talkative, a few people did get along with her.  It might be fun to meet those people and see what they talk about. The next option was to try out the remote some more. She had only scraped the surface of what it was capable of. Lastly, a small part of her mind told her she really should let Blake know her mom called. Yang wouldn\u2019t let her out of it, but they were friends and Blake deserved to know.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even if the remote made it so everyone saw her as Blake, she still felt weird in Blake\u2019s clothes. Her clothes revealed more of her shoulders and less of her chests. Yang found that boring as, while Blake\u2019s chest wasn\u2019t a large as her own, it was still impressive. Guys deserved at least a little teasing. Blake did have a booty to die for, and she did wear tight shorts. As she passed a few guys, Yang gave her booty a little shake, getting more than a couple of quick glances. For the most part, nothing felt off except her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Blake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang stopped and turned around. She wanted to smirk at hearing the familiar voice, but kept to her new Blake persona and just gave a small smile. The voice belonged to a blonde boy with a shirtless vest revealing a rather impressive set of abs. The boy\u2019s name was Sun, a Faunus with a blonde monkey tail. Yang wasn\u2019t surprised to see him. Sun always flirted with Blake. Blake wasn\u2019t interested in him romantically\u2026 yet, but she did consider him a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Hi, Sun. What brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just thinking of returning a library book.\u201d Boy, was that a lie. Yang rolled her eyes big time. \u201cMaybe hoping to run into someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope you meet them.\u201d Yang teased, and continued on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Wait up!\u201d Sun raced after her. \u201cCome on, Blake. There\u2019s a new caf\u00e9 that opened up. Want to come visit it with me this weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Yang answered, though she figured Blake should at least give the boy a chance. \u201cI really do have something going on. I\u2019ll take a rain check though. Maybe next week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d Sun jumped up and punched the air. \u201cAlright! I can\u2019t wait to tell Neptune. You won\u2019t regret this.\u201d He rushed off while waving goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not bad looking,\u201d Yang commented to herself. \u201cIf he and Blake do get together, I wouldn\u2019t mind playing a little monkey in the middle.\u201d She laughed at her amazing joke, knowing her team didn\u2019t have a sense of humor and wouldn\u2019t laugh. Not pay attention to where she was going, she found herself stopping in front of the library. \u201cWhy am I\u2026 right. Blake\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been running on autopilot and Blake\u2019s life had been leading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library was only one possible option. There was no reason she had to stop.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before her stood her friends from Team JNPR, Pyrrha and Jaune. Both of them were in their fighting outfits. They probably just got out of training. Pyrrha was personally training Jaune due to his skills being on the lower end of their year. They were partners, but really contrasted a lot. Jaune with his assorted chest plate and shoulder guard, but wore jeans and a hoodie under it. Pyrrha had much fancier bronze smarten style armor.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/f/f6/Jaune_analyzes_the_situation.png/revision/latest?cb=20151103085337\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/omnibattles/images/b/b8/V3_09_00035.png/revision/latest?cb=20161225134728\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/omni...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Pyrrha. Hey Jaune.\u201d Yang greeted. \u201cHow was training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sore all over,\u201d Jaune said and flexed his shoulders. \u201cPyrrha was teaching me a couple new exercises and I\u2019m not used to them yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to change things up or your body won\u2019t improve.\u201d Pyrrha told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I need a shower,\u201d Jaune sighed. \u201cSo sweaty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were at it for over an hour,\u201d Pyrrha admitted. \u2018I could use one too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang really wanted to make a comment about them being hot and sweaty together, but Blake\u2019s life told her that would be a mistake. She would save that golden comedy for another time. It felt like just being quiet and occasionally interjecting a question or comment was Blake\u2019s specialty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why are you at the library?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need a book to finish Oobleck\u2019s essay,\u201d Jaune informed her. \u201cThen we are heading back to the dorm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, studying while you are tried,\u201d Yang replied. \u201cGood choice.\u201d That\u2019s about the few times she voluntarily studied. When her body hurt too much to move around and hang out with friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t let us hold you up, Blake\u201d Pyrrha apologized. \u201cSay hi to the rest of your team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Yang responded. As she watched the two of them entered the library, her hand reached for the remote.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nAnother swap couldn\u2019t hurt?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of people couldn\u2019t see why Pyrrha was into Jaune. He was awkward, clumsy, and was kind of weak for being in a school for Hunters. Yang couldn\u2019t deny though, with Pyrrha training him, he was beginning to fill out nicely. He walked a little straighter, his muscles were forming, and he had the added effect of being tall. Another good point of his was Yang could have a conversation with him without him staring at her chest. Pyrrha was a champion fighter and a celebrity, yet she liked him a lot. If only Jaune could see how into him she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be fun to swap with one of them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one batted an eye if she walked into the library. Yang slipped into an aisle and watched the two began browsing a section for the book they needed. The remote seemed to grow warm in her hand, thought that was probably because she was clenching it tightly. Her mind was deciding what to swap.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHmm, what to choose?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to swap with Jaune. Her team was all girls, so she thought it would be fun to swap with a guy this time. Jaune was also someone she knew, so she could swap back easily enough. He lived right across the hall after all. The question on her mind was what to swap now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time he wore the dress to the dance stood out and she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe a Wardrobe Swap? Give him all of Blake\u2019s clothes? That would be funny. When I swap back with Blake, she will be wearing his clothes and won\u2019t even know.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, part of her wanted to do something more. The Life Swap was a tempting option. How would living as a guy differ from a girl? Watching Pyrrha fawn over her would be hilarious, though maybe a little awkward. The downside is that Jaune would be in Blake\u2019s life and if they meet, the real Blake living Yang\u2019s life might try to talk about the remote. It was a risk Yang might be willing to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last was a very specific swap. Yang was by no means a shy person. She was perfectly okay making crude jokes and embarrassing people. Her eyes traveled down to between Jaune\u2019s legs. The temptation to swap genitals was strong. It would allow Yang to see a guy\u2019s dick up close without having to deal with the rest of them. Plus, she could settle a bet with Blake about what he was packing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that was the reason Pyrrha was so interesting in him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yang felt the swap long before she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was looking at Jaune, once the flash of green light faded, nothing seemed to change. Due to the design of guy\u2019s pants, it\u2019s hard to see anything change. The same couldn\u2019t be said for Yang. Girl\u2019s clothes were usually a lot tighter for them to show off their curves. Blake\u2019s outfit was no exception and Yang was currently wearing her clothes as she was living her life. Yang\u2019s eyes slowly travel down as she felt her tight white shorts grow even tighter in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sizeable bulge between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang knew the remote worked. That wasn\u2019t the reason she was so shocked. No, part of the reason was how weird it felt. Being stuck in tight shorts, she could feel her new dick being tightly wrapped up. It was definitely uncomfortable, but she also felt a little stimulation. That stimulation caused her new package to grow. As it grew, she couldn\u2019t help get turned on even more, which didn\u2019t help the predicament.  Her hand barely touched the outside of her clothes and it immediately grew. She was forced to stop before things got worse. This was not the reason for most of her shock though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy shit! Jaune is stacked!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang looked around. The library was hardly a place to examine herself. If anyone saw her, they would see Blake playing with herself. There was no way Yang was going to ruin her partner\u2019s reputation that way. She slowly started walking toward the door. Every step was weird and awkward. She wasn\u2019t used to having anything between her legs and it kept rubbing against her underwear. Two students passed her and neither paid any attention. Because of the remote, everyone should see Blake with a bulge in her pants as normal. Before heading out, Yang spared Jaune and Pyrrha one last look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them seemed to have changed at all, so Yang slipped out. She wasn\u2019t sure what to expect as she made her way toward the bathroom. Jaune didn\u2019t change any of his mannerisms and Pyrrha still seemed to be smitten with him. The remote only swapped the physical aspect and altered clothing slightly to allow the new transformations. She guessed it was to minimize changed. Yang pushed the door to the girls\u2019 bathroom and checked to make sure all the stalls were empty. Her eyes then traveled to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reflection showed Blake, mirroring any poses Yang did. (Heh, mirroring.) Yang already knew this. When they Life Swap, the world sees them as each other. The only difference they say, besides clothing, was the hair. Yang had Blake\u2019s long dark hair and Blake had Yang\u2019s stylish blonde hair. However, this time there was a big difference. The bulge in the front of her shorts was incredibly noticeable. Jaune was indeed stacked and Yang really wanted to check it out. The problem was the location. Was the public bathroom really the best place to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted to check it out immediately, but someone could walk in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grinning to herself, she really wanted to see her new appendage, she unbuttoned her shorts and pulled them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Blake. You wear some pretty sexy panties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t completely skimpy, but guys would kill to see Blake wearing just this black underwear. Normally, they would have outlined her delicious Bellabooty. Yang may like guys, but she could appreciate a sexy butt. Now the panties were straining in front of her with Jaune\u2019s impressive member. Yang reached a hand down and touched the outside of the cloth. Then slowly, she moved her hand up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran down her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guy\u2019s dick was pretty sensitive. She knew their balls were at least. Enough guys who tried to cop a feel when they thought she wasn\u2019t paying attention had their own ones knocked back into their body from one of her blows. Still, she wasn\u2019t touching it directly and, while it felt good, wasn\u2019t really anything extreme. Her vagina was much more sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was actually a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I have to stimulate it directly?\u201d Yang murmured and she slowly pulled down her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer member was already partially hard and the excitement about seeing it up close helped bring it the rest of the way. The second it was free from its constraints, it sprung up. Yang whistled at the size. It wasn\u2019t stupidly big, but it was a good nine to ten inches. No wonder Pyrrha was interested in him. She probably got a glimpse of it at some point since they shared a room. Not wasting any more time, Yang reached down and wrapped one hand around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was firm and she would feel her heart beat through it. Slowly, she moved her hand up and down as she had seen in porn. At first there was nothing, then she felt pleasure began to build up within her. Forcing herself to keep it down, it seemed like it was eventually going to release. It was now a game for her to see how long she could last. She slowly started moving her hand faster and a soft moan escaped her lips. The pressure was building up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026when the door to the bathroom burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho entered the girl\u2019s bathroom?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pressure faded and her dick began to shrink. Velvet sounded furious and Yang couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing Velvet angry. She was usually a quiet and soft spoken girl. Velvet was also a rabbit Faunus with cute brown rabbit ears on her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/UTQ7uHpR4HTvKQTw7\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/UTQ7uHpR4HTvKQ...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words told Yang all she needed to know though. There was one person who bothered Velvet to a degree to upset her this much. Cardin, the resident school bully had been bothering her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet was too occupied with her thoughts to notice Yang was there. Quietly, Yang gave up trying to pleasure herself. The moment was ruined and there were better places to do this. She pulled up her shorts and then stepped out into the bathroom. Velvet had been staring in the mirror while rubbing her ears. It was now her turn to jump when Yang emerged suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Blake!\u201d Velvet stammered. \u201cI\u2026 didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I heard you so angry,\u201d Yang commented. Velvet remaindered her she was Blake. Otherwise, Yang might have just asked if Cardin was being an asshole directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a bad day,\u201d Velvet muttered embarrassed, crossing her arms and rubbing the sole of her foot on the ground. \u201cJust need a little alone time to vent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas it Cardin?\u201d yang asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet didn\u2019t answer, but her deliberate eye contact and silence told Yang all she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to stand up to him.\u201d Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe will just bother someone else,\u201d Velvet protested. \u201cI can handle it, but others may not be as lucky. Besides, if I get violent, it\u2019s just going to reinforce his beliefs us Faunus are beasts.\u201d Her eyes looked up at the bow Yang was wearing on her head that should have hidden cat ears. \u201cYou just came out, so you know a few people look at you differently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI finally realized if I wanted people to judge me for who I am, I can\u2019t hide part of myself.\u201d Yang stated firmly. This was something Blake had told her and the rest of their team when she revealed she was a Faunus to the rest of the school. \u201cMost people didn\u2019t change at all, but you will always have a few jerks like Cardin and his group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to change his mind one day,\u201d Velvet stated, sounding a little bolder. \u201cBlake\u2026 please don\u2019t tell Coco or the rest of my team though. They would react\u2026 negatively.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coco would have Cardin\u2019s team tied up naked on poles in the woods. Shoot, Yang might help out if asked. She really disliked Cardin. Velvet continued to message her ears, indicating Cardin had pulled them. Yang washed her hands, but was thinking about something else. Velvet was right next to her and a perfect opportunity for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose ears were cute and, since Blake was a Faunus, maybe Yang should get her own Faunus part? Super hearing always seemed like an awesome benefit. Though after their conversation, Yang actually debated another Life Swap. If she took over Velvet\u2019s life, she could try to find a way to get Cardin to leave the poor girl alone. If she swapped back before she met up with Blake, no harm no foul. There were also many other buttons she could try out and observe the results.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First there was the obvious. Velvet was wearing Blake\u2019s white and black outfit. Her ears were sticking up though the bow. If Blake hadn\u2019t revealed herself already, everyone would immediately know she was a Faunus, if the remote wasn\u2019t warping reality. The second major change Yang noticed was how Velvet held herself. She wasn\u2019t slumping slightly, stood up straighter, and didn\u2019t have any trace of her old timid self. As far as she and everyone else knew, she was cool and confident Blake. The reflection in the bathroom mirror showed her as Blake, and Yang\u2019s reflection showed Velvet in her school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she noticed that the reflection of Velvet in Blake\u2019s life had a large bulge in her shorts.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nNo way!</i> Yang thought, as Velvet exited the bathroom. She would feel Jaune\u2019s dick between her legs, yet her reflection showed Velvet completely normal. Double checking, Yang lifted her skirt and saw plain white panties. There was no sign of the dick in the reflection. Yet Yang knew it was there. She could feel it and even grabbed it with her free hand to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave Yang something to think about when she left. She used the Body Swap option while in Blake\u2019s life. This made everyone think Blake had a dick, even though Yang saw her own body with it. When she swapped lives with Velvet, the world would see Velvet as Blake with the dick and Yang was just plain old Velvet. Yet, the dick was definitely there. It\u2019s just no one would notice. Yang immediately began thinking how to use this to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I could change in the locker room and accidentally bump into another girl with it? </i>Yang thought. <i>See if they notice? Of course, I swapped lives with Velvet to teach Cardin a lesson. What to do? What to do?<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

Though that wouldn\u2019t affect Yang much, but poor Velvet would suffer the repercussions. It\u2019s not like she deserved that. She could go and see Coco. There was a chance it was something normal and Coco just wanted to have a girls\u2019 night or something. Yang couldn\u2019t deny she wasn\u2019t a little curious.

Velvet\u2019s life encouraging her to go too just helped. Yang was beginning to get emboldened by the remote\u2019s power. She wasn\u2019t going to get in trouble. The worst situation that would happen is Blake would realize the person she thought was Yang in her life wasn\u2019t actually Yang and didn\u2019t know about the remote. That would be easily fixed. If things got too out of hand and Yang didn\u2019t want to deal with Velvet\u2019s life, she would just undo the swap. Besides, she liked Coco and had fun hanging out with her. That girl knew how to party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough, walking through Beacon in Velvet\u2019s life didn\u2019t feel that different than her own, except for two main differences. The first was of course Jaune\u2019s dick between her legs. It was straining against Velvet\u2019s underwear, but the skirt hid the bulge, unlike Blake\u2019s shorts. The second was Velvet\u2019s life having an influence on Yang. Yang felt herself avoiding eye contact and not standing up as proudly as she usually did. It was just a minor change, but one she noticed after trying to smile at a few people she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had only been to Coco\u2019s room once, but it felt like she had been there countless times. Velvet\u2019s life knew exactly where that room was without issue. Normally Yang would know, but since she was Velvet now, she simple unlocked the door and went in using Velvet\u2019s key. Team CFVY\u2019s room looked similar arrangement to RWBY\u2019s except with different personal items. Coco had been sitting on the bed, but jumped up when Yang entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time, Bun-Bun!\u201d She called out, sauntering over. She was wearing a tank top and hot booty shorts. \u201cThought you might have gotten lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you planning, Coco?\u201d Yang asked and Coco grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the guys gone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her brain froze as Coco\u2019s tongue began to work its way into her mouth and dance with her own. Even though the situation was so serious, Yang felt herself relax a little bit. It seemed Coco was always like this with Velvet. She would be all aggressive and Velvet would just go along with the flow. Since Yang\u2019s brain shut down because of the surprise attack, her life kind of took over. They began to make their way to the bed, wrapped together, and finally Coco broke the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you glad you didn\u2019t run away?\u201d Coco asked, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 er?\u201d Yang wasn\u2019t sure how to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Her grin didn\u2019t fade as she pushed Yang onto the bed. This was an unusual occurrence for Yang, as she was a muscular girl normally. Velvet was smaller and more agile and the world treated her as such. \u201cNow, let\u2019s slip into something more comfortable. In an instant, her top and skirt was off, revealing a pair of light brown bra and panties. This was one of the few times she also took off her sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn involuntary squeak erupted from Yang\u2019s mouth as Coco dived on her and pinned her to the bed. Coco masterfully used one hand and slipped down Yang\u2019s skirt while the other held her wrists in place above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t have to be so forceful,\u201d Yang gasped, trying to take back some measure of control. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour surprise expression is too cute though,\u201d Coco told her, reaching a hand into Yang\u2019s underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gasp escaped her lips as Coco pulled down her panties and firmly grasped her dick. Coco then leaned down and began to kiss Yang\u2019s neck lightly, making sure to nozzle affectionately against her. Yang\u2019s eyes widened as she realized what was happening. Coco saw her as Velvet, yet was stroking her dick, which felt amazing by the way when done by someone else. She struggled lightly in vain, without any real determination behind it, when her eyes fell on a mirror in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Velvet being pinned down by Coco, but Coco\u2019s hand in that reflection was down between Velvet\u2019s legs. There was no dick, so Coco\u2019s fingers were actually inside Velvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy crap!</i> Yang thought. <i>Her body reacts to the dick, but she still sees and believes\u2026 ahhh\u2026 that it\u2019s just Velvet\u2019s pussy.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nIt was getting hard to think and if Yang didn\u2019t do something soon, she was going too wrapped up in this to fight anymore. Coco\u2019s smooth hand felt amazing and the pressure in her balls was growing alarmingly fast. If she wanted to get out, she would need to grab her skirt off the floor and hit the remote. Of course, she would just stay here and see what lesbian sex was like. She wasn\u2019t a lesbian of course, but living Velvet\u2019s life which was along with having a male dick, her hormones were acting up and she liked the current situation. Though, even if Yang was living Velvet\u2019s life, it didn\u2019t mean she had to be so passive. Maybe she should try to get Coco to do what she wanted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Yang choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She loved getting Velvet to beg. Little did she know Yang had other ideas. Their reflection showed Yang that Coco couldn\u2019t see the dick she had taken from Jaune. She was going to take advantage of the situation the second Coco moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I can\u2019t resist your pleading, Bun-Bun.\u201d Coco whispered seductively and pushed herself off of Yang, before sliding down. \u201cI\u2019ll get you all warmed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Coco stopped jerking Yang off, the pressure in her balls decreased. Yang still had her uniform top on, but nothing else, so it wasn\u2019t long before Coco put her head between her legs. Yang pretended to look at Coco, but was also watching the mirror. Her harden member was sticking straight up in the air and only a few inches from Coco\u2019s face. Their reflection showed Coco\u2019s face in front of Velvet\u2019s slit. Coco smirked up at Yang before opening her mouth and engulfing the cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang almost exploded right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, I thought her hand job was good, but her mouth is in another league!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang\u2019s entire body jerked ad Coco sucked the top half of her member and ran her tongue long the veins. The wet and moist sensation engulfing her skin and nerves was intense. She began to understand why guys liked this, even if girls didn\u2019t get much pleasure in it. Semen really wasn\u2019t tasty. Blowjobs were just rewards for boyfriends. Now she understood how much. It took so much concentration not just relax for a fraction of a second and let the pressure in her balls release. Since being on the receiving end was something she would never have expected to experience, she wanted it to last as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she held on, her eyes traveled to the mirror again. Coco\u2019s head was buried between Velvet\u2019s legs and Velvet\u2019s face, which was really Yang\u2019s, was reddening rapidly. As her attention wavered at how cute Velvet looked, she felt a little bit of precum release into Coco\u2019s eager mouth. This only seemed to encourage her and Coco began to suck more vigorously and wrap her tongue around the dick excitedly. Yang sucked in a sharp breath of air as pleasure threatened to overwhelm her. The warm, moist sensation, the sucking pressure, and the tickling sensation of the tongue were more powerful than her determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang felt her control beginning to weaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the moment she was waiting for. Right when she knew she was about to release the flood gates and couldn\u2019t turn back, she reached forward and grabbed the back of Coco\u2019s head with both hands. At the surprise touch, Coco stopped sucking and started to pull away, but Yang was having none of that. She pulled hard and forced Coco\u2019s head all the way down the shaft until her lips were touching the base. Yang ignored Coco\u2019s choking and grinned as she saw the bulge in the girl\u2019s neck. This was payback. Even though Coco wasn\u2019t sucking her cock anymore, Yang had been on the verge and finally relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cum she had been saving up in her balls was finally released and she could feel streams of hot sticky liquid squirt down Coco\u2019s throat. Yang let out a sigh of relief as she felt so relaxed. Unlike Coco, who was coughing, eyes watering, and struggling to get free. Yang finally let go and Coco shot up, coughing into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Velvet.\u201d Coco said between coughs. \u201cDid you warm up already? You squirted a lot faster than usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang laughed and Coco raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Yang do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a challenge and, if she didn\u2019t have her Semblance, Yang probably would have won several times. Shrugging and seeing that she was alone, Pyrrha aimed the remote and fired.

She had on a tan jacket, with a yellow undershirt that revealed the top of her chest. An orange scarf wrapped around her neck, black gloves, tight black mino shorts and normal boots.

She reached up and felt her headpiece tying up Jaune\u2019s short blonde hair. The biggest thing she felt was the bulge between her legs. It was much larger than she was anticipating and her underwear, while adjusting to Jaune\u2019s waist, was female and did not have room for a male package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have\u2026 umm\u2026 a little top heavy and missing something I\u2019m use too.\u201d Jaune said, looking down at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha saw herself without her head piece and her hair was now straight down instead of a ponytail. Jaune\u2019s hoodie and jeans didn\u2019t change much, except there was a bulge on his chest where her breasts were. She was going to make sure not to mention anything if she saw Jaune touching them. Just pretend to ignore them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d Jaune asked. \u201cGo and see everyone? I feel a little weird, but they should see this as normal, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, just like how you saw me as normal in Yang\u2019s clothes.\u201d Pyrrha said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to have some fun and it\u2019s kind of exciting having a little secret between us.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ren on the other hand began to jump in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what was so funny?\u2019 Jaune asked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019 believe what happened in Vale,\u201d Ren said excitedly. \u201cWe were at that all you can eat pancake place-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one you were banned from last month?\u201d Pyrrha asked, thinking back to Nora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was only one month.\u201d Ren said sulking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne month to the day.\u201d Nora added evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, someone tried to rob the place.\u201d Ren continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u2019 Jaune and Pyrrha asked together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, held a gun under his jacket,\u201d Ren said. \u201cHe got the money and ran out, but he slipped on a pancake and collided into the door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen actually was the one who dropped the pancake,\u201d Nora added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLies!\u201d Ren cried out. \u201cI would never waste a pancake.\u201d He looked back at Pyrrha and Jaune. \u201cWell, the \u2018gun\u2019 he had was just a banana and it got smashed all over his shirt and flew into his face.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIt was hilarious and served him right for trying to rob that place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune laughed and even Pyrrha chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we did eat,\u201d Nora said. \u201cSo feel free to get dinner on your own.\u201d She shared a knowing look with Pyrrha, who nodded in thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun!\u201d Ren said and waved. \u201cCheer up, Jaune-Jaune. Maybe the person for you is right under your nose.\u201d He gave a big wink to Pyrrha, who blushed and then had to try hard not to laugh at seeing the stoic Ren say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune and Pyrrha then exited the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was having a little trouble concentrating with the large package between her legs. It kept rubbing against her underwear with every step, turning her on. Not only that, spending time with only Jaune was turning her on too. \u201cDid you have someone in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but we can\u2019t ever let her know.\u201d Jaune warned. \u201cShe would kill me if she found out I took her baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you want Ruby\u2019s scythe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026 yeah.\u201d Jaune muttered, rubbing his neck nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t say that\u2019s not a fun option, though it might be a little more advanced than your ready for,\u201d Pyrrha said. \u201cYou could probably swap weapon skills with Ruby while you\u2019re at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Jaune shook his head. \u201cAt that point, she would have my skill and that can put her life in danger if something happens.\u201d He frowned. \u201cI won\u2019t put someone else at risk like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, sorry.\u201d Pyrrha apologized. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, you didn\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d Jaune assured her. \u201cNow let\u2019s go find Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find Ruby. She didn\u2019t have her weapon on her in the school grounds, but that wouldn\u2019t matter with the remote. Pyrrha was just lucky Weiss wasn\u2019t with her so that Jaune wouldn\u2019t be reminded of her. After Jaune swapped with Ruby, they headed to their lockers to see if the weapon was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d Jaune muttered, picking it up. He clicked a button and it transformed form the gun mode to full scythe mode. \u201cWeird, I\u2019ve never used it before but I know how to use it.\u201d He collapsed it back into gun mode. \u201cLet\u2019s go try it out in the training room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha smiled at seeing Jaune look like he just got a Christmas present. The better thing was she noticed Jaune touching her breast through the hoodie again. Every second she was getting closer. Though, there was a moment when she reached down between her legs and felt Jaune\u2019s dick once. She had been just trying to adjust her underwear and one thing led to another. When she felt something build up in the balls, she stopped, worried she might have gone too far.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s supposed to be some guides when living their life so you can mimic them. I don\u2019t know what that means. The instructions were rather vague.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonal Info Swap has a lot of options,\u201d Pyrrha said. \u201cWe just did weapons, but it can swap any two things between people.

Even intangible things like jobs, ownership, like weapons, names, relationship, memories, traits, anything really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we swapped teams?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeams?\u201d Pyrrha repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike instead of Life Swap where we become them, we just joined their team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, not sure.\u201d Pyrrha admitted. \u201cIn theory it should work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLife will be fine too.\u201d Jaune assured her. \u201cI was just thinking out loud.

The only thing that can ruin this now is if Weiss somehow falls in love with him and asks him out, but the likelihood of that ever happening was zero, it was absurd to think about what was next she was bisexual, Ruby has a crush on HER, Yang stops making puns, Blake shows her cat ears to everyone?

Jaune nodded at that and thought of more possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we might want a team with teammates that don't do that, team NDGO maybe, team FNKI, team CMEN?\"  Jaune suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha knew those teams, the all girl team from shade academy led by Nebula, the musical based team led by Flynt from Atlas, and the unknown mysterious team led by Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them are good choices, I'm sure we can pick one.\"  Pyrrha mentioned, she really wanted to avoid team RWBY or if they do go with it make sure Weiss isn't there, she didn't care who of the other three were left when they did the swap, it just had to be anybody but Weiss, she wanted her completely out of Jaune's mind and by the time she reenters it Pyrrha and Jaune will be in a relationship, then Weiss can see him all she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can Pyrrha.\"  Jaune smiled, still eyeing him, Pyrrha inwardly smiled as he was now checking her out, this is why she'll make sure nothing will ruin this plan, nothing.</span></div></div>",

Pyrrha had scored high enough to be set up on a second year team, while Jaune had scored very high in tactical training simulations, something Coco seemed to be lacking. Ozpin decided to try an experiment about coming first and second years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next was about Jaune\u2019s wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe onesie he had? Coco had burned that the first day in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to be the reason for this trip. There was no way Coco would let Jaune continue to dress like he did and kept shoving outfits into his arms before kicking him into the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re being a little hard on him?\u201d Velvet asked eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Coco replied immediately. \u201cHe needs to know the difference between fashionable and abominations.\u201d Jaune stepped out. \u201cSpin around.\u201d Jaune sighed and did so, knowing it would be faster. He had 7 sisters, so this was actually common for him. \u201cNot bad, keep that one. Try these one next.\u201d It seemed he was going to get an entirely new wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Pyrrha.\u201d Coco said. \u201cSee anything you like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA couple,\u201d Pyrrha admitted, looking at a few dress designs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should choose something like this,\u201d Coco said, pointing to a red backless dress. \u201cShoves off some skin without being overly slutty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little more\u2026 daring than I\u2019m used to.\u201d Pyrrha replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes you have to be daring to get the guy to notice you.\u201d Coco said sternly. \u201cSo\u2026 any progress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome,\u201d Pyrrha said slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s noticing more after being rejected, but I feel like the rebound and I\u2019m taking advantage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes they have to crash and burn before they realize what they want,\u201d Coco explained. \u201cNothing wrong with showing there\u2019s a better option. Did you at least tell him you liked him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha remained silent and Coco lowered her shades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeeze, Pyrrha.\u201d She said. \u201cThe kid over there is nice, but he\u2019s thick as hell. He\u2019s not going to know your interested until you tell him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been spending more time with him and he\u2019s noticed my umm\u2026 body a little.\u201d Pyrrha said blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019 something at least.\u2019 Coco sighed. \u201cBut he\u2019s never going to make a move without you pushing more. You\u2019re hot, Pyrrha. Strut it a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can try.\u201d Pyrrha muttered, red faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you need to borrow some sexy underwear, I got extra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoco!\u201d Pyrrha gasped and Coco laughed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a flash of light and Pyrrha found herself sitting in front of a plate of cookies wearing a Beacon uniform. Jaune was sitting across from her, wearing a female uniform too, but the thing she noticed was that Jaune had Yang\u2019s long abundant yellow hair. Jaune was looking at her hair too, so she must have had Ruby\u2019s short dark hair. Her head did feel lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026so even though Pyrrha and Jaune are dating, \u2018Weiss was saying. \u201cYou can\u2019t let their relationship distract you, Ruby.

She was shocked at how good they tasted. Maybe Ruby\u2019s life affected her taste or Beacon just made that good of a cookie. \u201cEither way, it doesn\u2019t concern us now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr you weird fantasy,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cYang found your weird ship journal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed and then glared at Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d Jaune said raising his hands.

No hurting family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake pouted and went back to eating her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pyrrha was surprised at how easy it was to act like Ruby. Things just came naturally and yet didn\u2019t overpower her. Ruby was excitable, though shy around new people. Once you got her out of her shell, she was really friendly, talkative, and nice. Jaune seemed to tease all of them equally, so he was following Yang\u2019s life too without problems. Weiss and Blake never expected a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat class did they go to that morning?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t help that he talked at 1000 words a minute.  Pyrrha tried and her notes were okay, just not nearly as good as her own. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Ruby and Jaune living in their lives. Ruby had Pyrrha\u2019s long red hair and Yang had Jaune\u2019s short red hair. Ruby\u2019s outfit didn\u2019t look different, except she didn\u2019t have her normal cloak. Pyrrha was wearing Jaune\u2019s male uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was, surprisingly, taking notes dutifully like Pyrrha always did. Yang was sort of taking notes, but Yang and then quickly looked frantic as she tried to catch up. Pyrrha couldn\u2019t helping giggling softly know that\u2019s exactly what Jaune would do. Glancing over, she saw he was doing something similar. Yang wasn\u2019t a great note taker either. Port\u2019s class was a little easier, as everyone just slept, doodled, or read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the bell rang and Pyrrha left with Jaune, Weiss, and Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you copy my notes.\u201d Weiss told Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!

Let\u2019s blow off some steam with a quick training session? The Vytal Tournament is just around the corner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby is right,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe should take every opportunity we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d Blake said. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to try and need Yang\u2019s help with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?

I don\u2019t know if we can use their weapons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can swap back,\u201d Jaune said and then he pointed. \u201cLooks like Ruby and Yang are going off somewhere in our bodies, we can check on them first.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe could hop into other people and let them deal with the training?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Think her name was Octavia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the Life and Body means we will be in their life, but at the same time, have their bodies, unlike with Ruby and Yang?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe so.\u201d Pyrrha agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey aimed the remote and swapped with the two girls. The next moment, they found themselves wearing completely different clothes and Jaune had the fun of being a different gender. They were also flanked by the other two members of Team NDGO. Neither of them thought about if the girls had something going on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Those moves you did were amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe saw a lot of people fight in Combat Class I tried to mimic a few things,\u201d Pyrrha explained, trying to avoid raising suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia had a different fighting style than her and her instincts led her to dodge and block different ways. Pyrrha however was able to push it down and do a few moves she was used to doing. It felt clunky, but they worked somewhat. She did do a lot of them, just one every now and then during key moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it worked,\u201d Nebula complimented. \u201cDew, you seem to be a lot less aggressive, you need to keep pushing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Jaune apologized. He was the opposite of Pyrrha. He used Dew\u2019s skills to improve his own, though she was much more agile than he was. He was actually surprised at what he could do and got better further into the session. He didn\u2019t attack a lot though, since he was more used to defending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust try to keep doing what you did at the end,\u201d Nebula assured him. \u201cYou and Octavia did some amazing combos.

They eventually came across a pair of well-dressed twins and Pyrrha pointed them out.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/qrMAmm4yCm9C1BMG9\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/qrMAmm4yCm9C1B...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill those two work?\u201d Pyrrha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I can pull off the dress, but you would look amazing in the red one.\u201d Jaune told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it then.\u201d Pyrrha pushed and the next second she was standing in a really fancy red dress and boots with a feather in her hair and red scarf. Jaune had a white scarf, dress, and boots. Though, he didn\u2019t fill it out nearly as well as Pyrrha did. \u201cHehehe\u2026 you look so funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha.\u201d Jaune suddenly swooped in and kissed her. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what I wear or how I look.

He could mimic a lot of things he saw and even began to recognize colors and numbers. He was also really expressive. Pyrrha found it really easy to know what he was thinking and adjust what she did to make him happy. That might have been the Terra instincts too. She also got to enjoy herself watching Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Adrian, he was expressive. It was obvious he wasn\u2019t bored or tired of playing with his nephew. Not only that, he was always one step ahead of everything. When Adrian was thirsty, he already had the bottle, when he soiled his diaper, Jaune was on it already to change. Pyrrha didn\u2019t have to do anything. Hours passed and they forgot they were just suing this to skip class. Jaune started making dinner while Pyrrha sat on the couch and watched Adrian watch a TV show while playing with a spaceship.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWould this be what marriage life is like with him?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha flushed as she thought about what her future would be with him. Sure, they both would be Huntsmen and fighting Grimm, but eventually they could settle down. One of them could go and do missions, while the other watched kids. Though, that meant there was always risk involved and there may be a time when one of them doesn\u2019t return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe vowed to train Jaune even harder than ever until he was better than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha suddenly felt bad at thinking about unpleasant thoughts.

I\u2019ll even convince Nora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha gave a weak chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we get that far.\u201d She reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora will break my legs if we don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we must, for your legs sake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for cheering me up.\u201d Pyrrha said and hugged Jaune quickly, before letting him go. They had to avoid some public display of affections. Her scroll beeped and she answered it. \u201cNora? What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlynda has all the students not on a mission in the auditorium trying to figure out who breached your privacy,\u201d Nora explained. \u201cOnly Ren and I are above suspicion. Nearly everyone thinks Cardin did it. I do too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any proof?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, but he\u2019s a jerk and obviously did it.\u201d Nora glared off to her side. \u201cHis team said they were all in their room hanging out when the picture was taken, but we know they are liars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026 can\u2019t just say it\u2019s him.\u201d Jaune said with a sigh. \u201cI think it\u2019s him too, but I\u2019m not going to blame him for something unless we have proof. Nora, I know this is asking a lot, but can you  and Ren try to let others know that. It\u2019s only going to make him act out more if people blame him for something he didn\u2019t do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 but\u2026 Fine!\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cBut only because it\u2019s you, Fearless Leader.\u201d She hung up and Pyrrha put the phone away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was nice of you.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t do it and we punish him, then the person who did it can keep doing it.\u201d Jaune explained. \u201cWe need to know for sure who did it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just make sure you two are seen in class so you have deniability. I won\u2019t have much time and may leave their room a mess. You think it\u2019s on a USB, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be easier to hide.\u201d Pyrrha said. She had to be careful with details or Blake would ask how they knew it all. \u201cBlake\u2026 Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe deserves it for what he did.\u201d Blake assured her.

Being able to put aside personal grudges for the greater good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah now, putting aside a grudge?\u201d Jaune shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m super happy he\u2019s being punished and won\u2019t be able to bother us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laughed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jaune was flying around some floating rings on the board, making sure he could handle it, and Pyrrha was practicing long distance sniping. Pyrrha of course mastered it in just a few minutes, but Jaune kept almost falling until he finally figured out his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing we didn\u2019t invite Team RWBY,\u201d Jaune said, flying down next to Pyrrha. \u201cThis would be embarrassing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait until you figure out how to fight with it.\u201d She pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I can do a couple moves.\u201d Jaune said. \u201cI can break it into two revolvers, kicked it at enemies and bounce it back, and put some dust in it to add dire or ice to my bludgeoning attacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see it.\u201d Pyrrha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey practice for almost two hours and night had fallen. Jaune was finally get the hang of some of the combos, but due to his innate skill, couldn\u2019t evoke them as fast as he needed. Pyrrha acted as an enemy since she could block with her gun. Even though she didn\u2019t really have a strong melee weapon, Jaune couldn\u2019t break her guard. He got close a couple times and did freeze one of her legs. That caused her to go on the offense and Jaune found himself on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou almost got me.\u201d Pyrrha admitted, reaching down to help him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u2026 Almost won\u2019t win us the tournament.\u201d Jaune said, accepting her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you wanted to do team training this Saturday,\u201d Pyrrha reminded him. \u201cGroups can overcome what a single person can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong as I\u2019m not on the receiving end of Nora\u2019s hammer.\u201d Jaune mumbled.

Everything passed like usual and she diligently finished her class work. Jaune seemed distracted and she wondered if the swap affected him more. He was on his scroll a lot more. She couldn\u2019t get much information from him and figured he was playing a game of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen classes finally ended, Jaune disappeared. Pyrrha went to look for him, but was ambushed by Yang and Ruby, who wanted her to come with them. She met them along with Weiss and Blake in the training halls. They had been arguing over some training techniques and wanted her opinion on which one was better. Then Yang challenged her to a fight and Pyrrha was not the kind of girl to back down. By the time she left, she had been there for almost two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran into Ren and Nora on the way to her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Pyrrha!\u201d Nora said. \u201cRen and I are heading into town to pick up a few things. Need us to pick anything up for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d She replied. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you and Jaune need to keep a low profile for a few days,\u201d Ren said. \u201cSo if you need anything, just let us know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate it, really.\u201d Pyrrha loved having friends like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached her room and opened the door. It was dark and the blinds were closed. She flipped the light switch and found it wasn\u2019t working. Sighing, she stepped in to open the blinds when the door behind her closed. The some lights in the middle of the room flickered on and she jumped. A table had been set up with two trays of food lit by candle light. Jaune was standing behind it, smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could go out to a fancy restaurant because of that picture,\u201d Jaune said. \u201cSo I hope this can sort of make up for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha held her hands up to her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfterwards, I managed to get Beyond Remnant 3 on DvD, I know you liked the series and haven\u2019t been able to see it yet.\u201d Jaune continued. \u201cit\u2019s not a movie theater, but I have popcorn and soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welled up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune\u2026 I\u2026\u201d The words wouldn\u2019t form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you not like it?\u201d Jaune asked worriedly. Pyrrha shook her head violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love it.\u201d She told him in a shaky voice. \u201cYou went through all this\u2026 for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was easy,\u201d Jaune assured her. \u201cI love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world stopped for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, she had leaped forward and wrapped her arms around him, locking lips with him. He jerked back at first and then leaned into the kiss. His arms wrapped around her back too and they stood there, in a perfect world. When they finally broke, she looked up at him. It was another thing she liked. She had always been tall, but Jaune was still taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d Pyrrha said. \u201cThis is lovely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally calming herself down, she sat down and enjoyed Jaune\u2019s delicious food. They talked, laughed, and just enjoyed each other\u2019s company. Turns out Jaune bribed Team RWBY to distract her and gave Ren and Nora money to stay in Vale until tomorrow. Their friends were happy to assist. After the dinner, Jaune cleaned up as Pyrrha set up the movie. They made popcorn and soda, and propped themselves up on Pyrrha\u2019s bed so they could watch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jaune had torn her hymen. She knew about it from biology books. Jaune had even stopped when she cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Pyrrha said softly. \u201cIt did hurt, but the pain is disappearing. I\u2019ll let you know when you can start moving.\u201d His concern was admirable and she appreciated it. Once the pain had subsided, Pyrrha nodded toward Jaune. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune began to move slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was online anything Pyrrha had felt behind. She had masturbated before using her fingers, but having Jaune\u2019s large manhood pushing deep into her womb? That was something else entirely. It was warm and strong, pulsing with his heartbeat. It filled her up more than any food could. Pleasure ran through her body as she felt Jaune moving in and out. Her legs tightened around his body, not wanting him to go, but he kept at it. Moving out and slamming back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, Jaune!\u201d Pyrrha cried. \u201cFaster! This is amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune obliged and started moving faster. His thighs smacked loudly against her own. He even reached one hand up to fondle her breast. Her entire body was in heavy. Her hands were above her head, gripping the bed sheets. Electricity coursed through her and she felt pressure within her. Jaune\u2019s cock seemed to pulse more too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPyrrha\u2026\u201d Jaune warned. It seemed her instinct had been right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull out,\u201d Pyrrha told him softly. \u2018It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m about to cum too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune held as long as he could and pulled out. Pyrrha cummed unlike anything masturbation had done before for her. Juices gushed out as Jaune shot out several shots of his own. Most of it landed on her breasts. Both of them sat there, panting. They were both a little worried, scared, and tired, but the second their eyes met, all that disappeared. Jaune laid down next to Pyrrha and kissed her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I was okay.\u201d Jaune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were amazing.\u201d Pyrrha assured him. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure I\u2019m on the pill from now on so we won\u2019t have any accidents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have used a condom.\u201d Jaune realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Pyrrha assured him. \u201cIt was a safe day today or I would have told you.\u201d She looked down at her breasts. \u201cGoing to have to shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant some company?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha giggled and pulled him after her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was also a wardrobe swap, maybe even body part swap, plenty of fun to have there, he might stay away from life swap though at least for now, save that for later or when Pyrrha comes back, then again a life swap won't hurt if he's careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune hummed to himself, choice paralysis hit him a bit, he took a while to shake it off before thinking it over again, suddenly he had an idea of what swap he wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

All the sounds around him increased as he had her ears and his sight seem to become more powerful and sharper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to resist laughing, seeing himself weaing Blake\u2019s tight clothes and her bow.

As amusing as this was he needed to swap with them, but what to take?  Looking over both of them he went to take Yang's wardrobe and with a swap he was now wearing Yang's outfit, much better for his new body.  What else though, did Ruby have something he wanted?  Her voice maybe, nah he sounds like Blake and that's good enough, her personality?  Nah he didn't want to ruin her fun with Yang.  There had to be something though, he had an idea, her name.  He liked her name and figured he can borrow it for awhile, with a swap he was now Ruby Rose and her Jaune Arc.

He wasn\u2019t sure what else he could swap with. Maybe an outfit? Or team? Something fun at least. He looked at the remote and thought about what to do with it. There was plenty of Personal Info Swaps he had available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Velvet and Coco and remembered Velvet had that cool hard light box weapon. One quick swap later, he had that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Life Swap would kind of defeat the purpose of some of his swaps. He already did most of them. That left some Personal Info swaps and Personality. He didn\u2019t want to do a Personality without Pyrrha there to snap him out of it, so that left Personal Info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at Coco and Velvet glancing at each other, with Coco slapping her ass when no one was looking. They were in a Relationship. Maybe he could try a Relationship Swap? Being a thing with Coco, or even Velvet, might give him ideas that he and Pyrrha could do. Though, doing that would be kind of cheating. The Reset would make it never happen, but there were ethical issues involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option was Position Swap. He could put himself on another team and hang out with them. He wouldn\u2019t be Pyrrha\u2019s partner, but they would still be dating. Someone different would be his partner. Maybe he could go with the all-girl star team NDGO and make it coed. He laughed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast Personal Info Swap he was curious about was Perceived Gender Swap. It would make everyone thing he was the Gender of who he swapped with, without changing him. So swapping with a random girl would make everyone see him as one. He could go in all sorts of places he couldn\u2019t normally go and no one would find it weird.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Same reason why he won't do a perceived gender swap, he'd be seeing other naked girls that aren't Pyrrha, and granted he'll so see Blake's body nude that's only because of the deal.  Once again Pyrrha needed to give him the okay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Position Swap, his safest option since he'll still be a guy and dating Pyrrha, so if he wanted to hang out with say team NDGO, he can and they won't do anything to him, yes that can work perfectly.  But did he want to swap with team NDGO, he did them already before with Pyrrha, maybe another team will suffice?

But he can worry about that later, right now he needed to check the time and figure out what to do from there.</span></div></div>",

Blake leaned forward after feeling an object under her pillow, a small black box with a manual on the outside. She looks around the room trying to figure out how it got there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks closer at the strange box, \"A remote?\" She closes her book and gives her full attention to the box before taking the manual off opening the box, the manual's title caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your Guild to the Swapping Remote</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to me joking me, this must be Ruby's or Yang's attempt at a joke\" She muttered as she took out the remote and continued to read. Her ears started to twitch the more she read. Thinking about how this remote could do anything it claims. She think it over before her curiosity starts to take over. \"I mean I have to know if this thing works\" She said before slyly pointing at Weiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to try a swap that won't effect them both too much. \"Body part swap seems like a good idea\" she whispers too herself before pressing the button. And in a green flash she looked across the room and let out a quiet gasp. Weiss Schnee, the so called Ice Queen, sat at her desk with Blake's long black hair. Blake couldn't believe it, Weiss had her hair and she had her snow white hair. Blake couldn't resist but run a hand through it to make sure it was real. A small grin forms on her face<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since she just did a Body Part Swap, a different swap was in order. Nothing big of course, but something that was obvious. She settled on a Clothing Swap.  Weiss was the only target in the room, so Blake figured she might as well use her. Aiming the remote, she hit the button. There was a flash of light and Blake saw Weiss sitting at her desk, but wearing a completely different outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019 white and light blue strapless dress, white bolero, and white heeled boots were replaced by Blake\u2019s  black vest, white sleeveless undershirt, shite sorts, block boots and full stockings from black to purple. Blake looked down at herself and saw Weiss\u2019 outside on her body. Wanting to checking something, she got off her bed and went to the closet. On her section of the closet, Blake found all of Weiss\u2019 clothes, though sized to fit her own body. Not only did they swap, but everything adjusted automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss didn\u2019t notice a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could only stare at the remote for a moment before shoving it into her pocket.

Being a bit unsure of the remote she couldn't risk anything. Besides there will be plenty of people for her to test the remote on.

Blake turned to Weiss, who was finishing up the chapter she was on, happy to see her back in her white dress and with her white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Weiss?\" She said eagerly wanting to go out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Let's to find those troublesome teammates of ours\" Weiss said standing up from her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss grabbed her scroll and headed for the door with Blake in tow. Blake kept a firm grasp on the remote in her pocket, resisting every urge to take it out and swap with someone. \"Alright Blake, calm down\" She though to herself. There was no reason for her to ruin a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking the Beacon campus only made things worse. Ideas kept rushing into Blake's head and she had to shake them off by letting go of the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could they be?\" Weiss said getting more annoyed with every location they checked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.

Under the Personal Information Swap was a race option. Blake didn\u2019t hate being a Faunus, but she wanted to know how it worked. She knew it had to work, her earlier experiments proved it. Carefully aiming her remote at Ruby, who plopped down on Weiss\u2019 bed to talk to her partner, Blake hit the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light and things seemed to quiet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake reached up to her head. Her bow was still there, but there were no ears. Instead, Ruby seemed to have grown some new ears herself. They weren\u2019t cat ears though, they were floppy dog ears, matching her hair. Blake couldn\u2019t believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was a dog Faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Weiss,\u201d Ruby said excitedly. \u201cWe should do stuff together. As partners. I just added a cool new attachment on Crescent Rose. Or maybe we could go to Vale.

Her text was kind of cryptic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to hang out with us, you can.\u201d Ruby told her. \u201cKnowing Yang, she might want to take you clubbing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Great.\u201d Blake moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do your homework until Yang returns then,\u201d Weiss told Ruby, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww!\u201d Ruby whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn\u2019t help stare at the new Faunus Ruby. Finally shaking herself out of her shock, Blake pulled out her student ID. It said she was a human, but she shouldn\u2019t have been surprise. She had been pretending to be a human before the swap. Her eyes traveled to Ruby\u2019s desk, where her ID laid. It listed Ruby as a Faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026so Cardin tried to pick on me.\u201d Ruby told Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you smack him around?\u201d Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Ruby said proudly. \u201cHe won\u2019t pull my ear again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt bad and quickly undid the swap. Ruby didn\u2019t deserve being a Faunus and being mistreated. She was one of the nicest girls Blake had ever met. The swap was only meant to be a test anyways. Laying back down, she looked at her book as if she was reading, but was really thinking about how to use the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later, Yang finally arrived. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had stopped at A Simple Wok Noodle House and picked up everyone's usual; all the girls besides Blake would get the same thing.

The rest of the team looked at her as she had stars in her eyes and drooled at the fish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss calmly ate her noodles, taking peeks at the rest of the team devouring their food.

She walked into the bathroom. She stopped in front of the mirror. She hadn't actually gotten a look at herself since her swap with Pyrrha. She touched her face, feeling her new features: Nose, lips, cheeks. She then turned her attention to her hair, it was a drastic change in volume and color. She turned her attention to the rest of her body, flexing and stretching. Even lifting her shirt to look at her abs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible, I knew Pyrrha had a fit body but this is incredible\" She thought before getting ready for her dinner with Yang.

Though, she didn\u2019t really want to keep it right now. It was just something new she was checking.

A flash goes off as she presses the Life Swap button and found herself walking next to Pyrrha wearing Jaune's clothes and carrying his shield. The armor adjusted for her but it was really uncomfortable for her, not to mention the her new hoodie and jeans didn't feel like good combat attire. She looked up to see Yang and Jaune walking away and noticed Jaune wearing her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing too out of the ordinary\" She thought reaching up and feeling she no longer had her cat ears. Her assumption  was that with Jaune assuming her life, that he gained her Faunus traits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaune, is everything alright?\" Pyrrha said looking at Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Pyrrha. I'm fine. Just a little sore\" Blake replied, trying to stretch. She figured her body was a little tight because of the added armor but she was aching from head to toe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I feel like we're really making progress Jaune and we'll have that semblance unlocked in no time\" Pyrrha talked with such confidence and hope that Blake couldn't help but a little excited. As they were walking back the both decided that they should get something to eat before going back to their dorm room. Both go to the cafeteria to get some dinner and talk about how the training went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may just need to focus more on concentrating rather than combat for a bit. Maybe that's the key to unlocking your semblance\" Pyrrha suggested as Blake ate. Blake couldn't help but think about Pyrrha, after all she had her body for a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if there are any flaws with her? She can beat Yang in combat and she can out smart Weiss. What's she not good at?\" Blake thought to herself, not paying attention to what her partner was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that sound good Jaune?\" Pyrrha asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah,sounds great Pyrrha\" Blake responded with a little panic in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Maybe we can get Ren and Nora to help\" Pyrrha said before continuing to eat her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's hidden desires were only partially fulfilled.  Even though she was living the life of a boy, even though Jaune has flaws, she was missing the part that really made a man a man. She clenched the remote in her pocket looking around the room. The cafeteria was participial empty because it was so late and she didn't have many choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to hold off and finish her meal. Pyrrha was sitting patiently for her to finish so they could return to their room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Jaune?\" Pyrrha said with a smile on her face. She had already stood up from the table before Blake could respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake just nodded and stood up, keeping an eye on the room just in case she found someone to swap with. Sadly there was no one for. As they leave Cardin comes in and shoves Blake to the ground only for Pyrrha to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad Arc. Didn't see you there\" He said with a smirk on his face and spitting on the ground next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cardin! We both know you did that on purpose!\" Pyrrha spit back at him after helping Blake up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't concern you Nikos!\" He yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha got in his face and just stared him in the eyes. He glared back before heading into the cafeteria. Blake felt so helpless in the situation, like she couldn't defend herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Jaune? And don't worry about him\" Pyrrha exhaled at turned back to Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Thanks Pyrrha\" Blake said looking down at the remote in her pocket. </span></div></div>",

The more she thought about it, the more it frustrated her. She couldn't figure it out and pulled out the remote, staring at it while walking with Pyrrha. \"Maybe I Yang was right and I should loosen up\" She thought to herself as her finger lingered over the undo button. She wasn't too sure where she'd end up but it was a little excited to find out. As she pressed the button a bright flash went off and she found herself sitting at a table in a club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Blake! Stop being shy and dance!\" Yang yelled from the dance floor. Blake looked around the club and then the remote. The club was a place Blake wouldn't be caught dead in by herself and even though she was there with Yang it still made her incredible uncomfortable. Yang came off the dance floor and grabbed her hand, \"Didn't you hear me, let's get out there and dance!\" Blake nodded not letting go of the remote and aimed it at a random girl in the club, \"Maybe a personality swap will help me\" she thought. As she the flash went off she felt so energetic, she stood up and dragged Yang out to the dance floor. Both girls proceeded to dance and have a great time, maybe the most fun Blake had in a long time. \"This is incredible! I've never had so much fun!\" she yelled to Yang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time she kept tabs on the remote in her pocket, even though she was enjoying her new outgoing personality she won't want to stay like this. She noticed Yang was heading back to the table she was sitting at before the swap. She practically skipped back to the table and sat down next to Yang. \"Getting tired?\" Blake asked resting her head in her hands. Yang leaned back and smiled, \"As if, the night just started!\" Blake held the remote in her pocket tightly, debating on telling her teammate about the device. \"Yang, I have something to show you!\" Blake yelled over the music. \"Can it wait until this song is over? It's my jam!\" Yang yelled in reply as she stood up and got back out to the dance floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake just sat back and took the remote out, her new personality was telling her to use the remote more. \"Gosh, did I swap personalities with Ruby? I need to fix this\" She thought to herself looking around the club. She knew she could just press undo but there was no fun in that. A pair of girls on the upper floor caught her eye. One wearing a white dress, like something she'd imagine Weiss owning, and the other a black and red dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.redd.it/7sv84rjtxch21.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.redd.it/7sv84rjtxch21.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only done body swap once, lets try it again\" Blake thought as she smiled and pointed at the one in red. In a flash she saw her body overseeing the club wearing the girls red dress. Blake looked down at herself and admired her work. \"Not bad\" she thought patting her chest and running and hand along her torso. Lastly she checked her hair, it was shorter than what Blake normally had and felt much lighter in volume than her's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing she knew Yang was at the table and telling her they had to leave. Blake stood up and stumbled before her body adjusted and swiftly exited the club. \"What happened Yang? Why did we leave?\" Blake asked as she crossed her arms, a little shocked by her new bratty sounding voice. Yang put her hands behind her head and smiled, \"I may have a problem with the owner and I'd rather not ruin our night because of a fight\" Blake couldn't help but blush at her concern for the night. That feeling quickly faded as she reached for her pocket to find the remote missing. Blake's face turned pain as she started to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to do?  </span></div></div>",

The remote wasn\u2019t there. For a moment, she panicked. If someone else found it, there was no way she would get it back. Luckily, a quick scan of the crowd and she saw a guy holding it. He was one of the club\u2019s bouncer goons and Blake ran over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine.\u201d She told him.

Seeing herself wearing the red dress and wielding claws was kind of disconcerting to Blake. She quickly jumped back to avoid the attack and did a summersault kick to send the girl reeling back. Yang parried the kick from the girl in white and tossed her over a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBail!\u201d Yang yelled and Blake didn\u2019t need telling twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dashed out of the club and Blake found herself laughing. This was the most fun she had that she could remember. Her new personality loved causing trouble. The best part was it didn\u2019t get rid of Blake completely. She still had her memories. It was just her feelings and desires changed a bit. Logical thinking was still an option and she knew she could suppress the desires if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpill it Blakey,\u201d Yang said, pointing to the remote. \u201cWhat the heck is that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be easier if I show you,\u201d Blake said. \u201cHere touch it.\u201d Yang looked confused, but did as she was asked. Blake hit the Undo Button, not the reset. She wanted to keep the personality for now. It made things more fun with Yang around. There was a flash of light and Blake had her own body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wha\u2026how\u2026 but\u2026.explain!\u201d Yang finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time to explain the remote and it\u2019s functions.

Both girls stood outside the club thinking of how they would get back at them. \"I mean body swap is the obvious choice but I'm not sure I'd want to give my body to them\" Yang said poking down at her body. Blake wasn't too concerned about it since she had already given her body to one of the girls already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go with a life swap? That way we keep our bodies and get to party all night\" Blake said as she placed a hand on her hip. Her new personality taking over and letting her enjoy herself more and Yang wasn't complaining. \"Alright Blake, how are we getting in? Same as before?\" Yang replied with a grin and motioned towards the door. \"You know it\" Blake nodded and gripped the remote tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls walked into the club as the bouncers and thugs cleaned up the mess from their little scuffle. \"Hey Boys!\" Blake shouted. Every thug that was preoccupied with cleaning dropped what they were doing and rushed Blake. Yang swooped in and laid out the incoming assault. While Yang dealt with them, Blake scanned the club for the twins. She ran up to the second floor that oversaw the club, scanning the room for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so dead! A voice shouted from behind Blake. Both girls ambushed her from behind and forced Blake back to the first floor. Yang had easily handled the thugs and rushed to Blake's side. \"I'm guessing you found the brats?\" Yang said getting into a fighting stance. \"Oh yeah, get ready\" Blake replied grabbing Yang's hand and placing it on the remote. The Malachite twins stood on the other side of the dance floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls like ruined our club and night\" The one in red said. \"It's time we teach you a lesson\" The other said. Blake and Yang smiled to each other. \"Which one do you want Yang?\" Blake asked as her thumb hovered over the button. \"I'll take red, white was never my color\" Yang replied pressing Blake's thumb into the button. A flash went off and they found themselves on the other side of the floor wearing the twins clothes. Blake and Yang looked at each other and turned towards with twins. \"Ready?\" Yang said with a smirk, wielding her new claws. Miltia, the one Yang had swapped with, rushed in and was swiftly greeted by Yang and her fist. Blake put the remote down on a near by table and motioned to a thug, \"Keep this safe and away from those girls\" She commanded before joining the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Yang easily handled the \"troublemakers\" and stood over them in victory. \"Oh Boys will you throw these girls out\" Yang commanded putting a hand on her hip, looking at her new attire. Blake had walked back to the table and grabbed the remote. Both girls decided to go up to the second floor and oversee the club. The bouncers threw the Malachite twins out the front door and the club slowly resumed business as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun\" Blake said with a smile clenching the remote in her hand and looking to Yang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..what else can your magic remote do?\" Yang asked with a devilish grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just getting started.....\" Blake replied </span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s party some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I love partying with you.\u201d Yang said.

Flirt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018All of the above?\u201d Blake suggested and Yang high fived her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, we are living the lives of these two bitches,\u201d Yang said. \u201cWe should take that into account.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much do you hate these two?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey cut my hair once, Blake.\u201d Yang replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Well, that made sense. \u201cIf you don\u2019t just want to party as them, we could drink a ton and flirt with ugly guys. Once we swap back, they have to deal with the hangover and the guys trying to contact them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are devious, you know that Kitty Kat?\u201d Yang laughed. \u201cWhy not just get them into a mess of trouble while we\u2019re at it?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She walked over to grab a drink and downed it. \"Might as well enjoy ourselves\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Yang smiled to each other and couldn't help but laugh. After composing themselves they headed down to the dance floor and proceeded to dance the night away. Both occasionally stopping to get drinks and with the patrons. Blake kept a tight hold of the remote as she danced but as the night went on and the more drinks she got it became harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to stash is thing away before I lose it again\" She thought as she staggered off the dance floor. Her overzealous personality was causing her a bit of a problem for the first time since she acquired it. She knew she could put it on the second floor but she'd have to make it there. Quickly looking around and she could see Yang at the bar getting more drinks for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang cheerfully sat at the bar and drank both drinks before getting back out to dance. She was handling her booze better than Blake but she was still struggling. She stayed out on the dance floor as Blake staggered up the stairs. \"Aww, poor Blake must be struggling\" She slurred and kept going. Her feet were killing her because of her heels but she figured she could deal with it for the rest of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake finally made it up to the second floor and slumped over in a nearby chair. \"This remote is incredible\" she said as she held it up. She was resisting every urge to use it again but she knew Yang would want to be a part of it. She drank out of a glass that had been sitting on the table next to her and stood up. \"One swap won't hurt and she won't even notice\" She said with a smirk and pointed at the crowd, she was eyeing up a girl in a short black dress and clicked the wardrobe swap. \"Much better\" Blake thought as she hid the remote under the chair. She headed back to the dance floor and was greeted by Yang with a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing up there?\" Yang asked as she get closer to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stashed the remote up there. Didn't want to lose it\" Blake replied downing her drink<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. Wouldn't want that\" Yang said as she started to grind against Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn't help but enjoy the sensation and pleasure she was getting from Yang. Both girls continued to dance and drink with each other. Eventually the club started to clear out just leaving the girls to themselves. Both girls stumbled up the stairs and passed out. </span></div></div>",

Her head was pounding, she was nauseous, and Yang was snoring a few feet away from her.  It took all her strength to slowly push herself up and stagger to the bathroom. The reflection in the mirror looked terrible. Her black hair was a mess, though it was shorter than her normal hair. The Life Swap function swapped hair along with lives for some reason. The makeup she was wear was messed up and her black dressed was stained with some drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did I swap clothes?\u201d Blake muttered. Last night was kind of a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 Blake?\u201d Yang sat up. \u201cCrap, my head is killing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoin the club.\u201d Blake muttered. \u201cWe forgot to enact your plan. We got wasted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night then.\u201d Yang tried to joke. \u201cThough, drinking too much is liable to tequila-you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake groaned and threw a pillow at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get the remote and swap back,\u201d Blake muttered. \u201cGet rid of this hangover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, I agree with you.\u201d Yang held a hand up to her mouth. \u201cOne sec\u2026. hmph.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake waited as Yang ran to the bathroom and released the contents of her stomach. The two of them then went up to the second floor and looked for the chair Blake hid the remote in. Luckily, no one else had found it and Blake was about to take it back, when Yang grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrip and toss your clothes over the edge.\u201d Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Blake was shocked. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we swap back, the remote goes with us, right?\u201d Yang said. \u201cSo those bitches will be stuck here nude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Blake grinned deviously as her new personality took over. \u201cGood idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second they were naked, Blake hit the Undo Button three times. One for the outfit and the other two for their lives. Part of her didn\u2019t want to get rid of her new outgoing personality. The world blurred and they found themselves in their dorm room, on their respective beds, as Weiss and Ruby were heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018\u2026lucky it\u2019s Sunday and we don\u2019t have class,\u201d Weiss was telling them. \u201cWhy we have to have 2 party girls on our team is beyond me. Thank god Ruby isn\u2019t like you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrinking nasty alcohol and in crowds, yuck.\u2019 Ruby said, as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel hungover at all.\u201d Yang said. \u201cLooks like the twins in our lives came back after we kicked them out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow they have to deal with being naked.\u201d Blake replied and they laughed. \u201cWhat now, Yang?

How about we go get some breakfast and think about it on the way?\" Yang said standing up and walking towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can't wait to show you a body swap\" Blake exclaimed as the door shut. She turned her attention back to the remote as her thumb hovered over the undo button. She loved her outgoing personality but she knew it won't work for her during class. She was one of the better students and she couldn't let that go. One on hand she enjoyed partying as hard as Yang but on the other she knew it wasn't her. \"I'm sorry Yang, I know you like party hard Blake\" She sighed and pressed the button and in a flash she was back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang came out of the bathroom, walking over to her wardrobe and stripping. \"C'mon Blake! We're going to miss breakfast if you don't get that lazy butt out of bed\" She exclaimed as she picked out her usual attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed and got out of bed, walking into the bathroom. She stopped at the mirror and stared at her reflection. \"What are you doing Blake, what has this remote done?\" She asked herself. She shook off whatever doubt she had and exited the bathroom. She stood at her wardrobe and picked out her usual black and white outfit. She looked over to Yang, who was sitting on her bed and looking over the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea who you want to swap with Blakey? Or what kind of swap? I'm thinking about body swapping with Pyrrha, she's always beating me in class\" Yang asked with a smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, maybe Coco or someone from another school\" She replied tightening her bow to cover her ears. She walked over to Yang and grabbed the remote, \"Let's go get something to eat and we'll see where it goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smirked and got up, opening the door and escorting Blake out. \"After you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiled and put the remote in her pocket and exited the room with Yang behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though, exploring the lives of others was always a fun idea. She couldn\u2019t lie to herself that it was tempting. Even looking back at the twins, being able to do something like drinking and parting with Yang all night long was something she never expected to experience. She also got a glimpse into what Jaune\u2019s life was like, even if she didn\u2019t enjoy being so timid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Pyrrha.\u201d Yang muttered, elbowing Blake. \u201cPass the remote, Blake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to touch it to notice it too.\u201d Blake reminded her, handing over the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune and Pyrrha were talking in the hallway about something and Blake wasn\u2019t trying to spy on them with her heightened sense of hearing. Both of them were dressed in their combat clothes, though didn\u2019t have weapons. Most likely they were going to train a bit after breakfast since it was Sunday. Yang however, immediately aimed at Pyrrha and did a Body Swap. Now Yang was standing over talking to Jaune, wearing Pyrrha\u2019s red and gold Spartan style armor and skirt. All fitted to her proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Yang whispered, flexing in Pyrrha\u2019s body. \u201cI feel amazing. I\u2019m pretty strong, but Pyrrha\u2019s much more limber with the muscles backing it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of weird for Blake to see Pyrrha act like Yang, even though she knew this was Yang with Pyrrha\u2019s body. Yang flipped Pyrrha\u2019s red ponytail back and looked down. She was still wearing tan jacket with yellow crop top under it, revealing her navel though it adjusted to fit Pyrrha\u2019s frame. The brown belt and black miniskirts also adjusted to fit Pyrrha\u2019s frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you probably won\u2019t beat her,\u201d Blake pointed out. \u201cYour Semblance, skills, weapons, none of that swaps with a Body Swap. It\u2019s literally just the body. Everyone should just believe you\u2019ve always looked like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you need something bigger than just a girl swapping with a girl\u2026\u201d The smile appearing on Yang\u2019s face did not bode well for Blake. \u201cI dare you to swap bodies with Jaune.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blinked, thinking she misheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBody Swap\u2026 with Jaune.\u201d Yang repeated slowly. \u201cCome on, Blake. With all those smut stories you read, I bet you\u2019re dying to check out a male\u2019s body. Maybe we can see why Pyrrha likes him so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty sure that\u2019s not the reason.\u201d Blake muttered, rubbing her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part? Blake was tempted. She had Life Swapped with Jaune a little bit, but didn\u2019t get to experience the true form of a boy. Jaune was also one of the only guys she talked to recently, besides Sun. There was no way she was swapping with him. Even if he would believe he always had her body, the thought of what he would do with it if he found out. Jaune would at least take care of her body, minus some of the junk food he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dared you,\u201d Yang pressed on. \u201cDo it, Blake. Step out of your comfort zone and have some fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d Blake agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnew you wouldn\u2019t, guess we can find\u2026 what?\u201d Yang\u2019s head cracked as she turned instantly to look at her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Blake said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s time to step out of my comfort zone and experience new things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised the remote and Yang quickly touched it before Blake hit the button. There was a flash of light and Blake then saw herself wearing Jaune\u2019s hoodie and jeans, talking to Pyrrha, who looked like Yang. Blake was momentarily worried because her body had ears showing, but quickly dismissed it. Everyone saw her body as Jaune\u2019s for now. So there was nothing unusual to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang\u2019s laughter caused Blake to sigh and looked down at herself. She was still wearing her white and black outfit, including the vest and sleeveless shirt. However, when she looked down, instead of seeing her chest, she saw a broader male one. She was also much taller now with Jaune\u2019s body. She touched her head and felt the short hair, minus the cat ears, though the bow was still there. Lastly, she felt how tight her shorts were. They adjusted to fit Jaune\u2019s body, but he had equipment her female shorts were not made to contain and it was pressed tightly against her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed as Yang laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, want to see how Ruby and Weiss react?\u201d Yang asked, still laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we should.\u201d Blake agreed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Make this thing a team bonding exercise\" Yang replied back, confidently puffing out her chest. Even though Yang had Pyrrha's soft kind voice, she still had the same boisterous attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn't help but blush at Yang's confidence, she was so reassuring with her tone. But the more they walked the more Blake started to fidget and adjust her shorts. Her shorts didn't leave much to the imagination on what was underneath but the way the fabric rubbed against her new attachment was getting a little much. She looked around to see if she could swap with someone without Yang noticing but there were no options. She kept awkwardly walking next to Yang adjusting her shorts as much as possible without suspicion.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright Blake?\" Yang said with a smirk, knowing exactly what was happening to her friend. She had noticed Blake tugging on her shorts from the start and held back her laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....I'm Fine\" Blake replied back with a scowl on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Not everyday you get to experience the other side of the gender fence\" Yang said back with the same smirk. \"I only got Pyrrha's standard body while you got Jaune's <i>manly</i> one\" She said pulling Blake into her chest and giving her a clear shot of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned bright red as she saw Yang's near exposed chest. \"Why do you have to wear such revealing clothing\" She thought to herself. Her new member was getting a little hard to contain in her tight shorts and Yang knew it. Blake managed to push off and escape Yang's hold. \"What's wrong with you?\" She said as she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, Just trying to help\" Yang said as she tried to hold back her laughter.  Her eyes hadn't left Blake's crotch, in all of Blake's embarrassment she was having a hard time controlling herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake noticed her friend's eyes and quickly looked down to see that her shorts were shorting a very large tent. She covered her crotch with her hands and the remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm undoing this right now! This is too much!\" Blake screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Please don't.

Not to mention the thing in her pants that would not calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did boys deal with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, you love me.\u201d Yang replied. \u201cAt least your body does.\u201d Her eyes darted downwards and Blake hissed at her. \u201cCome on, you got Jaune\u2019s backup sword there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can have it back.\u201d Blake muttered, before they sat down. She thought she saw Weiss glanced at her crotch once before she was out of sight. Ruby was too busy eating her breakfast to notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning!\u201d Yang sang, plopping down across from Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a cheerful mood,\u201d Weiss commented. \u201cI would have thought you two would be upset after being kicked out of that club? You seemed that way last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake seemed relieved.\u201d Ruby corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got dragged there, so an early night was better for me.\u201d Blake replied, pulling out a book from her bag. At least she could keep her mind off her new appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, win some lose some.\u201d Yang said, waving her hands dismissively. \u201cWe got back at them and drank a bit somewhere else. They lost business because come on.\u201d She gestured to her body. \u201cAll the guys would love to get in to see all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d Weiss said and Blake glanced up. Weiss\u2019 eyes flickered to Yang\u2019s new chest. While not as large as her original one, it was still impressive. Pyrrha had a goddess like body with perfect proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kept you too?\u201d Ruby asked. \u201cTired?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, Blake had some personal problems she had to manhandle.\u201d Yang replied with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned her head instantly and glared at Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything we can help with?\u201d Ruby asked, looking at Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did Blake answer, but Weiss did too. They all looked over at her in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026\u201d Weiss coughed. \u201cYou know Blake\u2019s body is different than ours, so she has some own personal criteria she has to maintain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Ruby looked sorry at prying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Blake assured her, trying not to blush herself. \u201cYour sister is just being a jerk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she does that.\u201d Ruby agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the time, and usually with lame puns.\u201d Weiss added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Yang protested. \u201cWhen was it \u2018Pick on Yang\u2019 day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday.\u201d Ruby answered with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation turned to more normal topics, school, homework, the Vytal festival coming up, and other things. Blake was only partially listening while reading her book. Then she realized a problem she didn\u2019t foresee. Actually two. The first was her adult literature, not smut like Yang called it, was descriptive and she had gotten to some late night scenes. As she read, the tightness in pants kept growing and getting more comfortable. She tried to adjust her pants discreetly and it only helped a little. She brushed it once and a tingling sensation ran through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was when she was forced to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was sure because she had Jaune\u2019s male body, her hormones reacted to girls. When Yang pulled Blake into her chest, her body reacted to her bare chest. When Blake glanced at Weiss, her body seemed to react immediately. She got warm and her pants tightened. Just how big was Jaune anyways? Is that why he always wore loose fitting blue jeans? Blake was forced to look at Ruby during breakfast. Being cute, she didn\u2019t elicit the same reaction as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was finally finished and Ruby naturally suggested they do something together as a team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should get some training in,\u201d Weiss said immediately. \u201cIf we want to get first, we need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d Yang countered. \u201cI\u2019m at the top of our class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnder Pyrrha.\u201d Blake corrected and Ruby giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEt tu, Blake?\u201d Yang glanced down. \u201cOn second thought, sure Ruby. Let\u2019s all do training. Even Blake will come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blinked and realized Yang noticed her erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet!\u201d Ruby said. \u201cI\u2019m going to grab us a room, hurry and finish you too.\u201d Ruby took off and Weiss chased after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate you.\u201d Blake said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you should always back your partner.\u201d Yang said, crossing her arms. \u201cBut I keep my promise. You can swap with someone else. Who you thinking of? Jaune? Kind of boring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys closes would fit better,\u201d Blake admitted. \u201cThough, I suppose a girl with a skirt would be fine too.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't want to keep Ruby and Weiss waiting\" Yang said leaning over the table to show Blake more of her tits, in an attempt tease Blake's erection more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should switch with you\" Blake said through gritted teeth and stared down Yang's shirt, crossing her legs to try and deter her body from reacting more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead. I'm sure these shorts would make that a great sheath for that sword you're wielding\" Yang replied cheerfully with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake simply scowled back and looked around the room. She knew she had to find a guy whose clothes she liked, a skirt may conceal her erection but she couldn't risk it. There were a couple choices for her, one being Jaune, but Yang's words of get out of her comfort zone lingered over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Cardin?\" Yang suggested as she looked around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww no! I don't wan't to wear that Faunus hating pricks clothes\" Blake spat back as she placed the remote on the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaune? I mean you have his body, why not complete the look?\" Yang replied with a smirk and sliding her hand towards the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again no\" Blake said as her eyes darted over to a table that seated team CFVY. Blake had noticed the orange jacket of the teams more unique member, Fox Alistair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/b/bd/Fox3infobox.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/249?cb=20190926104107\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, grab the remote\" Blake demanded, making up her mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Bout time\" Yang exclaimed as her placed her hand on the remote<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Blake just sighed and pointed the remote at her target. In a flash she was sitting wearing a sleeveless orange jacket and black pants that hid her erection better than her old attire. She looked over to see Fox continue his conversation with his team wearing Blake's outfit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that looks nice on you, I take it you had a desire to show off those manly arms of your's\" Yang said with a smirk looking Blake up and down. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Shut up Yang, let's go\" Blake replied with a crack in her voice. She stood up and grabbed the remote, securing it in her new pockets. Giving a quick adjustment to her crotch and looking up to see Yang staring. \"Let's go\" She repeated as Yang snapped out of her trance and stands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, that looks good on you Blake\" Yang repeated with a soft smile as she stood up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed softly at her comment returned the smile. \"Come on Yang, let's not keep them waiting\" She said as she started headed towards the door. She still had an erect but it was less noticeable, but that didn't help much as she noticed some students taking glances as she walked past. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although, I'd rather not get Weiss' posh and prissy personality.\" Yang replied putting her arms behind her head. \"But seeing Weiss try and use Ember Celica might be worth losing them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weapon swap it is then\" Blake added as they approached their team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was loading her rapier, Myrtenaster, and Ruby was practically doing laps using her semblance. Blake held out the remote for Yang and selected weapon swap. In a flash, the girls saw Weiss loading ammunition into Ember Celica, and Ruby was bounding across the room using Blake's Gambol Shroud. The notable differences were the colors of the weapons. Weiss' new weapons were in her typical white with blue shotgun shells and while Ruby's weapon was her standard red and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...this thing is so light? Why would anyone use this?\" Yang sighed as she looked at her new rapier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss isn't as big as you or Pyrrha. So it doesn't need to be heavy.\" Blake replied adjusting Crescent Rose on back of her belt. \"This thing is heavier than it looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it compacts down to a reasonable size.\" Yang said as she flexed the tip of her weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the girls got to the center of the room with Weiss, Ruby stopped goofing around joined them. \"Ready for some team building!\" Ruby said cheerfully and wrapping an arm around Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a standard 2 verses 2 sparring match, Ruby and I against you two?\" Weiss exhaled as she pushed Ruby off her, placing her hands on her hips. \"We only have the room for the remainder of the morning so no goofing off\" glaring at both Ruby and Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Weiss, I'm serious\" Ruby responded with a salute<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me\" Yang smirked as she cracked her knuckles like usual. She looked to Blake and headed towards the end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, let's try to get the most out of this, the Vytal Festival is coming up and we shouldn't get complacent.\" Weiss shouted as she turned and walked to the opposite side with Ruby following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, I just realized we've never used these weapons. This is the best idea?\" Blake asked with concerned voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine, it's just Weiss and Ruby\" Yang replied cheerfully and got into her normal fighting stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Blake sighed as she extended Crescent Rose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready? Begin!\" Weiss shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sides rushed to the center. Weiss managed to fire off a couple volleys onto Yang, who was fidgeting with the dust but managed to fire a few fire projectiles back. Ruby was bounding around the room and landing a few kicks onto Blake, who was struggling to fire her weapon. After a few minutes, Blake and Yang got a general idea on how to use their weapons and started using them efficiently enough to be a challenge to Ruby and Weiss.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weirdly enough, Blake and Yang actually pulled through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake found out Jaune\u2019s body, being larger and physically stronger than her own, was well equipped to use Crescent Rose. His reach was longer, could swing it easier without scraping the ground, and with stand the recoil without issue. Ruby using Blake\u2019s katana and sheath didn\u2019t have the range advantage. Of course, she still had her super speed, but Blake was experienced with it. Ruby always had specific patterns she attacked with. The second Blake saw her disappear, she was already swinging to where she believed Ruby would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually met with great success if she didn\u2019t dodge in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also helped she had her clone Semblance to take plenty of hits until she got use to Ruby\u2019s weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw of the fight between Yang and Weiss was a little more awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had a small build and was normally a range fight with Dust attacks. Her Glyphs were used to move her around the field and repel attackers. Now, with Yang\u2019s gauntlets, if she wasn\u2019t shooting the shotgun blasts, she ran in close to deliver punches. Balke was a little surprised by this, as Weiss didn\u2019t have the greatest arm strength, but by using shotgun blasts with her punches, she could do a lot of damage. Her glyphs propelled her forward at high speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had difficulties at the beginning, even with Pyrrha\u2019s goddess body. She was toned and lithe, but Yang was used to fighting through direct physical confrontations. Now, she only had one weapon which was used for quick and precise jabs while adding Dust attacks. It took Yang a few exchanges with Weiss to get use to using the Dust. It was how Blake knew how to transform Ruby\u2019s weapon from gun to scythe mode. The Remote gave them some knowledge on how to use their new weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis allowed Yang to use her physical strength to her advantage with surprise Dust attacks. She sent Weiss flying with a blast of Electrical Dust. Weiss flew through the air and crashed into Ruby, causing them to lay in a jumbled pile. Weiss\u2019s underwear was visible and Blake\u2019s male body reacted quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Male hormones suck</i>, Blake thought, trying to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you too still asleep at the beginning?\u2019 Weiss asked, stretching a bit after that exchange and flinching at the pain. Her eyes darted to Blake's crotch and quickly looked away, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho won though?\u201d Yang countered, flicking the end of her rapier. If Weiss knew, she would have been furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys!\u201d Ruby said interrupting before a fight started. \u201cWe should be learning to work together, not fighting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby\u2019s right.\u201d Blake agreed. \u201cThe first round of the tournament is a four on four. We need team training along with individual training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe did divide into one on one fights,\u201d Weiss admitted. \u201cIf Ruby and I had swapped opponants or combined attacks,we might have won.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Yang admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got an idea!\u201d Ruby exclaimed. \u201cLet\u2019s take a break for a bit and come up with some ideas for team practice and then this afternoon, we come back and try some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually a good idea,\u201d Weis admitted, sounding impressed. \u201cI have a few ideas we could go over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026yaay?\u201d Ruby sounded a lot less happier while Yang snickered. Weiss and Ruby headed toward the changing room while Blake and Yang stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fun.\u201d Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was.\u201d Blake admitted. \u201cThough, I think I prefer my own weapon\u2026 and body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure love your body.\u201d Yang teased. \u201cI love mine too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean Pyrrha\u2019s.\u201d Blake replied with an eye roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine now.\u201d Yang laughed. \u201cSo, we swapping back weapons or not?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh shit, changing is going to be awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had showed and changed before breakfast, but that was when she had her own body. Now she had Jaune\u2019s male body. After the workout they had, she was sweaty. At the very least, she needed to change out of her clothes into clean ones. There was just two problems. One is she would be seeing Jaune\u2019s naked body. Luckily, with Fox\u2019s clothes, she had least had some tight boxers to cover the personal junk. Didn\u2019t help too much, as Jaune was big and she got turned on with every little thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second problem was there were some girls in the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss and Ruby were still there. They were talking to Pyrrha and Nora who had also arrived. Nora was standing in her underwear, completely unabashed. Pyrrha was changing, but talking to Weiss. Since Pyrrha had Yang\u2019s body, Blake could feel herself reacting to the shirtless show before her. No matter how hard she tried, Jaune\u2019s body refused to remain silent down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang noticed and immediately walked forward, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Pyrrha! Nora!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang!\u201d Nora replied excitedly and they fist bumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Yang.\u201d Pyrrha replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking good there, Pyrrha.\u201d Yang said and Blake rolled her eyes. She couldn\u2019t resist complimenting her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you\u2019re looking fit yourself.\u201d Pyrrha replied. \u201cDid you all just finish some training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, had to teach these two who\u2019s the boss.\u201d Yang said, pointing to Ruby and Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou barely won,\u201d Weiss huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Ruby agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re going down next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd technically, Ruby\u2019s the boss being the team leader.\u201d Blake added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Blake.\u201d Nora greeted and Blake nodded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou doing some team training too?\u201d Ruby asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Jaune has some ideas about a couple team plays we can do.\u201d Pyrrha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell them, Pyrrha!\u201d Nora cut her off. \u201cThey are top secret plans by our esteemed leader. Don\u2019t be sharing Team JNPR secrets!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, sorry.\u201d Pyrrha apologized, while Ruby and Yang laughed. Pyrrha put on her armor sorest and Blake hated how it accentuated Yang\u2019s boobs. It just turned her on even more. It was taking a lot of work not to touch it. \u201cWell, we should be going. Have fun.\u201d They left and Blake finally realized another problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune had her body in the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of panic, Blake calmed down by reminding herself that no one would consider Jaune having her body unnatural. At the most, a few guys might be oddly attracted to them. Blake always knew she had a nice body, even if she didn\u2019t like to show it off. She knew what guys were like. As Yang distracted Weiss and Ruby, Blake scooted away to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered swapping out of Jaune\u2019s body, but then Yang would win. Blake couldn\u2019t deal with her sore winner attitude. Making a hidden swap would also feel like cheating and that was something Blake didn\u2019t like. That left her with one option left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many conflicting emotions running through her mind. She was hot and sweaty and wanted a shower. The problem was seeing the naked body. At the same time, part of her wanted to see it. She had seen pictures and porn sure, but it wasn\u2019t like she had experience with the real thing. It was also technically her body. The down side was if Yang found out. Blake would never hear the end of it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She peered around the room to make sure no one was looking and unzipped her jacket. Even though the jacket wasn't too constricting on her body she still stretched her arms across her chest. She took a deep breath and practically vomited at the stench. She reluctantly lifted her arm and sniffed again, gagging more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so gross. This body is so gross!\" She thought as she gritted her teeth and glared at Yang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was stripping off her clothes, continued to talk with Weiss and Ruby. As they talked, Blake could see Weiss glancing over to her and back to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess now is my best chance\" Blake thought as she took off the rest of her clothes and headed towards the showers. Her eyes never looked down, no matter how tempting it was.  She cautiously stepped in and turned on the water. She slowly eased herself into the water and slowly relaxing. The warm water relaxing her sore muscles as she started to wash herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't so bad, just try to avoid Jaune's junk.\" She said softly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake must be taking a shower.\" Yang said before it clicked in her head. \"Blake's taking a shower.\" she repeated seductively as she turned and watched from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's eyes stayed shut as she tried to distract herself from the situation. She softly brushed her crotch and her body immediately reacted and only trying to subdue her erection led into more of a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me. Yang is going to pay for this.\" She whispered trying to hold it down. She exhaled and stopped touching it, turning her focus to finishing her shower and getting dressed. \"Maybe if I don't touch it or think about it, it will go down quicker.\" She thought, washing her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang figured she had been through enough and continued to chat with other girls in the changing room. Occasionally taking glances as Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rinsed off one final time and turned off the water. Her body felt ten times better and smelled better too. Although her curiosity was eating away at her, she was in a guys body, naked and hadn't gotten a look at herself. \"A peek isn't going to hurt.\" She said opening one eye and then the other. Her face turned bright red as she stared down at her crotch that was going more erect as she stared. She rushed out with a towel around her chest as usually she would with bottom barely covering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Blake?\" Yang teased as she stood over Blake. She was only wearing a towel and a short one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Yang, just take your shower\" Blake replied looking away as she dried herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I won't take long\" She said patting Blake's head and walking away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed and continued to get dressed. She slid on her boxers and shivered in disgust as her body reacted more. Blake sighed and glances around the room, at this point most of the occupants had left, just leaving Yang and Blake with a couple random girls. She stood up and gently zipping up her pants, grabbing the remote and placing it in her pocket. Lastly, she put on her jacket and gave a slight flex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang exited the shower already drying herself off and walked over to her bag. \"I'm starving Blake, do you want to go eat lunch right away or wait for Ruby and Weiss?\" </span></div></div>",

She was finally getting use to Jaune\u2019s voice coming out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou showered,\u201d Yang pointed out. \u201cDid you make sure to scrub \u2018every\u2019 part of your body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake flushed and Yang laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious seeing Vomit Boy blush as much as you have recently.\u201d Yang told Blake. \u201cBut seriously, did you? I would have if I were you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo.\u201d Blake hissed. \u201cI was just going to change, but once I removed the sweaty clothes, the smell was horrible. I had to shower or I would die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNever knew Jaune to smell,\u201d Yang admitted, rubbing her chin. \u201cHe must have good hygiene habits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThank god or I might turn into Weiss when he\u2019s around.\u201d Blake sighed. \u201cAnyways, I had to shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut did you touch it?\u201d Yang pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 well, once to push it down.\u201d Blake finally admitted and Yang laughed.

You literally can see what boys go through. Maybe you\u2019re having so much problems with it because you haven\u2019t\u2026 polished it. Spanked the money.

Weiss had been looking at her. Did she actually her now that Blake had a dick? Why couldn\u2019t she just have gone out with Jaune if that was the case? The reality still considered Blake a girl, just with a manly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust saying, don\u2019t be surprised if Weiss tries to get you alone.\u201d Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do realize, I\u2019m remembering all of this and once I complete this dare, tomorrow, all bets are off,\u201d Blake reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring it on, Kitty Kat.\u201d Yang said, gesturing with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will regret those words.\u201d Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey!\u201d Ruby said, as she appeared out of the locker room. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you two were waiting.

It\u2019s just been an interesting weekend to say the least.\u201d Blake replied trying to shake off the overwhelming feeling, she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Yang walked ahead of Weiss and Blake the whole way to the cafeteria. Blake kept glancing over to see if Weiss was doing that same as they walked. The whole time Weiss had not looked at Blake, seemingly as if she knew what Blake was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls entered the cafeteria and processed to get their food. Blake was struggling with her male hormones again as she could not keep her eyes from staring at Yang\u2019s ass. Yang\u2019s shorts where tight and Pyrrha\u2019s body was making it hard for her not to stare. As the girls sat down Blake quickly adjusted her pants before sitting down. Weiss looked up to see her in the act and quickly looked down before Blake noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I was thinking we switch up the teams for training later.\u201d Ruby blurted out as she chowed down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe and Weiss and you and Blake?\u201d Yang asked with food in her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we can rotate partners.\u201d Ruby added finally swallowing her food<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019d like to get more comfortable teaming with Blake if that\u2019s okay with you two. I\u2019d like to see how compatible we are together.\u201d Weiss suggested as she looked up at Blake with a sly grin on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake\u2019s eyes widened again as she face flushed red<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you excuse me?\u201d Blake said swiftly standing up and walked to the bathroom. She sat down in one of the stalls and exhaled, \u201cWhy is she acting like this?\u201d She took the remote out of her pocket and scowled, clenching it tightly in her hand. She exhaled again and relaxed, \u201cJust for a rest of the day and then I get my body back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake finally composed herself and looked down at her body. \u201cMaybe Yang was right too?\u201d She said reaching down at unzipping her pants. Softly grabbing her manhood and letting out a soft gasp that, which interrupted by Cinder and Emerald coming in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake put her junk back in her pants and stood up. Walking to the sink and washing her hands. She was tempted to do a small swap that would not affect her too much; Blake just didn't want to have Jaune\u2019s voice anymore. Ultimately, she held off and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou good Blakey?\u201d Yang cheerfully sung upon her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Blake hissed back as she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake continued to eat as her team talked about their upcoming training.

Ironic as Blake had Jaune\u2019s body and Weiss never gave him the time of day. Ruby helping Weiss get notice by her crush?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotally a Ruby thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also didn\u2019t help Blake that Weiss was attractive. While her chest wasn\u2019t huge, she had a sort of ethereal beauty inherited from her family guys liked.

Once they left, she turned to them. \u201cOkay!\u201d She declared. \u201cYang and I will practice some combinations over there.\u201d She pointed to the far side of the room. \u201cWeiss and Blake, you two will practice over here. After half an hour, we can meet up and do some light two on two. After that, if we want to keep going, we can swap and it will be Blake and me and then Weiss and Yang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, sis.\u201d Yang said. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe arena we are going to be competing in is supposed to be quite large,\u201d Weiss explained. \u201cWith changeable terrain. If we get separated from our partners, we need to be able to work together with anyone on the fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Yang said dismissively. \u201cGood luck working with Ice Queen, Blakey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck.\u201d Ruby whispered to Weiss. Yang winked at Blake, who deliberately looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Weiss said to Blake, once Ruby and Yang had left. \u201cDo you have anything you want to try first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really.\u201d Blake shrugged, really hoping she was just overthinking things. A dick might just make Weiss uncomfortable and she couldn\u2019t help staring. \u201cYour Glyphs are probably our teams most flexible ability. Maybe we could practice using them as platforms for added movability?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn excellent idea, Blake.\u201d Weiss complimented. \u201cI always knew you were smart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Blake couldn\u2019t tell if that was a normal compliment or Weiss\u2019 attempt at flirting.</span></div></div>",

She was able to complete a couple rounds before landing in front of Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked great up there.\" Weiss said as the glyphs faded and with wind around her died down. \"You got the hang of that pretty quick. I think we make a better team than Ruby and Yang.\" She added pointing at them across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for being sisters they don't seem to connect very well\" Blake replied turning to look, giving Weiss a perfect opportunity to eye her up more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Blake; you should try wearing something a little more maneuverable, like a skirt or shorts.\" Weiss suggested, pointing at Blake's crotch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll.....I'll think about it Weiss.\" Blake responded sheepishly and scratching the back of her head. She still was a little shocked at the texture of her or rather Jaune's hair; it was drastically different from her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can go shopping with you, if you'd like\" Weiss added <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, let's get back to training\" Blake responded quickly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" Weiss agreed as she stepped back only to get interrupted by Yang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice Queen. Blake. You two ready?\" Yang sung from across the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sides stood at opposites sides from each other. Yang loaded her gauntlets before getting into her fighting stance as Ruby extended Crescent Rose. Blake and Weiss nodded and got ready, Weiss taking a quick glance at Blake before the match began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should both target Yang, she's a little more dangerous than Ruby.\" Blake suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lead, I'll follow\" Weiss replied as the two teams rushed to the center.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naturally, Ruby and Yang charged them first. Both of them were more aggressive style combatants. Blake knew both of them well enough that this didn\u2019t surprise her a bit. Ruby dashed at Weiss and Yang dashed at Blake. Weiss prepared a wall of ice and Blake was about to use a clone to dodge the attack, when a couple explosive shots went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby used Crescent Rose\u2019s high powered rifle shot to blast her away from Weiss and toward Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang used a shotgun blast to do the same thing, except propelling herself toward Weiss. Because of the angel difference, she could avoid Weiss\u2019 Ice Wall. Blake\u2019s timing was also slightly off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was thrown backwards and Blake barely managed to parry Ruby\u2019s attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss!\u201d Blake yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stood up immediately and hit her rapier against the ground. A glyph appeared under Blake. As Ruby swiped at her with her scythe, Blake shot up and landed on another Glyph. Ruby looked up at her, only to notice that the ribbon of Blake\u2019s weapon was wrapped aroundh er leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Ruby moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Blake replied, and twisted her body as she yanked. Ruby skidded across the ground into Yang, whi was moving toward Weiss. The sudden impact knocked her over. It didn\u2019t do much damage, but a white glyph appeared under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d Yang muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Weiss mimicked Blake with a smile on her face. The glyph propelled them into the air and out of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t call it there and kept at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was awesome!\u201d Ruby said, after their training finally ended. They had practiced all sorts of teamwork options with different partners. \u201cWeiss\u2019 glyphs can do so much for us, and Blake\u2019s ribbon can tie up enemies and give us a boost. That combo using Weiss\u2019 ice as a ramp and Yang doing a dive attack was crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake was the one who suggested using my Glyphs as platforms for all of us to make use,\u201d Weiss said, patting Blake on the arm. \u201cAnd I can make fake ones for our opponents too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got this in the bag.\u201d Yang said, slamming her hands together and Blake nodded. Weiss and Ruby were walking to the changing rooms for a quick shower and getting out of their combat clothes, when Blake tugged at Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Yang said, shrugging. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Weiss is crushing on me.\u201d Blake admitted. Yang stared at her and burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Blake repeated incredulously. \u201cIt was awkward. Every time her skirt moved up, my body reacted. She even offered to go shopping with me to get some more maneuverable clothes like skirts and shorts\u2026 while looking directly at\u2026 this thing.\u201d She gestured with a hand down to her crotch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is pretty impressive.\u201d Yang admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it.\u201d Blake snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to deal with this headache and now, every time I see her and she\u2019s trying to get my attention, my body reacts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could always surrender and swap back.\u201d Yang suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d Blake snapped back. \u201cI\u2019m winning this and getting you back tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird seeing Vomit Boy grow balls.\u201d Yang said and Blake glared at her for that line. \u201cWell, you could take my advice and see if\u2026 relieving yourself will help with the constant urges. Guys can only do so much before their flaccid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssuming Jaune\u2019s endurance isn\u2019t as high as the rest of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it is, I want to know.\u201d Yang said seriously. \u201cMight be worth seeing up close later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stared at her and Yang winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can always help you deal with Ice Queen.\u201d Yang said. \u201cWe could Life Swap. You and I will still see ourselves with our bodies, just wearing each other clothes, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally yes,\u201d Blake said. \u201cSince we did a Body Swap first, that should be the case. You will have your body and live my life. They will just see you as me with Jaune\u2019s body. They would see me as you with Pyrrha\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let Ice Queen down easy.\u201d Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake doubted this. A lot. Knowing Yang, she would do something stupid. The last thing she needed was Yang to accept Weiss\u2019 advancements and then swap back. This option carried a lot of risk, but in the off chance Yang actually pulled through, she wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the flirting anymore. There was also the risk of Yang upsetting Weiss and making things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019d rather not have you in control of my life.\u201d Blake sighed and headed towards the changing room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say Blakey, but you should definitely use that body before you switch back.\u201d Yang teased as she followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was empty except for Ruby and Weiss who had already showered. Blake tried her best not look but just a glance made her body react. She was going to forego the shower this time around and just change. As she unzipped her jacket she noticed, Weiss glance over and then away. Blake could only sigh and keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLookin\u2019 good Blake!\u201d Yang teased as showered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake replied with a hiss and put a new shirt on. Now came the part she absolutely dreaded, changing her pants and underwear. She took a deep breath and unzipped her pants, letting them drop the floor. She looked up to see Weiss turn away and continue to get dressed. Just the thought of Weiss looking at her package made Blake\u2019s body reacts more. She looked down to see her underwear sticking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swiftly pulled them down, her body refusing to let it stay. She looked to avoid looking at it but could see Weiss\u2019 face was flushed red. She grabbed the replacement pair and slid them on, still sporting a large tent like before. She promptly put her pants on and adjusted them; at this point, she just wanted to get out of Weiss\u2019 view. Slipping into her books, she quickly exited waited for her team. She sat outside and turned her attention to her scroll. Ruby was the first one out and took a seat next to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t team together today Blake but maybe tomorrow we can.\u201d Ruby said cheerfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we could make a great team.\u201d Blake replied, giving a soft smile. Ruby seemed to be the only person her body did not get aroused by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kept discussing and devising ways for them to work together as a 2-person team. Before long Weiss and Yang exited and walked over to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you two ready to get some dinner?\u201d Weiss asked as she glanced at Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I\u2019m starving!\u201d Ruby said excitedly as she hopped up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood the faster we eat, the faster you can finish your homework.\u201d Weiss added, crossing her arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s excitement quickly faded as the team went to dinner. It was by far the least awkward meal Blake has had since getting Jaune\u2019s boy earlier. The team discussed what they could improve on from the training, classes, and the upcoming tournament more. Weiss occasionally looked at Blake, but Blake was able to subdue a majority of her body\u2019s hormones and enjoy meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in the room, Blake took her usual spot on her bed and read her book, trying to pass the time and put this day behind her. Weiss was helping Ruby finish up her homework across the room and Yang was playing on her scroll above Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang popped her head over the edge of her bed and smiled and Blake. \u201cDo you want to do one last swap before the day ends?\u201d She asked with a devious smile on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Say goodbye to Pyrrha\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww.\u201d Yang fake cried. \u201cGuess I should explore every knock and cranny tonight before I sleep. Don\u2019t mind the noise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going easy on you tomorrow,\u201d Blake warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh, there\u2019s nothing you can do to throw me off.\u201d Yang huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake bit her lip and remained silent. She was thinking hard about what to do to mess with Yang. She had been interested in trying to remote some more, but after a big swap with Jaune, she wasn\u2019t really sure what to do. Maybe some new Personal Info Swaps tomorrow to try them out. She was only half paying attention to her book. It wasn\u2019t her typical romance novel because they caused her discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Weiss finally went to bed and Yang crashed not long afterwards. Blake put her book away and laid there silently, making sure her teammates were asleep. She finally heard Yang\u2019s snoring and Ruby\u2019s sleep talking at last. Getting up without making a sound, Blake crept into the bathroom and shut the door behind her. She turned on the low light as not to wake the others and then she sat down on the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity and feelings the entire day broke her restraint. Taking a deep breath, she lowered her pants. The boxers she was wearing did not do a great job hiding the large bump in the front. This was the last chance she had to stop. That moment passed when Blake grabbed some lotion and tissues. Taking another deep breath, Blake yanked down her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fully erect member sprung to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could only stare for a moment, so the size finally got to her. She had only been glancing at it, with an occasional passing touch. Blake was no stranger to porn and the books she read were more than enough for her to know how guys did this. Now she was going to experience it firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo pun intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squirted some lotion into her hands, rubbed them together, and then used one hand to grip Jaune\u2019s dick. She flinched at the feeling and then relaxed. Slowly, she rubbed her hand up and down, feeling the pleasure in waves running up her body. The lotion was being worked into the skin, softening it up. A low moaned escaped her lips. She swapped hands and worked the lotion from the other on in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was beginning to see why guys enjoyed jacking off so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot less work than pleasuring her normal self. The sensations she was feeling was also different, which added to the pleasure. Her hands began to go faster automatically, as she subconsciously wanted more. Pressure was building up in her balls and she knew what that meant. She didn\u2019t want it to end too soon, but she couldn\u2019t stop. Her determination was to keep herself from releasing the mental wall so her hand, which was moving up and down her cock like a machine, could continue pleasing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, her wall broke as the pressure grew too high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Blake gasped, as cum shot from her position. It hit the counter opposite of the toilet and some of their girl\u2019s supplies. \u201cWow\u2026. That was quick and intense.\u201d She panted a bit. \u201cYang was right. I should have done that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise by the door alerted herself to someone\u2019s presence. Blake had not been paying attention at all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once their toiletries were thoroughly cleaned and she wiped her new appendage down she washed her hands, pausing to look at herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune stared back, which was normal all things considered, but what wasn't normal was the dopey smile he, or rather, <i>she</i> wore. Looking at her flaccid member she smiled, wondering just how long it took to 'recharge'. Surely one more go before bed wouldn't be bad? Yang was out like a light and she could probably get away with another. Maybe if she just got one of her books...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang wasn't the only person she shared a room with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did Blake turn did she spot Weiss. Where her own face had since returned to normal Weiss' was flushed, biting her lower lip. Blue eyes shifted nervously from her face to her crotch, and to Blake's surprise and alarm both the heiress appeared to be rubbing her thighs together in her nightgown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Weiss, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake...\" She clamped her mouth shut, watching a myriad of emotions flash across the demure girl's face. Hesitation, uncertainty, frustration, excitement, and everything in between. \"Blake,\" Weiss began again, licking her lips. \"I... I didn't know you were up. I needed to... To use the restroom and...\" Her eyes flit down to Blake's crotch again then shot back to her face, cheeks darkening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way this was happening right? Maybe she was asleep? Maybe she'd had a 'wet dream' and this was all just some perverted fantasy conjured up by Jaune's body. Except it was her body right now. Didn't that make her a pervert? Blake's thoughts came to an abrupt halt when Weiss stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind her. Backing up until her hips hit the sink she watched the heiress uncertainly, wishing she could use her own Semblance and vanish. No such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Listen, I... I can explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You don't have to.\" Weiss took a deep breath and looked up at Blake, one hand grasping her chest and the other pulling at it around her waist. \"L-Listen, Blake...

She had been stressed all day in Jaune\u2019s body with Yang\u2019s teasing that she was having an erotic dream. The question was why Weiss? A couple times Yang had appeared after some days she walked around topless looking for her bra, but they had never been like this. Weiss was usually a monster in Blake\u2019s dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why did Blake find her so alluring?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2026I like you, Blake.\u201d Weiss finally said and the last scrap of Blake\u2019s sanity broke.

Due to the remote, everyone believed that Blake always was female but had a male body. What made things even weirder was that Weiss knew Blake was a Faunus and that she was a Schnee. There would be so many issues if Blake did like her like that. Blake was straight, right? She liked guys. That should have been the case, but no matter how many times she told herself that, she was still getting an erection from Weiss\u2019 expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2026 can we go out?\u201d Weiss asked. \u201cJust the two of us. Let me show you the way I feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, Blake was getting powerful d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from how Jaune always tried to get Weiss to go on a date. However, before she could reply, she noticed Weiss\u2019 hand was slowly going down her chest, toward her unprotected member. Words failed her as Weiss\u2019 hand slowly descended.

Blake's eyes looked down at her teammate's chest, Weiss was very conservative when she was getting dress and rarely let the anyone see her naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up Blake!\" She thought to herself, trying to escape this nightmare but to no avail. Blake couldn't believe what was happening. She squirmed as Weiss continued to press into her and massage her cock. She could feel the pressure start to build again. All Blake could do was look into the mirror to see Jaune's face, her body was running on auto-pilot like before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss released Blake's cock and stood in front of her, slowly taking off the white nightgown. Blake starred in awe as Weiss stood before her completely naked. Before long, Weiss was pressing back into Blake and stroking her cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....what do you say Blake?\" Weiss asked as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake still couldn't respond, she managed to shut her eyes but quickly opened them when she felt Weiss' lips connect with her's. Blake was greeted by Weiss' blue eyes and her body reacted by wrapping her arms around Weiss's waist. A hand slowly crept down to Weiss' butt and gave a soft squeeze, making Weiss moan softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How....about Friday?\" Blake softly spoke to much of Weiss' surprise, which led to a smile forming on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Weiss whispered as she kissed Blake again and continued to relieve Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a couple minutes the pressure was too much and she shot whatever she had left, getting some on Weiss. Weiss wiped her hands off and grabbed her nightgown off the floor, getting dressed before leaving Blake alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's heart was pounding, she wasn't sure if it was from Weiss or her body recovering from her second time. She cleaned up whatever mess she had made, still unsure about what just happened between her and her teammate. </span></div></div>",

Silently, as to not wake up Ruby or Yang, Blake crawled back into bed. Confusion racked her mind as she thought about what happened. The remote made everyone but her and Yang see her with Jaune\u2019s body as normal. That meant Ruby and Weiss joined a team with her like this. So maybe in this reality, Weiss had been trying to get with her for a while and finally got the nerve. Since they hadn\u2019t been dating beforehand, she could only make the move now. It made sense and Blake knew tomorrow would be awkward when they saw each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned over in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she\u2019ll wake up tomorrow and find out this was all a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>The next morning\u2026</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, hey Blake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sunk below the covers as someone poked her cheek. She wanted to sleep more. Someone poked her again and she hissed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be. You asked for it, Blake.\u201d There was a thump and then Blake\u2019s covers were yanked away from her. She opened her eyes and looked up to see Pyrrha\u2019s face grinning down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally awake, Kitty Kat.\u201d Yang said. Blake blinked and finally remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe nice,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cShe\u2019s up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have class today, so don\u2019t take too long.\u201d Weiss warned. Blake\u2019s eyes snapped open and she looked over at her teammate. Weiss was deliberately not looking at her. Though, Blake could see Weiss\u2019 face was slightly red. Blake\u2019s stomach twisted up in knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night had not been a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMondays suck.\u201d Yang muttered, jumping back up on her bed. \u201cYou two can go on ahead, I\u2019ll wait for Blake\u2019s lazy butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take too long or you won\u2019t have time for breakfast.\u201d Ruby said. \u201cReady Weiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Weiss said and as they left, her eyes darted over to Blake. Not at her male parts, but directly into her eyes, before they disappeared out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Yang said, the second they were alone. \u201cYou managed to last an entire day in Vomit Boy\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was\u2026 unusual at first.\u201d Blake admitted, getting dressed. \u201cBut besides the constant erections, it wasn\u2019t really that different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t help that Weiss likes the new you, did it.\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it made things awkward.\u201d Blake rubbed the back of her head and felt the difference in hair again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to swap back?\u201d Yang asked. \u201cUnless you want to keep that body. Don\u2019t you like Jaune\u2019s secret Master Sword?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Blake grabbed the remote and made sure Yang was touching it too. She hit the Reset Option and both of them were back to normal. Blake no longer had Jaune\u2019s body and Fox\u2019s clothes while Yang no longer had Pyrrha\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww.\u201d Yang complained. \u201cI liked Pyrrha\u2019s body. I gave her mine, so it wasn\u2019t like she had nothing.\u201d She grinned and stretched. \u201cI have to admit, I missed my own body a little.\u201d She eyed Blake. \u201cMissing your dick already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Blake denied. Part of her had begun to get used to it, so the space in her legs was weird for a few minutes. \u201cBut I have been thinking about what your dare is going to be.\u201d She smirked. \u201cDon\u2019t think I forgot about all the hassle you put me through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring it on, Blakey.\u201d Yang challenged. \u201cEven if you give me Cardin\u2019s body, I won\u2019t falter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Blake mused, as she finished getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a couple things on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she had plans for Yang. Blake wasn\u2019t naturally a vengeful person, but Yang was asking for it all day yesterday. And it wasn\u2019t like Blake didn\u2019t want to do more swaps. No, she was too busy worrying about Weiss. Technically, the remote only gave her original body back, so what happened last night still stood. Blake could suddenly recall a set of memories. One that actually happened and one that was like watching through a TV set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night, the memory showed Weiss had touched her when she was in her original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant the reality they were in still had Weiss asking Blake out. She didn\u2019t know how this would work. Weiss was interested in her because of her male body, right? Why would she be interested in Blake now? These were questions she didn\u2019t have answers now. Looking over at Yang, who was browsing a game on her Scroll, Blake debated telling her what happened. Yang would laugh and embarrass Blake for sure, but after that, she might actually have good insight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could continue to think about it for a bit, pretend to be lost in thought about Yang\u2019s punishment dare, and meet Weiss and Ruby for breakfast. It might help to see what exactly the situation was now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been watching Weiss to see what she would do now that she didn\u2019t have Jaune\u2019s body. Maybe Weiss wasn\u2019t as sexually attracted to her anymore. Though, she had the memories of what happened last night with her original body now. It was possible now that Weiss asked her out and she accepted, she wasn\u2019t as nervous anymore. She would have to wait and see what happens on Friday. Or if Weiss mentions it during the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, she really should focus on Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was what to swap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Yang was more outgoing than Blake was. She wouldn\u2019t consider a simple swap a dare and laugh at Blake\u2019s attempt. If she swapped him with a guy, Yang would just constantly make dick jokes. Yang might suffer a little if she swapped her on Cardin\u2019s team, but then Blake would have to deal with one of his teammates as her partner. That was more of a punishment for her. Blake had to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang did say she wasn\u2019t interested in swapping personalities with Weiss. That might be fun to see. Though, if they swapped personalities, would Yang like her or was that just started because of Blake\u2019s male body. Weiss had asked her out, so a personality swap shouldn\u2019t change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it seemed tame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a better punishment? What did Blake not like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer hit her like a ton of bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The demon!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake immediately thought about Zwei, Ruby's pet corgi. What if Yang swapped with him? Maybe the body? Or a Life Swap. Or owner? Ruby would treat Yang like a pet and maybe Zwei as a sister? Personal Info swaps were supposed to have some unexpected results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Blake looked around for more inspiration before finally making her decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out of all their teachers, she was the strictest and did not tolerate tardiness.

Yes, Blake knew it was Yang, but at the same time, this excited her on two fronts. The first was Blake hated that dog and watching it lose was satisfying. Second, it was Yang and this was payback for all the teasing that happened yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way Yang could win in her current state, was there?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally Yang was the one to spar with Pyrrha. Both of them were the top of the year. Then Nora and Blake would be slightly below them. Too many times Blake had been on the receiving end of the energetic ginger\u2019s hammer. Then there was the case of which Pyrrha\u2019s Semblance was polarity. She could literally control metal, which meant her weapons were useless. The only thing was she didn\u2019t use it openly, so Blake only had to worry about small adjustments to her weapon. Still, it meant she was never really going to get a good hit on Pyrrha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck.\u201d Pyrrha said as they took their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too.\u201d Blake replied. The nice thing was Pyrrha never rubbed it in. She was a hard worker and always treated people with respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegin!\u201d Glynda announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kept her distance and fired a barrage of bullets at Pyrrha. Most reflected off her shield as she closed the gap. A few glanced off her Aura doing minimal damage. Pyrrha jabbed her spear into Blake, which she just managed to dodge, only o get knocked back with a shield bash. Blake pushed off the ground to minimize the impact, but Pyrrha was not a slouch. She charged forward and kept delivering blow after blow to keep Blake from stabilizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jab went straight through her and Blake\u2019s body shimmered before running red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha\u2019s eyes widened in shock as an explosion engulfed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was on the other side of the area now. Her Semblance to clone herself to take attacks was a handy skill. Combining it with Dust added additional affects, such as fire making explosions. She could hear Ruby cheer, but couldn\u2019t rest yet. The battle was far from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the smoke, a shield flew at her and Blake ducked, only to see Pyrrha already on her. That was a champion for you. She never let her opponent set the pace. Blake got hit cleanly and a good chunk of her Aura went down. She dodged a fatel blow with her clone and struck back. Only for her blade to miss by inches due to her Semblance. She then was hit several more times in the space of only a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinner, Miss Nikos!\u201d Glynda declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake put her weapon away and sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you know what I go through.\u201d Yang said to Blake in an \u2018I told you so\u2019 manner. \u201cThat\u2019s why I hate fighting her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explosion was awesome!\u201d Ruby assured Blake. \u201cShe didn\u2019t see that coming at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to thank Weiss for lending me some Dust a few days ago to practice that,\u201d Blake admitted. Weiss smiled and her cheeks turned ever so slightly pink. Was that a sign there was still affects from the previous day\u2019s swap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Rose vs Mr. Ren.\u201d Glynda called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m up!\u201d Ruby cheered and zipped down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d Yang pushed, her small puppy paws on the table. She was sitting on a book so she could see. \u201cLet me swap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said after class.\u201d Blake muttered. \u201cBesides, you got your second swap. You can talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was your choice so you could understand me.\u201d Yang pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Blake conceded. \u201cWhat did you want? The same rule that applied to me though. No swapping out of the body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d Yang muttered darkly. It was obvious to Blake that\u2019s what she was planning. \u201cWhat about lives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s okay,\u201d Blake admitted. \u201cPeople would see you as whoever you target, but you would still have Zwei\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I kind of want to try personality swap too,\u201d Yang admitted. \u201cMight help with my situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d Blake murmured uncommittedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, Personal Information could have so much fun,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cSwapping with someone who has a relationship. Always wanted to know if Coco and Velvet were like that. Maybe Pyrrha\u2019s Semblance too. Would make grabbing and moving things easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was a little disappointed Yang was adjusting so easy to Zwei\u2019s body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was something Yang would do and Blake was the type of person who didn\u2019t want that girl controlling their TV and other electronics. Weiss\u2019 eyes met Blake\u2019s for a moment and her cheeks flushed before looking back down at the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake began to realize Weiss had been purposely avoiding her.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nIs she embarrassed over last night?</i> Blake thought, but she couldn\u2019t push the issue now.

As far as Blake knew, they still had that \u2018date\u2019 on Friday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake spent the rest of class absentmindedly watching the fights or watching Yang text Coco. Even with Zwei\u2019s puppy paws, Yang was still able to text easily. Weiss glanced over at Blake once for half a second before deliberately avoiding eye contact again.

Questions would be asked that she did not want to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally!\u201d Yang cheered as the bell rang. \u201cFood and then I need to go meet Coco.\u201d She hopped down off the stool and walked next to her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m starving too.\u201d Ruby said. \u201cRen was tough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone had to win from our team today,\u201d Weiss commented. \u201cGood job, Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t fight,\u201d Yang pointed out, as they entered the cafeteria. \u201cBlake had to fight P-money and I just had an off day.

As much as Blake wanted people to see her for her, not for her being a Faunus. She hated to say that she judged Weiss as a Schnee who looked down at Faunus before getting to know her. Things had not been pretty, but they finally settled down and the two of them became friends. Thanks a lot to their innocent younger team leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss, can I ask you something?\u201d Blake said, glancing up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Weiss looked up from her Scroll. \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hesitated a little bit. She had to ask because her own memories were a little blurry. This was also a chance to learn more about Weiss in this reality and how Blake being in Jaune\u2019s body changed things. It was still awkward though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkipping over last night\u2026\u201d That was embarrassing for both of them and Weiss flushed. \u201cWhen did you\u2026 er\u2026 start having feels for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss blinked and looked surprised at the question. Her Scroll lowered as she thought about Blake\u2019s question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure when it started,\u201d She finally answered slowly. \u201cI guess I always thought you were attractive in a way. More so than Yang\u2026 but don\u2019t tell her I think she\u2019s even a little bit attractive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLips are sealed. Her ego is inflated enough as is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shared a small laugh with Blake and then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think after the incident with\u2026 your old organization and we finally talked, I realized I liked you\u2026 more as a friend.\u201d Weiss took a deep breath. \u201cYou weren\u2019t afraid to talk back to me. Not in an insulting way, but pointing out when I was mistaken. Most people would either just agree due to my family name, or just argue for the sake of arguing. I don\u2019t like admit when I\u2019m wrong, but I can do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou apologized to Ruby,\u201d Blake remembered. \u201cAnd you also forgave me after I ran off without explaining myself.\u201d Her eyes lowered for a moment. \u201cI think\u2026 being in Beacon, away from your environment back home\u2026 has been good for you. Both of us actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 think so too.\u201d Weiss agreed. \u201cIt was strange to adjust, but I like it hear. I like our team. I like you\u2026\u201d She flushed again. \u201cTeam JNPR is nice too, even if Arc is annoying.\u201d Her eyes brightened. \u201cIf things go well this Friday\u2026 maybe he will give up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to him before,\u201d Blake said. \u201cBesides some confidence issues, he\u2019s considerate. Your initial reactions to it might have been a little over the top. It would have been better to be honest and just tell him you don\u2019t feel that way about him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish I had known this then.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI was afraid of asking you, you know? I realized how much courage Arc\u2026 Jaune had in asking me after all those rejections. It\u2019s nerve wrecking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight have been easier since we were both half asleep.\u201d Blake admitted, causing Weiss to nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir talks sort of died out as Weiss checked her Scroll and Blake turned to her book. Though, her brain was thinking more of what she just learned. Weiss liked her in this world for a while, and Blake had no way to confirm if that was true before the Body Swap. She might have to be careful about swaps in the future. Either way, Blake wasn\u2019t sure what she thought about this. Few people knew that Blake was bi and actually liked girls and boys. Weiss was very attractive in her own right too. The Schnee were known for their almost ethereal beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a Schnee and a Faunus was certain to draw some raised eyebrows once Blake came out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blake replied with a sigh and picked Yang up and placing her on the chair next to her. Immediately Blake noticed that Yang and Coco had done some extra activities during lunch: Yang's fur was more of a mess than usual, her clothes looked like they were put on half-assed, and she smelled worse than Zwei normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you make it to class on time\" Weiss said as she crossed her legs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here aren't I?\" Yang barked back before turning her attention to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Yang?\" Blake asked as she noticed her teammate staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how you could hate having a dick, even this one is amazing\" Yang whispered with a smirk on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did not\" Blake whispered back, just for Yang to nod her head yes. Blake wasn't too sure about how to react to her friends claim, she knew she was disgusted but she also knew how good it felt to relief a dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blake could really respond Professor Oobleck walked into the room and the class begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his lecture went on, Blake pulled the remote of her pocket and discreetly looking it over to no avail since Yang noticed it right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha doin' Blakey? Thinking about swapping?\" Yang asked with her tongue hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" Blake sighed as she looked at Yang <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blake hit the button and swapped their voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s this for a new voice?\u201d Blake purred as she shot a smirk at Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t mind, I was curious about how you sounded in bed anyway.\u201d Yang shot back causing Blake\u2019s face to flush red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think a new outfit is in order.\u201d Blake said turn her attention to Yang and looked her friend up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea Blakey. Who do you got in mind?\u201d Yang asked as her tongue rolled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm I don\u2019t know\u201d Blake replied looking around the room but pointing the remote at Yang. She discreetly hit the wardrobe swap, switching their clothes. Even with Yang holding the remote, she didn\u2019t notice the swap because of the fur. Blake pointed the remote at Weiss and swapped, giving Weiss Yang\u2019s attire that she pulled off very well, much to Blake\u2019s surprise. She then pointed it back to Yang and swapped, giving Yang Weiss\u2019s snow-white outfit. Blake quickly pointed it at Ruby and swapped. She actually didn\u2019t mind wearing Ruby\u2019s skirt or boots but the cape was a little annoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking good Blake.\u201d Yang barked still obvious to Blake\u2019s secret swap. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d take clothes from my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s something different right.\u201d Blake purred, holding in her laughter.</span></div></div>",

You can make some weird sounds with it during the right stimulation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Gross.\u201d Blake gagged. \u201cI still don\u2019t know if you\u2019re being serious or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you won\u2019t?\u201d Yang shrugged and her tongue flopped out of her mouth. \u201cCoco\u2019s a machine though, so maybe more today. You should try out a guy\u2019s equipment some more. Maybe I\u2019ll have you do that tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah.\u201d Blake shivered, though part of her was interested in examining that a little bit more. Her eyes darted to Weiss, who was still diligently taking notes, like what Blake should have been doing. If she had one, things might get weird. Yang would love her to go that far though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot to experiment while you can,\u201d Yang whispered, her dog ears flat on her head. \u201cThe remote just showed up, maybe it can disappear too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn\u2019t like the sound of that. If it did vanish, they would be stuck with these swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing to do anymore swaps?\u201d Yang whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a name,\u201d Blake whispered. \u201cOr a personality swap. Haven\u2019t done those and they won\u2019t interfere with my current ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonality swap is awesome,\u201d Yang agreed. \u201cYou were a part animal. Just do someone completely different than-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you two PLEASE keep it down.\u201d Weiss hissed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to concentrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d They apologized and quickly lowered their heads to get back to work. Oobleck had turned to look at them. Class then passed in silence between them, as Blake didn\u2019t get a chance to use the remote again. Once it was done, they all rushed out happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we sure his Semblance isn\u2019t speed?\u2019 Ruby asked, well away from Oobleck\u2019s classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, his thermos is just pure espresso.\u201d Yang assured them, walking a little funny with Weiss\u2019 high heeled shoes on her back paw. Blake enjoyed that. When they eventually swapped back, Yang would remember wearing them while oblivious if she touched the remote. \u201cNow, if you excuse me, class is over and I\u2019m going to meet up with Coco and\u2026 finish something we started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun!\u201d Ruby said. \u201cWeiss, want to head to Vale?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose, class is done.\u201d Weiss agreed and turned to Blake. \u201cWant to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to take advantage of the quiet room and read,\u201d Blake replied. \u201cThank you. Maybe next time?\u201d They nodded and headed out while Blake decided what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her wanted to know if Yang was actually doing with Coco what she was saying they were doing. That would be a weird site to see. Kind of perverted, but Yang was taking advantage of the swap in a way Blake didn\u2019t expect. There was a chance she was lying to mess with her too. Blake could also use the remote for another swap, maybe the personality and name like she planned. Or\u2026 she could try out Pyrrha\u2019s body. Every stepped told her how strong and athletic Pyrrha was. Maybe some training was in order. She could even swap weapons and/or Semblances for added fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was right about one thing, she needed to experiment a little bit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she looked around she noticed Ruby and Weiss walked back towards their dorm room instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I guess since Ruby has my personality she wants to go upstairs and read\" Blake snickered as she looked at the two, her eyes becoming fixated on Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, Weiss looks as cute from behind as she does in the front.\" Blake thought before realizing what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked around, holding in her joy as she clinched the remote tightly to her chest. Since classes were done for the day most of the students were either heading off to Vale, getting some extra training in, or going back to their rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Blake wanted to go around and swap more she wanted to get a better look at her body. She rushed back to her room and somehow got there before Ruby and Weiss, being greeted by Zwei with his naked Yang body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Zwei!\" Blake cheerfully greeted him as she began petting him, getting distracted from what she went to the room to do. \"Even though you're a naked Yang you're still super cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Weiss and Ruby entered the room to see Blake and Zwei laying in the middle of the room. \"Hi Ruby! Hi Weiss!\" Blake greeted as the two as they walked in, Weiss took a seat at her desk and Ruby climbed onto her bed and started reading a novel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rubbed Zwei's belly before remembering why she came up to the room in the first place. She hoped up and walked into the bathroom, locking the door behind her. She then spend the next 10 minutes checking herself out, flexing and playing with her new hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool, Ruby's personality goes great with this remote.\" She joyfully said into the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what I should do next?

Though, they had a date scheduled for Friday and would it be clingy to keep wanting to hang out with her during the week leading up to it? Blake found herself much more attracted to Weiss then before. Maybe Ruby had an unrequited crush on Weiss and now Blake felt that feeling.

Reese\u2019s hair didn\u2019t really fit Pyrrha\u2019s body, but it was funny. Coco\u2019s voice sort of fit, but Blake forgot about it for a moment. Wearing Ruby\u2019s clothes with her personality made her feel comfortable at lease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat to do? I know.

No, Blake needed something more spy-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could become a super spy with the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink, Blake. Think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake went over what she knew. She knew where Coco\u2019s room was, as she had been there with Velvet a couple times before. Going through the door was impossible, but how about the window? Blake could climb up the nearby tree and peak in. The risk was Coco or Yang looking outside and seeing her. She needed something worthy of being a super spy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the bathroom, still debating, when a bird flew past her window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Blake realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it?\u201d Weiss asked, turning to look at her.

She and Yang proved that already. What Blake was doing was going to do a quick Life Swap. This would make the world see her as a bird and the bird as her. Keeping her body though would allow her to use the remote. Blake found one sitting in the tree outside Coco\u2019s dorm and Blake aimed the remote. She fired and the next moment, she found herself sitting in the true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHH!\u201d Blake cried out in surprise, but no one really noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple other students walked by her previous life. The bird was sitting there with Reese\u2019s hair style and Ruby\u2019s clothes. Blake forgot the life swapped the hair too. She shook her head and climbed the tree. Maybe she should have done bodies so she could fly too. It was easy enough to climb though and Blake had a perfect view into Coco\u2019s dorm.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hope they have cookies tonight!\" Ruby shouted jumping off her bed and rushing to Weiss's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Blake closed the door she got a message from Yang on her scroll.<br>\r\n<i>Hey, I'll meet you guys at dinner, just finished cleaning Coco ;P</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's expression turn to disgust at Yang's text before catching up with her teammates as they made their way to the cafeteria.</span></div></div>",

Now Yang found a way to make it weird and fun for her. She wished she had that kind of creativity. Anything weird to her was completely accidental. Like having Weiss fall for her when she had a dick. They still had a date that Friday. She sighed and looked in the mirror ,seeing herself wearing Ruby\u2019s clothes over Pyrrha\u2019s body with Reese\u2019 hair and Coco\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang wasn\u2019t lying when she said she was going to hear Blake\u2019s sexy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I get her back?\u201d Blake muttered, knowing Yang was going to get to choose the swaps tomorrow. Movement caught her eye and she saw a naked Yang walking on all fours. It was Zwei with Yang\u2019s body. \u201cShould have swapped Zwei\u2019s food with hers. I\u2019ll save that in case Yang goes all out tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout having a dog\u2019s body, Zwei was actually bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I might be able to have a little fun.\u201d Blake grinned and undid her body changes. She was now back in her body. Then she aimed at Zwei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light and Blake saw herself naked with a collar on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that was a little off putting to her, but she knew everyone would see it as normal. Instead, she turned to the mirror and saw Yang wearing the uniform. Flicking Yang\u2019s long Yellow hair behind her shoulder, she rushed out to join Ruby and Weiss, making some excuses why she lagged behind. They grabbed their food and Blake got to examine Yang\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was buffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was lithe, but Yang worked hard to get the muscles she had. Her fighting style relied on it and she didn\u2019t lose to any guys in physical confrontation. Nora was the only one who could really match in one on one in pure physical might. They sat down and began to eat, when Yang appeared, holding her tray in her doggy mouth as she sat down next to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey all!\u201d Yang greeted happily. \u201cJust got back having some fun with Coco.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot while we\u2019re eating you barbarian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww, Yang.\u201d Ruby shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell dad you\u2019re kissing girls again instead of training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can have downtime, right Blakey?\u201d Yang winked at Blake, who ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo anyone have plans this evening?\u201d Ruby asked and Blake had a sudden idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was thinking of getting a hair cut,\u201d Blake replied. \u201cIt\u2019s getting a little long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Weiss was surprised. \u201cSince you work so hard to maintain it, I thought you wouldn\u2019t want to cut it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, don\u2019t do anything you might regret.\u201d Yang added, not aware it was her original hair. She thought Blake was still swapped with Reese in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a thought.\u201d Blake assured them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At this moment Blake thought of a way to mess with Yang. She held Yang tightly into her borrowed chest, feeling her small tail wag against her body.

You really stacked that body but remember it's my turn tomorrow.\" Yang cooed as they approached the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake put Yang down and opened the door. Weiss was standing over Ruby and tutoring her and Zwei was sleeping on Blake's bed.

No matter how devious Blake tried to be, Yang was much better than her. Blake had literally turned Yang into a dog and she found a way to enjoy herself.

Smiling to herself, knowing even if Yang never found out, she had won. Now she had to swap without anyone noticing. Taking a deep breath, she peaked out the bathroom door and aimed the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, she was back in Pyrrha\u2019s body and Yang in Zwei\u2019s body was cuddling against Zwei in Yang\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake laughed to herself and came out.

You\u2019ll still be considered you and normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t changed my race, even with a new body,\u201d Blake hissed. \u201cPeople will notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, the remote makes it seem normal, like me in a dog\u2019s body,\u201d Yang brushed off. \u201cBesides, you\u2019ll still have your bow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Blake sighed. \u201cFine, let\u2019s get the swaps done and then I can worry about the date after classes today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Yang cheered. \u201cLet\u2019s go with Winter, as it\u2019s more hilarious for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate you.\u201d Blake muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you too, Blakey.\u201d Yang hugged Blake while the girl just cross her arms and huffed, trying not to show that she DID indeed appreciate Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Weiss is suspicious about the remote, so we should be careful of showing it to her,\u201d Blake mentioned. \u201cI can\u2019t take it on my date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d Yang laughed. \u201cWhile you and Weiss are on a date, I\u2019ll have some fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stared at her, not trusting her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep the swaps tame,\u201d Yang promised. \u201cAnd I wont cause issues with you and Weiss. I\u2019ll wait until you both leave too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was still suspicious about Yang\u2019s accommodation. She obviously had an idea on what to use it for. Yet, there wasn\u2019t a lot she could do. Weiss would get upset if she brought it and Yang would look for it the moment Blake left if she hid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026 just please, don\u2019t do anything really bad.\u201d Blake sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to check out some lives,\u201d Yang assured her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, let\u2019s find the targets,\u201d Blake muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tailed Weiss who met her sister during a morning free period at school. It seemed like Winter was working with General Ironwood, so she was going to be in the school today. Ironwood was friends with her and Weiss, so when they didn\u2019t have classes, Weiss could chat with her sister. A quick shot from Blake caused her to have Winter\u2019s body. She then swapped body parts ears, so her ears were hidden under her bow on her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/Pga4iE9MDhYarYFy9\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/Pga4iE9MDhYarY...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice,\u201d Yang chuckled, looking Blake up and down. \u201cSeems like Winter\u2019s sister got the looks.\u201d Her eyes fell on Blake\u2019s new chest. \u201cYou should let her hair down sometime. Bet she looks hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m going to tell Weiss you said that about her sister.\u201d Blake teased back. \"Besides, I don't want to reveal my ears yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink she\u2019ll put a good word in for me?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll have some words for you for sure.\u201d Blake chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, we got one more main swap to do.\u201d Yang laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn\u2019t have a choice and followed. It wasn\u2019t hard to find Jaune. He had joined his team for breakfast and was sitting at a table. A quick shot with the remote and Blake felt the familiar bulge in her pants. However, before it could get more uncomfortable, she swapped pants and underwear with Jaune. She was no wearing jeans instead of her tight white shorts. There were boxers under there too, instead of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, she had to smile imagining Jaune with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeans don\u2019t show off your butt as much.\u201d Yang told her. \u201cStill nice though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake scowled at her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had the body of Weiss's sister, Winter, with Jaune's junk and her own cat ears. Despite everyone seeing her as normal, she felt anything but normal. She would slightly be okay with just being Winter with her cat ears but having Jaune's meat between her legs was something she wouldn't and couldn't get use to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the team was getting lunch Weiss pulled Blake aside to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I've already gone ahead booked our dinner reservations. It's one of the nice restaurants down in Vale. Which means you can't go out in those disgusting jeans.\" Weiss sternly said as she pointed at Blake's borrows jeans. <br>\r\n\"I'm suggesting we go we can quick run to a store and get you some new clothes before hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that sounds fine.\" Blake hesitantly spoke back, feeling her cock throb slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner isn't until 7 so we have plenty of time. I'll explain more when were about to head to Vale\" Weiss assured as the two continued to get lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school day was coming to a close, Weiss pulled Blake aside once again. This time the two were standing inside their dorm room, Weiss forcing Ruby and Yang to wait outside while they talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winter has arranged out transport down to Vale for the evening and tomorrow morning.\" Weiss stated <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...tomorrow morning?\" Blake said as she felt her heart sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, She also arrange for us to stay at a hotel close to the restaurant. She'd prefer us not traveling late at night. We have about 15 minutes to get down to the transport to meet Winter.\" Weiss added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door bursts open as Yang and Ruby fall onto the floor. Both girls stand up as quickly as possible and act as casually as possible. Weiss and Blake stare at the two sisters before making their way out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blakey, I think you're forgetting something.\" Yang cheerfully sang as she held her hand out for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake placed the remote in Yang's hand with a hiss before Weiss nudged her out the door. Blake could only look back at Yang to see her smiling back and Ruby taking an interest in the remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss and Blake arrived at the transport to see Winter standing there with Blake's body. She greeted the two and escorted them to the ship and down to Vale. She gave Weiss the pick-up time for the following day before departing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have roughly 2 hours before dinner and we need to get you out of those pants.\" Weiss stated as she walked in front of Blake and into a high end fashion store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's dick throbbed at Weiss's innuendo as she followed her into the store. The two browsed the clothing selection as both girls picked out clothes. Blake sticking to black, white, and purple colored clothes but more so picking out only pants. Weiss picked out her usual colors and styles very quickly, even picking out something for Blake; a black strapless dress and faded to purple at the bottom. As the two proceeded to checkout, Weiss insisted Blake wait outside the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't believe she only picked out shirts and pants, that's not like her.\"</i> Weiss thought as she told the cashier disregard those clothes; leaving only the dress Weiss picked out for her with some of her own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls quickly checked into the hotel and headed up to their room. Inside were two beds, which Blake let out a sigh of relief, Weiss proceeded into the bathroom to get changed, taking the bags inside with her. Coming out shortly after wearing a white dress with black flowers and heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ed/51/8f/ed518fdebbb3e45c960671d3abd9a12f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ed/51/8f/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hopped up and walked into the bathroom, locking the door and disrobing. She quickly changed her bra and panties and dug through the bag, only to discover that the clothes she picked out were gone. She held up the dress Weiss picked out and held it up to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose this isn't the worst dress. Weiss does have an eye for nice clothes\" Blake sighed putting it on, looking at herself in the mirror and the very apparent bulge. Lastly Blake let down her white hair and slide on her heels. She walked out to see Weiss sitting on a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go Blake?\" Weiss cheerfully smiled.</span></div></div>",

She was in Winter\u2019s body right now, which was awkward knowing Weiss was flirting with her. The black dress with purple hem wasn\u2019t really Winter\u2019s sort of outfit, but Blake didn\u2019t really change clothes except the pants from Jaune, so the world would see her black, white, and purple as her normal style still. Her eyes twitched under her bow and the equipment in her panties jerked a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Blake decided to go with the a simple response. \u201cYou look nice too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss seemed happy with that answer and Blake relaxed. Honestly, this was her first date in a long time and she was a little awkward about it. Her last relationship with a Bull Faunus did not end will. They kept talking light until they got to restaurant. It was a little fancier than any Blake would go to, but it seemed right up Weiss\u2019 ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI chose this place because they have a wide selection of seafood.\u201d Weiss assured Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Blake blinked in surprise. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you were a fan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI enjoy seafood now and then,\u201d Weiss assured her. \u201cBut I know you like it.\u201d Blake flushed slightly. They scanned the menu, ordered, and their talks slowly turned a little serious. \u201cIs something wrong, Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong?\u201d Blake was confused. \u201cNo? This is actually going really well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed distracted today,\u201d Weiss pointed out. \u201cAnd\u2026 I want to apologize for leaving your choices at the clothing store. They were outfits you normally don\u2019t wear so I was surprised you were selecting something so\u2026 er\u2026 as Coco would say, unfashionable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake bit the corner of her lip. How was she to tell Weiss that she wanted pants because of Jaune\u2019s dick between her legs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLately, I\u2019ve been getting some looks about my\u2026 equipment down below,\u201d Blake replied slowly. \u201cI sort of became a little more conscious of it. Wearing pants helps hide it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked away. She knew she had been looking lately too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame you,\u201d Blake added quickly. \u201cI actually appreciate you accept me for not only that but\u2026\u201d Her eyes looked up and her bow twitched. Weiss nodded quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know we had some arguments when you first revealed that, but I want you to know you\u2019re my friend and your race doesn\u2019t change it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn\u2019t help chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot of people would be surprised to see a Schnee with a Faunus.\u201d She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not my father!\u201d Weiss huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no you aren\u2019t.\u201d Blake agreed with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re our resident Ice Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn\u2019t help laughing lightly and Weiss begun to laugh too. The food eventually came and Blake really enjoyed it. It was one of those five course dinners and it was all perfect. The wine they drank was pleasant and not too strong either. The fish was amazing and it even ended with a delicious tiramisu. Blake also enjoyed her company with Weiss. Weiss could be kind of aggravating sometimes, but she mellowed out since meeting them. Blake wouldn\u2019t trade any of her team for anyone, but looking at Weiss, she felt weird. It wasn't the alcohol either, as being Huntresses they could drink earlier.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nMaybe I do like her like this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaunus tended to be a little more open to sexual experiences than humans, though being in Winter\u2019s body made things awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer underwear straining against her hardening junk between her legs didn\u2019t help either.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blake had to ensure she didn't say anything about how Yang was practically tormenting her with the remote, as well has tug on her dress occasionally as her hardening junk was starting to show. As the girls decided to go back to hotel, Blake was beginning to notice the effects the wine was having on Weiss. Before leaving the table Blake saw the empty wine bottle they had left and started to worry slightly. Weiss wasn't completely drunk just she was starting to show it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess maybe Weiss is either a light-weight or Winter's body can handle a little booze.\" Blake thought to herself as the two left the restaurant and made their way to the hotel. Blake kept a close eye on her date just in case but she seemed to be doing fine as they entered the hotel and walked down the hall towards their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls entered the room, Blake sitting down on her bed and Weiss flopping down onto hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe\" Weiss giggled to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake ignored her and started to relax, taking off her shoes and eventually helping Weiss with hers. Blake dug through a small bag they had both brought of clothes to change into for the night and tomorrow. She left Weiss on her bed as she went into the bathroom to change, quickly changing into her black yukata style shirt and some black shorts she brought since the yukata barely covered her junk. She left and helped Weiss out of her clothes and into her pajamas and letting her hair down, trying her best to not let herself get too aroused. Weiss still had an expression on her face that showed she was still a bit drunk, that quickly turned into a yawn. Blake let out a sigh on relief and quickly tucked Weiss into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness. Last thing I would want is Yang actually be right about tonight.\" Blake thought to herself as she turned out the lights and laid in bed, taking about her book and started reading. She occasionally looked over to her sleeping partner and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's so cute...I can't believe I have a thing for my teammate</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stayed up for a little while longer before marking her page and calling it a night.

So a clumsy movement right next to her would wake her up instantly. Being a Faunus also meant she had night vision and could see who it was even if she didn\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had sat up and was looking down at her.

Her face falling into a state of relaxation and pleasure, her mouth slightly open. Weiss placed a soft kiss on Blake's lips, leaning more into Blake's borrowed body and chest. Blake slowly finding the will to slightly push Weiss off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should at least give it a try.\" Blake purred as she brushed her hair from her vision. Weiss's flushed red face greeted her and passionately kissed her again, crawling on top the blanket Blake was under. Weiss straddled Blake, feeling the blanket brushing against her butt and hearing Blake purr loudly. The two embraced a bit more, Blake's body seemingly reacting on instinct and hormone alone. She couldn't tell if the alcohol from earlier was starting to hit her but her body grew warm. Weiss got off Blake and removed her nightgown, unclasping the bra under, and wiggling her panties down to the ground. She peeled back the blanket and tugged Blake's black shorts and underwear down in one swift motion, marveling in the fully erect cock Blake possessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss straddled Blake once more, easing herself down onto Blake's male anatomy. A shiver ran through her body as a small moan escaped her lips. Blake could feel the wave of pleasure and euphoria rush over her, idly bucking her hips up and into Weiss. She was blissfully sitting on top, feeling the foreign entity push into her more and more, grabbing Blake's hands and placing them on her hips and ass. The pace picked up as Weiss started to go to work, moving herself up and down on Blake, letting her lover focus on grabbing her ass or tits. An idle hand felt up Weiss's torso and grabbed her breasts, the other hands starting to roughly grab her ass, slapping it occasionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's and Weiss's moans harmonized as they continued, Blake rolling to have Weiss on bottom. Blake's animal like instincts took over, roughly moving her hips faster and harder into Weiss. Weiss's legs wrapped around Blake, in an attempt to hold her. Blake could feel the pressure building in her male equipment and knew she only had a few more thrusts left. Blake felt it coming fast and pulled out of her friend, shooting a warm stream of cum onto Weiss's chest and belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stayed over Weiss, panting and sweating, looking at Weiss bask in the afterglow of their, maybe her, first sexual experience. Weiss was lost in her own thoughts, lewdly panting and moaning as Blake places a kiss on her lips. The legs that trapped Blake eased off, allowing Blake to roll off and lay next to her lover. Blake laid there, staring up at the ceiling, hearing Weiss's pants and eventually feeling her body nuzzle up to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing.\" Weiss panted, kissing Blake's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Blake replied, blushing as her body became to feel warm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss pulled the blanket over the two and cuddled up with Blake, resting her head on her teammates chest and placing a leg over hers. Blake brushed the hair from Weiss's face and watching her drift off to sleep, before succumbing to her our fatigue. </span></div></div>",

She really enjoyed seeing Blake looked like Weiss; big sister, minus the large package in her pants and hidden snow white cat ears.Her partner look unsure, but Yang was positive she would enjoy herself. Though, Weiss could be a little boring sometimes. As long as they didn\u2019t go see an opera or something. Snickering she sat back down on her bed, as her sister Ruby hung over the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s with the remote Blake gave you?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a universal remote that she took from me.\u201d Yang lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to program it to activate all our stuff and pretend a ghost was haunting our room.\u201d Yang knew the excuse Blake gave to Weiss, so it didn\u2019t hurt to continue that. Ruby probably didn\u2019t need to know about the remote. \u201cYou know, turn on TV, cause music to blare, that kind of stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Blake found out and stopped you.\u201d Ruby finished, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, she noticed pretty fast.\u201d Yang confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Weiss and Blake\u2026\u201d This was what Ruby really wanted to talk about. \u201cTogether?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did they start like liking each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Weiss made herself known a couple days ago. Blake just started realizing it herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope it works out.\u201d Ruby suddenly looked nervous. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t and it\u2019s a messy break up, our team dynamic is going to be weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt it will be that bad,\u201d Yang assured her, patting Ruby\u2019s back. \u201cHey. Let\u2019s go get dinner. No use worrying about anything yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smiled as Ruby seemed happier, but in her pocket, she felt the remote grow warm. Yeah, she was going to swap with people tonight while Blake was having fun. The question was what. She just had to be careful not to use the Reset Button and just do the Undo, as not to mess with Blake\u2019s fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as Yang entered the cafeteria, her eyes traveled around to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, she probably wasn\u2019t going to do a Body Swap, as her body was already amazing. Perfect proportions and all that. However, a small Body Part Swap wasn\u2019t out of the question. Lots of Faunus around along with attractive people. Shoot, maybe she should steal a dick and see what it\u2019s like. One that isn\u2019t Zwei\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, Personal Info Swaps seem kind of interesting. Swap all the nonphysical aspects of people. It was limited by her creativity. It was more than just stuff like names. There was also the Life Swap, which would let her live the life of someone. So many choices. She could choose a girl with an interesting life to see what it\u2019s like, or maybe a guy so she can sneak into the locker rooms and check out the other guys. So much perverted things were just a button click away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Blake was missing out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well Blakey can't be the only one with something between her legs.\" Yang thought as she continued to look around the cafeteria. Her eyes wondered around the room, idly licking her lips at the thought of having a dick in between her legs. Her eyes surveyed the room. With Vale being the host to the Vytal festival, there were plenty of candidates for Yang to choose. She sighed slightly as she looked to Jaune, slightly wishing she didn't made Blake have his dick, but then to Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang pondered swapping with Ren, making it a fun swap between the two teams, but looked around for other options as the two sisters sat down with their food. She figured Ren was a safe swap and she would have ample attempts to swap back if needed. She turned her attention to a table just past Ruby, Team SSSN was being rather loud. Yang kept her eyes on the team as she eat, feeling the remote grow warm in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet that blonde monkey is hung.\" Yang thought to herself, watching Sun's tail sway back and forth. \"Or maybe Neptune...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang. Yang. Yang!\" Ruby said leaning into Yang's view of team SSSN. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Ruby?\" Yang asked back, slightly annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking, we should come up with a way to mess with Blake and Weiss before they get back.\" Ruby suggested, bouncing slightly in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be down for that. What did you have in mind?\" Yang asked back, leaning over the slightly and taking the remote out and aiming in under the table. She wasn't sure on which one of the boys she'd hit but her desire to have a real dick between her legs was growing too much for her. She pressed the button and felts the unfamiliar weight and feeling in her tightening shorts. She watched to see which one of the boys would readjust to their new female anatomy. Sun was the only one that seemed to shift in his seat and when the team got up from the table Yang could spot a slight bulge in Neptune's pants. She bit her lip she felt her new dick throb and harden in her shorts, reaching down and tugging on them to make some room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang adjusted herself, Ruby was going one about her plan to prank their teammates, suggesting they use the remote for it's \"original\" purpose. Yang shot it down slightly, merely saying since Blake knew it wouldn't work. Ruby sat back and sulked slightly, thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can we use the remote to mess with another team?\" Ruby asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry Ruby.\" Yang sternly said back as she finished her food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yang felt a little bad seeing Ruby\u2019s disappointed expression. She just wanted to do something with her big sister. Even with the tightness in her pants, Yang decided she couldn\u2019t keep Ruby sad like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIf you get another universal remote, I\u2019ll pass this one off to Blake and we can use the new one to mess with them. I\u2019m a little broke from upgrading Bumblebee.\u201d Bumblebee was Yang\u2019s motorcycle that she loved like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet!\u201d Ruby cheered, pulling out her scroll. \u201cI\u2019ll find one for our purpose. Hopefully nothing is too expensive. I\u2019m a little low too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUpgrading Crescent Rose, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang chuckled and then adjusted her sitting posture as her new equipment got hard again. Man, guys got horny over every little thing and her tight shorts were not well designed for this. She understood why Blake wanted new pants over her tight ones after she got Jaune\u2019s dick. Yang wanted to get up and go back to the dorm to change, but stuck around to not draw attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the itch to use the remote was too tempting. Looking at her sister, Yang decided to do a small swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light and Ruby\u2019s silver eyes were now lilac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang looked at the back of her spoon and saw herself with silver eyes. They were pretty cute and Yang always liked Ruby\u2019s eyes. Nothing else really changed though, so she didn\u2019t feel bad targeting her sister. No, the remote was addicting and Yang was already looking around for another swap. She wanted something unique that would be different for her. Instantly, her eyes targeted Velvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another flash of light and Velvet\u2019s rabbit ears vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, everything became loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now yellow haired rabbit ears on Yang\u2019s head heard the entire cafeteria like it was right next to her. It took a moment to orient herself as the sound was overpowering. Her grimaced attracted Ruby\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, Yang?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, just loud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, sorry.\u201d Ruby hit the top of her head. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like loud places. I thought it would be less crowded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Yang assured her. Deciding to checking something, she pulled out her student ID. It still said she was a human, just her picture had rabbit ears. That meant Velvet was a Faunus without any anima traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird, but magic remote. Not much can explain that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe debated what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA life swap would be interesting, living as someone else a bit. Maybe Coco so she could have a relationship with Velvet. Yang did fuck Coco in Zwei\u2019s body once. Though, she had a dick now, and life swap only made people perceive her as someone else, with their clothes swapping to. Velvet might be thinking she was doing it with a girl while taking a dick. Could be interesting and it would relieve the pressure building in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she swapped with a guy, she could check out the guys locker room, their team, flirt with girls for fun, all sorts of hilarious stuff. No one would know. They would just see her as the guy she swapped with. So much potential. She could even take over a teacher\u2026 though she should wait for a school day to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched, feeling her impressive weight on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea occurred to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were amazing, no one could deny that. The thing was all women with large chests knew the pain. Maybe she could swap her chest with someone else. Just temporarily to get a break. She could swap it with a girl with tiny breasts to give them a chance to see what it\u2019s like, shame Weiss wasn\u2019t here. Or\u2026 she could give it to sun and see him walking around with them exposed. Might be a little embarrassing seeing her chest on display, but it would be Sun. He had her pussy and she had his dick anyways.<br>\r\n\u2003<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yang pondered her options and the thought of feeling a flat chest for the first time in years was too much. She was tempted to swap with Ruby but that just felt too weird, she still had Sun as an option although she had to get over the mental hurdle of her breasts hanging free under an unbuttoned shirt. She pressed the button and felt the instant relief, her back and chest became practically weightless and pain-free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, talk about a weight off my shoulders..or rather back.\" Yang snickered to herself as she looked down at her new chest. A set up pecs greeted her under her top along with the now unless bra. Despite her clothes refitting her chest, they still were tight, which in return only made her equipment downstairs starts to stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to go Yang? Weiss made me promise her that I study for the test coming up\" Ruby stated as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I suppose so.\" Yang replied as she stood up and followed Ruby, following behind her sister. Due to Velvet's, now her rabbit ears, Yang couldn't help and eavesdrop on Sun and his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you know how I can't wear anything over my boobs, I feel so constricted.\" Sun confidently stated as he puffed out his chest, the shirt just barely covering his nipples. Yang half-heartedly smirked as she walked further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked beside Ruby, her strides awkwardly wider due to the dick between her legs but she slowly got use to the movement. She still swayed her hips like normal but the bulging front seemed to turn more heads. Yang kept a firm grasp on the remote as they walked, wondering about Blake's date and her desire to actually test out her new dick. She did have a dick before but she knew that it wouldn't compare the what she was packing now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters made it back to the dorm and Ruby took her seat at the desk, making an genuine attempt to study, while Yang kicked off her boots and laid back on her bed. Her hand idly drifted down to her shorts and rested on her bulged shorts, softly grabbing it and biting her lip. She pulled her shorts up slightly to get a view of what was underneath and she wasn't disappointed: a decently sized dick with a bit of hair at the base greeted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll play with you later.\" She thought as she released her shorts, letting them snap against her body. Her hands then rested on her chest, feeling more odd. She was use to the soft, yet firm breasts but now the hard muscles lay under the top. Her rabbit ears twitched slightly as her own perverse thoughts ran through her head, only to get interrupted by Ruby's groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Ruby?\" Yang asked rolling to face her sister<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just wish Weiss was here to help but I know not to bother her and Blake. What do you think they're doing?\" Ruby asked, she was still innocent and her mind didn't jump to the more explicate stuff right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably just dinner, and a relaxing time at the hotel.\" Yang replied, not wanted to corrupt her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, they are getting to be real close friends.\" Ruby smiled back   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're going to get really close I bet.\" Yang teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room fell silent as Ruby returned to her attempted studying and Yang scrolling through her scroll. Eventually Ruby retired for the night, changing into her pajamas and crawling up to her bunk. Yang grabbed her pajamas and turned out the lights for Ruby, walking into the bathroom and locking the door behind her.</span></div></div>",

She was so turned on. Reaching down, she wrapped her fingers around the warm rod. It pulsed in her hand as she felt her heartbeat. Slowly, she moved her hand up and down, not entirely sure what the best way was. She only knew from her own experience and porn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels nice\u2026\u201d Yang moaned, as she stroked the shaft up and down. \u201cNo wonder guys start of scratching their balls and then rubbing one off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ticked her balls with her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, yeah, this is nice. Now, let\u2019s see.\u201d Yang looked around and grabbed a little of Weiss\u2019 fancy lotion, of course she won\u2019t mind, and some Kleenex for the inevitable result. \u201cNow for some Yang time.\u201d She lubed her dick a bit with the lotion before starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers wrapped around her new cock firmly, but not squeezing and slowly began to pump the shaft again. The more she increased the speed, the more pleasure that was growing in her balls. She reached up to grab her breasts automatically, but realized she didn\u2019t have them. In a way, that turned her on a bit more. The pressure kept growing within her balls and she stretched back on the toilet she was sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Yang imagined Blake fucking Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pushed her over the edge and she came, filling up the Kleenex with thick white cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026\u201d Yang gasped. \u201cOrgasms like a guy is amazing.\u201d She quickly washed up before Ruby got suspicious and snuck back into her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t sleep immediately, as she debated what to do tomorrow. The remote was amazing and she still hadn\u2019t done all the cool swaps. Maybe a Life Swap? Yang grinned in the darkness. Blake would try to see her, but the real Yang and knowledge of the remote would be someone else. Blake tracking her down would be hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Yang wanted to know how the date went.

Think of all the fun we could have!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to lie down?\u201d Ren asked, his brow furrowing slightly. \u201cI\u2019ll make you something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sick!\u201d Nora protested and held up a pamphlet. \u201cIt even came with instructions.\u201d She pushed it into Jaune\u2019s hands before he could say anything. \u201cTake a look, Fearless Leader.\u201d Jaune smiled indulgently and scanned through the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sounds like a scam,\u201d Jaune muttered softly. \u201cStill, these instructions seem rather detailed.\u201d He handed the paper to Pyrrha. \u201cWhat do you think, Pyr?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how this could work,\u201d Pyrrha admitted, after reading it and passing it onto Ren. \u201cThis is impossible. It defies every law of physics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a child\u2019s toy,\u201d Ren agreed, after he read it. \u201cHave you tried it out, Nora?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Nora beamed at him. \u201cI swapped hair with Yang.\u201d She brushed back her long golden hair that reached her waist. \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys notice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve always had blonde hair,\u201d Jaune pointed out. \u201cAlways surprised it doesn\u2019t get in the way of fighting since you don\u2019t pull it back like Pyrrha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s not mine,\u201d Nora explained. \u201cHere, hold the remote while I hit the Reset Button.\u201d The others shared a look and obliged. It wasn\u2019t like Nora was giving them a choice. Jaune, Pyrrha, and Ren placed a hand on the remote and Nora hit a button. There was a flash of green light and then nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2026 Nora, you\u2019re hair!\u201d Pyrrha gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, it\u2019s supposed to be short and orange,\u201d Jaune remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is astounding,\u201d Ren added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you hold the remote you remember the changes,\u201d Nora reminded them, as they had all read the instructions. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if the Reset Button would make you remember a swap you weren\u2019t there for if you were touching it, but it looks like it did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry we didn\u2019t believe you,\u201d Jaune apologized. \u201cThere was no reason for you to make something like this up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Pyrrha agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Nora crossed her arms and gazed at them superiority. \u201cAs long as you learned your lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did you have planned for this remote?\u201d Ren asked and there was a tiny bit of nervousness to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam bonding exercise!\u201d Nora answered immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam bonding exercise?\u201d The others repeated.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They glanced at each other and shared a moment of male bonding. Jaune had seven sisters and, when he was younger, he was forced to wear girl\u2019s clothes.  Ren was childhood friends with Nora. Nora once replaced all of his clothes with her own because she thought he would look cute in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Nora suddenly suggested. She was still a little disappointed they wouldn\u2019t switch bodies. She wanted to examine Yang\u2019s muscles and see if she really was fitter than her. \u201cWhat if we do it randomly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, randomly?\u201d Ren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swap with the first person to leave their room,\u201d Nora suggested. \u201cThen Pyrrha, than, Ren, than Jauney. Whichever member of team RWBY leaves in that order is who we swap with.\u201d Jaune nodded his head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay with that,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be awkward regardless of who I get.\u201d Ren and Pyrrha didn\u2019t have any objections either. \u201cWhy am I last though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo save the best for last, duh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Pyrrha giggled at Jaune\u2019s confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them waited behind the door while Nora peaked out. They could hear Team RWBY talking loudly behind their closed door, but their words were muffled. It sounded like they were going to leave soon. Nora fidgeted excitedly as she waited. All members of Team JNPR had their hand on the remote and waited. After about five minutes, the door opened and the girls across the hall left. There were four clicks followed by green flashes of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho swapped with who?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruby had been the first person to leave. She also had Ruby\u2019s red and black dress along with her tall combat boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo be careful,\u201d Ren advised. \u201cWe are merely borrowing their outfits. It would be rude to ruin them.\u201d He was wearing a black buttoned vest with coattails. Underneath it was a white, sleeveless, high necked, crop undershirt and white shorts. He also had black low-heeled boots and full stockings with a color gradation of black to purple at the ankles. Nora giggled at his outfit and hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look great, Renny!\u201d Ren\u2019s lips tugged upwards slightly in an embarrassed smile. Blake had been the second person to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if white really suits me,\u201d Pyrrha said, glancing at the mirror as she opened the closet. She was wearing Weiss\u2019 white combat dress along with a bolero with the same color scheme. \u201cAnd nearly all of Weiss\u2019s outfits are white or light blue.\u201d At least they were rather conservative so Pyrrha wasn\u2019t too embarrassed. It was still disconcerting to see someone else\u2019s clothes where her clothes had been hanging up moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look great,\u201d Jaune reassured her. \u201cAt least your dress covers everything. I\u2019m not used to such revealing clothes. Sheesh, Yang.\u201d Jaune tried to pull the tan jacket that bared his midriff down. Under it was a low cut yellow crop top that was pressed tightly against his skin. If he had breasts, they would have had a good portion of them being revealed. His other hand tried to pull the black short shorts down a little bit. His male parts were severely restricted and Pyrrha had to make sure he didn\u2019t catch her looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang\u2019s clothes\u2026snk\u2026 really suit you?\u201d Pyrrha tried to say with a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha,\u201d Jaune laughed sarcastically and pushed Pyrrha on the shoulder. \u201cVery funny. At least her shoes are normal.\u201d He pointed to the brown, knee-high boots and orange over-the-knee socks. He suddenly frowned and adjusted his tank top, or something underneath it. \u201cThis is so constricting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d Nora teased. \u201cIs our fearless leader having trouble with a bra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even need one,\u201d Jaune protested as Nora and Pyrrha laughed. \u201cBut the remote adjusted all of the clothes to fit us.\u201d His face suddenly grew red as he imagined Yang bouncing around without a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to admit,\u201d Ren added. \u201cThis is a little uncomfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou learn to deal with it,\u201d Nora replied with a shrug and Pyrrha\u2019s face flushed. While that was true, speaking about women\u2019s underwear with Ren and Jaune was rather embarrassing. It was rather amusing to see the boys struggle with something the girls considered essential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d Jaune asked the others. \u201cThis is funny and all, but we are the only ones who will notice this, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSupposedly,\u201d Nora answered. \u201cThat\u2019s what the instructions said. We could go out and check what other people think if you want.\u201d She smiled deviously and held up the remote. \u201cOr we could do some more swaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could see if Yang has anything a little more conservative if you are worried,\u201d Pyrrha added, gesturing to the dresser.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Afterwords, team Jnpr decide to go and find team Cvfy and swap clothes with them. After an hour of searching for them, team Jnpr finds  team Cvfy in the courtyard Just talking about what they need to do to improve on tactics for the vytal festival coming up in a couple of months. Nora and the rest of team Jnpr are standing in a corner and decides that now is the time for action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\". Nora said, \"just like we did with team RWBY, let's go one at a time and swap with the fist member of team Cvfy\". Nora said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\". With the rest of team Jnpr saying in a perfect union together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person to go was Nora, she pulls out the remote and points it at the team leader of team Cvfy, which was coco. She aims and pushes the wardrobe swap button on the remote and  a light blue laser comes out and gives an impact on an unknown coco that is talking to velvet at the time. Afterward's, the rest of team Jnpr choose  the rest of team Cvfy to swap clothes with. When every member of team Jnpr had swap clothes with team Cvfy, we can see the difference. With team Cvfy wearing team rwby's attires while team Jnpr is wearing team Cvfy attires, all refitted to their new owners bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\", \"look at mine, I'm Like some super secret agent with these's Shades on.\" Nora said with confidence in her voice with coco's outfit on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" this sure is kinda freaky in a way to see your other teammates wearing your clothes right in front of you.\" Pyrrha said while wearing velvet's outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I like my new attire, it makes me feel cooler in a way.\" Jaune said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agree\", ren said. But I would feel more comfortable in my own clothes. Ren said sarcastically. After the swap was completed with team Jnpr and team coco, the notice that team RWBY had just arrive to meet and greet with team Jnpr while also seeing team coco coming over to talk as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before both team RWBY and team Cvfy could get closer, Nora was trying to figure out if herself and team Jnpr should try out another button on the remote, or if they should redo everything back to normal, including clothes and all.

That left Cardin to do whatever he wanted by himself. Something sparkled in the distance and it peaked his interest. \u201cA remote?\u201d Cardin muttered confused, reaching down to pick it up. Below it was a folded up pamphlet of some kind. The title was clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your Guide to the Swapping Remote</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething compelled him to read the pamphlet and his eyes grew wider with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way in hell. No way in hell is this real. Some asshole\u2019s pranking me.\u201d Cardin glanced around, yet no one was there. He was farther away from the main buildings, so not a lot of people came this way. \u201cI know this is fake, it has to be, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too tempting to ignore. His imagination showed him all the fun adventures and swaps he could do. Not only could he use it to spy on all the ridiculously attractive girls in Beacon, he could even swap his team around with them. He could rule the school and do pretty much whatever he wanted. Testing the remote became a priority. If it didn\u2019t work, he would throw it away. If it did work\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say he was going to enjoy himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her nickname came from the fact she never lost a match. One time, Cardin\u2019s entire team was trashed by her in combat class. She was fast, agile, and all attacks seemed to just miss her. Not only talented, she was a beauty. Long red hair, bright green eyes, along with a full figure combined with her combat skills made her an attractive icon for sponsors. A lot of guys at the school tried asking her out and she kept turning them down. For some reason, she was attracted to Jaune and Cardin could understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m stronger and smarter than him</i>, Cardin thought to himself, as he began to scour the school for his target. <i>And now I have this remote.

The person in front of him was an exact match, even the school uniform consisting of a black suits lined with gold, white shirt, and red tie. Cardin looked down at himself and saw two large mounds on his chest covered by a lot more white shirt than he was used too. There was also a draft between his legs because of a red skirt and long black stockings covered his, now thin and feminine, legs. His head felt heavy and he reached up to discover long red hair tied up in a ponytail. Stunned disbelief overtook him for a moment and then a grin exploded onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt works!\u201d He cried out, fist pumping the air with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Cardin stopped when Pyrrha in his body and clothes turned around. He had forgotten she hadn\u2019t known he was there. His voice drew her attention. \u201cCardin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn\u2019t talking to you, Nikos,\u201d Cardin replied hastily. \u201cDealing with an issue on my scroll.\u201d He shoved the remote in his pocket as he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d There was a slight negative change in her expression as she looked at him before turning away and leaving. Cardin made sure she was really gone before reaching up and cupping one of his new breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew that bitch\u2019s chest was nice, but daaaam.\u201d He spent a few minutes working his hand through the clothes and enjoying the pleasure coming from his breast. His other hand reached down and felt between his legs to discover his manhood was gone. Touching his underwear cause a sharp spike of pleasure when he got too close to Pyrrha\u2019s vagina. \u201cFuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to stop himself before he went too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like he was worried about Pyrrha\u2019s body. No, it was the fact others would still see him as Cardin and the last thing he needed was for someone to catch him masturbating in the hallways. He was smarter than that. Turning around and heading in the opposite direction of Pyrrha, he had time to think. The lack of manhood and a slightly bouncy chest felt off, but not unpleasant. A bra was holding his new assets in place quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can't believe this remote actually works,\u201d Cardin muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him never really believed it would, so he didn\u2019t plan out a next step. Naturally, the first thing he wanted to do was check out his new body. With the rest of his team busy, he probably had a good hour to himself. Pyrrha was a looker and it was his chance to examine her body up close and personal. Another option was to use the remote and get onto a new team, one full of girls. If he swapped himself with that young girl Ruby, he would have three of the hottest girls in their year on his team. However, if he swapped places with Jaune, his partner would be the strongest and one of the most attractive girls at Beacon. Shoot, he could even confess and Pyrrha would be all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many choices. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cardin had every intention of getting back at Pyrrha with his newfound device. He still would but what was the rush? She wasn't going anywhere any time soon and he had an entire school of babes to experiment with. His own year, second years, seniors. Hell, there were professors he could imagine parading around as. To be Goodwitch and haul that impressive chest around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lecherous grin wholly out of place on Pyrrha's face appeared. Taking another quick glance around he licked his lips and seized one of his breasts, groping it roughly with a melodic laugh. \"I'll have all the time in the world to get back at you later, bitch. Maybe I'll pop by tonight for some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now though? With Beacon ripe for his experiments there were, surprisingly to him, more pressing things than his revenge. Scouring the device for an \"Undo\" button he clicked it, although not before giving his stolen rear a hearty spank. Down the hall and now back in his own body he laughed hearing Pyrrha gasp, totally oblivious to why her ass was now stinging. Throwing a knowing smile over his shoulder Cardin waved, twirled the remote in his hand, and headed off to find his next host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plenty of options. Brothers know the school wasn't wanting for attractive girls. His fleeting taste of Pyrrha had left him wanting and he definitely needed to find himself someone comparable. Or hell, someone he could use to get closer to someone comparable. An all girls team for sure, of which there were frustratingly few. Again his mind went back to the pipsqueak Ruby Rose. She was cute enough he supposed, although more of a 'cute girl next door' kind of girl than one he'd lust over.  Her teammates though? Blake Belladonna was an exotic beauty, Yang Xiao Long was <i>stacked</i>, and Weiss? Beautiful and loaded.  He could swap into any of those three and be satisfied. Or, he could play the part of Yang's dopey little sister and cause a little chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos sounded fun. He could rile up \"his\" team, cause problems for them, and get while the going was good. Maybe jump into one of the other girls once Ruby was thoroughly done for. He didn't have much of a vendetta against the brunette, nothing like how he felt about Pyrrha, which honestly made it easier. He just didn't care enough one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to team RWBY's dorm was the only obstacle. By virtue of all first years being on the same floor, in the same wing, it wasn't difficult finding it. Most of his peers steered clear and he even managed to  pass Pyrrha on his way over, winking at her and puckering his lips, snickering as he stepped into her own room with a look of barely restrained disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't you worry, Nikos. We'll have plenty of fun soon enough.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRWBY's room was directly across JNPR's, and once the coast was clear Cardin walked up and knocked. Banged, really, stepping back and taking out his remote. Hopefully the bulge wasn't too obvious in his trousers, not that he much cared. It would be someone else's problem to deal with soon enough. Grinning, he raised the remote as soon as he heard the doorknob turn, waiting until the door opened before firing away.</span></div></div>",

The next moment, he was standing in the room facing outwards, instead of outside the room staring in. He had hit the Life Swap option and it took a second to get used to the sudden location swap. According to the instructions, he should now be seen as the girl he targeted, Glancing down, he saw a red and black dress. Knowing who this dress belonged to, his eyes moved forward to see who was living in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ruby Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing his clothes and sported his brown hair. That must have meant he had her short black hair. The girl was sneering at him like Cardin would have done. She should believe that she WAS him and everyone should see her as him. Still, it took a lot of self-control not to burst out laughing as she was so short and hardly intimidating. He didn\u2019t see her as himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Cardin asked, trying to sound like her. It actually felt kind of natural. The instructions did saw Life Swaps would help with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust checking to see if you\u2019re still in school and not kicked out yet.\u201d Ruby laughed with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away R\u2026 Cardin!\u201d He almost said Ruby, but he quickly changed direction. Ruby laughed, before turning and walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was going to do this, might as well do it all the way. He did a Body Swap and soon found himself in Ruby\u2019s body. The world seemed much bigger now as he lost a foot or two. He felt so small and weak. How this girl could beat him was beyond him. She was either lucky or it was because of that monstrosity she called a weapon. He slammed the door and turned around to check out the room. It looked pretty normal, though they had bunk beds, with one bed strung up with some horrid contraption. There was only one girl in the room right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did\u2026Cardin\u2026 want?\u201d Weiss asked in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust being a jerk.\u201d Cardin replied, letting Ruby\u2019s life guide him. Seems they insulted him a lot. He would have to make them pay for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow he was even allowed in is beyond me.\u201d Weiss muttered, turning back to her desk and paper she was working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin glanced into the mirror and saw himself looking exactly like Ruby. The evil grin on her face was definitely not her usually one though. Weiss didn\u2019t notice as her back was turn. Cardin was not deciding what to do. Should he go into the bathroom and check out his new body? He could do stuff to Weiss and get Ruby hated by her. Maybe go out into Beacon and cause problems to get Ruby into trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many choices.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of all the girls in Beacon, Ruby Rose was far from the top of 'girls I'd like to see naked'. That being said he was once again presented with a unique opportunity, a chance to experience something no guy did. Except for him, naturally. Another uncharacteristically lecherous grin appeared on Ruby's face and he snickered, sauntering over to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta drop a deuce, don't come in!\" he chirped in his new squeaky voice. Weiss gave him a look of shock, eyebrows raised, and he winked before stepping into the bathroom. With the door locked he fumbled for the switch and turned it on, shielding his eyes as light flooded them, then found the mirror and leaned in to inspect his new self. It was uncanny seeing someone else in your own reflection. Just as strange was seeing Ruby mirror everything he did. Silly faces, seductive ones - the best approximations he could make anyways - and crude gestures. Snickering, he ran a hand through his black and red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... Another few years and you might actually be kind of hot, Rose. Your team's got you beat though!\" Grinning, his hands latched onto his stolen chest and he squeezed. A pleasant shiver shot down his spine and he yelped, eyebrows raising at the sound. His breasts were sizable, big enough for his dainty hands, and definitely sensitive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Softer than Nikos'...\" Squeezing them again he shivered, licking his lips as he ran a hand down his stomach. A bit of pudge, though not nearly enough to turn him off. With a giddy giggle he unbuttoned his blazer and tossed it aside, running his hands over his white blouse and giving his chest another squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step back to get a 'full picture' he turned around and lifted his skirt, swaying his hips and slapping his own ass. The meaty sound and the jiggle made him laugh again, giving one cheek a squeeze before working at the skirt. It took some fumbling to find the button and once it was undone the tartan skirt fell to the floor, kicked aside with the blazer. In just stockings and his blouse now Cardin turned around again, sneering as he began to unbutton his blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kick my ass, will you? Humiliating me, you little bitch...\" Hearing Ruby Rose's voice cursing was hilarious. No matter how angry the pipsqueak got she never cursed. Kind of like Nikos in that regard. Both prissy bitches too good to sully themselves. \"Oh, look at me, I'm Ruby Rose, a prodigy.\" He snorted and grabbed his chest again, squeezing and shuddering. With the topmost buttons undone he pried the garment open and raised an eyebrow in disbelief; a black bra with pink hearts held his breasts back. \"And apparently I'm twelve years old. What about her panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough they were the exact same. After tossing aside his blouse he stood before the mirror clad in only stockings, bra, and panties, as close as one could get to bare without actually being naked. Licking his lips he rubbed at his stomach and one breast, legs shaking as he worked his stolen chest. Beneath the bra he could feel his nipples growing harder. His panties were beginning to grow damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's life told him that she rarely ever touched herself. Once or twice, a fact that bewildered Cardin. What teenager wasn't totally wrought with hormones? Did she think she was special, abstaining from it? <i>She's more interested in weapons than feeling good. She really is an idiot.</i> One hand went down between his legs and rubbed at his outer lips, hips bucking on reflex. He laughed, tossing bangs from his eyes and tearing the bra down to let one breast hang free. His fingers pinched the nipple, darker than the rest of his pale skin, and another delightful jolt shot through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could change that though, couldn't we, Rose? Ruby Rose the sex crazed student...\" Cardin laughed, rubbing his vagina as he worked at his nipple. His face had grown flushed, silver eyes becoming hazy, and sweat had begun to bead on his pale skin. \"Or I could just have fun with you myself... Some private payback, heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many choices...</span></div></div>",

Lastly, he dropped her panties, so now he, technically she, was completely naked in front of the mirror. \u201cCongrats, Rose. You\u2019re going to teach me what a female orgasm is, if it\u2019s not a myth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed as he sat on the edge of the tub, spread his legs, and began to slowly rub the outer lips of his new womanhood with one hand.  His hips buckled again until he was used to it. There was no rush as this was technically his body now. His other hand went back up to his breasts and pinched his now fully hardened nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small moan escaped his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what your sex noise sounds like?\u201d Cardin laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re such a slut, Rose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to increase the speed of rubbing his crotch and found a small sensitive nub. Realizing that must be her clit, he focused on that. The pleasure coursing through his body multiple exponentially. Sweat was forming on his body, his sight was growing hazy, and words couldn\u2019t be formed easily. The hand on his breast was tweaking the hardened nipples harder and harder, the pain adding to the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it felt like something inside of him just exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d Cardin gasped, as a shock ran through his body. A little liquid leaked out of his pussy and he nearly fell into the bathtub. \u201cJeeze, Rose. You\u2019re so sensitive. Was that the first orgasm with this body?\u201d Due to the Life Swap, he had her memories if he focused. \u201cYep, she\u2019s still a virgin with no sexual experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nasty awful evil idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around for anything he could use and then began to dig through the cabinets beneath the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, come on.\u201d Cardin muttered. \u201cShe may not have one, but the slut Xiao-Long or the babe Belladonna has to have one.\u201d Finally, hidden way in the back of the corner cabinet, hidden behind several boxes of other stuff, was a purple dildo. \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into position, he gently pressed the cold plastic against his wet pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it feel, Rose?\u201d Cardin whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re about to lose your virginity.\u201d He pushed the dildo in and gasped as the hard plastic sent pleasure through his body. There was a slight resistance once it got too far in and that caused him to grin. \u201cOne, two, THREE!\u201d He pushed it through and a sharp spike of pain ran through him. \u201cOuch, no wonder bitches cry.\u201d He held the dildo still until the pain ended. Aura helped with that. Who knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued thrusting the dildo in and out of the tight womb, squeezing down on it and buckling his hips instinctively. The pleasure was amazing. Maybe after this was all done, he can figure out how to use the remote to make some of these girls his girlfriends and have sex with them whenever he wanted. First things first though, revenge. The familiar pressure arrived again and he came, leaking all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like he was going to clean it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby?\u201d Weiss\u2019 voice came through. \u201cAre you okay? You\u2019re making weird noises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust masturbating!\u201d Cardin shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-\u2026 that\u2019s disgusting! Are you going through some rebellious phase?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should try it!\u201d Cardin told her. \u201cYou won\u2019t be so uptight anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUGH! You\u2019re just as bad as your sister.\u201d Her footsteps moved away from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do next?</span></div></div>",

Damn I'm good at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers were sweet and the fluids he lapped off clung to them, making his taste buds dance. \"Wonder how the others taste...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it he didn't have to wait. His initial thought had been to undo the swap and let Ruby deal with the fallout that ensued. Weiss was probably steaming outside of the bathroom just waiting to lay into \"her\" and no way in hell he wanted to deal with that. But maybe he didn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn shaky legs - Ruby's body had handled his rough play poorly - he scrounged through the discarded uniform and dug out the remote. While the brunette would probably be good for another round later he'd already caused some havoc and frankly he was getting more and more keen on trying out other girls. He was a guy after all even if he hardly looked the part right now, and what else would an honest, hot-blooded guy do with a device like his? He sure as shit wasn't about to start trying to improve the girls' lives. What did he care? How many days had he spent in Beacon so far forced to go blue balls while all these babes strutted around campus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've endured long enough,\" Cardin chuckled, rubbing a sore breast as his sticky thighs ground together, skin peeling apart with a wet slop. \"The suffering of Cardin Winchester ends here.\" As if his plight was anything worth raising awareness for. Bare feet padded against the cold bathroom floor and he shivered, throwing wide the bathroom door and snickering. Weiss, who had sat back at her desk, turned back only to avert her eyes, face going red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get dressed so I can yell at you, you dolt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're the next step in my plan, Schnee!\" Cardin stumbled forward unsteadily, reaching out with his free hand. When Weiss reached out to stop him he pressed the remote into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting Ruby wake up a total mess would be amazing but he wouldn't be able to witness the results first hand. There was an alternative, however, that would guarantee he'd get that, and he wasn't about to pass it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote went off and the world disappeared again only for his senses to rush back in an instant. Ruby Rose\u2019s face frozen in shock, mouth agape and silver eyes wide.. Touch, the feeling of a ponytail hanging off the side of his head, strands of hair tickling his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's voice gasped before letting out a string of unintelligible, stammering sounds that were either exclamations or questions. Calmly, though unable to keep a triumphant grin from spreading across his new face, Cardin rose to meet his former host, standing and putting a hand on his dainty hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Schnee,\" he said in his new voice, smile widening as he watched the real Weiss go pale. \"But I'm going to need to borrow you for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin had expected Weiss to be a little more composed, to fight back, or hell, at least try to do something to stop him. Instead he watched as \"Ruby Rose\" swayed, then collapsed in a heap. For a moment he stood still and stared at the girl's bare crumpled form before snorting, pressing his toes against her stomach. \"She fucking passed out...\" Wow. He didn't know if that was hilarious or sad. \"Oh well! Makes it easier for the others to find her.\" Satisfied, he leaned down and snatched the remote back, kissing the soiled device and licking his pale-pink lips. \"Man, I love this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing the device into his shirt and patting it, Cardin stepped over Ruby's body and into the bathroom. Weiss Schnee, the prissy, stuffy, bitchy heiress smiled back at him. With a finger between his lips he leaned closer to the mirror, pressed out his smaller chest, and swayed his hips. \"Oh Cardin, you stud. Bend me over and ravage me, you magnificent bastard.\" Hearing Weiss of all people calling to him made him grow damp in a hurry, rubbing down his nimble frame with both hands as he let out a moan. \"Fuck, I bet she'd sound so good...! Wonder how she feels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could totally go again. He didn\u2019t need the life swap to know how to masturbate - Weiss\u2019 \u201cplumbing\u201d was the same as Ruby\u2019s after all - and getting worked up would be easier. He was Weiss Schnee now though; heiress to the Schnee Dust Company, top tier student, and a looker to boot, there was a lot of fun he could have with his new disguise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again he was confronted with choices. Ravage Weiss\u2019 form and slip into another like he was changing clothes? It was tempting, especially as he played the part of a horny bitch before the mirror. He really should get back at her for what she\u2019d said earlier anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasturbate, roam Beacon, or screw with team RWBY some more. Cardin whimpered as he forced his hands from his chest, smoothing out his clothes and grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCan\u2019t have Schnee ruining my run,\u201d Cardin said, looking around the room. There wasn\u2019t anything like ropes in the room. \u201cSeriously? I thought the Belladonna girl would have ropes. She always seemed like a dominatrix.\u201d The last thing he wanted was Weiss to escape and warn the others that someone had a remote that swapped bodies. Most people would think she was crazy, but her team would realize soon enough she was right. He needed to make sure she was out of the picture for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrapping the sheets from the beds, he wrapped them up tightly into rope like objects. Thankfully, Weiss in Ruby\u2019s body was still unconscious and he bound her up tightly. First, he tied up her arms and then her legs, then for good measure, tied them together. Weiss wasn\u2019t the strongest girl around, so this should do. Yang would have torn them apart with ease. Still, Cardin wanted to humiliate her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need these, so you can have them to kill you big mouth shut, Schnee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin reached under his new skirt and pulled off the pure white panties. He then crumbled it into a ball and shoved it into Weiss\u2019s mouth. After that, he dragged her into the closet and put her in the back of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d Cardin wiped his brow. \u201cHave fun tied up for a bit. Enjoy your partner\u2019s body.\u201d He laughed. It didn\u2019t matter that he was panty less. If anyone saw him, they would see Weiss doing this. \u201cWhat to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on Weiss\u2019 bed and thought about his next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he rubbed his crotch, slipping a delicate finger into his slit as he debated what to do. The pleasure was nearly as amazing as Ruby. Though, now that Cardin had experience, he wasn\u2019t as mind numbing. Weiss actually touched herself now and then so she wasn\u2019t completely new. She was a virgin though and Cardin would have to do something about that. He gasped a bit in Weiss\u2019 voice as he played with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to go out, that\u2019s for sure. Whether it was to find the locations of the last two members of Team RWBY, or to ruin Weiss\u2019 reputation. Both were good options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Cardin finally said after climaxing. He made a mess on Weiss\u2019 bed, but again, he didn\u2019t care. She would have to deal with it on her own. Standing up and straightening out his dress, without putting on panties, he grabbed her scroll and exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake would most likely be in the library. That\u2019s where Weiss\u2019 life told him she would be. If not there, she would be at a tree out back of Beacon enjoying the fresh air.  Yang would probably be in the training room or the gym working out at this time. It would be easy to make them hate Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, Cardin had other options available to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss insulted him a lot over the time here, always acting like she was better than everyone. Criticized people\u2019s food, their skills, how skilled they were, looks, and more. She had to be dropped down a peg or two. There were a lot of people at Beacon. The right show would make sure her life was ruined. Maybe go to the cafeteria, eat enough junk food until he hurled, then use something to masturbate in front of everyone. He could then reset with the remote and leave her to explain her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust an example, but it did sound fun. There were possibly better options if he thought about it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cardin decided agaist the library and cafeteria and decided to visit the school gymnasium. Yang was most likely there and just imagining the things he could do to the girl sent a shock below the waist. It turns out Weiss had some beef with the Blonde hottie, his eye\u2019s turning to \u201chis\u201d breasts, and it became apparent to Winchester that these issues wasnt just about bust their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXiao Long was a fiery soul, always butting heads with anyone and solving problems with her fists. And this was something Weiss disagreed on, having preferred diplomacy and compromises. It became obvious to Cardin that the top team of the first years even had cracks in their perfect little group and Weiss\u2019s body (or subconscious) was serving it piecemeal to \u2018her\u2019 new mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid thoughts and complaints came rushing into Cardin, an imaginary slide show playing on loop for him to decipher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She shouldn\u2019t coddle her sister too much, Ruby\u2019d end up a bigger dolt than she already is if she keeps acting like Ruby\u2019s caretaker!\u2019 Okay a sensible advice, if Cardin actually cared about their team cohesion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Ruby would listen to MY sound advices if Yang didn\u2019t butt in to make stupid puns!\u2019 Whaddya know, the Ice Queen\u2019s got a short - though subtle - temper, Cardin thought. Somehow he felt insulted by his own crass accusation, his face sporting Weiss\u2019s signature sneer as he passed by two nobodies. Said two gave way to the angry Schnee to avoid her wrath. \u2018See if these two nobodies could get the memo then it should\u2019ve been easy for Yang.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She keeps trying to kick my ass for fighting Ruby or that idiot Arc, combat school anyone?!\u2019 Cardin\u2019s thoughts complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She only thinks about herself and that sister of hers!\u2019 Weiss\u2019s body supported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Damn that bitch!\u2019 Both mind and body thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Weiss\u2019 arrived at the gym with a little too much time to boil over her grievances against tall busty and blonde. Cardin\u2019s mind wanting revenge and her own body\u2019s muscle memory had made the Schnee crave some deserved payback. Her eyes laid on her target and she kept her reaction to herself. It was unbefitting of her stature, her body said. I ain\u2019t letting the slut see this coming plus her tits are popping out, said Cardin\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting a closer look - her body said it was reconnaissance against the enemy and her mind just wanted to see those tits bounce around - \u2018Weiss\u2019 stomped her way to Yang\u2019s workout station. The blonde girl was busy doing jump ropes, her generous cleavage putting on a show for the heiress to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang spoke up, a confident grin on her face. \u201cHeya Ice Queen, what\u2019s chillin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting to facepalm, \u2018Weiss\u2019 gave the girl a smug smile before answering back, \u201cOh nothing too important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one free seat, back straight, legs crossed, highlighting her shapely thighs. Her stoic white eyes glued on to Xiao Long twin peaks as it rose and settled from Yang\u2019s brisk breathing. \u201cJust enjoying the view.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang let out a snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you Weiss, acting like a regular teenager. But the eye candy are on the other side of the gym.\u201d Yang pointed to the boys side of the gym. All forms of muscle and masculinity resided there, pumping iron to get into tip top shape or just to show of their guns. While her mind saw nothing unusual, Weiss\u2019s body reacted positively to such a sight, something in her yearning or more than a peek, but stopped the moment she saw one of the guys using the treadmill. \u201cWell eye-candy and Jaune.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow insufferable\u201d, commented Weiss both her mind and body once again in sync though from two different reasons: her body was annoyed by the blonde who could never get the memo she wasn\u2019t interested in dating him and her mind just wanted to shove the fool into a locker and launch it sky high. This earned another snicker from Yang but this time there was no follow up jab. With the pent up frustration Weiss\u2019s body needed to vent and her mind finally getting its revenge plan motion, it became apparent that she needed to humiliate Yang in more than one way. But how should he go about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote could nearly change anything about Yang, eyeing the peaks, both physical or mental. And almost instantly she devised a couple of plans without a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling proudly, remote aimed at Yang, she pressed a button.</span></div></div>",

The boy however took a slip from the treadmill as a result and got flung out of the gym just like slapstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Weiss\u2019 took note of the \u2018new\u2019 Yang. Nothing looked too different appearance wise, those breast of hers still tight in her work out tank top. Weiss resisted the urge to play with them now, she would bide her time and take things slow. Step 1 being...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I think it would be neat if we do a little spar, don\u2019t you agree Yang?\u201d She gave a good stretch, using muscle memory to flaunt her body, while Cardin never in his life played the temptress it\u2019d seem that Weiss\u2019s body had a little bit of experience in buttering people up, after all she would need to manipulate anyone when she took control of the SDC. She made sure that Yang had a good view of Weiss\u2019s shapely legs and the quick twirl to the changing room made her show a little bit of her bare ass to Xiao Long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess it\u2019ll be fun... yeah let\u2019s do that! I kinda want to see how Ember Celica goes against that toothpick of yours,\u201d Yang followed suit, and the two began to chat along the way. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary other than the fact the two were getting along alot better than weeks before. And the way Yang tried, keyword tried, to stop ogling Weiss\u2019s ass was becoming apparent to the heiress. A cruel smile etched on Weiss\u2019s face, she had Yang where she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep two was here in the changing room. Both their lockers were close to each other, and Weiss took initiative to get out of uniform. She haphazardly ditched her blazer then polo onto Yang. Instead of dumping it and complain like she would normally do against someone she had beef with, Yang - face beet red - brought it close to her face. Something was wrong with her, the butterflies in her stomach were going crazy. She couldn\u2019t resist her team mate\u2019s scent and any form of subtlety from her sneaking a peek was replaced by a lovestruck glare on Weiss\u2019s full moon. Yang dropped the clothes, mouth agape, face heated. \u201cUrk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat beautiful sight did not last forever, Weiss had swapped into her combat attire immediately, leaving Yang wanting more. So focused she was on that short miracle, she failed to notice Weiss\u2019s advance on her and that hungry smile the heiress carried. She only came to her senses when the pale girl grunted at her to hurry, her eyes slowly trailing below Yang\u2019s waistline.\u2018Please don\u2019t tell me she sees how wet I am down there... NO! No way am I getting turned on by this!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rushed to her locker and picked up her weapons, she decided against changing and wanted nothing more but to get this over with. She egged Weiss to follow her and it took alot more of her mental strength to pull her amber eyes away from the Schnee\u2019s glowing white. Something was clearly wrong with her, she was never this nervous with girls. And yet here she was, struggling to have a proper conversation with her team mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I like... Weiss?\u2019 was one repetitive thought that entered her mind. She would have laughed at that suggestion alone a few mninutes ago but the aching in her heart, her rapid breathing and the joy she felt whenever the heiress smiled back at her with sparkle in her eyes made Yang very confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped the spar would have knocked some sense into her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Schnees had everything. Money, fame, popularity bought by the two of those. Weiss was, and Cardin loathed to admit it, probably one of the smartest girls not just in their year but in Beacon as a whole. And sure, she was hardly a model like Nikos or Xiao Long but she was a delicate beauty in her own right. Really the bitch had everything going for her. In the back of his mind a voice was shouting at him that it wasn't true, that her life was anything but glitter and gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it definitely wouldn't be when he was through with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his ass and vagina bare to the world, albeit beneath a skirt, he left the room, stuffing the remote down his shirt for the time being. Students had begun to mill about now and Cardin made a point to sway his hips, grinning when the motions caused his skirt to flit up. Surely people were getting a good glimpse of everything beneath the skirt, and if not the fluids still leaking down his legs made more than a few heads turn his way. Just to add icing to the cake he winked, pursed his lips, and waved at most guys who looked his way. The majority were stunned, beyond belief that Weiss Schnee of all people smiled at them or waved, much less strut down the halls soaking wet. With any luck he'd given them some sweet dreams for the next week. For Weiss? Nothing but nightmares were in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cafeteria would be busier even in between meals. The library felt too stuffy and he couldn't think of much to do in there anyways, shy of stripping down. So, after a few flights of stares, a couple of hormonal induced nosebleeds, he arrived at the dining hall. Students milled about, some studying, others enjoying a late meal. Scanning the room he grinned when he spotted his own body, with Ruby still living his life, sat off to the side with his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Awesome, won't have to go far to get back then.\"</i> Maybe he'd try to figure out a way to let Ruby realize what was going on before he dumped her in Weiss. That would be a riot! Weiss, bound upstairs in his partner's body while Ruby would come to in Weiss', violated for a whole crowd to see. It wouldn't get much better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I dump rose in the Ice Queen though I gotta have some fun.\" Which meant finding a nice phallic shaped food and introducing it to Weiss' already soaked pussy. Easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding something to use was easy. The salad bar, virtually untouched by students - who ate the healthy shit anyways - had just what he was after. Sashaying his way to the display he sifted through the containers until he found a nice sizable cucumber, unpeeled and uncut. \"Perfect!\" Just what he would need. Running a slender finger along the length he chuckled, scanned the room for a suitable spot, and made his way over to a table at the head of the room. Just for shits and giggles he made sure to walk by his body and winked, blowing a kiss and rolling his eyes as \"he\" just stared, dumbstruck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Would I really be that shocked? Man.\"</i> He supposed it wasn't every day Weiss overtly flirted with someone. What he was about to do definitely would be a first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up onto the table he peeled back his skirt and planted his rear down, grinning as a few heads turned immediately. Reaching up and unclipping his tiara he let Weiss' stark hair fall down her back, tossing his head to shake it free. After spreading his legs and running his tongue along the cucumber, gathering even more onlookers in the process, he cleared his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" he shouted, Weiss' shrill, demanding tone filling the now silent hall. \"I've just been so damn horny lately, with all you studs and babes walking around all the time. I just can't help myself anymore.\" Deciding to hell with his shirt he grabbed the top and pulled. Buttons flied free and he pried open his blouse, peeling it back until his chest, as meager as it was, pushed out. \"And so, I've decided to have a little fun, but since I'm so generous I want to share it with all of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back laughter he reached back and fumbled with his bra, unhooking it and tossing it to a lucky, and very surprised student. Sending a wink his way as well he licked the cucumber one more time before leaning back, holding himself up with one hand and running the bumpy vegetable around his primed pussy, lips quivering in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And remember!\" He grinned, pressing the cucumber against his lips. \"Today's show is brought to you courtesy of the SDC! Be sure to record this, I'm sure daddy would love to see how I'm doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he shoved the phallic food into his lips, gritting his teeth and blinking back tears as he forced it deeper. Pain blossomed and he felt Weiss' hymen push back, weakly, before breaking. Crying out and tossing his head back he began to pant, closing his eyes and waiting for his Aura to get to work. After about a minute of respite the pain became more manageable and a lecherous smile returned to his face, giggling as he rolled his hips, taking one of his small breasts in his hand and moaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw yeah... That feels so good...\" Quite a few Scrolls had come out already and he was just getting started! Cardin shuddered and began to pump the cucumber in and out, toes curling as the bumps rubbed against his walls, striking his pussy as he angled it, vying for Weiss' sweet spot. With his nipples hard as diamonds already he pinched one between two delicate fingers, twisting and pulling, working until his pink skin turned red from abuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he kept going. When one nipple was thoroughly teased he moved to the other, flicking it, pinching and twisting. Unable to lift Weiss' puny breast to her mouth he settled for drooling on it instead, lathering his spit into pale skin and grinning as a few students came closer still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're fucking ruined, Schnee. No way in hell are you living this down!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately as much fun as he was having Weiss' body just wasn't used to the kind of stimulation he was giving her. Pressure built up and he grunted, closing his legs and trembling as he tried to stave off his orgasm for as long as he could. His arm pumped faster, spilling fluid down his thighs and dribbling on the table, crying out each time it struck deeper and deeper. Lifting his hips and pressing into the vegetable further he gasped when it finally struck gold. A bolt of lightning shot down his spine and his head went fuzzy, lolling back as he moaned. Weiss' legs lifted and he cried out again as the climax finally hit, soaking the cucumber, his hand, and the seat beneath him. As if that wasn't enough he actually squealed during the orgasm too, whimpering as he came down from the high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn, you're fucking loud! Who knew such a prissy girl was such a slut?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling breathlessly he eased the cucumber out of himself, admiring his handiwork before tossing it to the floor, watching it roll away with a wet slop. By now the students that hadn't left in disgust, very few judging by the crowd, were crowded around and watching, slack jawed and probably just the slightest bit turned on by what they'd witnessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah...

Your whole team must be full of horny sluts!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing down from his high he rolled his hips again and shivered, cool air hitting his thighs and abused pussy.

If he hit the Undo button, Weiss would be in her body and he would be bound up in Ruby\u2019s body stuck in the closet. If he did the Reset, he would be in his body watching the show. Actually, that would be pretty fun. That would be perfect. Weiss naked in the cafeteria and Ruby tied up in the locker room. How could he make this better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little gay as he was a guy, but he could swallow his nausea a moment for pure revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have three holes for some lucky guys!\u201d Cardin called out in Weiss\u2019 voice. \u201cFirst come, first serve! Before we get caught!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeirdly, he saw himself hesitate as other guys rushed forward. Thinking why, most likely because Weiss wasn\u2019t Pyrrha or Yang. He would prefer to fuck those two into oblivion. He would have to figure out how to do that with the remote. Anyway, he felt a couple strong hands grab his waist and two guys began to position themselves. Pants were already on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of them would consider this a once in a life time opportunity. Several Scrolls were recording everything so he kept up the flirtatious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho knew the Ice Queen was such a slut.\u201d One of the guys said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares, lets fuck the bitch out of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two will be my firsts, lucky you!\u201d Cardin laughed. \u201cReally pound me. I don\u2019t want to be able to walk after this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a slut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin gritted his teeth and tried to relax into Weiss\u2019 mind as two dicks began to pushed against both of his lower holes. He wasn\u2019t gay and didn\u2019t like cocks, but he needed to do this right. Pleasure rocked his body, along with pain. Weiss\u2019 ass was tight and even if the guys wasn\u2019t very big, it was painful to get in. The guy fucking his pussy was smaller than the cucumber, so he fit in nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d He cried out, as the waves of pleasure ran through him. Maybe being fucked as a girl wasn\u2019t too bad. At this point, Weiss was never going to live this down. She\u2019ll probably have to leave Beacon or at the least never leave her room anymore. \u201cYou two are amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod\u2026she\u2019s tight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrigid bitch turned slut, part 1.\u201d Someone yelled out and the guys laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid Weiss lose her mind?!\u201d A girl cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe the pressure got to her.\u201d A more passive guy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still have a mouth!\u201d Cardin yelled out. \u201cWho wants to shut me up?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin looked up to see a big second year walking around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope your dick is proportional to your size.\u201d Cardin laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get choked for sure.\u201d He promised, pulling down his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, Cardin felt a little inadequate. Maybe once he was back in his body, he should steal that monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he needed to time this perfect. He did NOT want to suck a dick. That was disgusting. No, he needed to make it so when Weiss was back to her body, she was stuck like this. However, appearances needed to be kept. He licked his lips and opened his mouth as his hand slipped under his clothes. It took some work, as his crotch was being pounded and it felt like his insides were being churned up. Girl sex was extremely different than being a guy. His mind was getting hazy as he was succumbing to the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy finally shoved his dick into Weiss\u2019 stolen mouth and Cardin hit the Undo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light and Cardin found himself watching the spectacle, the remote in his hand. Weiss was on her side being fucked in all three holes, her eyes wide as everyone recorded. According to the instructions, the person would try to rationalize why they did something when someone was controlling their life. This was COMPLETELY different thought and Cardin was anxious to see what she would do. Freaking out would be fine, but if she tried to rationalize it, that would be hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pocketed the remote as he watched.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling not even an inkling of remorse for his actions Cardin grinned, took his Scroll out and snapped a quick picture. A memento, or even better, blackmail if this whole fiasco was somehow swept under the rug. He doubted it though; nearly two dozen students had hung around to witness Weiss' humiliation. It would take a miracle, hell, magic to make this go away. And since magic was a load of bullshit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sucks to be you, Schnee,\" Cardin jeered, unheard as the crowd around him cheered. Weiss tried her best to compose herself but began to spit and wipe her mouth in a desperate attempt to rid herself of her impromptu meal. With cum still dribbling out between her legs and from her ass there wasn't anything she could do to not look like a total whore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Serves you right. Maybe from now on you won't act so damn high and mighty around everyone!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere behind them the doors to the dining hall slammed open. Glass shattered as the windows exploded on impact and students immediately reacted, scrambling out of the way of the oncoming storm. Cardin, taking a hint, stepped aside and blanched as an absolutely livid Glynda Goodwitch marched past him. Still sat on the table and trying to cover herself desperately Weiss shrank back when the woman stopped before her, riding crop bending between her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor! I... I...\" Weiss stammered, drawing back with a flinch as leather struck the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Are. You. Doing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Weiss tried to justify her actions. Unable to find any explanation she curled up on herself and shook her head, burying her face in her knees. Even with her being aware of what happened and knowing that she herself had apparently attempted it of her own accord left her speechless. As ridiculous as it was for her to go from standoffish and unapproachable to a cock-hungry girl in the span of an hour that's exactly what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Collect your things, now. We are going to see Ozpin.\" Glynda reared around and stared down the remaining crowd. Though Cardin knew what the woman's Semblance was - Telekinesis - he swore she was trying to set them all ablaze with her glare alone. \"As for the rest of you, I expect far better of our students! Each and every person here is going to be spoken to and, considering some of you were participating in this debauchery you will receive punishment befitting your behavior!\" She drew a deep breath, adjusted her glasses, then released the air in a sharp sigh. \"I think expulsion is perfectly reasonable, but that remains up to the headmaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bullshit, she started this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a whore! We didn't do anything wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting a vulgar display like this is acceptable?!\" Glynda's voice shook the room and Cardin flinched, glancing sidelong at the trio of guys, two of whom were hurriedly trying to zip up their trousers now. \"You four, come with me. As for the rest of you, don't think you're excused. We'll be dealing with the rest of you as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this couldn't have turned out much better. Sure, Cardin himself was in line to get some kind of reprimand, maybe even a mark on his record, but he wasn't about to be expelled. The other guys though? Weiss? Their tenure at Beacon was good as finished. Watching Glynda herd the indecent quartet out of the room he smiled knowingly at Weiss, winking as she glanced at him. Did she remember? Hell if he knew, and hell if he cared. No one was going to believe a word she said; claim someone else took her body and made her do it? They'd send her to the loony bin before the day was through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this thing is fucking great!\" Seriously, if he ever met the mad genius who made the remote he'd have to thank them. Cardin slipped the device into his pocket and patted it, whistling as he broke away from the crowd and headed for the doors. Making sure the coast was clear he laughed, folding his hands behind his head and humming as he cut across the commons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was good right now. He'd had his fun with two girls, all but ruined Schnee, and the day was still young! So much more to do...</span></div></div>",

Then who would he have left to mess with? The Schnee wasn\u2019t as hot as some of her teammates, but Cardin could have fun with her. Part of him hoped she stuck around and went along with the idea that stress was getting to her. Ozpin was kind of a softy in that regard. Shoot, they didn\u2019t even seem to care about bullying. Even if they did, now he was perfectly safe as he could mess with everyone and they wouldn\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should be his next target?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCardin?\u201d A familiar voice with an interesting accent caught his attention. He turned around and saw a familiar rabbit Faunus with brown hair. \u201cDidn\u2019t Proffessor Goodwitch say everyone had to stay in the cafeteria?\u201d<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/vmQsPxH6xhwGPcnd8\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/vmQsPxH6xhwGPc...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d Cardin sneered. The girls name was Velvet Scarlatina, a real push over. She had some decent combat skills for being a second year, but the girl was an easy target. He pulled her ears multiple times and she did nothing. Her teammates? They were another story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get in trouble.\u201d Velvet warned. Her voice wasn\u2019t very strong though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, maybe I don\u2019t care?\u201d Cardin touched the remote in his  pocket and debated what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was somewhat attractive. Even the rabbit ears weren\u2019t a put off. She was just a Faunus and inferior to humans.  Still, there was a rumor he heard. Coco Adel, her team leader, and her was an item. Velvet may have been okay, but Coco was damn hot. Maybe this could work to his favor. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t dare of crossing Glynda Goodwitch, but with the remote, he wasn\u2019t afraid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of getting girls kicked out from school, maybe he can just use them to satisfy his needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to tell her you left.\u201d Velvet muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk, fine.\u201d Cardin rolled his eyes. \u201cJust because Goodwitch said so, not because of you.\u201d Velvet nodded and looked relieved he weren\u2019t putting up a fight. He turned around and went back into the cafeteria. Right before he entered through the doors, he aimed at Velvet and pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of green light and everything sounded so much clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now watching himself head into the cafeteria. After a Body and Life Swap, Cardin was now living the life of Velvet while in her body. Before Velvet could leave in his life and body, Cardin aimed the remote and did a Body Part Swap. The next moment, he felt the panties he was wearing tighten in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now had his dick with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure he had to lose Velvet\u2019s vagina, but it was worth it for what he had planned. If all the rumors were true, he was going to fuck the Fashionista Coco. Of course, because of the remote, it\u2019s going to be considered normal for Velvet to have a dick since he did the Body Part Swap after the Life and Body Swap. He flipped her long hair back over his shoulder and walked down the hallway. Velvet hadn\u2019t been in the cafeteria, so she didn\u2019t have to stay. The only reason he didn\u2019t argue with her was so she in his body would wait in the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hallways mirror caused him to stop as he passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his face was a very un-Velvet like smirk. His new rabbit ears also switched and he could hear everything. While outside the cafeteria, he heard everyone discussing what they just saw. Now they were nothing but mummers from this distance, but not something humans would normally be able to hear. He grabbed her breast for a moment and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d came out Velvet\u2019s accented voice. \u201cNot Yang level tits, but better than Schnee\u2019s. Now, how about I find your team leader and see if we can have some fun. Or, maybe I can ruin your reputation a bit too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet was just a Faunus, but if she was kicked out, the only person he really enjoyed bullying was Arc. He needed to do just enough that Velvet was an outcast but not enough to get kicked out. The question was did he do that before or after he met with Coco? If he did it before, it might affect the relationship with Coco.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While there was a plethora of things Cardin would love to do as Velvet, the least of which including getting her expelled, there was so much more fun to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, he could mess with teams like he'd originally planned. A difficult plan to stick to honestly; finding oneself in the body of an attractive girl made concentrating pretty difficult. Even if team RWBY hadn't been entirely pulled apart by his shenanigans there would definitely be backlash. Weiss was likely facing some serious punishment, Ruby was probably going to be a total mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the damage done to them - for now - maybe CFVY should be up next? They were his seniors and strutted around like they owned the damn school. Coco Adel especially. That fashionista acted so stuck up in a way entirely different to Weiss, and why? Because she dressed in overly expensive clothes? <i>\"I can definitely get some payback on her now.\"</i> 'Velvet' smirked and he groped at his chest again, feeling a stirring beneath his skirt. <i>\"Fuck her brains out first then ruin Coco's rep. She won't know what hit her.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of not knowing, Cardin grunted as he walked into someone else. With a squeak he tumbled back and fell onto his full rear, wincing and biting his tongue. \"Fuck!\" Who in the hell was dumb enough to bump into him? Were they asking to get pummeled?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right, Velvet's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Velvet, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was too perfect. Cardin glanced up, pursing his lips before putting on his most innocent smile he could. \"Oh, hey Blake.\" A hand was offered and he took it, yanked to his feet. Gods his ass smarted! Giving himself a rub through his skirt he winced, one ear swiveling when Blake cleared her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Should I contact Professor Peach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's fine!\" Cardin said, holding his hands up. \"I just hurt my ass, that's all.\" Blake raised an eyebrow and he kicked himself mentally. Did Velvet not curse? Not in public, her life told him. Rarely if ever even. <i>\"Jeez, and I thought Rose was a prude. This girl's so innocent it's fucking gross!\"</i> Surprised the hell out of him too. He figured an animal like Velvet would swear like a sailor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well, sorry for bumping into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Blake!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't plan to swap again so soon, not when he'd just become Velvet. Besides, after having a vagina for two rounds he wanted to get his 'dipstick' wet, and trading it away again made that impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to say though, Blake was pretty damn hot. Once you got past the whole annoying emo thing she had going on she was an exotic beauty, probably from Mistral. Almond shaped amber eyes, long black hair, and a body clad in what really seemed more like a knock-off maid's outfit than anything. Not now though, as right now Blake had on the same school uniform Cardin did. His eyes drifted down to her hips, locking onto them as Blake passed him by, burying her face in a book again. And there it was: the famed Bellabooty. He felt his erection stiffen and he had to adjust his panties. Why hadn't he swapped his underwear with Velvet's too?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping was an option, albeit one he didn't want to do just yet. Especially not when Velvet's life kicked in again and his eyes locked on the little black bow atop Blake's head. \"No fucking way...\" he mumbled. \"She's a Faunus?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there was something he could use. Clearly Blake was trying to hide that little fact from people. He could totally out her, spill the beans and let the rest of Beacon decide how to treat her. Considering Velvet's own time there Blake wouldn't have a great semester. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin began to follow Blake back down the hallway, patting the remote in his pocket. Did Blake know about Weiss yet? Causing her to panic might be fun, although he was sure the rest of RWBY would hear about their teammate soon enough anyways. And there was the option of swapping again, of course. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he wanted to out her, it needed to be done by her teammate. Well, her teammate with him controlling their life. But that was kind of boring. He wanted something more. To see that girl in her place. For now, he was hoping an opportunity presented itself. Since Blake didn\u2019t have any trouble with Velvet, she didn\u2019t question while Cardin was following her. She seemed to be heading to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cardin\u2019s prayers were answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake!\u201d Yang called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang\u2026 why do you have THAT with you?\u201d Blake asked, her voice growing cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin turned to see Yang carrying a dog in her arms. He had heard rumors about Team RWBY hiding an animal in their dorm. Velvet\u2019s life was telling her it was named Zwei. Blake hated the dog and Cardin knew why. She was a cat Faunus and couldn\u2019t resist her animalistic nature. However, the dog was giving him an interesting opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking him back up to the room,\u201d Yang told her. \u201cSomeone said Weiss got into some trouble in the cafeteria, but I couldn\u2019t get a lot of information. Going to check up and see what happened. I can\u2019t seem to reach Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant me to help?\u201d Blake asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust let Ruby know I\u2019m looking for her,\u201d Yang assured her. \u201cOh, hey, Velvet. Sorry I can\u2019t stick around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I pet Zwei real quick?\u201d Cardin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Yang let Zwei down who hopped over to his feet. As Cardin knelt down to pet him, the two girls spoke a bit more and he pulled out the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light and nothing seemed to change at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll contact you if this is anything bad.\u201d Yang assured Blake, rushing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Cardin asked, feigning concern while smirking on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Weiss probably got tired of someone hitting on her,\u201d Blake sighed. \u201cHope it wasn\u2019t Jaune, or I\u2019ll have to listen to Ruby reprimand her for hours.\u201d Her eye sfell on Zwei. \u201cDo you have to take him around with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s part of the family.\u201d Cardin lied, thinking about what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe targeted Yang with the remote and Swapped Pets. As he didn\u2019t have one and Yang did, only he had one now. He debated doing more to Yang, but he wanted to think of a really special punishment for her. All the times she kicked his ass in Combat Class was going to be repaid tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, keep him away from me please.\u201d Blake replied. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the library if you need me though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll put him away.\u201d Cardin promised as Blake turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now deciding what to do with Blake now. See, for him to target her and Zwei, he would have to do a triangular swap. Swap with one of them then the other and the back with the first one to get his trait back. The first idea he considered was swapping Zwei and Blake\u2019s clothes. If he swapped with Zwei, he would be naked except for a collar. Then he would swap with Blake, so she would be nude and he would have her clothes. Then swap with Zwei so he was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe famous Bellabooty would be on full display and she would wear a collar like a true animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe downside is everyone would consider it normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option he thought of was swapping lives with Zwei, so he would be considered the dog. Then he would swap Positions with Blake. That would make Zwei the member of Team RWBY while Blake would be the pet of Cardin. Cardin considered lives, but only he would see Zwei as Blake, everyone else would see a dog. Actually, that might not be a bad idea. If he was caught, everyone would see Velvet fucking a dog. Maybe he could get caught on purpose. Though, keeping Blake as a pet would be hilarious. A true animal\u2019s position. He might have to swap Zwei\u2019s loyalty with her too, so Blake will do what he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many choices. Though, he couldn't wait for Yang to find out what happened to Weiss and Ruby.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Remembering the pamphlet he found with the remote, he recalled a specific portion; users were only aware of the remote's effects if they were TOUCHING it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought to himself: <i><b>I haven't NEARLY gotten my fill of revenge, and if I'm gonna get it, she has to REALLY feel it...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin quickly backtracked to the hall where he encountered Pyrrha. <i>Good, she's still taking her time walking...</i> he thinks, seeing \"her\" a bit ways down the corridor. He began to, while very much enjoying the jiggling sensation of his new breasts within his shirt, pick up his pace to a slight jog towards his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nikos!\" he shouted, unaccustomed to the sound of Pyrrha's higher pitch escaping his mouth. Stopping her, (or his, in this case) stride down the hall, Cardin watched his former body turn towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is it now, Cardin?\" Seeing and hearing himself talking with the soft grace Pyrrha's voice normaly carried was a bit jarring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, listen. Professor Port's been kinda breathin' down my neck about the way I 'carry myself as a student.' Says that I need to get my act together, especially with Arc, or I'm in some deep shit\", he lies through his teeth. \"So I was thinkin', maybe if I can be quote-unquote 'Cool With You,' he could get off my back, and Jauney-Boy could stop running to the staff every minute I'm around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want ME to help you out, Cardin?\" Pyrrha remarks. \"I'm not very fond of you as-is, but trying to get my assistance in something for YOUR personal gain? I'm sorry, but I'll have to pass,\" she tells him, as she begins to turn away from him once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait wait wait,\" Cardin nearly yells. <i><b>Damn, I've never heard Nikos shout like this before,</b></i> he silently remarks. \"Think about it this way: I can get Port off my tail, and Arc stops looking like a deer caught in headlights whenever he has to walk in the hallways!\" He gives Pyrrha a cheeky smile, which with Pyrrha's face would have sealed the deal, if it weren't for all of that reality-altering stuff the remote did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how would you propose you earn my favor?\" Pyrrha questions him, her expression almost blank. That was the phrase he was waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy,\" Cardin exclaims, pulling out the remote from his skirt pocket. \"I just need you to hold this!\"  Pyrrha gives the remote a questionable look?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... remote..?\" she finally says, looking towards Cardin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Simple as that, figured something basic like this would be enough of an ice breaker,\" Cardin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>I knew he wasn't exactly A+ in the brains department,  but holding a remote for him?</b> Pyrrha thinks. <b><i>...well, if it can get him off of Jaune, then it can't be anything TOO mean...</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha reaches up to grab the remote; the minute her hand makes contact with the surface of the device, Cardin quickly jabs one of the buttons. Which button did he press?</i></span></div></div>",

What did grabbing your remote do..?\" Pyrrha finally says, after an awkward pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did everything great okay thanks later!\" Cardin hastily rambled, before running off in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There's only one way for me to check if this actually worked, I gotta find someone...</i> he thought to himself, as he trotted towards an area of the school that had more students about. Making his way towards one of the more open foyers where students liked to mingle, Cardin found someone who would easily prove if his plan worked: Velvet Scarlatina. He cautiously approached the Faunus, still unsure of his plan's success, and greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh... Velvet. Wha-what's going on?\" he stammered, fully expecting his idea to burn up in front of him. Velvet turned around to see who had called her name, Cardin subconsciously wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hello there, Pyrrha! How are you today?\" she asked, giving Cardin a gentle smile. \"Still working hard to be at the top of class?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin's fear turned into shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, totally! Listen, I gotta go, I have some SUPER important homework... stuff... to do, I'll talk to you later!\" he yammered, before sprinting off. Velvet gave Pyrrha a curious face as she ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, wasn't that a bit odd?</i> she wondered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure he was out of Velvet's line of sight, Cardin made a beeline to the nearest bathroom. Making sure it was empty, he ducked inside. He slowly strode over to the mirror, eyeing up his new reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit... it worked. It worked! It fuc-king WORKED! She thought I was Nikos! Holy fuck, she actually thought I was Pyrrha-fucking-Nikos!\" the new Pyrrha cheered to herself. Cardin was getting excited, he now had the identity of the bitch at the top of his shit list. In fact, he was getting excited in more ways than one. \"Given that this is now MY body, and MY life, I should get better acquainted with it, shouldn't I?\" he wondered aloud, as his new slim fingers reached up to his well-endowed chest and started groping it with intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmmm, oh fuck, I didn't get a chance to do this earlier,\" he mused to himself, the almost-seductive tone he made Pyrrha's voice take only turning him on even more. He slowly slid one hand away from a breast, running it down his taut stomach, that he could feel, even under his uniform; Pyrrha Nikos had a body of sin. The hand slowly came down underneath her skirt, before moving upwards to reach the waistband of his tights and panties; he barely even noticed the foreign sensation the underwear caused him when he initially switched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, ohhhhhh...\" Cardin bit his now-plump lips, as his hand roughly caressed Pyrrha's most intimate spot, gliding his fingertips slowly over her slit that he now possessed. His body shuddered, the sensation of attempting to pleasure himself being very strange and unusual for his male mind, but he wasn't going to stop so soon. <i>I've already taken it this far, Nikos, might as well go all the way!</i> his thoughts echoed, as he finally took the plunge, and sent two of Pyrrha's digits up inside himself, her body bucking from the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh YEAH, UHN! Nikos, your body is fuckin' FAN-AHH-TASTIC!\" he shouted in-between rough thrusts, a moan escaping his lips every time. \"Now nobody-AHN- is gonna know that inside-HMM- this hot bod is good ol' Cardin Winchest-AAH!!\" He couldn't even finish saying his own name as he tweaked a nipple through the fabric of his shirt, making his new vagina clench down on his fingers. Cardin was finally able to slow down enough, though still lost in the bliss his new form was experiencing, to look at himself in the mirror. The great Pyrrha Nikos was in front of him, her usually stoic demeanor replaced with a very disheveled look, one hand roughly clamped over a breast, the other deep in her undergarments, face covered in sweat, as well as her tongue lolling out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can doo whatever I want to you Nikos, but more importantly, I can do what I want with your REPUTATION. Your friends are gonna be shocked when the all-new, all-different Pyrrha shows up!\" he smirked to himself, which actually looked almost cute upon her face, until he squinted his eyes shut, still caressing and groping his sensual form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin contemplated continuing his abuse of the poor redhead's shape, but new ideas were beginning to form in his head; what did Cardin want to do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fighting the desire to continue violating himself, Cardin sadly pulled his manicured fingers from his snatch, the urge to finish himself off still burning away at his nethers. As much as he wanted to keep going, there were some fruits of labor he wanted to see produced. Cardin gingerly pulled his panties and tights back over his freshly ravaged vagina, relishing in the feeling of how snug the undergarments clung to his wet crotch. A stray hand brushed across the fabric as he slid it into place, and he had to suppress a moan rising up his throat. Straightening up, he felt a slight tingle in the back of his head, but pushed it aside. Putting his shirt back into place, Cardin made sure he looked presentable and made his way out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hold on, why did I wanna make sure I looked good before I walked outta there?</i> His mind was curious, thinking about HOW he was able to fix his appearance, when he felt the tingle in his head again. A memory flashed, surprising Cardin, one of Pyrrha getting up in the morning and dressing herself for class. As he probed it, more began appearing. Images of training with the rest of Team JNPR, of listening intently to another of Professor Oobleck's lectures, of fighting a Death Stalker in the Emerald Forest... these were Pyrrha's memories!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This... this is good...</i> Cardin smiled devilishly to himself, and began to pick up his pace towards Team JNPR's dorm, caressing his chest as he walked.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ <br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin arrived at the door to JNPR's room. The trip over had been rather unremarkable; even though a few students gave him strange looks when they saw THE Pyrrha Nikos groping herself all over while traveling the halls, all he had to do was flash one of Pyrrha's signature soft smiles (that he now had access to the memory of), and it dissuaded anyone from sharing any remarks. Tapping into her head again, Cardin fumbled through his pockets and grabbed her scroll, coincidentally in the same pocket he slipped the remote. <i>Man, who'd have thought a little thing like you would allow something like this...</i> Cardin thought, as he swiped the scroll against the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the room, Cardin took a quick survey of everything around him. It was fairly standard, like most other rooms; four beds with some dressers between them on one side, and four desks with extra storage containers on the other. Accessing the memories present in his mind again, he followed them to the bed closest to the bathroom; this one was Pyrrha's. He sat down on it, making note of the soft curves of his newly acquired rump. \"Mmmmhhh... even when she sits, it feels divine. Is this how Nikos lives every day? I'd go crazy!\" the redhead said aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was seated out of the public eye, he could take his time exploring his new shape. Starting at his legs, he sensually caressed the nylon-clad limbs, really appreciating the thin fabric as it rubbed against his skin. He smiled to himself as he hooked his thumbs around the waistband once again, sliding the tights down his legs ever-so-slowly, really drinking in the sensation. With the tights off, he approached his underwear again, gripping it in the same fashion as the previous garment. Cardin yelped a little when he felt the fabric, still damp from his earlier session, peel off of the nub of his clit; it stoked the fires again down there, that had dulled on his walk to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He made quick work of his jacket, and took off the ribbon tied to her blouse in no time. Removing the garment, Cardin marveled at the cream-colored mounds nestled in the bra sitting on his chest; he didn't take off his shirt back in the bathroom because of the hassle of tucking everything in again. He was able to unhook the straps of Pyrrha's bra thanks to her muscle memory, and soon it was on the same pile as the rest of her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new \"Pyrrha\" leaned back on his bed, and began inspecting every nook and cranny of his form. Hands rubbing and groping all over his arms, sliding over his stomach, probing between his legs; it was a sensory overload. Cardin pushed a breast up to his mouth and began to gnaw at the nipple, lighting his chest up with the same fire he had experienced earlier. It seemed that Pyrrha's body was finally worked up like it had been back on the main campus grounds, so he picked up where he left off in the restroom, his hand working his crotch with two digits. It seemed like his hand was running on auto-pilot now, ever so gingerly running along his lower lips, and firmly sliding deep into his torso, his breath hitching higher and higher with every thrust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a fever pitch, Pyrrha's form had finally reached its limit, and with a jolt of pure electric bliss, it finally climaxed, her back arching, breast slipping out of his agape mouth, his throat looking for its voice. After a few moments Cardin collapsed down on the bed. \"Oh... my fucking... god... *haaah...* Is this... how good it feels... to be this girl..?\" In his exhaustion, his mind began to wander. <i>Hot damn, I've never felt that good in my life...</i> he thought, reveling in post-orgasm. <i>Today, nobody wanted to talk shit to me, it's like everyone is just inclined to love this girl. I could probably get away with fuckin' murder with a face like this. Boy, am I gonna <b>relish</b> ruining this bitch's life!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile relaxing, an internal reminder went off in his head; it seemed like Pyrrha's body didn't want to stew covered in it's own juices, so Cardin propped himself up and stumbled over to Pyrrha's dresser, still recovering from his \"fun.\" Grabbing a pair of undergarments, a cute matching strapless bra &amp; boyshorts, he tossed her tiara-thing (he had no idea what the hell it actually was called) on the bed, and hobbled himself into the bathroom, stepping into the shower. Turning the water to maximum heat, he reveled in the feeling of the water splashing against his skin, seemingly melting away the fatigue he had just experienced. Lathering up her body, Cardin let \"Pyrrha\" do all the work as he washed his hair and scrubbed himself clean (although he DID take over when it got to scrubbing his crotch; he wasn't gonna let \"her\" take that experience away), and in a few minutes had successfully taken all the bodily fluids off himself. Toweling dry and wrapping his hair, he gingerly stepped out of the shower stall, feeling refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a reason Cardin picked a strapless bra; after sliding the undergarments on (which Cardin noted still felt fantastic), he stepped over to one of the cabinets in the room, and pulled out the outfit he was looking for. Pyrrha's battle wear would have been a nightmare for him to put on in any other scenario, but as if he had been doing this for years, he was able to slip it on with no issues. Stepping into her corset, he gingerly tightened it against his torso, very much enjoying the tight gripping sensation it applied to his chest. He laughed to himself, as he slid her miniskirt over his firm rear, slapping it appreciatively as the elastic gripped his cheeks. \"Man, Nikos' body just doesn't wanna quit, does it?\" Cardin asked himself, hands caressing his buttocks.<br>\r\nNext were the opera gloves, which were pulled on in a single smooth motion. Cardin took his time sliding Pyrrha's stockings up his legs; that feeling was the best, he noted. Clipping on the greaves and cuisses of her armor was... a lot simpler that he thought it would be, honestly. He stepped into her high-heeled boots, taking notice of how he was able to stand so easily in them. Not wasting any extra time, he quickly threw on her bracer, belt, sash, and the bronze bracelet that usually adorned Pyrrha's upper arm. He finished the ensemble off with her gorget, which he clasped around his neck with practiced precision. Putting her circlet back on, he ended his show with tying his hair into its signature ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping over towards the closet once more, he used its mirror to drink in his appearance. His lecherous grin only made the idea of what he was doing <i>SOOOO</i> much more erotic. As far as anybody could tell (besides the real girl herself), Cardin Winchester WAS Pyrrha Nikos. The idea was still so surreal to him, but here he was, using HER hands to caress HER face, in HER room, with HER clothes on. The sheer thrill of nobody knowing who was really lurking underneath her demure skin was peak eroticism. He walked back to her bed, and deftly picked up her soiled uniform before inelegantly dumping it in the closet hamper, nabbing both the swap remote and her scroll from the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping back down on Pyrrha's bed, Cardin just basked in his new look. <i>Y'know,  if it wasn't for the fact I was gonna wreck this girl's life, I don't think I would mind staying as her for longer...</i> Cardin pondered. His thoughts, however, were interrupted by the sound of the door lock beeping, signaling that someone was coming in. He held his breath as the door swung open; this whole scenario still felt so criminal to him. He finally exhaled a wry smirk finding it's way onto his mouth when he finally saw who was stepping into the room: Jaune Arc.</span></div></div>",

For Cardin Winchester to come up to her out of the blue, asking if he could try to ease tensions between him and Jaune? Professor Port must have really brought down his hammer of authority on him, since it seemed like these kinds of actions never yielded any results in the past. Still, all he wanted in return was to hold a remote for him? She knew that Winchester was a few bullets short of a full magazine, but if it meant that he would stop being so abrasive to poor Jaune, then she'd be more than happy to try and work with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The least I can do right now is humor the man,</i> Pyrrha thought to herself, as she reached up to grab hold of the remote Cardin had extended to her. <i>Curious,</i> she pondered, <i>what kind of device is this? I don't think I've ever seen a remote like this before... maybe it's for a radio or something similar?</i> Her hand had finally gripped the item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than a slight tingle, it didn't seem like grabbing the remote actually <i>did</i> anything. She stood there, with the plastic piece in hand, expecting something, anything really to happen to it.<br>\r\n\"...Soooooooo. What did grabbing your remote do..?\" Pyrrha finally asked Cardin, still looking at the remote; she was convinced that Cardin was definitely shorter on the common sense scale than previously thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did everything great okay thanks later!\" In an instant, Cardin had yanked the remote from her hand before darting back around the corner, to the hall he had called her from. <i>This is... yes, he has to be completely out of his mind,</i> she thought. If she had questioned it in her head a bit more, she probably would have wondered why he left in a blur that was so unusually... red,  but she played it off as a trick from the light of the hall windows. Turning back around, she started her trek back to her dorm, only managing to take a few steps before noticing something <i>off.</i> In fact, a LOT of things felt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, I certainly do NOT remember my legs feeling as stuffy as they are right now.</i> Pyrrha turned her head down to find she was now wearing a pair of uniform slacks. \"H-huh?\" she stammered. Gears started turning in her head, trying to understand how quickly her head was able to adjust itself. Her neck tilting down provided another visual shock: <i>Wait, how can I see my feet so clearly? Where is my CHEST??</i> \"What... what is this?\" she said aloud as she brought a hand up to her head, and even MORE alarms were starting to go off; her hair was gone! In its place was a gelled, short cut, that was a far cry from the bangs and ponytail she usually sported. Pyrrha also examined how rough her fingers felt against her forehead; she never had battered, callous hands at this level before, nor did her voice ever reach as low of an octave as it currently did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling into the floor, she yelped as the impact on her butt felt much sharper than it normally would; she had lost the natural padding her rear had. Her hands began to frantically roam across herself; hard abs, pectorals with more muscle mass than she was accustomed to, biceps that were strained against the material of the blazer she now wore, a weird pressure where her legs clasped around her groin. <i>This isn't right, something is wrong here, something is VERY, VERY WRONG,</i> her mind shouted. Pyrrha's thoughts were a panicked jumble, and she had to struggle to her feet, her center of gravity being vastly different from what she was used to. Wobbling over to a classroom, she was able to catch her reflection in the glass of the door; looking back at her was the rough and equally panicked face of Cardin Winchester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</div><br>\r\nRunning through the halls, Pyrrha was barely able to keep herself upright while she frantically searched the empty classrooms for Cardin; her new body's height was throwing her off immensely. \"He HAS to have had something to do with this,\" she muttered under her breath. \"I was perfectly fine until he called me over to see his... REMOTE!\" Two and two finally clicked together in her mind; the red blur she had barely registered when he left had been real, it was HER hair! Somehow that remote Cardin was holding had allowed him to take her appearance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all her room search proved fruitless, Pyrrha had made her way to one of the campus's many open courtyards. Panic was really beginning to set in; she needed to find Cardin, and find him quickly. Who knew what kinds of horrible acts he was committing with her identity: stealing pencils, mocking the school administrators, or worse, antagonizing her friends!<br>\r\nWhipping her head around rapidly, she caught a glimpse of a familiar tuft of blonde hair walking away from the crowds of students: it was Yang Xiao Long! Pyrrha had never been more glad to see the brawler. She began making her way to the girl, when a faint buzz in her head made her stride slow down. <i>Oh shit, it's Xiao Long... What a fiiiiine piece of ass. I totally would have hit her up, if it weren't for the fact that her and all her bitchy friends hate my guts, and would kick my ass three ways to Sunday...</i> Pyrrha paused. <i>Wait, why would I think that about Yang? She's my friend... huh..?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha winced a bit as the buzzing sensation returned to her mind. Suddenly, almost against her will, foreign thoughts started filling her head. Thoughts of blackmailing Jaune when she found out he faked his way into Beacon, being embarrassed getting her shit kicked in by Pyrrha Nikos during sparring classes, and laughing at how fuckin' weird and stupid the ears on that Scarlatina chick looked. Then realization hit her: these were Cardin's memories! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving one more glance at the back of her former friend, Pyrrha regretfully turned away from the blonde, and resumed her search for her body. By this time of the day, extracurricular classes were over, and students were either headed back to their rooms, or were casually lounging around; either way, the masses had thinned out, and from what she could see, \"she\" was nowhere to be found. Her options dwindling, she came down to the best option of the few she had, and began making her way to the dormitory wing of the academy; towards her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha had started making her way down the corridor, terrified, but committed. She eyed each of the numbered doors, slowly counting the numbers down, sweat forming on her brow. Her only hope was that one of her teammates was in their room, and that she could somehow convince them that she was actually \"her\" and that Cardin had made off with her face. She had finally reached her destination.  Very hesitantly, she raised a hand to the door, slowly bringing her knuckles (which were VERY pale, due to how tight she had her fist clenched) to the wood surface, and began knocking. She waited a moment as she heard a very faint, but familiar yell, as there was a loud thump against the floor; Jaune must have stood up too quickly to answer the door again, and tripped over his shoes. The yelp he emitted brought Pyrrha a small chuckle, she knew him so well. The slight tension relief was immediate gone, however, as she heard the doorknob turn as it swung open. Jaune stood in the frame, nursing the bump he had given himself on his elbow, until he looked up to see the unexpected visitor; his complexion going completely pale once he recognized the face he was staring at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-C-C-Cardin!? What are you d-doing here!?\" his voice squeaked; Pyrrha was in a state of shock as well, fully comprehending the situation she was in. Her demeanor only worsened, as her eyes slipped past Jaune's terrified expression, to see the other occupant in the room: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Pyrrha Nikos, standing next to her bed, fully adorned in her combat attire; her face in an equal amount of surprise, until it slowly shifted from a startled stare, to a menacing grin full of malicious intent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hello again, Cardin!\" Pyrrha felt sick to her stomach, as she watched herself-NO, as she watched Cardin morph HER OWN face from its serial killer-esque grin back into the soft, gracious smile that Pyrrha was known for. It was absolutely <i>TERRIFYING.</i> \"What brings you over to our dorm on such... unexpected notice?\" Pyrrha recognized that tone of voice. It was the same tone she used when she was trying to get a point across, the hint of venom virtually nonexistent, but she would know it anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right! Jaune, don't you remember the small talk I had with you when you came back to the room?\" Cardin had his attention set on the lanky blond now, Jaune responded like normal; like how he would when he spoke with his good friend Pyrrha. \"Oh, r-right... I almost forgot,\" Jaune finally managed to say. It was truly scary to Pyrrha how he was talking to Cardin as calmly as he was, but it was even scarier seeing how Jaune didn't even notice anything amiss with his \"partner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I told you that 'Cardin' reached out to me earlier today about how he isn't trying to cause any more issues with you, since he's having problems of his own with Professor Port.\" Cardin said, as his eyes darted back to his former self, a glint of naughtiness in them. Pyrrha absolutely HATED how smug Cardin was making her sound, but she knew at the moment there was nothing she could do. \"It's supposed to be a plan that is mutually beneficial to both of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I remember... heh, looks like neither of us are able to escape Port's wrath, does it?\" Jaune half-heartedly joked to Pyrrha, a hesitant look still in his eyes. Pyrrha looked down at the boy, trying to say something, <i>anything</i> that could possibly alert Jaune to the problem at hand, but all that could escape her mouth was a measly \"Er...--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Look at the time, Jaune! We only have a little over two hours to get down to the gym, and get your workout in! We can't take too long, we promised Nora &amp; Ren that we wouldn't be late to dinner again, remember?\" Cardin exclaimed. Pyrrha let that statement linger in her mind, until she finally realized why Jaune hadn't been alarmed by anything \"Pyrrha\" was doing. <i>Oh no... he has access to my memories as well!</i> she panicked. Everything Cardin was saying was in exactly the same fashion SHE would say them! Pyrrha felt her heart sink to the bottom of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for bringing this issue to my attention, <i>Cardin.</i> But could you please <i>not tell anybody</i> about this? I know <i>you have a reputation you'd like to uphold,</i> and it would be a shame <i>if the teachers or our friends found out,</i> and thought you bribed or <i>threatened us,</i> right? This way, we have no issues!\" Cardin grinned. Pyrrha knew exactly what he was doing, and she didn't like that she essentially had to go along with it. \"Y-yeah..\" she finally stammered, \"...it really WOULDN'T be great if that happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Riiight...</i> Well, if you'll excuse us, I've got to prep Jaune for some upcoming spars; it was good to have this heart-to-heart, Cardin! Take care!\" the false redhead perkily told Pyrrha, as he pushed Jaune out the room. The pair started making their way down the corridor. Once Jaune had gotten a few feet in front of him, however, Cardin stopped and proceeded to hike his skirt up over his rear, plainly for Pyrrha to see. Using both hands, he tugged his panties tighter up into his crotch, &amp; with an audible moan, let the elastic waistband snap back onto his rump. He made a cocky grin at the \"boy,\" sticking his tongue out, before yanking his skirt back down and disappearing around the corner. Pyrrha was left absolutely dumbstruck. If Jaune, the one person who knew her best, didn't notice the boy currently occupying her body, what were the chances anybody else would?</span></div></div>",

He couldn't recall a moment his face had <i>ever</i> looked so scared, and it wasn't even actually him that was scared! Pyrrha Nikos was wrapped around his dainty finger, and as long as he was smart about things, he could keep her there as long as he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet that she's never gonna try to cross me again after this,\" he said aloud. \"Man, this is SO fuckin' fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what was that, Pyrrha?\" Jaune asked. \"I wasn't paying attention, still a little shook from Cardin being right in front of me without being followed up with sudden impacts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin smiled. \"Oh, it was nothing, Jaune. I was just mumbling to myself. But yes, I assume it's a breath of fresh air for him not toying with you for once, hmm? It's almost like <i>something inside him changed...</i>\" he chuckled. The redhead sighed blissfully, and allowed his hands to start roaming along his shape once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God damn, this body feels so fucking great... I could get addicted to this</i>, the boy thought, as his gloved fingers peaked over the top of his corset, sliding between the leather and his pillowy mounds. He grazed the nipples, before beginning to pinch them between his fingers. As a horny jock in the flesh of a smoking hot girl, Cardin couldn't resist exciting himself nonstop, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finally arrived at the locker room. \"Alright, Jaune, go grab your sword. I'll be right out with my weapons\" he told the blond. Cardin appreciated that Pyrrha's memories allowed him to find and open her locker so easily. He eyed up Mil\u00f3 and Ako\u00fao\u0331, her signature spear-rifle and shield. \"What a pain in the ass these were, LITERALLY,\" Cardin griped, remembering his previous spar with the girl. \"But now I'm Nikos now, and Cardin wants to play!\" He slipped the shield onto his bracer quickly, before grabbing his spear and making his way to the door. Right before he stepped out the lockers, he paused just long enough to give his pussy a quick fondle, before leaving the room; Jaune was already waiting for him outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I'm assuming we're doing the same ol', same ol'? Working on stance and reaction, right?\" Jaune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin hadn't thought about this. Was he really gonna just have a standard training session with this loser? <i>No no no...</i> he determined. <i>That's WAAAY too easy, and even more BORING.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how did Cardin spice up this gym session?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come on, Arc, finish this rep! You're right at the finish line!\" Cardin yelled, as he wiped drops of sweat from his forehead. He was looking down at Jaune, eyes beaming with determination and desire. Jaune's face, however, looked like a balloon at the brink of popping. He had 3 sit-ups left in his rep, and normally he would have quit by this point, but Pyrrha's shouting was simultaneously being extremely encouraging and <i>the most terrifying thing ever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workout Cardin put the two were on consisted of 30 minutes of hard sparring, and 10 minutes of heavy weights on legs, back, chest, &amp; arms, all wrapped up with abdominals. Cardin had originally planned to absolutely swamp Arc to the point of complete exhaustion, as some kind of cruel entertainment; however, he hadn't expected that Pyrrha and his own inclination for exercise would kick in simultaneously, and found himself joining the blond in his \"torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that... like it's such... an easy... feat... for me!\" Jaune croaked, as he dropped back onto his mat from another sit-up, tenting his shirt up to cool down. \"You're in your prime, and make this all look like child's play!\" he gasped, in between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>Y'know, for once, he's totally right.</i> Cardin thought. <i>Jumping into this conditioning was AMAZING...</i> Cardin had to admit, there was more to Pyrrha's body than it being oh-so-sinful. He had pretty much peaked with physical training in his old body, and didn't care much to learn the intricacies of combat skill. Pyrrha's body however, had never really pressed further into that; sure she was tough, but she easily could have been tougher, instead focusing on being a better fighter. Pyrrha's muscles really, REALLY ached from the evening, and that soreness was something he really hadn't felt in a long time. Sure, he'd get banged up from fighting with Grimm, but that hurt was completely different; it was an exciting feeling. Cardin had started to understand the appeal in applying more skill, rather than his typical hit-em'-till-they-can't-hit-back approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also a plus to discover how flexible his current form really was. He'd been almost as stiff as a board before, due to packing on muscle mass like a fiend, so finding out how much he could really move was eye-opening. Pyrrha was strong enough to act out the same combat motions he was used to, but loose enough that he could change up a motion nigh-instantly. The new ideas his body came with were also very welcomed here; the sheer amount of experience Pyrrha had before the swap really enlightened Cardin to all kinds of different attacks and stances, knowledge he probably would have forgone previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had also discovered a new joy in wielding Mil\u00f3 and Ako\u00fao\u0331. They felt nothing like the mace he typically slung around; both required a level of finesse he hadn't tried before, and found it to be quite fun, Pyrrha's mind subtlety reminding him of all the different feats the spear/shield combo could offer. Pyrrha was constantly showing Cardin how much of a good idea it had been to switch bodies with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, an issue did present itself to the false girl. About halfway into their sparring, Cardin started catching himself looking very intently at Jaune. His gaze was constantly locking onto the boy's face, the sheer determination the blond expressed almost transfixing him. Cardin had felt a throb in his chest, but brushed it off as his increased heartbeat from exerting himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn't seem to be going away. As their training progressed, Cardin's heart only seemed to experience that mysterious throb more and more. It was baffling to him! Why was he feeling it so often, and <i>why</i> was only happening when he looked at Jaune? After their spar, the two had a small break for water, and catching their breath, but it was mainly so that the pair could take their armor and ect. off for the conditioning portion, and so they could switch into the gym clothes in their locker. That was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin was the first to emerge from the lockers, and took up a seat near the leg press. He looked up to the sound of the locker room door opening from his position, to see Jaune. He had his hoodie off in one hand, and only had a tank top on, allowing Cardin to see Jaune's biceps, and the outline of his chest. <i>HE WAS NOT THAT FIT BEFORE, I SWEAR...</i> Cardin's mind blared. That was when he felt it again: the throb. However, this time it was accompanied but another sensation, one Cardin had become very familiar with that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin felt an itch, the same itch he partially relieved during his \"adventure\" in the school bathroom and from his shower back in the dorm. The itch he felt deep inside his lower region. His hand subconsciously started drifting towards the edge of the short shorts he had slipped on, until he caught himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, fuck. Oh fuck, oh fuck oh fUCK OH FUCKOHFUCK,</i> he started shouting in his head. Cardin ran an emergency search in his new mind, and was shocked that his suspicion was true. In his head, Pyrrha's memory was replaying a scene that must have been during the middle of the night, judging by how dark it was. In it, Pyrrha was alone, at the top of a stairwell somewhere in the academy. His vision shifted down to see that Pyrrha was in her pajamas. One had was gyrating under her pants, the other roughly bunching up her shirt as it slipped under the fabric to grasp her breast; she was indeed pleasuring herself, but that wasn't the surprise. In between each stroke of her lower lips and nipples, he could unmistakably hear the name she was speaking in heavy breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhhhh, Jaune.... ooohhhh, JAUNE...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OH GODS,</i> Cardin was in an internal panic. <i>NIKOS HAS THE HOTS FOR THIS GUY?</i> The information he now had was a bit much for him to process. Pyrrha had fallen for the blond boy, and now her feelings were bleeding over into Cardin's mind. He wanted to scream, but clammed up instead. Noticing \"her\" odd posture sitting, Jaune extended a hand to help \"Pyrrha\" up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...rrha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyr....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ey. HEY! Pyrrha, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin snapped back to reality, frantically whipping his head around, reorienting himself to his surroundings. \"Huh!?\" he finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem a little zoned out, Pyrrha. Do we need to end training for today?\" Jaune asked, half out of concern, half trying to get out of any more physical action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I'm... I'm fine. I just, got caught up in an old memory... Let's head over to the equipment now.\" Cardin told the boy. Finally accepting the hand reaching out to him, Cardin stood up and gave his face a few slaps, before joining Jaune at the bench press.  <i>Calm down Cardin... just push those thoughts aside. Let the workout become your focus, just like it used to.</i> the redhead thought to himself, as a sort of pep talk. Little did Cardin realize, that was an idea easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin felt like he was going to go ABSOLUTELY MAD. Everything, every SINGLE LITTLE FUCKING THING Jaune did shot sparks of arousal directly into Cardin's nethers. When his calf would strain on the leg press, yup! When he would pick up a barbell and flex his arm, YUP! When he took his hoodie to wipe the sweat off his stupid fuckin' face, you guessed it, YUP! He tried to work off his arousal by trying to get his testosterone pumping, but given his current body, that was a little problem. Sure he was getting excited from the actual workout routines, but it did little to nothing to quell his growing libido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....aaaand...  DONE!\" Jaune exclaimed. \"How's that for ya, Pyrrha? I basically kept up with you the entire time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's FANTASTIC, Jaune,\" Cardin almost stuttered out. His head was an absolute mess, a jumble of energy and horniness that he had NEVER experienced in his life EVER. He was actually ready to RIP his shorts off, then and there. \"Keep this up, and you'll be able to take on anything the world throws at you!\" he said, as he toweled his face off. It gave his hands something to do, preventing them from going to town on his own body,  with Jaune right in front of him.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up his scroll, which had been set on a bench next to his chestplate, Jaune turned to \"Pyrrha.\" \"Oh, geez, we're late meeting Nora &amp; Ren!\"<br>\r\nGlancing back at the clock, he relaxed a bit. \"Wait... it's only by a couple minutes. We should be fine, but you know Nora is gonna give us an earful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shouldn't be too long, we can always shower when we get back to the room.\" Cardin said to the boy. \"Let's just change quick, and head to the dining hall.\" Jaune didn't even get a chance to agree with \"Pyrrha,\" in an instant she scooped up her belongings, and darted into the locker room. Depositing his equipment on the bench next to his locker, Cardin quickly slipped into the ladies' changing stalls, nearly collapsing onto one of the smaller stools inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, c'mon Cardin, keep yourself together. All that's left is dinner, and the day is finished.\" He repeated his mantra a few times, and it appeared to be working, until he went to remove his shorts, and accidentally grazed a knuckle against his crotch.<br>\r\n\"Fuck meeeeeeeee...\" he groaned, as another wave of itchiness rippled through his insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Cardin's next line of action?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Struggling against his internal instincts, Cardin had to wrench his hands away from his sweat- slicked chest to prevent another fondle fest. \"No! Not again!\" he almost shouted, \"I can't keep fucking myself every time I think about it, damnit...\" The redhead had to clasp his seat, and control his breathing to calm down a bit. <i>Alright, alright, Cardin... you can do this...</i> he thought, as he mentally psyched himself up. <i>Just need to rinse off quick, throw on my old outfit, and I'm golden...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding himself sufficiently pumped, Cardin proceeded to charge through with his gameplan, quickly stripping out of Pyrrha's workout attire &amp; underwear. Throwing the clothes to the side, he dashed into the showers, and quickly slammed the water on. The streams ran over his curves oh-so-delicately, but with steeled determination, Cardin kept his desires at bay. Thinking he was washed off enough, Cardin shut off the water and dashed back to Pyrrha's locker, simultaneously drying himself. He didn't want to risk bringing unwanted scrutiny to Pyrrha's actions; he had appearances to keep, at least for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, against his best wishes, sweet erotic daydreams of pleasuring his skin, and of Jaune started to creep into his mind. Damn, and he had just slipped his underwear on, and started re-dressing with Pyrrha's gear too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOPE! NO. STOP THAT, BRAIN...\" Cardin ordered himself. It was turning into a real struggle, carnal instinct vs. willpower, but Cardin was not going to ruin the illusion he'd created by being caught in the locker rooms with a water bottle shoved up his cooch. Quickly, he drew the strings on his corset tight; almost painfully, in an attempt to distract his mind. Yanking his skirt and sash over his rear, and tugging on his gloves and thigh highs, he didn't even bother putting his armor or accessories on, opting to shove the items into a duffel bag Pyrrha had left in her locker, which he quickly slung over his shoulder. He quickly tossed his spear and shield into the locker as well, before hastily shutting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, bar checking to make sure the swap remote was in his bag with the rest of his belongings, Cardin had finished. He gave himself a small cheer, proving that even a horndog like him could complete a simple task like this. His body was still aching a bit with need, but the actual physical exhaustion he felt was able to wane it off for the time being. It'd be no problem for him to have some \"alone time\" later in the night. The \"girl\" made her way out of the lockers, where Jaune was already waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was about to call for you, started to get a little concerned,\" Jaune told the redhead. He looked at the girl, and picked up on her shaking a bit, like she was restraining herself physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyrrha, you sure you're all right? You've been acting a little weird all night...\" the boy pondered. \"Pyrrha\" seemed a bit startled by the blond's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, no, I'm alright! I'm just... h-hungry! Yeah, that's it!\" he stammered. It wasn't a total lie, Cardin was absolutely <i>famished</i> from the evening's training, but he obviously couldn't tell Jaune that there was a whirlwind of lust working under his panties, and that he was actually restraining his hands from rushing under the garments and probing his insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you think of my new workout plan? Was it too much or..?\" Cardin had quickly changed the subject to distract himself, but he WAS genuinely curious. From the way it looked, apparently his attitude and Pyrrha's determination had actually <i>benefited</i> the boy, rather than torture him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know,\" Jaune replied, \"I was thinking it was gonna be WAY worse than it was. Like, WAAAY worse... but look! Somehow I finished the entire thing, and I was almost keeping on par with you!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very good to hear from you, Jaune.\" The Pyrrha part of Cardin's mind absolutely adored that Jaune actually was good with his plan. Cardin wasn't completely sure if it wasn't influencing his current thoughts, but he was damn impressed that the twig of a guy next to him didn't fall apart during the exercises.The whole thing was almost... fun. The two continued their way, idle chatting helping keep Cardin distracted from the hot mess down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, were here! Thank the gods, I'm STARVING.\" Jaune said. He began trotting to the double doors to the grand cafeteria, and Cardin followed in pursuit. <i>Seems like I've unwound a bit..</i> he thought to himself. Passing through the entrance, the pair's attention was alerted to their names being called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEYYYYYY, JAAAAAAAAAUNE, PYYYYYYYYYRRHA, OVER HEEEEEEEEEERE!!\"<br>\r\nThe two turned to see, at a table against the wall, the energetic flailing figure of Nora Valkyrie. Besides her sat Lie Ren, almost out of the duo's line of sight. Nora looked to have come straight from a workout herself, while Ren was more traditionally dressed in his casual attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEEEEEEEY! LOOOOOOOOOOK OVER HEEEEEEEEEEEEERE! IT'S MEEEEEEEeeeeEEEeeeeeeeeeeEEEEE!!\" The ginger continued to shout. Jaune and Cardin shared a small laugh before heading towards the table, Cardin noting how he actually found the annoying girl's current antics funny at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora, I think they heard the first few hollers. You don't need to call them in... \"orangutan...\"<br>\r\nthe quiet fellow said to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's better to have all my bases covered, duh!\" she cheerily replied. Jaune and Cardin arrived at the table, and dropped onto the bench opposite of their teammates, visibly exhausted; Cardin dropping his duffel unceremoniously on the bench. \"Sup, guys, where were you two this evening?\" Jaune asked the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Nora said she had spotted a giant rock outside the window of her history class, and wanted to prove to me she could lift it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which I TOTALLY did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo, if I recall, you actually didn't; it was too big, so you opted for lifting a different, smaller rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I DID end up picking up a different smaller rock, but what you wouldn't notice since you didn't hold the rock like I wanted you to was that the small one I picked up was actually SUUUPER DENSE compared to the bigger one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, you win this one\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora fist-pumped. \"And add another tally to the Nora score!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly is the 'Nora Score'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune and Cardin chuckled. It was always lively with Nora around. Which was proven when she nearly vaulted over the table to inspect \"Pyrrha.\" Cardin jumped back in surprise, while Nora squinted her eyes at him; she finally asked, \"And what about YOU two, hmmmmm!? I see that you're not wearing your armor-jewelry-thingies, Pyrrha! Wait... were you robbed!? Did you two get robbed by muggers, but didn't want the thieves get away so you thwarted their scheme and had them arrested, WITHOUT ME??\" Nora almost seemed heartbroken at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Nora! We just came back from the gym; she doesn't wear anything other than her circlet there, remember? Anyway, Pyrrha stepped up our routine, and I'm pretty impressed by myself. I kept up with her the whole time!\" Jaune beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Ren retorted. \"Pyrrha actually followed through with her plan to jumpstart you workout routine, and you kept with it? Congrats, Jaune!\" he said, patting Jaune on the shoulder, as Nora produced a party whistle to blow on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, tell me about it... hey, we gotta cut it for a sec, me &amp; Pyrrha actually need to get some food into our systems before we continue. Also, Nora... do you just... carry that whistle with you..?\" Jaune said. The ginger just grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filling our stomachs is an idea I can get behind,\" Cardin replied, as the two slugged their way off their seats to approach the kitchen line.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What's going on, tough guy?\" Cardin had let Jaune slip ahead of him, deciding instead to saunter over to his former self; Pyrrha was tucked away at a small table in the corner, and was no doubt <i>very</i> upset over the events of the day, and Cardin could see in on the scowl \"he\" wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cardin!\" she exclaimed, suddenly sitting up, and was ready to lunge at her former self, but Cardin didn't give her the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahp-up-up, I wouldn't do that if I were you...\" lifting a cautionary finger to her face. \"Are you forgetting where you are? Look at all these students and faculty around! It would be a shame... if something... were to happen...\" Cardin told her, as he hooked a dainty finger at the top of his corset, bra and all, and slowly pulled it down, stopping just short of his nipples. \"What would everyone think if Pyrrha suddenly started stripping in the middle of everyone eating dinner? It'd be absolutely scandalous!\" he chuckled, his face in a look of mock surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... do you want... Cardin?\" Pyrrha spat sharply. The anger she was expressing looked normal on Cardin's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not much. Just wanted to see how you were hanging in there. It must be <i>really</i> tough, knowing that somehow you were yanked out of your body, and that Cardin Winchester is tucked away nicely inside of it. Wearing your face has been a blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha said nothing, only staring indignantly at the boy inside her form, so he soldiered on. \"Gotta say though, you've got some fuckin' goods!\" He dragged a finger across his cleavage, before tugging the corset back over it. \"Man, your body is absolutely amazing, did you know that? It's so light, but still has some REAL power behind it! You've GOT to tell me how you reached this point sometime...\" he sighed, and took the moment to seat himself at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another thing: having people think that I'm you has been AWESOME. Your reputation is one of the best things I've ever had in my life. There ain't nobody who talks trash to me, since you've never done anything except get praise!\" Cardin gave himself a moment to laugh, thinking about the twist of fate he was experiencing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already know about the memory thing, right? It's not like you lost any of your smarts and shit, so you probably caught onto that real quick.\" Cardin flashed the girl a wry smile, before continuing. \"It is SO easy passing myself as you. When you think about, I pretty much AM you! I've got your figure, I've got your memories, your mannerisms, I've got your damn room for god's sake!\" Cardin picked up a stray spoon laying on the table, and began twirling it between his digits. \"Really, the only difference between me and the old you is that there's a lot more sadistic and perverted thoughts up here.\" he told her, tapping his head with the utensil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta say, though, the best part about this whole thing is how your body is SO fucking sexy. I've never so turned on in my entire live, until today. Every caress of your skin, the smell of your hair, how firm your tits are, and how your pussy is DIVINE. Did you know that right after I swapped with you, I had a field day on your cooch in the girl's bathroom? HOOOOLY SHIT, that was life changing. Still haven't fully masturbated though, planning on doing that tonight. I wanna <i>REALLY</i> hear this baby purr...\" he licked his lips as he said this, using his free hand to grope his groin. It was very fortunate for Pyrrha that his back was towards the crowded room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha had heard enough. \"Cardin, I swear to god, if you try anything with my body, I'll--\" Cardin slammed his hand on the table, cutting Pyrrha off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Or you'll WHAT? Listen Nikos, I'm pretty sure you don't have shit for brains up in that head of yours, so you should be able to understand the situation you're in. I -AM- YOU. I'm the one who put you in there,\" he pointed to her chest, before gesturing to himself, \"...and me in HERE. You've had this shit coming a long time. You thought you were gonna get away with embarrassing ME in front of these dumbass kids? I hope you didn't!\" Cardin had dropped the cheery facade, becoming as deathly serious as Pyrrha had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody knows what happened. Nobody's gonna BELIEVE what happened, even if you told them. And even if they did, what are they gonna do? They don't know about the remote, and I'm sure as shit not gonna let anybody know that the damn thing is even real! So here's what you're gonna happen: you're gonna shut the fuck up about any of this body switching shit, and you're not gonna tell me what I can and can't do while your body is MINE!\" Cardin nearly screamed at the poor girl. Pyrrha was absolutely shaken. If it weren't for the large body of teens in the room chatting and hollering, his voice would have echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down, Cardin re-adopted Pyrrha's cheery disposition. \"So we have a mutual understanding, right?\" he asked, in the kindest tone. Pyrrha was too petrified to answer. \"Good,\" he said, \"I'm glad that we handled our little problem just now.\" Cardin stood up from his seat, and began walking to the dinner line. Almost out of her range, he turned back to Pyrrha quickly. \"I hope the rest of your night is wonderful, Cardin. I hope you get to know your roommates more, they're not as bad as you think!\" He winked to the girl, before heading off. It made him feel good watching the girl squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin politely slid by the students who had gathered in the mess line to re-join Jaune. \"Hey,\" he said, \"Sorry about not lining up with you sooner. Cardin needed some advice with his roommates, and I was more than happy to help.\" His eyes happened to catch on the spoon he had been holding earlier, shocked to see that the metal had warped and bent into a very unusual shape. Cardin opened up Pyrrha's mind again, searching for this specific occurence; he found it, mentally cheering himself. Applying a bit of concentration, Cardin focused on the spoon, until it suddenly started jittering, and warped back into a more recognizable spoon shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a neat little Semblance...</i> he smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the mealtime had passed rather uneventfully. Nora regaled the team with various stories of her triumphs against hordes of Grimm, and the weird guy who bought nothing but pickles at the market when she was a kid. Cardin had been making mental notes nonstop; about his teammates, and about Pyrrha. He found himself pleasantly surprised, discovering how different foods tasted with Pyrrha's mouth compared to him. Before today, he'd never touched a brussel sprout, but now he couldn't get enough of the damn things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam RWBY eventually showed up, adding to the festivities. While they were chatting, Cardin took the time to eye them up; aside from the annoying younger sister, all the girls had something Cardin was interested in. Xiao Long's massive rack was very appealing. Then there was that Blake chick, who really had something going on with her ass. Even the Schnee girl looked appealing, she was definitely the prettiest, dainty-est of the three. <i>Damn... definitely gonna have to hop inside the three of them some time. Maybe after I'm done with Nikos...</i> he deemed, stealing another appreciative glance at his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teams made their way back to their dorm hall, wishing each other good nights as they split to their respective rooms. Nora had begun yammering another wild tangent to Ren, who listened as he changed into a sleeping shirt, while Jaune dashed into the bathroom; he had one too many glasses of juice at dinner, since Nora slipped back onto her original idea of him &amp; Pyrrha valiantly stopping a bank robbery, and his throat went hoarse explaining  how that NEVER happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin had slipped out of his fighting gear (Nora blindsided Ren with a pillow so he couldn't see), and had donned Pyrrha's pajamas, her memory once again proving to be very fruitful, as he slipped on the fancy lingerie that was tucked in the back of her dresser; Pyrrha's mother had given her that, in case she met any \"special boys.\" It was certainly convenient Nora didn't see what he put on, since she was too busy with smothering Ren. Covering up the underwear with some sweatpants and a hoodie, Cardin started making his way to the door, when Ren questioned him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you headed this late at night?\" he asked, recovering from the fluffy smack he recieved. \"Unless it's your 'Pyrrha Time' again...\" he finished, swiftly dodging a pillowy tackle from Nora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you brooding about Jaune again?\" Nora chimed in; she was draped unnaturally over the side of Ren's mattress, and couldn't quite lift herself up without falling completely on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's another one of those nights, yes.\" Cardin bluffed. He just wanted privacy for what he was going to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, you're gonna--OOF!-- have to tell him sometime. You can't be a grumpy grump forever~!\" Clearly Nora didn't make her recovery. Before she could press on, Ren stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't tell Pyrrha to do something she's not ready to undertake,\" he told the ginger. \"It's not magic. This kind of thing has to happen naturally.\" He turned back to Cardin. \"Go ahead, take all the reflection you need.\" The \"girl\" thanked him, as she disappeared behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank fucking God...\"Cardin sighed. \"SO glad he didn't ask anything more. Now, to find somewhere quiet...\" Cardin snuck down the hall swiftly, scouting out a potential hiding spot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slinking through the dark corridors, the redhead had made his way back into the main building of the school. Jumping from shadow to shadow, Cardin was being <b>extra</b> careful to ensure that no stray custodian or the like found him. He was a girl on a mission.   After a few minutes of creeping around, Cardin finally had found himself a suitable hiding place; there was a stairwell not far off from the library that looked to be used to store spare tables and chairs. Making his way to the top of the stairs, he covertly pushed the equipment to the edge of the railing, so the wall by the roof exit was clear for him.  Cardin felt he was good enough out of the way to finally get down to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alrighty then, Nikos, it's taken all day but now I can finally  <i>really</i> get familiar with you, and I've got all the time I need...\" he smirked to himself. Cardin took Pyrrha's Scroll and squatting down, propped it against one of the empty table legs; he opened the device's camera and ,switching it to video, set it to 'selfie-mode.' He stood up, and paused momentarily, contemplating the A+ footage he was about to get. Finally, he slowly began to rub his manicured hands all over himself, basking in how soft his female shape was. He could feel every soft caress his hands made, even through the hoodie and pants he was wearing. Cardin took his time getting his excitement going, sensually rubbing and groping his firm body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, can't access the goods so easy with this on,\" he spoke to himself. \"I think it's time for an impromptu strip tease...\" Cardin slipped off his hoodie, exposing his chest to the cool air of the stairs, grinning as he felt his nipples perk from the temperature difference. Staring at his fine rear, he hooked his thumbs around the waistband of his pants and began to pull them down, wiggling his ass side to side to help work the garment off. Folding up the hoodie and pants, he set them on the floor as a cushion, before plopping down on top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin let his hands roam the entirety of his body, soaking in the smooth texture of his skin, before bringing them to a stop under his chest. <br>\r\nHe worked his fingers under the fabric cups, and slid his hands over the cushy lumps, and proceeded to grope them. Finally alone, Cardin didn't have to hold back his voice anymore; he could let his moans, covered in Pyrrha's sweet tones echo throughout the stairwell. Looking at the camera, he spoke. \"Oh, Cardin, what are you doing to me?\" the redhead said to himself, as he began working more voraciously, kneading his breasts; each squeeze sending tiny jolts of excitement off inside him. \"I've been waiting for you to do this ALL day, Cardin...\" The boy's roleplay with himself was really getting the job done, because he felt a slight dampness forming underneath his lace panties. \"Are you going to head 'downstairs' soon, tough guy? I can feel myself already raring to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin released his breasts, reaching around his back to undo the clip holding his bra on, letting the fabric drop and exposing his chest to the cold; his nipples were like diamonds at this point. He moved a hand down to his crotch, where it began caressing his slit through the thin material of his panties. \"Oh Cardin, <i>please</i> don't tease me like this\" he said in mock concern, \"I don't know how long I can handle this!\" Cardin pressed a single finger at the bottom of his pussy, and dragged it all the way up to his clit, sending shivers up his spine. He clasped the nub between two fingers, and twisted ever-so-slightly, but it was more than enough for the inexperienced boy. His entire body seized up, as his pussy spasmed, and the boy experienced his first real orgasm inside of the body of one of the sexiest girls in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a sharp breath, he spoke. \"HOOOO, fuck! Is that how it feels to cum as a girl!? I didn't even do that much!\" he said, feeling the damp juices he let out soak his underwear. \"I HAVE TO step it up!\" the redhead stated. As Cardin said this, he smuggled two fingers under the material of the lingerie and located them between his lips. Cardin mentally braced himself, looking directly at the camera, right before plunging the digits into the warm, wet depths of his new feminine sex. It felt so incredible inside of himself. The velvety walls of his vagina tightened around his fingers as he felt out the space in his crotch. Every twist of his hand set off jolts of pleasure, and it wasn't long before he began pumping the fingers in and out. His other hand had found it's way back to his chest and locked onto a nipple, pinching it between fingers. The boy squeezed his eyes shut; the pleasure was too great. Cardin couldn't get over just how good this felt. How good HE felt. How amazing masturbating felt as a young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, Cardin... Oh fuck! Fuck yes!\" 'Pyrrha' moaned, slumping against the wall. His fingers were still furiously working inside his vagina. \"That's... That's it, Cardin... Fu-fuck me! Fuck my perfect pussy good!\" Cardin grunted, as he continued to watch his sexy, lingerie-clad classmate pleasuring herself in the mirror. It was a turn on like nothing had ever experienced. The way \"Pyrrha\" was \"talking\" to Cardin was beyond exciting. \"She\" said everything he wanted to hear, and he was absolutely <b>LOVING</b> it. He kept this charade over the next few minutes, as the pressure in his loins gradually started to build. At the cusp of orgasm, Cardin suddenly shouted out \"FUCK YEAH, CARDIN BABY!\" immediately followed by the dam in his panties bursting, shooting cum all over his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the first orgasm, this second one was <b>INCREDIBLE</b> for Cardin. Pure erotic pleasure exploded out from his vagina, reaching all the way from his head, down to his toes, making them curl. His body thrashed wildly on the floor, as he squealed. It was quite late in the night, so Cardin didn't need to worry about anyone else in the halls hearing him. Not like they would anyway, he was too far out the way for anyone other than a Faunus catching him. Orgasming as Pyrrha... no, as a young woman, was SO much more satisfying than it had been as a guy. It took a lot of work, and it certainly took longer as well, but the effort was worth it. The orgasm wasn't a simple, short, intense burst anymore; now it lasted much, much longer, and felt even more powerful. Cardin writhed on the floor for a hot minute; it took a bit to come down from this fantastic high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay there, basking in the bliss of his post-orgasmic afterglow. However, Cardin didn't feel like he normally did after masturbating; he was neither tired or drained. \"I think... I could go again...\" he said aloud. Which he did. He took the hand he hadn't used jerking off previously, and slammed it back into his lingerie, and started working himself up again. His mouth opened, letting out more of Pyrrha's lust-tinged voice as he circled his index finger around his lower lips before taking it, and his middle finger, back inside his dripping folds. This time his hips tried meeting his hands, lifting his crotch towards his digits every time they plunged inside him, making Cardin bite his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Pyrrha, ahhhnn... you're DEFINITELY a keeper, ohhhhhhhh.... now that I know you inside and out,\" he said, bucking his hips, as he continued thrusting his hand into his pussy. \"I don't think -ah!- I'm gonna give your body so soon, now that -HNNNNNG- I've had a sample!\" His free hand slid up his stomach, before latching onto his breast again, fingering the nipple. \"I've got to try more-AHHHHNNNN!\" he nearly screamed as another orgasm rocked his frame, yanking out a moan deep from within himself, making him thrust his hand even further into his wet snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been 30 minutes now, and after numerous orgasms (since he longer needed to recover in between), Cardin had decided Pyrrha was going to be his residence for a BIT longer. She was just too much fun; too much fun to be, too much fun to taunt, &amp; too much fun to feverishly masturbate inside of! He finally slipped his fingers out of your vagina and sat back against the wall. Panting, Cardin popped them into his mouth, sucking all of Pyrrha's fluids off her hand. \"Hehe, you taste pretty damn good...\" he chuckled. Cardin reached over to the Scrool sitting open and stopped the recording. Switching to camera mode, Cardin examined his face. Pyrrha looking pretty disheveled; her long red hair was splayed all over, and her breasts were hanging out. She looked like she had just finished filming a porno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lucked out Pyrrha,\" the boy said, examining his face in the Scroll's camera. \"I like being you too much to ruin you. But I'll find other ways to have a good time in here!\" He gave his ass a firm slap, enjoying the rippling sensation. Cardin set the Scroll down to pick up his bra and secure it back over his chest. Standing the handheld up again, he admired himself as he struck a few poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this little session has got me fuckin' exhausted... I think it's time to call it a night,\" Cardin told himself, \"Better pick up and head back to 'my' room, hehe~\" Cardin slid Pyrrha's scroll into his panties, right over his vagina (to which he was delightfully greeted with the sharp chill of metal against his hot lips), before picking up his outerwear and slipping around his desk barricade, headed down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's balls-o-clock at night, nobody'll mind if I show off in the halls.\" Cardin smirked, as he sashayed back through the corridors of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door made a quiet 'click' as it was unlocked; Cardin crept in, careful as to not make a peep. Thankfully, it seemed like the rest of the team were knocked out. Plucking the Scroll out from them, he peeled his drenched panties off his legs, and after drying his crotch with the hoodie he was holding, slid a new pair on. He disposed of the dirty articles in his closet hamper, and pulled out Pyrrha's pajamas. Slipping them on, he crawled into her bed, ready for more shenanigans tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not even bothering to straighten himself up, Cardin roughly shrugged Pyrrha's uniform back over his new body; he didn't smooth out her undershirt, leaving it very rumpled from his groping session. It had come untucked from his skirt when he slid his hand underneath the cloth, and his panties were still crudely pushed to the side underneath his silky tights. It wasn't like anybody would notice it anyways, the skirt's fabric was long enough to cover that portion, although you could see some of his vagina's love juice trickling down his thigh. The only thing he did do, however, was suck the fluids coating his fingers away. Cardin let the musky taste linger on his tongue before he swallowed it, smirking at his reflection in the mirror. \"Bet you never thought you'd be tasting yourself like this, didja Nikos? Though I gotta say, your flavor is absolutely delicious...\" Cardin chuckled to himself. Wiping the saliva off his digits onto his skirt, Cardin made one last nipple tweak, soaking his tights just enough that his fluids could start dripping from between his legs, before proceeding out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passed by Velvet once more, this time however winking at the girl and blowing her a kiss. Velvet became VERY confused; not many first-year students were brave enough to talk to her, let alone make such a move, but there Pyrrha was; she pulled that look off without so much as a single hesitation. As the redhead walked off, Velvet could have sworn that the girl had more of a manly gait to her, but barely entertained the thought after she saw the glistening trickle of some liquid slide down the girl's inner thigh as she rounded the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin was absolutely in love with his new form. The cool air brushing over his lips under his skirt sent constant tingles up his spine, some of the sensation reaching his breasts; his earlier manhandling of them causing the nipples to slide over the edge of his bra, making them visible under his collared shirt.<br>\r\nFeeling them prick, Cardin was about to pull his jacket over them to cover the bumps from being seen,  when a jitter shook his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory flashed, surprising Cardin, one of Pyrrha getting up in the morning and tucking her breasts into a fresh bra before continuing getting dressed and heading to the cafeteria for breakfast. As he probed it, more began appearing: images of helping Jaune unlock his Aura, of taking on a horde of Grimm in Downtown Vale, of kicking HIMSELF in his own ass while in sparring class... these were Pyrrha's memories!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooohhhhh, I think these could come in handy later...</i> Cardin thought to himself, licking his plump lips. He willed his hands away from the edges of his blazer, letting his nipples remain free. Cardin thought to himself, <i>I can't be alone on an experience like this... I GOTTA tell somebody...</i> Cardin pondered who in all of Remnant he could possibly tell about his new toy, when three perfect candidates popped into his mind. \"Pyrrha\" began to quietly laugh to herself, as the fiend controlling her form most intimately strode back to his fortress of solitude: Team CRDL's dorm.</span></div></div>",

Whatever he was, he got captured by Atlas military in Vale and was locked up in a jail cell. This left Neo on her own, not like it was anything new. She was used to doing whatever she wanted. Their relationship was one of convenience more than anything. All the skills she had, her illusions Semblance, and keen mind allowed her to become a top tier criminal. Unlike Roman, she could walk around Vale without issue. Few knew her and even fewer would dare try to rat her out. The reason she was traveling along the back alleys was due to her not liking crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomedays she wish she could change things to lead a normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther times she enjoyed the freedom and ability to eliminate anyone who annoyed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at what we have here,\u201d a snide voice said behind her. Neo turned around to see three losers blocking the way she just came. \u201cA colorful girl entering out territory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously she came to see us.\u201d The second one stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo rolled her eyes at how clich\u00e9 they were being. Still, her fingers tightened on her parasol. Beating a couple no names to death was sure to help alleviate her frustrations. She wasn\u2019t a first rate assassin for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing to that girl?!\u201d A voice demanded and the three turned around. Neo tilted her head curiously. A tall blonde boy with scraggly hair was walking into the alleyway. He was wearing a pair of jeans and a black hoodie with a rabbit on the front, which Neo found adorable. It did diminish the impressiveness of his entrance though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind your own business,\u201d the leader of the thugs said. \u201cUnless you want to get your ass kicked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to leave until I\u2019m sure you three are going to leave that girl alone.\u201d The boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d The leader snapped his fingers. \u201cBeat him within an inch of his life.\u201d The nearest thug threw a punch and hit the boy in the face. It didn\u2019t even look like the boy tried to dodge the blow and it hit him square in the nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwe!\u201d The thug grabbed his wrist. \u201cThe bastard has Aura!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap! It\u2019s a Hunter!\u201d The three of them ran past Neo and disappeared around a corner. She silently laughed and turned to her\u2026 savior?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d The boy asked and she nodded. \u201cYou might want to avoid alleys from now on. Gangs like to hang out here.\u201d He looked at his scroll. \u201cIt\u2019s this late already? Nora\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d He bows in apology. \u201cSorry, I got to go. Stay safe!\u201d He bolted off before Neo had a chance to respond. She did notice him touching his face and wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird kid</i>, Neo thought.<i> Though he is kind of cute. Maybe he could kill some of my boredom. I\u2019ll look him up later.</i> She spun her parasol around and continued on her way. If the thugs came back, she would deal with them. The hidden knife wasn\u2019t for show after all. She didn\u2019t get to far when a box caught her attention. There was a faint green light coming from it. Thinking it might have been Dust of some kind, she opened it, only to find a remote and a pamphlet. A little disappointed, her curiosity was aroused when she read the title on the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your Guide to the Swapping Remote.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter scanning it for a moment, a huge grin formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If this is real, I\u2019m going to have sooooo much fun</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Neo looked down in utter shock and grabbed her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, there was a large cock and balls where her pussy used to be. Looking at the boy, he went further into Beacon talking to a famous girl named Pyrrha Nikos. His pants looked less strained, but no one else noticed.

Her brain stopped when she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was HUNG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a cock Neo would have loved to have in a hotel room to ravage her.

As she made her way out of the alleyway and into the street, her cloths shimmered until they were much duller colors. She didn\u2019t want to be disturbed as she was spying. Her first priority was to find this blonde haired boy and figure out how to get near him. The accidentally bumping into him and flirting strategy was a good Plan A. He didn\u2019t look like he had much experience resisting cute girls like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find him, but Plan A went up in smoke when she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo groups of people were with him. One of them was several girls Neo recognized. A black haired girl in a red cloak, a tall blonde girl, a raven haired girl with a bow, and a silver haired girl who Neo recognized as a Schnee was talking to the boy along with three other people. There was a red haired girl who Neo recognized as Pyrrha Nikos, famous fighter down in Mistral. Then there was a ginger girl along with a black haired boy. They were sitting next to each other and Neo was pretty sure those two were together based on their interactions. The first four girls were a problem because they would recognize her from the train fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Neo could do now was spy on them. It didn\u2019t take long to gather information on each of their names and the boy, Jaune, seemed to be kind of a dork. That would make him ever so much fun to tease. Now, the question was how to get near him. From his interactions with the others, there were three good choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was Pyrrha Nikos, the champion fighter. She was his partner and teammate in Beacon. This would give Neo direct access to Jaune. The problem was she was crazy popular and Neo would have to deal with that popularity. The second option was Ruby Rose, the black haired girl in the red cloak. She seemed to be good friends with Jaune and Neo would swap places with her and become something more with him. The downside was dealing with that annoying blonde bimbo, Yang. The final option was the Weiss Schnee girl. Jaune seemed to have a crush on her. Neo wasn\u2019t too interested in dealing with the Schnee fame though. His crush on the girl would make it easy to manipulate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she decided to swap with\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neo continued to spy on the kids for a while as they shopped. It became obvious to her that Pyrrha Nikos also had a crush on Jaune. For some reason she didn\u2019t act on it and gave very subtle clues, something he didn\u2019t pick up on. Neo overheard some of their friends discuss a pool on when those two would get together and that was what pushed Neo over the edge. It wasn\u2019t like she could have competition. Jaune was going to be hers until she decided he wasn\u2019t anymore. Whether that be a week, a month, a year, or forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was what kind of swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Life Swap was the more obvious choice. From what the instructions explained, Neo would find herself living Pyrrha\u2019s life and everyone would see them as each other. The downside was actually being the popular Pyrrha Nikos. A couple times several fans mobbed her in a store and that just seemed like a real pain in the ass for Neo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was to do a Personal Info Swap. Neo could swap their positions. The exact specifics were kind of hard to understand, but she could put herself on the team and change relationships so Jaune was her partner and friend. Pyrrha Nikos would be stuck in her position, possibly a criminal. That would be pretty funny to see. A famous celebrity now a wanted criminal. The only worry was that the instructions did say Personal Info Swaps could have some unknown results on reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally deciding, Neo raised the remote and clicked the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stawwwwpppp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo blinked and shook her head. She was sitting at a table outside a small diner with seven other people. Their conversation didn\u2019t falter for even a moment at her unexpected appearance. In all honesty, Neo was sitting there speechless. There was no way the device should have worked, but here she was. Ruby, Yang, Blake, and Weiss had met Neo before in less than positive circumstances, but they were going on like normal. Blake hiding behind a book, Weiss sipping tea, and Ruby and Yang bickering. Neo\u2019s eyes fell down to the plate in front of her and noticed there was a half-eaten bowl of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha wasn\u2019t eating ice cream when Neo swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes darted toward where she had been before swapping. She thought she saw a flicker of red hair, but she wasn\u2019t sure. It seemed like reality altered quite a bit when Neo swapped with Pyrrha. Memories flashed before her mind of joining Beacon. How she found out Jaune snuck his way in with fake transcripts and she was mildly impressed by that feat. Neo had decided to train him because of it after unlocking his aura. Her training was more hands on and revolved around beating him up until his body learned how to move automatically and avoid being hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimple yet effective training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam RWBY didn\u2019t like her much, but as Neo was part of Team ANRN (Team Anuran) and their teams got along, they put up with her. Neo was still a quiet girl in this reality, as she didn\u2019t speak, but took particular delight in beating up her opponents in a very showy manner. The Neo in this world found Jaune somewhat adorable, but decided to act like she wasn\u2019t attracted to him until he was a better fighter. Well, that could be easily changed now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked and turned to the boy next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?

Weiss\u2019s expression and tone immediately soften. \u201cAww, it\u2019s okay, but you can\u2019t chew a remote you little cutie. It\u2019s not for puppies and the small parts could get stuck in your throat.\u201d She placed the remote on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZwei tilted his head not understanding and Weiss kissed his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I can\u2019t stay and play,\u201d Weiss continued. \u201cGrabbing some lunch and heading back to meet Ruby and the others.\u201d Zwei\u2019s ears perked at the sound of his master\u2019s name. \u201cAww. You are just sooo adorable.\u201d Weiss walked over to the closet, opened it, and pulled out a can. She then went over to her desk and pulled out an electric device. The can was set in it and she turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZwei\u2019s mouth watered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recognized the grinding sound. It hurt his ears but the sound told him food was about to come. He hopped up and down as Weiss took the now open can and pulled the dark brown mush into a bowl. The smell hit Zwei\u2019s nose and it didn\u2019t smell as good as it used to, but he was hungry. However, he tilted his head in confusion when he realized the bowl Weiss put the food in wasn\u2019t his. When she drew out a spoon and took a big bite, that was the last straw for the poor little dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whined and Weiss looked down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly, Zwei. This is my food.\u201d Weiss reached down and patted him on the head. \u201cRuby will be up in a little to feed you. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZwei wasn\u2019t sure what happened. Weiss was standing before him eating his food with a spoon while he went hungry. This was wrong but for some reason it also felt okay. He vaguely recalled Ruby and Yang bringing him a variety of food on plates while Weiss only ate the canned food. He really didn\u2019t understand this and decided to go lay down on the rug and wait for Ruby to make things better. Weiss smiled at him and dug her spoon once again into the dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who Ruby and Yang won\u2019t try this,\u201d Weiss muttered as she walked towards the door, bowl in hand. She lifted a heaping spoon of the dark brown muck and put it in her mouth, before sighing. \u201cIt\u2019s high in protein, not to mention has all the nutrients a Huntress needs. Plus, there are all sorts of different flavors. They need to expand their horizons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZwei fell asleep and was finally woken up by\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll be happy to see what I can do.<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nThere are a lot of swap stories taking place in the Real World and many for specific animes/cartoons. There are also plenty of RWBY stories on this site, but none of them involving swapping. This story is supposed to be fun and anyone can post. See guidelines below for information on posts and remote. I am always looking for additions and ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"clred\">Guidelines:</span></u><br>\r\n - No deaths<br>\r\n - Sex is fine as long as its not the focal point of every new chapter. Keep it to a minimum and not make the story all about it. There are plenty of different things to do.<br>\r\n- Keep the personalities of every character the same as much as possible. I understand we are not professionals, but try to avoid going wildly off the rails.<br>\r\n- Keep the story flowing and don't end it abruptly. <br>\r\n- Have good grammar, unintentional typos are OK, just try to keep it to a minimum.<br>\r\n - Keep the story lengthy. Usually two paragraph minimum is a good length to aim for. Avoid constant list of choices that takes several chapters besides the intro. They are annoying and giving people only a handful of choices is perfectly fine.<br>\r\n-Remote powers should be kept the same as below. No new buttons. If you really want to add one, message me and I may approve it if you give a good reason. This list can be updated to be cleared.<br>\r\n - Have fun and enjoy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"clred\">Important details about the Remote</span></u><br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Physical:</span><br>\r\n-Body Swap \u2013 The user exchanges bodies with the target. Nothing else changes. Everyone treats the user and the target as if they were themselves. There might be minor differences such as if a guy and girl switch, but nothing will appear unusual.<br>\r\n-Body Part Swap \u2013 This is like Body Swap, but only targets a specific part.<br>\r\n-Wardrobe Swap - The user exchanges all clothes with the target. This includes clothing not warned. For all tense and purposes, the user and target have always warn those clothes. Nothing will be considered unusual. This does not include weapons.<br>\r\n-Clothing Swap - Like Wardrobe, but only targets a single article of clothing that can be chosen by the user.<br>\r\n-Life Swap \u2013 User switches lives with the target. The user will find themselves wearing the targets clothes while still in their body. Everyone else will see the two as if they were the other. Can be combined with other options, like Body Swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Mental:</span><br>\r\n-Personality \u2013 User switches a specific part of their personality and traits with the target. Example: Emotions, confidence, fears, likes/dislikes etc.<br>\r\n-Personal Info: User can swap a piece of information about themselves with the target. Weapon ownership is included here. If a weapon is swapped, the positions of the two weapons will be exchanged. Other examples include: Names, age, positions, jobs, ownerships, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Other buttons:</span><br>\r\nUndo- Resets last swap made.<br>\r\nReset: Puts all swaps back to normal. Good for long stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Other important information:</span><br>\r\n-The device only swaps the user and the target, no mass swaps or swaps between other people. Let\u2019s add a limit to make it more challenging and thinking outside the box. Triangle swaps can bypass this.<br>\r\n-Anyone touching the device when it goes off is aware of swaps instead of just the user.<br>\r\n-The device works on animals and Grimm.<br>\r\n-The remote always travels with the user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nI tend to update whenever an idea comes to me. If you have something you want to add, feel free to do so. If you want to see something and are to shy to add, let me know. I'll try to take requests if people want to see specific story lines expanded.</i><br>\r\n</td>",
