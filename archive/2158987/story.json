You wanted to buy your girlfriend Kourtney something special as a spontaneous gift, a nice dress would really excite her, you knew. The hours you've been putting into work have been cutting into any social time you once had, and it felt like you only briefly saw your girlfriend on the weekdays, sometimes missing each other for a whole day or two as she's off doing her own side jobs. And here was this beautiful crimson dress with white swirls along it, something that you could easily picture on her. The problem was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't understand the size in the label at all. The numbers and letters inside didn't make any sense, and didn't match up to the sizing charts on one of the racks. It looked like a fit... but you couldn't be sure. You groaned, knowing the surprise would be ruined if you picked the wrong size and had to return it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you deliberated in your predicament, a red-headed woman seemed to appear out of nowhere, dressed up like she was on staff and wearing a nametag that says 'Zoe' on the front. She cheerily spoke, almost startling you out of your daze. \"Can I help you, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over, taking a breather. \"Uh... yeah, I'm trying to get something for my girlfriend. These sizes though... I don't understand why the number on this tag is different from the chart. How can I find out if it's the right size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe smiled, almost letting her excitement burst out of her. An opportunity! \"Oh, yes... these are from a new brand we just started stocking and they run sizes up a little differently. Do you have an image on your phone of the lucky lady, preferably with you and her together? I think we could work something out, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, you thought. Is the staff able to estimate a body shape based on an image? Maybe if you're the reference they can do something in the computers to figure out the right size, that actually seemed really cool. You quickly pulled out your phone, walking as Zoe led you along past other clothes. It took you a bit to find just the right photo, holding it out. \"This one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zoe looked at the phone, you looked up and realized your surroundings were not what you expected. Is this the changing room? The moment of confusion allowed Zoe to do something surprising.</span></div></div>",

Zoe was facing away from you, but her back seemed to open like she had been unzipped! Zoe's arms, legs, even head opened up, her clothes splitting and parting along with the rest of her body, revealing a sort of hollow interior the color of her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say a single word, she fell back onto you, and her body clung to you. She was exceptionally light, albeit because she had nothing inside of her, and it was like you were being draped with a warm blanket. For a moment, your vision was dark, Zoe's exterior clinging to you. While you tried to struggle or run, there was nothing really to struggle against. Your first attempt to pull Zoe off didn't work, as her hands slid over yours like gloves and you couldn't reach back to pull at whatever might still be open. Zoe very quickly sealed up, and it felt so strange... the moment she completely closed, everything felt... normal. Well, relatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mouth wide open, you turned to stare in the mirror at your new self. Immediately you recognized the face staring back at you: Kourtney. Clad in a very plain set of bra and panties, you reached your hand up to touch your face, bewildered by your sudden change--and the sudden disappearance of Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going ON!\" you say, startled by your own voice. It wasn't yours, and wasn't Kourtney's. You took a step back, bumping into the other side of the changing booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry about that. I didn't know what she should sound like, y'know? Pictures don't tell me that.\" The giggly, bubbly voice... it sounded like Zoe, but you looked around and saw no one. \"I'm still here! I'm just a part of you. Look, just be calm, I'm here to help! I'm pretty good at this part, I got enough of her to make sure you get a perfect fit for your sweetheart. Go ahead, try on the dress and see for yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the dress, then back to the mirror, your face still rather distressed.  You didn't know what to do...</span></div></div>",

You were so used to being a tall guy, and suddenly you're a petite girl, with a B-cup chest, and clearly fully female wherever you look... and it was a bit unsettling. You had a tough time breathing, as you turned to the dress silently, taking it off the hanger.  Unzipping the back, you slowly stepped into it, pulling the dress up over your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching your reflection dress felt so familiar. You'd seen Kourtney do this plenty of times, but being entirely in control of that reflection was jarring. Zoe occasionally giggled as you struggled with the zipper, when you leaned forward to make faces in the mirror to see Kourtney's face reciprocate, when you ran a hand up and down the dress, shuddering as your fingers traced along the breasts that for the moment belonged to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath, having to sit down in the fitting room as you brought a hand to your face. Your head was spinning, everything was so different. \"How is this even possible..?\" you muse aloud, and luckily Zoe was there to answer, as if everything was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! I am a special creature, you can bet on that. I'm a living skinsuit, or a shapeshifting suit, or a symbiote, or a shift-suit, or... I thought of like thirty of these, why am I drawing a blank now... whatever. When I'm worn by someone, I can make them look like someone else, girls only though. Lucky for you, though, I was here to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you looked at the reflection in the mirror. It truly was amazing... but you weren't sure that you were prepared for such a new experience today. All you really wanted was to get back to your girlfriend and... what was it again? Oh right, give her the dress. The dress you were wearing. The dress you could wear because you looked exactly like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Zoe...\"</span></div></div>",

I'd love to be able to see that myself, actually..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would? Um.\" That was a surprise to hear, it sounded sort of like Zoe was intending to stick around. \"Well, I mean, I'd like to get back to normal so I can give her the dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause, as you suddenly felt rather isolated in this different body, different voice, different eveything. \"Oh... right, yes.  About that, the thing is I need someone to wear me so I can stay alive, I was... hoping you could help. A favor for a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately felt sympathy for Zoe. This wasn't a malicious person, but being suddenly a woman was a big life disruption. On the other hand, you knew your girlfriend was bisexual... and maybe Zoe could help you give Kourtney a very surprising gift, beyond just the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you let me be normal, then I'll take you along with me... for, uh, wearing later. Maybe by me, maybe by my girlfriend if she likes the idea...\" You still weren't sure what you were getting into. How does Zoe respond?</span></div></div>",

Your first instinct is to contact someone, anyone, either to help you or to wake you up. So you began to reach around for your phone, feeling around for it.  You weren't seeing it in the mirror, moving to look behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe had gone quiet, sort of leaving you to panic on your own as you looked under the changing room door. Did you knock your phone away in the excitement? Your body shape had been modified so much that losing a sense of your surroundings had happened, so you could have dropped your phone and kicked it away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter observing you flail about, Zoe started to giggle, realizing what you were doing. \"Missing your phone? Try shaking your hand out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you even...\" you trail off as you shake out your hands, sort of subconsciously. You shriek out in a panic as your palm lights up, displaying in big glowing numbers the time. Your palm looked like your lock screen... and as you brought your other hand to touch the palm, your hand suddenly looks like a full phone menu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe keeps giggling, clearly giddy about your discovery. \"Oh, isn't that neat? Electronics sort of just... merge with me when I also flow over a body. There's all sorts of possibilities if you want to be a cyborg, y'know? Like... speakers in the chest, some boom-box boobs!\" She seemed to be enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny..!  It's... it's overwhelming, Zoe!\" Your hands are at your head, looking at your girlfriend's face in the mirror, then down at her petite body.  \"I don't know what to make of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Zoe's disembodied voice seemed thoughtful. \"Okay. Let me give you the run-down. My survival depends on being attached to a body, I just need to stay connected to you for a little while and then if you want me to go... I will. But just give me a day? I promise I'll do what I can to make it fun for you. Or maybe fun for you and your girlfriend in some way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving calmed down while you were listening to Zoe, you were able to think a bit more clearly. \"Fine. You and I need to talk more later about this survival thing of yours, but for now? I guess I am a bit curious.\" You realized that if Zoe is really what she says she is, then no one would be happier about it than Kourtney. She could have you play both sides of her bisexual desires, not to mention she's always been envious of other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it gonna be, um... what is your name, by the way?\" Zoe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your thought process.  \"Oh... I'm Alex. And if you're going to meet my girlfriend, she's Kourtney. But... okay, maybe we can try something out.\"</span></div></div>",

Kourtney's my girlfriend, but she likes women too, so... maybe could you try making a new version of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly!\" If Zoe was anything, she was incredibly chipper about being a bodysuit and all its possibilities. Your form began to shift before your eyes, returning to your brown shade of hair, your skin tone, and then your height returned--somewhat.  Zoe took some liberties with creating your feminine shape though--while your face shifted to look like as if you had a sister, your body took on a bit of extra shape. Your hips flared out, giving you an incredible set of legs, losing the panties altogether, giving you a view of your shaved crotch. Your stomach was smooth, flawless, as the bra also melted away, as Zoe had generated the basic clothes from her own self. Your breasts grew out, giving you a chest on the upper end of manageable. Your first experience with breasts was a bra-clad petite chest, but what Zoe had just given you seemed to jiggle at the slightest motion, and they were now suddenly impossible to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands came up to grip at the chest, as you stared in amazement in the mirror at your form. \"Oh wow... Kourtney would go bonkers over this, this body's amazing... you really think I'd look like this?\"  The voice coming from your mouth was familiar, but clearly wasn't your normal voice as your pitch had increased just enough to match your body. Your hands left your chest, causing the flesh to bounce back into position throwing you off-balance momentarily, as you ran your hands through your longer brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Well... consider it in the realm of possibilities.\" Zoe stopped making little adjustments, leaving you as-is. \"I mean, there's no real exact version of you. If you lived a life as a woman, it's hard to predict exactly how you would end up. Plus-size or stick thin, or really athletic or frail, there's so many factors. I could make you all those things if you want, of course! But you wanted to impress a girlfriend too.\" Zoe's sing-song voice at the end meant she had definitely had a strategy to the shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something off, though... you reached up to your face, realizing what it was when you tried to take off your glasses unconsciously to get a better look. No glasses! \"Hey... did you fix my eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! You were wearing the glasses when I got on you, so... it's like your phone. The lenses are built into you. But, you're right... to complete the illusion.\" Glasses suddenly seemed to grow out of your face! Dark frames in a trendy shape formed around your eyes, even with lenses to complete the illusion, though they didn't change your eyesight.  \"Purely cosmetic, I promise, but... wow, you look great now! Like some sexy librarian.\" Zoe took the liberty of forming some clothes over you, a cute grey sweater and black slacks. They felt like normal clothes, the slacks swishing as you moved your legs. \"If you like this look, then maybe you'll want to grab some actual clothes, something you can put on and take off on your own. But, I think you're ready to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried a smile, and were almost in love with your reflection, finding yourself incredibly cute. \"Yeah... you're right. This is amazing. Kourtney will love this...\"</span></div></div>",

Walking was so strange, everything shifted and jiggled and swayed in new ways that you couldn't keep your mind off of. Zoe's voice turned into a quiet voice in your ear as you wandered, guiding you along like a personal assistant. \"My things are in the back room, pick them up for me please? Just down the hall to the left, and just keep walking like everything is normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as instructed, walking as you felt yourself change all of a sudden.  Your body adjusted mid-stride, threatening to cause you to trip! You glance down, seeing Zoe's nametag on your chest, and her old uniform. \"Hey! Eyes up! This is just for security cameras, just act normal. Door code is 7732.\" You glanced up again, continuing to move forward despite everything being a total surprise at every turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just take over and make us do all this?\" you asked as you make it into the back room, going to Zoe's locker to grab some items that she can't just replicate, all contained in her purse. \"Like... you can make me look however you want without my say, why not just move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do... I don't have muscles like you do. I also don't have a stomach or lungs or a heart like you do, or a nervous system. My whole body is a special strange collection of cells that can do all sorts of things, but while I can briefly act like a body on my own, it's exhausting! And I can't fight against your muscles. So, it's all you. I don't mind though, I'm always happy to let you do whatever you want while I'm connected to you. If I didn't, I'd find another person to connect to, that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take everything and head outside through another door, Zoe shifting you back to your newly-adopted feminine form as you do. It was a beautiful day, sunny and bright. Zoe again took the liberty to modify your outfit, giving you sneakers, some shorts, a blue tank top. \"In my bag... there's some sunglasses. I can't make sunglasses that work as effectively as the real things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as instructed, and started to walk home. You didn't live far from the mall, but the walk still would take time, which you and Zoe spent to learn more about each other. You took out Zoe's phone from her bag as well, holding it to your ear so you could talk to her like normal and no one would look at you too strangely along your walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Zoe, I think we do need to figure out some understanding though... you're not just going to change the outfit every few minutes, are you? Or make it disappear in public altogether? Are you going to keep changing my body without warning too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a little giggle in your ear again--a slightly mischievous sound. \"Well, I suppose that depends on how well we get along, huh? If we're best buds, I'll let you dictate how we look unless you trust me to take care of that stuff on my own. But, it could be fun if you can't ever be sure how you'll end up looking... or if, say, a third party decides, instead. If you're really worried about me doing something embarrassing to these outfits I'm generating, then you can get some regular clothes on, I can't make those disappear. It depends on trust, but also if you want an infinitely large wardrobe where you never do laundry again.\" Well, that did sound appealing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped yourself for a moment. You're just in a temporary body! The real Alex is still inside, and Zoe was acting like she'd already made her stay permanent. That was too big a decision to make even if it benefit Zoe. \"How long can you live without a body like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, these questions...\" Zoe sighed. \"I can go a week without a connection. I'm just fine for three days on my own, but it's like a hunger beyond that. Every little bit helps, but a day resets the clock. I just...\" she trailed off for a moment, leaving you a bit worried that you brought it up at all, she seemed uncomfortable. \"...it's just that I'm tired of short-term connections. Lots of times, I sneak onto a body and then look exactly like they did before, but something like an injury gives me away--I don't bleed the same. Or, I can't always keep quiet... or hold the same shape. It's so much better to be with people who understand me, and I hope that can be you and your girlfriend. It went well for a while with someone else I knew but things just didn't work out after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked for a bit, keeping quiet. Zoe found the silence a bit unnerving, it seemed. No wonder she had a tough time hiding... \"N-not that I'm gonna stay on you forever, oh no! I mean, maybe a quarter of my time on one of you, and then the rest as my own person if that's what you want. Honestly, I'm flexible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded a little, but decided to change the subject, this was clearly a deeper conversation for later. Your apartment was in view, and Kourtney's car was visible in the parking lot.  \"So, um... can I eat and drink with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought back the giggly Zoe, who was relieved to move on as well. \"Yes, of course! All your normal bodily functions, pretty much.  And actually it's nice, since I don't eat or drink normally, I get to enjoy that while connected too. It's fun! Just behave like normal... eating, sleeping, all that. Before you ask, if you get drunk, I get drunk, while I'm connected to you. And, something else... I mean, like this, you're a woman, right? So, there's some other considerations... but don't worry about it for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you were at your door, realizing that there was one barrier between you and Kourtney. A mix of excitement and dread swirled in you. How would she react? Would she believe you? Would she let Zoe stick around? Suddenly, you were thinking whether it would be wise to surprise her in the body of another woman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You take a deep breath, and turn the handle, letting the door swing open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour apartment was not giant, but it was a nice size. The entrance opened up to a living area and kitchen, and off to the side was doors leading to the two bedrooms, where one was serving as an office for working from home even if your boss doesn't let you work from home often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney was in the kitchen, focused on cooking up something that smelled wonderful from the stove, likely some sort of stir fry. She didn't even look up when the door opened, humming to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Kourtney?\" You spoke up, somewhat meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blonde girlfriend turned around, stunned and confused by this beautiful girl at her door. \"Do I... know you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney was a bit lost in your appearance for a moment, before she seemed to come out of her daze. \"Alex... Alex who? Do you live nearby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes a little, realizing you weren't being very convincing. \"No, Alex-Alex... your boyfriend. I mean... huh, I should've thought this through better. Look, something happened while I was out, I was looking for something for you for a gift, and I... long story. I'm a girl, now. ...For now. It's, again, a long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that went horribly. Kourtney just stared, confused, as she pointed the wooden spoon in her hand at you, a smirk forming across her lips, giving a sort of a snort-laugh as she pieces together her idea of the situation. \"Oh wow. Okay, so Alex found a girl who looks sorta like him, with... wow, with a lucky body, for sure... did he hire you for this? Do you work in his office and this is like some goofy prank? I mean yeah, you're gorgeous, but that sounds like the kind of silly thing he'd do instead of just getting me a dress like a normal girlfriend.\"  It was safe to say that Kourtney wasn't convinced, and likewise wasn't impressed by what she thought was a strange roleplay thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, no, it's... Zoe! Can you show her?\" You put your hands on your hips as you look at a nonplussed Kourtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was different when you changed shape, though. Zoe turned you back into Kourtney's twin, exactly as before, even wearing her same clothes as now--and this time, accurately matching her voice.  Kourtney jumped, threatening to spill her stir fry as she yelped out, shocked that you would just change like that. Your hands went up, trying to calm her down from a distance, stepping further in. \"Nonono, calm down Kourt! It's me, it's Alex! ...And it's this person Zoe, too, she's sort of wrapped around me and can make me look like any sort of girl I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disembodied voice of Zoe spoke out. \"Hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney was wide-eyed at you still, and you realized it was still not enough. \"Zoe, can she and I have a moment...?\"  Your living bodysuit took the cue, as seams opened up behind you, pulling away from your arms, torso, head.  Your cell phone falls from your grip, as it had been contained inside until now. Eventually, Zoe pulls fully away, re-forming as a Kourtney clone--and she awkwardly wiggles her fingers.  \"I'll be outside, um, if you need me.\"  All of this just causes Kourtney to shriek again, until you're over at her side, arms on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kourtney, calm down... it's me, it's fine. Zoe was a shock to me too, but she needs our help. And... I thought you might like to try something different, something that changes the dynamic for both of us.\"  You spoke softly, and Kourtney calms down, but she still seems just utterly in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney looks out the door. \"How is any of that possible? And why didn't you just call!\" Kourtney shoves your shoulder, before latching into a hug around your waist. She was shaking a little, but she looks up at you. \"It's really not just some trick or special effect? She lets you be a girl...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Zoe was busy looking at flowers that Kourtney had put on the front porch. \"She's a bodysuit, a living one. It means she can wrap around a body, it's how she survives I guess. In return, she can make us look however we want. I did all the moving, she just made me look like that. I think we should really get to know her, I mean if it lets me be something better for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time before Kourtney finished processing her thoughts.</span></div></div>",

You were afraid she was just going to slam the door on Zoe, and you were ready to protest before Kourtney simply takes Zoe's hand, leading her off into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised, hands on your hips again, looking confusedly at the bedroom door. What could your girlfriend be up to? She isn't just having a makeout session with her temporary twin, is she? Or maybe she was interrogating her, finding out if Zoe was an alien or some weird parasite meant to dominate the human race...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the door opened.  You could see Kourtney's face--but it wasn't at her usual height. She was a foot taller, eyes piercing into your soul as she bit her bottom lip.  Her body had changed dramatically, as her hips and chest were pushing the boundaries of normalcy, and yet her massive melon-sized breasts seemed to defy gravity, in just some semi-transparent fabric that gave just a hint of her body underneath, wrapped around her chest and hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... do you like it?\" Kourtney asks, nervously. \"I had to see for myself. It's amazing...\" her hands ran up and down her body. \"It's the suit, but... I feel everything. I feel... fantastic. I think you may have found the perfect gift.\"  She strolls up to you, wrapping her arms around you in a passionate kiss. You didn't have to bend over to lock lips, and her massive chest pressed against you, getting you excited. Your girlfriend was breathing heavily, anticipating using this new body of hers in every way imaginable as soon as possible. The stir fry lunch long forgotten, it was clear that Kourtney had some new ideas to spend her afternoon.</span></div></div>",

Your hands were gliding along Kourtney's larger chest, eliciting a shiver from your upgraded girlfriend. With an ahem, Zoe pipes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two can do as you like, but if you really want to try being close?  Try being closer than two people in a relationship have ever been--become one person, quite literally, using me!\"  Zoe's chipper voice snapped you and Kourtney out of the daze caused by staring at the beautiful body before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney made a strange expression, not really sure what to make of what was being offered.  \"How would that work, even?  Wouldn't you stretch out to look, y'know... huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe giggled, amused by her newfound hosts.  \"Only briefly. When I seal up, I can distort everything within me--harmlessly of course!  That's how I was able to shape Alex earlier.  It's very simple, you two just need to enter my body while I'm opened up, and then I'll seal back up and you'll be a single body.  All that matters is how you position yourselves.  There are a ton of different ways, and trust me we can have a LOT of fun with just about every one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew immediately this could be interesting, if only because you would gain some amazing insight into Kourtney's own behavior and preferences from a first-person view.  \"I'm in, if... if that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... alright, show us something.\"  Kourtney was suddenly smiling, seeming to see some advantages to the situation herself if there was no harm in it.  \"What sort of things can we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe pulled herself off of Kourtney, unfurling to show her hollow self to the both of you.  \"Let's start simple, so consider these options.  If one of you climbs into my left side and the other to the right, I can split control between you two to either side.  If one of you sits on the shoulders of the other, then I can split control top to bottom--and maybe even make some adjustments down below so the lower half can speak!  Now, if you stand one behind the other, you're going to end up a blend of each other--you'll know you used to be two people, but it's going to be sort of a blend of both of you, best--and worst--of both worlds.  Scary as that might sound, it's actually the safest way so you won't end up hurting us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney, in her more petite body, stands by your side, holding your hand as she pulls you toward Zoe's open form.  \"You pick the first way we do this.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are <b>Alex</b>, a 25-year-old right out of college living with your girlfriend of two years named <b>Kourtney</b>, in your apartment while you try to figure out post-college life. Your relationship really needs something to spice it up, before the stresses of work life push you two apart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnter <b>Zoe</b>. She seems normal on the outside when you first meet, but she's got a secret--she's a living skinsuit! She can be worn by other people, who fully take on her shape when she seals up her back. In addition, she can transform her own shape at any time to look like any woman. She won't say where she came from, just that she needs to be connected to people in order to live, and she thinks your relationship is her perfect opportunity. Maybe it can spark something between you and Kourtney again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>People:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex - 25 - Either male or female at the start. Tall, thin, with brown hair and glasses. Not muscular or athletic, as you spend most of your time sitting at your desk for your job rather than getting out and about. You make comfortable money. You love Kourtney, but you're having trouble figuring out what would solidify things between you two again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKourtney - 24 - Sandy blonde hair, and a petite frame has her often envious of other girls, she makes up for her height with a charismatic personality. She's bisexual, and it can be hard to keep her focus on you if you don't put effort into it. That used to not be a problem, but long hours at your work have strained your ability to hold her interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe - ?? - She is an extremely cheerful people-pleaser, without a real shape to call her own outside of only appearing female. Her back and limbs can open up, revealing a hollow interior that can wrap around someone else. Zoe needs to be connected to people, and she thinks through her abilities (and some mischief) she could find a way to snag a long term host... or two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Facts About Zoe:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*It doesn't matter the size of the person she wraps around, she can completely envelop them. When she seals herself up, her outward appearance can be any size regardless of whoever is contained inside: allowing short people to be tall, large to be petite, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Her wearer feels everything through Zoe, once she has sealed up, as if it was their own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*When worn, Zoe has no motor control, the wearer has full control over how the body moves. Zoe can however still speak in a sort of disembodied voice that can be heard by people nearby. She doesn't seem to mind what her wearer does with her body, as long as she is connected to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*What Zoe <i>CAN</i> control is the body shape, able to transform it into any female form at will (photo references allow her to make a reasonable copy, but enveloping someone lets her recreate their outward appearance perfectly). She can also create an outfit for her body, though she enjoys normal clothes. She also has control over sealing and unsealing herself around a body, regardless of the wearer's wishes in some cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Zoe can envelop multiple people at once, and still maintain a normal shape. Depending on how the bodies she wraps around are positioned, control may be split in different ways--or the minds of the bodies inside might temporarily merge completely. How the minds share or merge tends to be fairly unpredictable, but it's entirely reversed once outside of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Zoe can also envelop around objects either with or without a person inside, although objects don't provide any life sustenance. Objects inside her can have wild effects, such as being able to be used somewhat like a phone if she sealed herself around one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Zoe can only go a week without being attached to a body. Since her internal structures are different than a normal human, she relies on a wearer for energy from respiration and digestion.  She needs at least one full day to fully recharge, but even just a few minutes with a wearer helps replenish some of her energy.  She feels fine for three or four days, and then she experiences something similar to starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>One More Thing:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add meaningful chapters! I would prefer none of the endless strings of chapters with no substances with things like \"Does Zoe turn into ___? Yes/No\".  </td>",
