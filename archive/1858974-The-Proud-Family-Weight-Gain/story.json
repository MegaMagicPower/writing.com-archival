One more bite and I will explode. I'm serious.\" Penny said and ran outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was walking down the street. She decided too go over to Dijonay. It was always very busy around her house with all her little brothers and sisters. Penny had just one little sister and brother and that was already more then enough for her. Dijonay was her best friend but sometimes she wondered why. Sure they could get along fine but sometimes Dijonay could really stab you in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Penny!\" Someone suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hello LaCienega.\" Penny said careful since she knew very well she did't liked her, and the only reason they hang out together was because she was a friend from Dijonay and Zoey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow what did you do to yourself? Did you swallow a whale? You're fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean. My clothes shrunk a bit because my mom washed them too hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what you keep telling yourself? Thinking if you say it enough times it will come true?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know what LaChienega, I don't know what I ever did to you too deserve this. You always picking on me and I don't no why and now you're telling me I'm fat, while I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right listen up proud, lets be fair. I don't like you and you don't like me that's just how it is but you are fat. That's the real truth. If you don't believe me, ask you friends. See you later proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye. LaCienega.\" Said Penny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cursed the day that LaCienega's family came living next to them. And for some strange reason her parents liked the parents of LaCienega. Also sugamama liked the grandfather. However she was't really sure if he liked her too. She could never understand a word he said. But he always ended what he said with a really irritating laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome too my life.\" Penny said too herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally reached Dijonay's house and rang the doorbell.  </span></div></div>",

Looking at it she thought it would be a bit to wide for her but that was not the only thing that was bothering her. It was a princess dress. She stopped dressing like a princess about eight years ago. What did her mother thought she was? A toddler?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mom... No advance but I think it's a bit to big for me.\" Penny said not wanting to hurt her mother's feelings by telling her she did't want to dress like a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know it's to big for you if you did't even tried it one?\" Trudy said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny sighed. Well there was no one here who could see her besides her family and you need to try on clothes to make sure the did or did not fit. Penny pulled on the princess dress and too her surprise it fitted her perfectly. It felt a lot easier then her old tight clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? How is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It fits perfectly mom. How is that possible? I was sure it was to big for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're still a growing girl honey.\" Trudy said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true. LaCienega said I was getting fat. That's not true. Is it mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no of course not. You're not getting fat. You're just getting taller. Some people mix up those two. I'm sure LaCienega did't mend it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes she did. Penny thought to herself but she did't say it. For some reason Her mother did't seem to notice how mean LaCienega was. Maybe because LaCienega's mother was her best friend. Penny sighed and went downstairs.<br>\r\nWhen she came down she noticed her father, Suga Mama, Bebe and Cece came home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A there's Penny. How is my granddaughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Suga Mama.
