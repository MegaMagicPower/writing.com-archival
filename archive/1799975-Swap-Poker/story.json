            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Happy Birthday Michael.\", everyone shouted as Michael began cutting the birthday cake. He just turned 17 and was happy to party with his friends. Michael never was a fan of big birthday parties. He never understood what's so great about big parties with a bunch of people he barely knows. He enjoyed celebrating with his closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the cake Michael watched at his friends. \"What do you guys say about playing poker?\", he asked them holding up the deck of cards he found this morning in his garden. \"I found the card deck laying on the grass this morning and it had a very strange manual.\". Michael showed the manual which was covered with runes from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I skimmed through it\", he continued explaining, \"And it says if you win a hand you can swap something with the others, e.g. body parts or personal information.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister grunted and rolled her eyes. \"Yeah right if that would be true... Why do I have to have a brother as stupid as him?\", the last part she mumbled but still hearable for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, even it is not true we can at least try it out and if it not works we just continue playing, for fun.\", Josie defended Michael with a smile. Everyone else nods except Anna who just rolled her eyes again. It was obvious for everyone that she did not want to be here. Michael knew that she was only present because their mother forced her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's start.\", Michael said and gave everyone their cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a full house Jeremy won the hand, then looked at Michael. \"And what now?\", he asked. \"Erm...\", Michael quickly looked through the manual. \"You er... have to say 'I want to swap ... with ...'.\", he explained to his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJermey nodded. \"Okay then... I want to swap...\", he looked through the group. Anna just shook her head and brushed her hair out of her face. \"Idiots...\", she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy, annoyed by Anna's behaviour decided that he wanted to swap something with her. \"I want to swap legs with Anna.\", he said angrily well knowing that Anna was very proud of her legs and therefore often wore short skirts, just like today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna continued shaking her head until she felt her legs tingle. Shocked she looked down, seeing her legs in her pink mini skirt becoming manlier and hairier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy on the other hand quickly pulled up his leg just in time to see his hair retreat in his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\", Anna exclaimed, \"It really works?!\". She looks at Jeremy. \"Give me my legs back! I look like an idiot with your legs!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to say this sis... but you cannot swap back right now. You have to win a hand... and you have to wait 48 hours before you can get back your legs.\", Michael explained while reading through the manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days?! I have to run around two days with this legs?!\", she cried out histerically, \"I can't go out like this!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. According to the manual reality adjusts and everyone except the ones who play will find it normal.\", Michael tried to calm his sister down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really exciting.\", Josie smiled, \"So we can swap everything?\". Michael nodded. \"It seems that way.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's continue.\", Josie said. It was obvious that she really liked the idea swapping something with the others. Michael himself was not so sure if it was such a good idea but nobody would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue?! Are you insane?\", Anna shouted out. \"I look like a freak right now because of this stupid deck of cards and you want to continue?!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody notices anyway. It could be fun. You started playing  and have to play again in two days again if you want your legs back anyway.\", Josie tried to convince Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\", Anna grunted again and Jeremy deals the hand this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hand was won by...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, I guess I won...\", Michael mumbled thinking about what he should swap. He was not sure if he should swap something with one of the girls. Looking at Jeremy and Philipp he was not so sure if he should swap something with one of them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem with swapping with the girls was what he could swap. He did not want anything the girls had, he did not want to have breasts, their hair or their crotch. Swapping with one of the guys was a similar problem. They were his friends, Michael did not want to have one of their body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up...\", Anna grunted annoyed. \"Yeah yeah... I hurry...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael continued thinking about his options. He could swap clothing with one of them. At least he read that in the manual. He did not like this idea as well. Michael was no crossdresser so the girl's clothes were out of question and he did not want to wear the clothes of Philipp. He was a pervert and who knew what landed on his clothes when Philipp was alone in his room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe some personal information? What meant this anyway? Could he swap names? Family? Birthplace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Michael felt a tingle on his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", Michael wondered discovering that instead of his own voice there was now Melody's high pitched voice was coming from his mouth. \"But I haven't said anything!\", he exclaimed, quickly grabbing the manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody was shocked as well. \"My... my voice...\", she said in her now deep voice, quickly covering her mouth. It was obvious she was scared because of this change and would not talk very much the next days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\", Michael sighed in his new girly voice, finally finding the passage in the manual explaining what happened. \"Apparently\", he explained to his friend, \"When you not choose a swap within two minutes the choice is taken away from you and you randomly get something from one of the losers...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to keep your stupid male voice?\", Melody asked sobbing slightly. Michael nodded which did nothing to cheer Melody up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp grinned looking at the others. \"This gets really interesting. As long as we play we cannot get away with swapping nothing. Well, anyway. Let's play.\". Philipp grabbed the deck and dealt the card. What the others did not know, Philipp wanted to win a hand in order to get Josie's D-Cups. He knew he would not get her because she did not like him but thanks to the game he could get her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winner of the following hand was...</span></div></div>",

Michael too was glaring at Philipp, as he, Jeremy, Anna and Melody all knew just what he was probably going to swap with Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an expression appeared on Philipp's perverted face, indicating a brief moment of 'thought'. \"I want to swap genitals with Josie!\" he blurted out...causing Josie to screech out a very loud...\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" Josie then muttered as she felt a tingling in her groin...and something pushing outwards...filling up her panties. She looked down as a definite bulge formed in the front of her long skirt, Philipp's penis and scrotum now sat rather 'uncomfortably' between her legs...and to make matters worse...she was getting an instant 'stiffy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard!\" Michael growled at Philipp, who already had a hand down his pants, probing the outlines of his new vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all thought I was gonna take Josie's tits didn't ya?\" Philipp grinned...as he gasped a little. \"I figured since I don't have a snowball's chance in hell of ever 'hittin' this pussy, I may as well have it myself\" he then snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one sick fuck you know that!\" Michael grumbled with a shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says the dude with the little girl's voice!\" Philipp teased Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody immediately snapped at Philipp. \"Who you calling little, asswipe?\" she boomed in Michael's deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie let out a prolonged sigh and tried to ignore the erection now straining against the fabric of her panties. \"Can we just get on with playing the game please and stop arguing?\" she said. \"And YOU...stop playing with my vagina\" she warned Philipp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem...its MY vagina now!\" Philipp responded with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not permanently its not!\" Michael said to Philipp, \"You're giving it back sooner or later\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys...come on, the game\" Jeremy interjected, and the cards were dealt again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So much choice, so few time.\", mumbled Josie. \"But I guess, I have an idea of what to do.\". She looked over at Philipp. \"You seem to like my vagina. Let's see how we can change that.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about swapping sexual orientation but she did not want to have that pervert's sexual orientation. Maybe hormones... But that would end up in the same way probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I got it now.\", she said. \"I want to swap how I feel about genitals with Philipp.\", she said and hoped that the cards would accept that swap and that it would end up in the way she hoped it would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp blinked horrified. \"You can't do that. That's against the rules, right?\", he asked the others but knew the answer before anyone could even answer. The thought of having a vagina between his legs did not turn him on anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked.\", grinned Josie. \"Now you won't have any fun, perv!\". Josie's delightness soon vanished because now she noticed the flaw in her plan. She suddenly was appealed to the thought of having a vagina between her legs. Although she knew that she once had one, she just was turned on by the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'm now thinking like the pervert... In some way... Better not tell the others...\", she thought and dealt the next hand.</span></div></div>",

It was absolutely brilliant to see his older brother and his girlfriend in such a state. Philipp was a pervert but as long as he did not swap with her, Anna was fine with it.

His mom, dad and big brother Robert were already sitting together and had started eating dinner. \"Ah, finally, sissy hands, is showing up.\", Robert joked as he saw Philipp approaching. Philipp was thrown back at the reaction of his brother but was able to keep his face. \"Don't call him like that, Robert!\", Philipp's mom blustered with her older son. \"You know he's been born with a rare disease that makes his hand and arms become feminine. And it's his right to let his nails grow long and have them manicured. Why shouldn't he with this beautiful hands? I also enjoy our mother-son days when we both get a manicure.\", his mom winked at Philipp as she spoke the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\", Philipp thought as he was taking his seat. \"The cards only seem to come up with a possible solution of the swap when needed. It wouldn't be normal for me to manicure my nails even though I have Josie's hands. I assume that if Josie's nails wouldn't have been manicured I would have just been a guy with feminine arms and hands but for no reason. Just like the way it is with my voice. The disease only affects my arms and not my voice.\". Philipp began eating, using his manicured hands while thinking about the way the cards worked. \"So if some aspect of a swap doesn't fit it gets an explanation otherwise it's just assumed normal.\". He cocked his head to one side while eating. \"The cases were something is changed seem to be very limited. Can't think of any other case. Maybe there is one I'm not thinking of right now.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp's mom looked worried at her son. \"What's wrong? Something bothering you?\", she asked him. \"Maybe a fingernail broke off.\", Robert joked and earned just a grim look from his mother. Philipp shooked his head. \"No, nothing. I was just er thinking about school tomorrow.\", he tried to explain why he was spacing out, using Josie's sweet voice. His mother nodded. \"Okay. I've got good news for you by the way.\", she smiled broadly at you. \"You cousin Eric is coming over the weekend.\". Philipp's face brightened up. He and Eric were best buddies since they were kids. They always played together and since they had hit puberty they were sharing porn magazines. It nearly became a contest between the two of them who got the best magazine since they last met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm reliefed I hadn't swapped breasts with Josie for now.\", Philipp thought. \"It would be really strange with him around and let him always look at my boobs.\". Philipp looked at his mother. \"So he's coming over tomorrow afternoon.\". His mom nodded. \"Maybe, I can get him to play poker with us the day after tomorrow.\", he thought smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Philipp went upstairs and looked at his wonderful arms and hands. \"In hindsight, that was really the best swap I could do.\", he grinned and closed the door of his room behind him. Inside he began masturbating again. He really enjoyed the feeling of his new hands on his cock. Moaning in his sexy voice he soon came and was sweating heavily. \"This just amazing!\", he smiled breathing heavily. He then went to sleep with a smile.</span></div></div>",

The house seemed strange now that he has gotten smaller. \"One thing I really need to change tomorrow. But I should try to keep these hands and voice.\", he thought with a smile. In the bathroom he looked shortly into the mirror and saw his smaller reflection. He held up his hands and wiggled his fingers. \"Best swap ever.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went to the toilet and got his penis out with the two hands he loved so much. Just when he touched his penis it began to react. \"No, sorry, not now. Don't have time.\", he sighed and took a piss. He then took a shower and went down to eat breakfast with his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp knew that his brother wanted to great him with his new nickname \"sissy hands\" but it seemed that he got into quite trouble yesterday and his mother was watching in that moment. \"Morning... Philipp...\", he greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp grinned. \"Morning, Robert.\", he replied. \"And morning, mom and dad.\". His mom who was currently baking some bacon turned around and smiled at Philipp. \"Morning, sweet-heart. Don't forget your cousin is coming over this afternoon.\", she reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I forget that?\", he asked smiling and sat down at the kitchen table. \"Good. And don't forget we both have an appointment for a manicure right after school. So hurry out of the class room just this once, will you?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp looked at his feminine hands. The nail polish was slowly fading away and it really did not look that good anymore. Probably because of all he had done in the last 10 hours so far with them. \"Right mom. Thanks for reminding me.\". He then ate his bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later he was in school. Only 5 minutes before classes began, like always. He may be a rather well doing student but one thing was for sure: He was very lazy. And you could only call him well doing considering his laziness. His marks were average, he could do better but he did not want to. He was just too engrossed in other things. Girls to be precisly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp wanted to avoid meeting with Josie or Michael on the hallway. Unfortunately he ran into them right away. \"There you are! Nearly too late like always.\", grunted Josie in Philipp's original voice right as Philipp was coming in hearing range. \"I don't want to know what you did with my beautiful hands!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now...

He looked at Philipp pleading that he did not say something that might anger Josie right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp nodded with a sly grin. \"Yeah, I didn't do anything I wouldn't do with my own hands. Besides you should be nicer to me. I'm ill after all.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie raised an eyebrow. \"And you have what? Pevertus?\". He shook his hand. \"No. I'm born with a rare disease that makes my hands and arms feminine.\". Josie growled at him. \"I get you and then I'll kill you!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp got one step back and raised his hands in defence. \"No it's true. Apparently the cards had to come up with this disease in order to enable me to have my hands manicured. What normal boy would do this?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie, still not believing his story, looked at her hands. \"Nobody told me something like that.\". Michael tried to make sense of it. \"Well, it may be that way: You as a girl can have unmanicured hands. He as a boy can't have manicured hands not as long as he is still straight.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie nodded. \"Makes sense...\". She then looked at Philipp and her old anger came back. \"Still though. I'll get you no matter what!\", she said and moved towards him, towering over him slightly. \"So don't make anything you might regret afterwards!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these words she and Michael went to their classes. Michael's walk changed slightly now that he had lost his package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp grinned. \"Don't worry Josie. I'll be careful.\", he muttered to himself and looked at his hands. He then went to his first class:</span></div></div>",

It would be horrible if I was forced to be at Melody's height.\", he thought and shruddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp looked at his hands and smiled. He was really liking them and would miss them if he were to swap them back. \"Maybe there's a way to swap something mind related that lets her want to keep these hands.\", thought Philipp. \"I doubt it's as easy as 'I want to swap how I think of my original hands with Josie'. There is the problem. Then she will like her original hands in the same way I like and then she really wants those hands.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp had not noticed that the teacher had entered the classroom so far. He was too busy thinking about how he could keep Josie's hands. \"Maybe I should get her breasts and then stop playing. That way I'll get her breasts and can keep her hands. I might lose them as friends but that's a small price to pay in my opinion.\", he continued in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Jenkins!\", shouted the english teacher at Philipp impatiently. \"I asked you a question!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Philipp did not hear any of his teacher's words, he was too busy thinking of possibilities as well as looking at his femine hands. That was until the moment an object hit him on the forehead. \"Ouch.\", cried out Philipp. The teacher had thrown a piece of chalk against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to answer my question!\", the teacher shouted angrily. \"Sorry.\", sighed Philipp. \"Would you repeat your question?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class went by without anything exciting happening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After school Philipp got out of the building as fast as possible. He knew that even though Josie was not that angry anymore, she would want to talk to him. She had a whole day to think about everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside was his mother already waiting for him. \"Hey, ready for our manicure?\", she asked smiling and stood in front of the car. Philipp was kind of happy because of the swap. He would not have thought that a small swap like swapping hands would change his relationship with his mother that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the swap he had a good relationship with his mother but they did not do anything together. He usually only saw her during breakfast, lunch or dinner. It was not like he did not want to see her, they just had nothing they were both interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow everything was different. Philipp was really looking forward to get his fingernails manicured with his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\", he smiled. \"I was looking forward to this all day.\", he said and got into the car. His mother followed him, started the engine and drove them to the beauty salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp had never seen one from the inside before. Why should he? He was a boy and didn't need his nails to be done or his hair, at last not until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mrs. Jenkins and Philipp. It's nice to see you again. Come in.\", the two were greeted and lead to some seats, were the two sat down and put their nails into some kind of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we have to wait now.\", he thought. He looked over to his mother. \"How was your day, sweetie?\", she aksed him smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er-it was nice. Classes were er... interesting.\", he said. Philipp had no idea what he should talk about. Although for his mother this was completely normal, for himself this was new. What did he talk about with her when they waited?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice to hear.\", she smiled. \"And have you talked to Debbie about your feelings?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp was confused. What did she mean with that? Did she mean Debbie Black from his biology classes? He did not have a crush on her. But there was no other Debbie he knew. Sure, she was kinda cute and everything but he did not have any real interest in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the time with my mother changed what I prefer about girls. Maybe I'm now interested in Debbie Black. I have no idea how \"girly time\" with my mother could change my preferences.\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er- No mom... I didn't.\", he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom looked at him. \"If you really like her, you should let her know.\", she said. \"But I told you already like 10 times or so.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom... I try to talk to her tomorrow...\", he said.</span></div></div>",

I don't know yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hurry up and choose something, so that I can get something that I want.\" Phillip quickly said irritably back to Melody<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might just swap lives with somebody so I can hang out with you guys over the next several days\"  Melody said while going down a last she had in her head.  \"Maybe I can swap lives with Micheal and I can be your best friend Jeremy\"  She said while winking over to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody!!  Be careful what you say!\"  Josie said almost yelling at the young teenager.  \"We don't want to have a mess up and be angry with one another over an accidental phrase being spoken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your panties in a twist.\"  Melody quickly quipped back to the older girl.  \"I mean it's not like I said 'I want to swap lives with Micheal.'  I just said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody!\"  Everyone but Phillip yelled at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" But she quickly found out that she wasn't sitting in the same spot as she was not even 10 seconds prior.  \"Crap, I really didn't mean it Micheal.  I swear I didn't\"  Melody said while trying to put out any fires that have flared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody it's fine,\"  Micheal quickly assured her.  As he was saying this he was looking for some sort of identification to futility verify that this didn't really happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you searching for, Micheal?\"  Melody wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some identification to see what the switch did.\"  He told her while still searching.  He didn't even have his wallet anymore that was in his back pocket.  After saying what he was looking for, Melody got up and walked over to her pink and purple backpack and quickly found what she was searching for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you were looking for?\"  Melody asked Micheal.  He quickly grabbed it from her and found out that the swap had taken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now Micheal Parker, age 13, grade 8, female\"  He read off of the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, Micheal is now a 13 year old girl\"  Phillip laughed at his friend's current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am now considered a girl and that means I can get in their locker room\"  Micheal said back to his friend.  \"Ouch!  What was that for?\"  After he had said the last comment, Anna quickly smacked his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not think of that.\" Phillip said as he was now thinking of what to do next.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opened up and Cindy, Micheal's former Mom, walked in and told the group.  \"Micheal, that was your Mom on the phone and it's starting to get late.  She would like you and your brother to start going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...  OK... Umm... Mrs. Ferguson.\"  He told her.  \"I, I mean, We will be heading home in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I will give her a call and let her know that you both will be heading home in a minute.\"  She said back as she was closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we have to go home brother.\"  Micheal said over to Jeremy. \"Better pack up the cards so that nothing else happens.  I will take them with me since I found them earlier and to keep you guys from playing with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe.\"  was the consensus of the group as Micheal was putting the backpack in his new pink and purple backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put on the backpack and felt the weight of the books, \"Dang Melody, do you not have a locker or anything to store your books at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some homework and a paper to write on the start of World War 2\"  Melody told him, \" Oh and before I forget to tell you.  I am going to be having a couple friends come over tomorrow night for a small get together.  You know play some games and watch a few movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal soon grimaced, \"So it's a sleepover?  Ok, if I have any questions, I will give you a call for some answers on how what to do and the names of everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not a problem.   I have a picture of the girls who will be coming over next to the mirror in my bedroom.\"  She pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty guys, I will see you guys on Sunday to switch back.  See you guys then.\"  Micheal said to the group as he headed out the door and to his friend's house.  After walking several blocks, they came across Jeremy and Melody's home.  It was a quaint light blue home with 2 cars in the drive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like both Mom and Dad are home.\"  Jeremy pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do this\"  Micheal told himself, mostly trying to psych himself up for the adventure to come.  As they opened the door, Micheal was welcomed by his new Mom for the next couple days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweety, did you have fun over at Melody's birthday?\"  Jeremy's Mom, Elizabeth, said as she looked over to the door.  \"Jeremy, it was nice of you to ask your younger sister join you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not a problem Mom,\"  Jeremy answered as they both headed toward the upstairs to venture to their rooms.  \"We already ate over there and now we are going to work on some homework\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if you need anything, just let me know\"  Jeremy's Mom answered back.  \"Oh and Micheal, you need to let me know what you want to do tomorrow for your sleepover tomorrow.  Just let me know before you go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Mom, I will do that.\"  Micheal told her as he made his way upstairs to check out his new room.</span></div></div>",

Micheal took a deep breath in as he opened up the door to his new room.  He turned the handle and opened the door to see what he was in for.  As the door creaked open he saw what looks to be a full size bed with the head up against the wall and a nightstand on both sides.  Against the far wall, Micheal saw what seemed to be a vanity with some books spread across it with some lip gloss and some other small makeup items on it.  He then made his way over to the closet, he just had to check on one thing.  He opened the door to see all of his clothes that were magically transported over from his original home.  Just then Micheal heard a light rapping on the door.  He quickly turned to see his new Mom, Elizabeth.  \"Hey baby girl\"  Micheal winced when he heard this phrase.  \"I just wanted to see if everything was ok with you.  I mean you didn't act like you usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you can say that I am just not feeling like myself tonight,\"  Micheal said with Melody's sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your friends have been busy as of late with dance classes, cheer leading, and basketball practices.  But they will be here tomorrow night and you can do your normal 13 year old girl things.  Watch some movies, play some games and tell stories.  That reminds me, what do you want to have for supper tomorrow night?\"  Elizabeth wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza sounds good.\"  Micheal quickly said to his temporary mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like a growing girl to suggest.  I remember when I was your age, I would eat almost all the time too.  But I certainly wasn't as tall as you are thought.\"  She told her tall daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Yeah Mom,\"  Micheal said as he was trying to get her to leave.  \"I am going to start on my paper now.  That way it will be done before Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything that you really want to do tomorrow?\"  Elizabeth asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, how about you choose some stuff and we can do it tomorrow night.  Mom, I really want to start the report so that I can have fun tomorrow night, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, love you baby girl.\"  She said to Micheal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too Mom.\"  Micheal quickly said back to her.  With that said, Elizabeth exited the room and Micheal continued to look around the room. 'Where is it at' he thought to himself.  Then he found it, the photo that Melody was talking about right before he had to go home for the night.  There was a photo that showed himself surrounded by 3 girls.  One was a blonde that was tall, seemed to be about 5' 4\" tall, graceful form. 'She must be the dancer that Mom was talking about' he thought to himself.  Then there was another blonde that had her hair up in a pony tail, she seemed tall too, but not as tall as the dancer, but close.  She must be the basketball player.  And that just leaves the chearleader.  She must be the one that has her hair up in pigtails and the big cheesy grin on her face. \"I guess I can get this paper done for Melody.\" He said to himself as he got his night clothes on for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow is going to be an interesting day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Michael got out of his new bed around noon and got to work on Melody's World War II paper.  Michael was more than happy to do this task for Melody not only because she was his best friend's sister, but because it provided him a nice distraction from Melody's life that he was living.  Heck if it weren't for the fact it wasn't his room he'd probably be doing something similar to this anyways.  Melody's homework also gave him a good excuse not to go shopping for clothes and sleepover party supplied with Elizabeth when she poked her head into the room.  Although he did get a little sad about it when Jeremy popped in and said he was going to go to the mall with Philip and Melody to hang out.  Michael made a move to grab his coat but Jeremy informed him with a joking smile that it was a 'guys night out' thing.  Michael chuckled kind of sadly and got back to Melody's work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess it makes sense that Melody gets to hang out with my friends since I'm going to have to have a sleepover with her friends.'  Michael thought to himself.  He texted Melody to try to get some information about the three girls, but he only got names back.  'She must be busy having fun with Jeremy and Philip.' He thought to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on Michael thought about faking an illness to get out of this when the doorbell rang and within a few seconds Elizabeth opened the door and three very excited teenage girls barged into his room.  Michael put on a smile and greeted the three girls.  Michael managed to not screw up the girls names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tallest girl was the dancer Mara.  She had short blonde hair and was thin and as flat as a board but based on her muscle tone she did not look like someone to take lightly.  The next girl was just a few inched shorter with long dirty blonde hair.  Based on the school jersey she was wearing it was easy to tell that this was the basketball player Britney, but Michael remembered from Melody's text to him that she usually just went by Brit.  And finally there was the cheerleader, she wasn't even 5 feet tall, but what she lacked in height she made up for in other departments.  Michael's eyes went a little wide when he saw her, she seemed more...developed than some of the girls in his real class.  Michael shook his head and actually looked into the red headed cheerleader who he remembered had the name Rosie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls gave the fourth masculine and uncomfortable friend a big hug upon seeing him.  Elizabeth smiled from the doorway and said, \"I'll go order your pizza, you girls go ahead and start the fun, I'll check in with you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone polity thanked your current mom and immediately started talking about what they wanted to do first.  Brit was first to propose something, \"While the sun's still out let's go play some two on two basketball in the driveway.  Me and Michael against Rose and Mara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\"  Mara said, \"I'm too tired from cheer leading practice, besides you and Michael are the strongest and best players.  You'd kill us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of the point.\"  Brit said with a cheeky smile,  Rosie took a pillow off of Michael's bed and threw it at Brit.  \"Or we could start with a pillow fight!\"  This didn't seem like a request as the three girls each armed themselves with pillows, Michael was barely able to dive for a stay one but soon found himself surrounded on all fronts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.'  Michael thought happily to himself as he did his best to push back against the pillowing hordes.  After a few minutes of fun Michael heard Mara said, \"Oh, how about we play some cards?  My dad just taught me how to play poker.\"  Michael saw in a moment of horror that Mara had picked up the cards from the purple and pink backback.  His first instinct was to shout her down and hide the cards away, but then Michael stopped to think.  Maybe the cards shouldn't just be for his group with Josie, Jeremy, and the others.  They were his cards and he could use them whenever and however he wanted.  Besides if he didn't like how things were going he would just be able to swap back whatever he wanted to eventually.</span></div></div>",

Made a song by making the worm move with all of its parts and it got to a point that we were laughing so hard at you that got us put into detention for 3 days because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally forgot about that,\" Mara quickly said as she started gagging at the thought of the worm openly displayed with it's inside being shown to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may remember it like that, but it really didn't happen.\"  Micheal told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your not a tomboy like we remember you being.\" Rose pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I am actually a 17 year old guy\"  Micheal corrected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, I actually brought nail polish and I was going to try to get you to try some on.\" Rose said somewhat despairingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we try one round to see if it is that way?\" Mara wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do one round, if you want to continue then we can can do it.  But remember, any thing we swap will stay that way for 2 full days before we can swap them back.\" Micheal told them trying to get them to step away from the cards.  But like a cat with an empty box on the ground they wanted to see more.   \"Before we continue, lets get our pajamas on so we won't get distracted later on.\"  So after a quick change everyone sat back down to begin the game.  Mara was wearing a Hello Kitty set that had white shirt with spaghetti straps and short black shorts.  This gave Micheal little to his imagination.  Rose was wearing something simple, so simple that Micheal had to look away.  She had on a pair of pink pajama pants with a white camisole top.  Then there was Brit.  She was wearing her favorite team jersey.  The Miami Heat with Andersen written on the back and it appeared that she wasn't wearing any pants.  Micheal quickly looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats wrong Micheal.\" Brit wondered as she threw a pillow at him to break his concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brit are you wearing anything underneath that jersey.\"  Micheal wondered as he blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, Micheal is embarrassed?\" Brit wondered as she sauntered her way over to Micheal and suddenly lifted up her shirt so that he could see what she was hiding underneath.  A pair of short shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness.\"  Micheal sighed in relief.  Was dressed in an old Zelda shirt with a pair of Blue Pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you are so embarrassed, Micheal.  We have P.E. together everyday and we have seen you naked.\"  Rose pointed out.  \"Even that little problem you have between your legs.  I mean, we know that you don't have any goods upstairs either, but we still love you like a good friend should.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that was said, Micheal instinctively put his hands in front of his pants.  \"Let's start the game, ladies.\" He said as he dealt out the cards and it turned out that Rose came out on top and had to choose something.  \"So since Rose won this round, She will get 2 minutes to decide on what to swap.  If she doesn't, then a random swap will occur and those can be really weird sometimes.\"  Micheal lectured the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"  Rose said back to him.  \"Micheal, can I swap with you?  Something small so that we can test it out to see if it's for real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but you have the other girls here too to test it out on.\"  Micheal pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I want to see if we can help you fit in better at school, among the girls anyway.\"  Rose told him and winked to the other girls in the process.  \"With that said,  I want to swap pajamas with Micheal\"  With a blink of an eye, Micheal was now wearing the skimpy top and pink pajama bottoms and she in turn was wearing his t shirt and pants combo.  \"OMG, I cannot believe it actually worked.  I honestly thought you were pulling our legs Micheal.  I think I am going to faint.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal quickly rushed over to her and consoled her, \"I wouldn't lie to you ladies.\"  He told the group.  After that was said, Micheal's new Mom came in and told the \"girls\" that the pizza was here and it was time to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" They all announced as she shut the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't see anything wrong with you wearing that?\"  Mara wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, as far as she is concerned, I am a tomboy that is 6 feet tall and all of my pajamas are what yours were.\"  Micheal pointed out.  With that they set out downstairs to feast on pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group of four made their way downstairs to find the pizza ready to go. Micheal saw on the counter 3 different pizzas with bread sticks and soda.  \"What do you want to bet that I can eat more than any of you girls?\"  Micheal wondered as he smiled at the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to make a bet?\" Rose wondered as she grinned over to her friend. \"How about this, we will do teams.  Mara and Micheal vs. Brit and Me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, whats the wager?\"  Micheal wondered as he looked at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Brit and I win, you have to do what we say for umm... an hour.  If you and Mara win then, I will do what you want for the next hour.  Deal?\"  Rose wondered as she held out her hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" Micheal said as he shook her hand to make the bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was long and harsh, it was tied at 11 pieces per team, but Micheal couldn't eat anymore.  Micheal's Temporary mom was amused by the whole thing as she watched closely.  Mara surprised Micheal by eating 4 pieces.  But the other team was still eating.  'How much are they going to eat?'  Micheal wondered as he could only stare at them with awe.  Then it happened, Brit finished her 6th piece.  Micheal saw this happen in what seemed to be slow motion.  After it was all done, he was kind of mad at Mara for not eating another piece.  But he was a man of his word.  \"I know when I am beat.  So what would you like me to do for the next hour.\"  Micheal wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to let us give you a makeover and try to break you of our tomboyish ways.\"  Rose announced as she quickly got up and went to her bag to grab some items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Micheal's mom heard about this, she got all excited.  \"I was hoping something like this would happen, so while I was out getting supplies, I also got some stuff to do makeovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think this whole thing was rigged'  Micheal thought as he took a seat.  He felt weird wearing the white I don't like this top, it doesn't fit right and it is starting to drive me crazy.\"  Micheal complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technically, you don't have the right equipment up there to hold it up correctly and your not used to wearing stuff like that.\"  Rose pointed out as she came back down stairs.  \"So this is how we are going to do it.  For the first part, you are going to be blind folded so that you can't see or complain.  If you complain, you get an additional 10 minutes added on, understand?\"  Micheal nodded as he had a blindfold wrapped around his head, effectively obscuring his vision.  \"How many fingers do you see?\"  Rose asked as she was just waving fingers in front of this blindfolded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, 3\"  Micheal guessed.  After he said that he heard a flurry of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\"  Rose said.  \"Alright girls, let's start.\"  As she said that he heard the timer being set on the microwave.  She then grabbed his right hand and began painting his nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder what color I am being forced to wear.'  He felt Rose going relatively fast on his hands.  Then he felt somebody working on his toes.  Micheal sighed.  After what felt like 2 minutes, he heard Rose announce \"There is the base coat.  Now I will start on the main coat.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A base coat?\" Micheal asked  \"How long am I going to wear this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you complaining\"  Brit said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just wondering.\"  Micheal answered.  After what he guessed was 15 minutes.  The blindfold came off and he nearly had his eyes bug out of his head.  On his hands, he had pink nail polish and light purple on his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanted to match your room and your new pajamas.\"  Rose said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New? She has had those for at least 3 months\"  Micheal's mom announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems new.\" Brit said trying to cover up the 'mistake'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you still have 40 minutes.\" Brit said to him.  \"Would you like to play poker for the next 40 minutes, up in your room of course, or continue the makeover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poker\"  Micheal quickly announced as the group quickly made their way upstairs after thanking Mom for the supplies for later on.</span></div></div>",

You guys just think of me as a girl when I switched lives with your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit shrugged, \"That part doesn't matter, because to us you've always been a tomboy girl with a...different body.  So just indulge us a little, you'll only have to be girly for a week before you go back to being a tomboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael rolled his eyes, he didn't have much time left and he had to swap something.  He looked at all the girls and tried to think of something minor but was drawing a blank, finally with mere seconds left he thought of something as he looked at his freshly manicured nails.  With a sly grin on his face he said, \"I want to swap makeup with Mara.\"  Instantly the makeover the girls had just spent the last 15 minutes carefully applying to Michael was instantly transported to Mara.  Michael looked at his plain nails and smiled.  Although he could taste a little bit of clear lip gloss on his lips but that seemed to be all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara said, \"Hey, that's cheating!\"  But her laughter showed she wasn't taking it hard.  The girls and Michael all laughed at Michael's little plot to undo his makeover but Mara quickly pointed out a flaw in Michael's logic, \"That's fine, I'll keep the makeover work for tonight, but until we switch back you're going to have to wear my makeup to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael smiled faltered a little, he hadn't thought of that.  Brit grabbed the cards and shuffled them up, \"Well this just means we'll have to take more drastic steps for Michael's makeover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie giggled, \"Yeah, there's three of us and one of you, you can't keep winning and handpicking your swaps forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't blame a guy for trying.\"  Michael said as he looked at his next hand and hoped for the best.</span></div></div>",

I want to swap breast sizes with Michael.\"  Michael didn't know what would happen since he didn't have breasts.  But he felt a pressure on both sides of his chest and within a few seconds he had a perfect pair of female breasts on his chest.

It doesn't matter what we did to help you, it just stayed the same.\" Brit said with her eyes tearing up.  \"We tried to help you out by trying to get you to join some sports, but that didn't work out.

Mara ran her hands through her short hair and continued, \"It'll be nice not to have to spend so much time taking care of it, besides it'd always get in the way when I danced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie jumped in, \"Plus it'll give those jerks at school one less thing to make fun of you for Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Micahel, you're looking really pretty...not that you weren't before!\"  Brit said quickly amending her statement.

Then next week he'd swap everything back and everyone would be all the better for it.  It would a little embarrassing in the short term but it'd probably be worth it in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a renewed passion for the game Michael made a show of whipping his now long hair behind his shoulder to the great amusement of the girls and then grabbed the cards to deal out the next hand.</span></div></div>",

Mara looked between the two of you and said, \"Well, did it work?\"  You shrugged and walked over to Melody's dresser.  You figured with your old strength you'd be able to lift it a few inches off the ground fairly easily but when you tried now you were barely able to lift it an inch.  \"Let me try.\"  Brit said as she pushed you a little harshly out of the way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michael's heart was in his throat while the hand was being played.  He just had to beat Rosie, he really didn't want to play cheerleader or rather be the cheerleader.  He looked down at his cards and felt a glimmer of hope.  He could actually win this one with 3 queens.  \"You know what Brit.\" Michael started to say. \"You are going to have a hard time beating this 3 of a kind.\"  He then laid down his cards and showed them to the girls.  \"I might as well start to think what I am going to...\"  Just then, Brit lay down her hand as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be the case if... I didn't have 2 kings.\"  Brit said interrupting Michael.  Michael saw this and his world just seemed to shatter.  He knew he would regret showing the cards to the girls and now he was going to pay for it.  \"I already know what I want to swap.\" She said with a huge smile on her face and what looked like a glimmer in her eye.  \"I want to swap after school activities with Michael.\"  She looked over at him and asked, \"Do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, how do we tell if it worked or not.\"  Michael wondered as he looked over at the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should check the closet, I know that's where I store all of my gear.\"  Rosie started to say as she got up from her seat and made her way over to the closet.  She then opened the door and Michael could see a smirk starting to form on her face.  \"I found it.\"  She said as she leaned down and pulled out a blue and white duffle bag.  The bag itself wasn't at a intimidating, what was however were the contents inside.  Rosie opened the bag and started to pull out some of the items inside, while doing that, she started to explain the purpose of each item.  \"First, this is the top or shell of the uniform\"  She said as she pulled out a blue and white top which looked like it would fit Michael then she pulled out the item that Michael dreaded the most and grimaced when he saw it.  \"Here is the skirt, as you can see it's blue and white, just like the High School's.  What's wrong Micheal?  Don't you like it?\"  She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I don't.  I have never wore one before and I was hoping to get away with not having to wear one.\"  Michael said \"And besides, I don't know your plays or patterns, whatever you call it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drills, they are called drills and besides we are just a couple plays away from knowing the routines and I am sure we can make you comfortable in any skirt.\"  Rosie said to her friend.  \"You know what, are you sure you just want to do this for a week and not a little longer?  We have a big game against Bryant in 2 weeks and I think you would do really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Michael, I would love to have you there cheering me on for that game, you know we haven't beaten them for the past 4 years and they still have our school flag.  I really want to beat them that way we can hold their flag for a change.\"  Brit pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we play it by ear for right now.  Besides, I think a week will be plenty of time.\"  Michael said feeling uncomfortable as Mara started to deal out the next hand.</span></div></div>",

Mara seemed particularly disappointed, \"Darn, I thought my 3 of a kind had it.\"  Michael thought about his current situation.  The reason he was still doing this was because he wanted to help make sure when he swapped back with Melody in a week she'd be popular, or at least not bullied.  Looking down at his breasts, long hair, and cheerleader uniform that Rosie had laid before him among the other changes and decided that he'd probably done enough so he could feel good about playing it safe before the game came to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap eye color with Brit.\"  This was met with some disappointment.  Michael simply shrugged, put on the charm, and smiled at Brit as he explained, \"I'm sorry, I just thought you had pretty eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit blushed a little and said, \"Oh, that's fine, not everything has to be a big change,\" as she looked at Michael with a smile.  But the smile on both of their faces faltered at a realization, they both pointed at each other and said at the same time, \"We didn't swap eye color!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie looked at them both and said, \"You're right, but how is that possible?  Michael easily made the swap in the time limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"  Michael said in a panic as he thought about what could be wrong, surly the cards didn't stop working or something.  That would be a nightmare.  Michael looked down at the cards from the last hand after a minute realized what was wrong.  \"I didn't win last time!\"  Michael said, \"Mara, you didn't have 3 of a kind, you had a full house.  You won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara's gasped a little, \"I what?  Oh no, um...I can't think of what to swap!  Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say something.\"  Michael, Brit, and Rosie all said it at the same time, but this didn't help calm down Mara at all.  She just froze.  She stammered, \"Um, I want to swap with Michael.  I want to swap...I want to swap...\"  Suddenly she stopped.  \"What is it, what's wrong?\"  Brit asked.  But Michael answered the question for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't swap in time, so she ended up swapping randomly, and it was with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you swap?\"  Rosie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael pulled at the neckline of his videogame t-shirt to reveal a Hello Kitty themed bra, \"We swapped underwear, it could have been a whole lot worse.\"  Everyone sighed at this revelation, but then everyone had a bit of a laugh in relief.  \"It's actually for a good thing for you to get some support now that you've finally developed up top.  But I still don't get why you wear boxers instead of panties.  I feel ridiculous.\"  Mara said as she referenced what she was wearing now.  Everyone looked Mara and burst out laughing.  You could clearly see the blue boxers what were bigger than the black short shorts she had on over them making a ridiculous look.  Michael laughed so hard he forgot the uncomfortable tightness that he now had down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter seemed to have gotten the attention of Michael's 'mom' Elizabeth who knocked on the door, \"Girls, just checking in with you before I head to bed.  Everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael smiled as he responded, \"Yeah, everything's good.\"  As he picked up the cards.</span></div></div>",

Please!  Lets play 4 or 5 more rounds and then we can call it a night.  I mean there are so many more things that we want to try out and give you a chance to see what it's like to not be a tomboy.\"  Rosie said with a pleading look in her eye and giving her best puppy dog look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright.  Man, I really need to learn to say no, especially to you, Rosie.\"  Micheal said as he nudged Rosie without even making her budge an inch. This really made Michael feel insecure with everything that has happened so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie saw this and then asked, \"Is everything alright Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just that this is starting to become too much.\"  Michael admitted. \"I mean... I...\"  He then sighed and took in a deep breath.  \"I don't know what to do, I have breasts, underwear, hair, height, and pajamas of a 12 year old girl.  I now a middle school cheerleader too.\"  Michael started to tear up a little bit. \"I mean, what am I going to do?\"  The girls were a little taken aback by what they just witnessed.  They thought that he was okay with this whole thing.  They all rushed toward him to comfort their sobbing friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this, we do 5 more rounds and in these rounds we all help you in this new life.\"  Brit said trying to comfort her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not what Michael wanted to hear, but if it made him feel better about the situation, then he will do it. \"If it will make me feel better about this, I will do it.  I am in your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her girls, we need to help her in the skin she is in.\"  Rosie said to the girls. \"If we help you, then you need to go with us to the mall tomorrow and hang out, deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was a little taken aback by the whole turn of events, he then looked to the group of girls and nodded.  \"Deal as long as you help Mel.. me with this whole thing.\" 'I still need to talk to Melody about what is going on.  I know she won't believe me about the swaps, so I just hope she will go along with it.'

And as Michael looked at the outfit he suddenly knew what it felt like to move around in it doing all of the choreographed movements with the other cheerleaders.  Rosie said, \"Woah, that was weird, one second I knew so much from cheerleading since from when I was a little girl and now, poof.  All I know now is that they look pretty doing the cheers during football games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And basketball games, don't forget those.\"  Brit added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I totally forgot about that.  Man this is weird.\"  Rosie said getting the cards ready for the next hand.  Michael meanwhile was a little lost in thought.  Suddenly his mind was flooding with all the minutia of cheerleading that he never knew about, and it was weird, he knew he had never been a cheerleader before two hands ago but he knew all the routines he would know as if he'd done it since he was a little kid.  \"This is super weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not weird it's cool, and it'll probably get cooler.

He got to his legs and felt ashamed.  \"I really need to get these legs taken cared of.\"  He then paused for a few seconds and followed up with.  \"Why did I just say that and why would I care of what others think of me?\" He then thought for a minute. 'Well if I don't have smooth legs then boys won't talk to me and I will be a loner.  If I am a loner, then my grades will fall, if my grades fall then I can't get into a good school.  No good school means I will have a dead end job.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this, if you go along with the 2 final swaps.

Michael seemed to not even seem to be paying attention to the game, he was just lost in thought and actually seemed really nervous.  Rosie worried about her friend asked, \"What's wrong Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at Melody's friend and said, \"It's all just so stupid, I don't know why I care about the things I care about now with the cheerleading and caring about what a bunch of 13 year olds think of me but I do and I can't do anything about it.  It feels like all I can think about is cheering at Brit's game this week and I'm going to make a fool of myself.  I know the routines but I'll look like a fool in the outfit, I don't know if I'm strong enough to do it all, and I can barely kick my legs out and it's all just stupid.\"  Michael couldn't believe it, he actually was starting to get tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls gave Michael a group hug to try and make him feel better.  Mara actually seemed to be crying as much as Michael, \"I'm so sorry, I had no idea my insecurities would mix so badly with all the changes.  It's all my fault you feel bad, I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's okay, I'm a big boy I'll get over it.\"  Michael said wiping the tears from his eyes.  But this scene seemed to make Rosie change her mind with her change.  She had a plan in mind, but at least for this hand she felt she had to put it on hold to do just a silly little thing to make Michael feel better and maybe a little more confident.  \"If you're still nervous about cheerleading don't be, I'll give you one of the last tools you need, I want to swap flexibility with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked a bit confused at this swap.  Rosie smiled at Michael and said, \"Let's see if it worked,\"  She then bent over and actually stopped before she could even reach her toes.  \"Wow Michael I didn't know it was this bad, after everything gets swapped back you have to promise me you'll try out yoga or something.\"  Rosie stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll try.\"  Michael bent down and much to his surprise before he even knew it his breasts were pressed against he knees and his head was between his legs.  He wasn't sure why but the fact that he could do this just tickled him.  He and the girls laughed as Michael then went the other way and bent all the way back so that he crab walked with ease around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit was the first to speak after Michael's little show, \"There now, do you feel better Michael.\"  Michael wiped a tear of laughter from his eyes, \"Yeah, I actually do, thanks for that one Rosie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are friends for, but don't forget, we still have one more hand to play.\"  Rosie said as she dealt out the last hand.  Michael took his cards and also a piece of paper so that he could make sure he got on paper all the changes that happened tonight after this one was done.</span></div></div>",

Michael didn't love this development but it was relatively simple compared to the potential complicated magic card related problems that could come up if he switched friends with Rosie.

A male boy who just swapped with your friend in another poker game temporarily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Michael had told the girls this multiple times throughout the evening, it was like the words broke through the magic and the girl's eyes went wide.

Oh...um, thanks for being such a good sport I guess.\"  Brit was beginning to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie was looking down her pink pajama pants and was turning the deepest shade of red Michael had ever seen, \"So that means this is really a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit seemed in awe, \"Wow, can I see?\"  And without asking she and Mara inched closer to Rosie.  Michael blurted out, \"Hey!  A little privacy and respect please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie quickly looked up and prevented the other girls from looking, \"Sorry about that.  I've just never really seen one before...\"  Michael laughed, \"It's okay, just don't respect it and don't go flashing it to everyone please.\"  With this the three girls started whispering to each other.

I just need to find the right underwear.  He then saw a nice pair of Hello Kitty underwear that seemed comfy, he grabbed them and hopped in the shower.  He found that his soap and shampoo had changed to a more flowery version.  He rushed through the shower and made sure not to miss anything.  His body was flying on auto pilot thanks to Mara's routines.  After about 20 minutes, he stepped out of the bathroom to get dressed only to see the girls up and ready to go.  \"Where are we going?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to go to the mall.\"  Rosie said as she looked at him until she got embarrassed and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you.\" Micheal wondered as he looked down to see that he wasn't in anything but a bra and panties. \"Oh, sorry, let me look for something to wear.\"  Soon he was dressed in a pair of jeans and a tshirt. \"There that should be better, I am glad that my clothes got resized to fit me better.  Are you girls ready to go?\"  He said as he grabbed his stuff and made his way downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie was confused on what was exactly going on.  She looked over at Micheal to see him in Mara's Underwear and she felt her new organ stir. \"Wow Michael you knew how to put on the makeup, huh, and you did a great job.\"  She said over to Micheal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks, to Mara, it came easily and worry it took too long, My body was on autopilot and I started to shave.  I just had too much stuff and it took too long.\"  Micheal said to the group of girls.  \"So what are we going to do at the mall anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got some money from my mom and she said for me to treat the girls to a fun day.  A way of saying thanks for being my friend.\"  Brit said as she took out her mom's card. \"All I have to do is keep the receipts.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all piled into Micheal's mom's minivan and Rosie asked Micheal. \"So are you technically old enough to drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't have a car yet, but I am working on it.\"  Micheal said. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering how old you really are because it's weird to think of you as a guy when you have been our friend for years.\"  Rosie started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a 17 year old guy with a girl friend and a junior in High school.\"  He said to her. \"But now I am a 13 year old girl who is in the 8th grade.\" He shrugged \"for the next week, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to make sure that you have fun this next week. We promise.\" Rosie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it they were at the mall and Micheal's mom dropped them off and told them that she would be back around 3 pm.  She then gave Micheal some money so that he wouldn't have to be dependent on anyone else.  \"So where do we go first?\" Micheal wondered as they made their way inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Michael asked what they would be doing all the girls smiled and turned to each other.  \"What are you three planning?\"  Michael asked a little worried.  Mara was the one to step up and answer, \"Well, we know and understand that you are a guy, but you're supposed to be a girl now but you missed one of the big parts of becoming a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already grew the breasts, although it only took a few seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're close,\"  Mara said, \"We thought that we'd help you go shopping for a bra.\"  All the girls giggled at the look on Michael's face.  \"I don't think I really need one, the one's I got from Mara during the poker game are plenty enough for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Michael, you're a girl now, and every girl needs to buy her first bra of her very own.\"  Rosie said.  Brit patted Michael a little too strongly on the shoulder and added, \"Come on, it'll be fun.\"  Michael realized the girls weren't going to be talked out of this so he went along with it.  \"Fine, fine, whatever.  Lead the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter that Michael wasn't enthusiastic, the girls more than made up for it with their glee.  They took Michael to a store in the mall that Michael had always been to nervous to even look at for a second out of fear of being thought of as a pervert.  But that was when he was a guy, now Michael could walk in with his head held high as a customer of fine undergarments.  The first thing Michael thought was that this was the pinkest store he'd ever seen in his life, second he wondered why it seemed like every single wall was plastered with beautiful models showing off the latest fashions in lingerie.  Even though he knew it was okay to be here Michael couldn't help but blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very happy and helpful saleswoman approached and asked what they were looking for, and Rosie (being an expert in the breasts they were getting fitted) told her the exact bra size they were looking for.  Michael just looked at the ground while blushing as the girls giggled at his embarrassment.  He could have sworn he heard Mara whisper that it was 'cute'.  A minute later the saleswoman was back with a number of different colored and styled bras for Michael's perusal.  And just his luck the girls insisted he try on and show them every single one of them as they practically pushed Michael into the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was the worst.  Now that he was out of Mara's daily routine he didn't really understand the finer points of bra wearing and removal.  It took an embarrassingly long time but Michael removed the hello kitty bra and replaced it with a yellow one.  He poked his head out of the dressing room to make sure that only the girls were there, \"Come on Michael, even if other people were here it would only be other girls.  You know, like you.\"  Rosie said sticking out her tongue.  Michael did step out to show off the bra, the girls were happy but they wanted to see more options.  He went back in and tried on them all, he figured he had tried on about 20 in a variety materials, brands, and styles not the Michael could really tell the difference outside of color.  Michael actually started to get into it a little bit walking down an imaginary catwalk and even embarrassing Rosie when he notice her new groin seemed to be enjoying the show too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael thought he was done after he tried them all on, but even after that the girls still insisted he had to buy at least one.  Michael shrugged and decided on a black one that he enjoyed imagining his girlfriend Josie wearing.  After they walked out of the store with his purchase in a bag Michael said, \"It's not that I'll get to keep it, it's going back to Mara once we swap everything back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, you've got to keep your first bra as a souvenir.\"  Mara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the gesture, I'll promise I'll always remember this experience nicely.  But I really can't keep this.  I don't want to have to explain to my mom why I have this.  Or worse, explain it to my girlfriend why I have a bra of my own.\"  Everyone got a good laugh out of that as they moved onto the next store.</span></div></div>",

I mean it's normal for a girl to get them done before the age of 5 sometimes not until 10, but in your case, it's going to be at 13.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that.\"  Michael said as he was starting to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Michael, you said that you would trust us if we helped you last night.\" Rosie said as she and Brit caught him before he got too far away. \"Besides, it won't hurt... much.\"  She said this with a huge grin on her face, much like the wolf from the Little Red Riding Hood.  She the wolf and Michael the little girl.  She wanted Micheal to do this and for him to do it she would have to play him a little bit. \"You know Michael, if you don't do this, the people at school will think of you as a little girl.  A little girl whose mom doesn't trust her enough to get her ears done.\"  She then saw his face start to grow slightly white, it was the fear of acceptance.  The insecurity of what others thought of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think... think that they will think that?\"  Michael stammered as the scenarios were being played out in his head.  The ostracization for what he believed people thought that he couldn't handle it. \"I will do it...  No I need to do it... I need to fit in.\"  This absolutely pleased Rosie.  She knew how to get him to do what she wanted.  This may be the cheerleader in her, or perhaps, it was because she was an older sister to 2 other sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are\"  Brit announced as the group walked up to a store that Michael only thought was for girls, it was a store of absolute pink.  There was an occasional purple or green, but mainly pink.  Michael looked up to the sign to see 'Edith's - A Store of Young Ladies'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to do that here?  I mean is it sanitary?\"  Michael wondered to the group of girls who were giggling as the walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which ones should we get?\"  Rosie said as she started going through the earrings that they had on display.  \"Since Mara helped out with the bra, Brit and I are going to help you with this.\"  The two girls looked around and found a pair of earrings each.  Rosie had a pair of pink butterfly earrings Brit had a pair of Hello Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I get to pick a pair and have them in my ears, right?\"  Micheal wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no, my sweet Michael.\"  Rosie said to her confused friend. \"You are getting both.\"  This came to an absolute shock to Michael and Rosie saw this.  \"Almost all the girls have at least 2 sets in their ears.  You don't want them to talk about you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I guess not.\"  Michael answered back <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you ladies?\"  A young lady walked up to the group of girls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, our friend here needs to have her ears pierced and we would like to get these for her.\"  Brit said as they showed the 2 pairs of earrings to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, let me gather up the stuff I need and I will meet you over at that chair.\"  She said as she pointed to a pink chair in the corner with some drawers next to it.  They did as the lady requested and within 2 minutes she arrived at the rendezvous point and she began her work.  Michael sat down and she had the first earring and got it lined up in his left ear and *Click* there was a slight pinch and then nothing.  Over the next 5 minutes, there were 3 more *Clicks* as the final 3 were put in his ears.  \"There how do they look?\"  She asked as she handed over a handheld mirror and showed her handiwork to Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in the mirror and saw that the bottom set had the butterflies and the top pair were the Hello Kitty.  \"They look great.\"  Michael said as he felt his self esteem grow slightly.  The attendant then gave them the care kit and then told him what to do to care for his new piercings.  \"That wasn't too bad\"  Michael said as they were leaving the store.  \"You know Rosie, I think you were playing me to get me to do this, am I wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I knew you would chicken out if I didn't push you a little bit.\" Rosie said laughing at her friend.  \"Well, it was Brit who was doing the pushing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laughed and then Michael asked, \"So I am stuck with these for the next 6 to 8 weeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you can always stay in that this life for that time so that nobody would think of anything different and plus we can have more fun together, perhaps try out dancing or even Basketball, like you are currently about to try out Cheerleading.\"  Brit suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe, lets play it by ear for right now and I still have to talk to the owner of this life and see if she would be okay with it.\"  Michael suggested as they made their way through the mall.</span></div></div>",

Then he saw it, the store that he loved the most and it symbolized his culture.  The culture that best symbolized him.  \"I know where I want to go and show you girls something about guys.\"  He said as he pulled, or at least attempted to pull, the three of them over to \"Game Guard\".  He looked in the window and saw shelves full of games with special standouts for the upcoming games that you can special order.  He walked in the door and felt like a kid in a candy shop.  \"What do you girls think?\"  Michael asked the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing in here,\"  Mara wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you girls showed me ropes of being a girl, now I want to show you what it's like to be me.\"  Michael replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm with Mara on this one, I don't think this is any fun.\"  Brit said as she was walking through the store with her friends. \"I mean, there isn't a girl who works here, actually, does anybody work here?\" She asked as she looked around the store<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you ladies?\"  a voice said from behind the counter.  The group looked to where the voice came from and saw a smiling female who looked about 17 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Josie?\"  Michael said enthusiastically, \"When did you start working here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, about 2 weeks ago.  I mainly do it on the weekends or when somebody doesn't want to work.\"  She shrugged as she came over to Michael to give him a hug. The other girls just looked at her and wondered who she was exactly.  \"Who are they?\"  Josie wondered as she motioned over to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie, I would like to introduce you to Melody's friends.  Mara, Britney, and Rosie this is my girlfriend, Josie.\"  Michael said as he pointed out each person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, do they know about the you know what?\"  Josie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they know about the cards.\"  Michael said back to her a little louder than a whisper so that the girls can hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can't you see that he looks different?\"  Brit wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he looks the same to me. Short, long hair, breasts, and makeup.\"  Josie said. \"Wait... you played with them didn't you?\"  Michael and the girls nodded at the same time and Michael went into the story of how it started ad what was swapped and with who.  Josie looked at Michael's current features and imagined them on the girls he mentioned.  \"But your still cute as a little 13 year old girl.\"  She said to him as she kissed him on the forehead. \"So how long are you going to be like this for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6 to 8 weeks.\"  Mara said as she smiled and nudged the other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Michael, you're in for the long haul aren't you?\" Josie said with smile and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie, I need you to file these games, please.\"  An older gentleman said, 'He must be the manager,' Michael thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I will be back there in a minute.  I have to go, I will call you later on Melody's cell phone.\"  Josie told him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess we will leave you to work as I go talk to my new friends.\" He said mocking anger.  They other girls heard this and started laughing as the left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Michael?\" Rosie said while she was laughing. \"Did you lose your cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6 to 8 weeks, really?\"  Michael said to them. \"I thought we agreed to 1 week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but the girls and I were thinking, that you could try a lot of other stuff too.  Like basketball or dance, you know stuff like that.  And if anything, you could swap lives with us so that you can still hang out with us.\"  Mara was saying to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that, when all I really have to do is swap friends with Melody or somebody and we can still be friends.\"  Michael said without really thinking about what he was saying and just kept walking forward as the girls stopped and looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't I think of that?\"  Mara said with a devious smile on her face.  \"Are you girls thinking of what I'm thinking?\"  The other 2 girls nodded as they thought of what to do next before the week is over.</span></div></div>",

They weren't in any of his classes and he had to wait until lunch to see them again.  \"I am glad to see you 3.  It's been the most boring day.\"  Michael started to say to them as they all sat down for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean boring?\"  Mara wondered \"you have all the interesting classes in the morning.  Algebra, History, and Geography, did I miss anything?\"  She said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Gym... you forgot gym.\"  Michael said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\"  Brit said with a smile on her face. \"You still think like a teenage boy.

We don't get to see you except for lunch and Biology.\"  Rosie said as she pat the seat for Michael to sit down again.  \"Besides, we need to talk to you about something.  You know yesterday when you were talking about swapping friends with this Melody person to stay friends with us.  Would that be something that you would do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was taken aback and didn't know how to respond.  \"I think I can do that,\"  The girls eyes got really big with excitement. \"IF!  I get swapped back in my original life and we don't get swapped back before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe\" Mara cooed, \"You mean you don't want to stay in my underwear forever?\"  The girls lost it and were rolling in the aisles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, Mara.\"  Michael laughed, \"I need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********** skip to after school ************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was still bored even though he had Biology with the girls.  Today they were prepping for the upcoming assignment about dissecting a frog and had to choose the groups, naturally, it was Michael and the 3 girls.  Michael was looking forward to that later on this week.  But now he had Cheerleading practice to deal with.  He knew all the cheers, drills, and was also flexible enough to do it, but he had a fear that he would mess up.  \"I hate having these insecurities.\"  He said to himself as he opened the doors to the gym to see 5 other girls that were on the cheerleading team, they were starting to warm up and stretch.  Michael was already in his gear and so he went to join them.  He was finding it easy to stretch and decided to try something that he knew he could do, but didn't want to try it.  He started running and did 3 forward flips and landed on his feet again.  \"I think I can get used to this\"  he said to himself without even getting out of breath. </span></div></div>",

After she arrived home, she went straight up to her room and did her homework.  After she was done with her homework, she had nothing to do.  Then she had a good idea, she quickly grabbed her phone and texted Mara and Brit to see if they wanted to come over. Of course, she had to remember if they had practices to get to, but then remembered that Mara has practice Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday and Brit has Practices on Tuesday, Wednesday, with a game on Thursday.  While she waited for her friends to come over, she decided to check out some of her... well... new assets.  She made her way to the door and locked it to make sure that she wouldn't be disturbed.  At first she was kind of afraid to do anything and then she started to think of Michael and his visit to the lingerie store.  How he sauntered his way out of the changing room with his C cups in the red and black bra and then it it happened. \"Oh my goodness,\" She said as she felt it stir in her panties. *Knock knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosie, are you okay in there?\"  came a voice from behind the door.  \"Your friends are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mom\" Rosie said as she unlocked the door and let them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing in here, Rosie?\"  Her mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I had to change and you know how it is.  Being self conscious and... stuff\"  Rosie said trying to get it out something that didn't seem perverted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sweetie. I better go check on your sister and make sure that they are doing their homework.\"  She said as she turned around and headed back downstairs to check on her other 2 daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie was embarrassed, she didn't think that her friends would get here so soon.  Just thinking about Michael with her breasts... She started to blush and stir again, just then she was brought out of her reverie by Brit talking to her. \"Soooo... did we interrupt something?\" She said with a smile on her face.  \"I think I want to try it out, at least once and are you blushing?  I don't think I've ever seen you blush before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I mean...\"  She couldn't choose her words. 'So this is how boys are, now I won't give them such a hard time when they stare at my chest.' she thought to herself.  \"Yeah, you definitely need to try it at least for a little while.  Well, anyway, do you girls want to do anything special or perhaps talk about what we are going to do about our dear Michael.  Does anyone have any ideas?\"  She asked the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all we really have to do is swap friends with him to get him to stay with us.  But, if we do that he won't go to the same school as us anymore.  And if we swap lives with him, then we have another problem. He will go to our school, but one of us won't go to the school.  So any ideas?\"  Brit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mara started it up again. \"Well, how about we go to the game that he originally played with his friends and that way he can get back in his life and we will still remember being friends with him.  So that way, we won't feel AS awkward being with him and everything.  We can tell him that we won't swap back with him unless he agrees to these conditions.\"  The girls heard this and they were shocked by the revelation that came out of Mara's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it. We can even get his girlfriend in on it too, I mean, did you see her?\"  Brit said somewhat embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we can get her in on it too and see if can join us, that way we can all have fun with Michael.\" Rosie added as the group began to plot how to get this plan into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****Meanwhile****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael just got done with cheerleading practice.  He had to admit that he actually had a fun time.  He didn't know if it was the knowledge he got from Rosie or what, but he was actually looking forward to the game on Thursday.  When he got back home, he quickly got his cellphone out, well, it was Melody's cell phone and dialed Josie's number.  \"Hello\" Josie answered as she answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's Michael.\" He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, sorry I forgot to call you yesterday, I got caught up with work and I had to do homework after I got done.\"  She said trying to assure you that she didn't really want to avoid him.  \"So your friends seem to be having fun with you, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm starting to like trying out new things,\"  Michael started. \"You never know what your going to learn and experience.  Honestly, I am liking these cards,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to talk for the next 15 minutes on how their lives (or the lives they were currently living) were going and what they hope to do later on.</span></div></div>",

They made their way to lunch to meet up with Michael and already saw him sitting in their normal spot already eating and looks like studying for an upcoming test.  \"Hey Michael, what are you studying?\"  Mara wondered as she tried to look at the front of the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey guys.\" Michael replied back as he showed them the front of the book he was reading. \"I have a test in Spanish and I was brushing up on it so that I can get a decent grade.  So what are you guys up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I was just wondering how your first practice as a cheerleader was?\"  Rosie wondered as she sat down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had to sit and choose his words wisely, \"Actually, I did.  I didn't know that I could do all the flips and everything else.\"  He decided to tell her the truth, he had nothing to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would like that.  That's one of the reasons why I gave you my flexibility and trust me I want it back.\" Rosie told him laughing.  \"It's killing me not being able to touch my toes without having to feel like I am going to break my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet.\"  Michael said as he closed his book so he could finish his conversation with his friends. \"Are you girls busy tonight?, I don't have practice tonight and I don't want to just sit at home not doing anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mara and I have practice tonight, so we won't be able to do anything, but if I remember correctly, Rosie will be at home too.\" Brit said while chewing at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Brit, try chewing your food.\"  Michael said with amazement as he watched her put away her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, ever since I got your height, I've been putting away food like crazy.\"  Brit said not the slightly bit embarrassed the way she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have picked up my metabolism too.  I haven't been able to eat as much as I usually do.\"  Michael replied back to the tall girl who was scarfing down the food. \"Well, Rosie, since everyone else has stuff to do, how about we catch a movie or something tonight, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can do that, I don't have anything else to do, so it only seems right that we do something together.\"  Rosie said to him as she finished up her food. \"I will see you around 6 then?\"  She said as she got up to put her trash in the can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Michael, I got a new number and I wanted to put it in your phone, will that be ok?\"  Mara said as she reached into his backpack to pull out his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you can, I mean, your already doing it anyway.\"  He said laughing. \"So Brit are you ready for the game on Thursday?  I mean, it is a big game, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, the big game isn't until next week.  But this week is looking to be a win.\"  Brit said as she stopped shoveling food in her mouth for a minute. \"I think the real question here is are you ready to cheer us on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at her blushing, \"Why are you ready to see me in a skirt?\"  He countered back. Brit stopped for a minute and blushed.  \"That's it isn't it, I can't believe I made you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go all updated and ready to go.\"  Mara said as she put back the cell phone in his backpack. \"Well, I need to go and get ready for class.\"  With that she got up and walked away while texting somebody on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**** Meanwhile across town ****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie got a text on her phone.  Since she was on lunch, she was able to check on it.  'Hmm... I don't know this number.  I wonder what it says'  She opened it up and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Josie, this is Mara.  I met you on Sunday with Michael.  We were wanting to play a game with him with the cards. If you can text back if you would like to join us and we will tell you our plan.**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I am always up to playing with Michael, that's what makes our relationship strong.'

She was glad that she was a good sport about the whole thing and Mara was happy about it.  She then let everyone know of what was going on and how they were going to proceed with everything.  \"So, Josie is going to talk to this Melody person, who apparently is our real friend, to let her know of what is going on, so that she can help us with him too. But I told her that the main thing that will happen is the whole friends thing.\"  Mara said to the group of girls as they were waiting for Michael and his mom to come and pick them up for the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when are we going to get together?\"  Brit wondered as she was looking down the road to ensue that their ride wasn't coming.  She was starting to feel the confidence that came with the height as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I remember correctly, it's going to be on Friday night, we were invited by Melody to come by her house.\" Mara told the group as the car they were waiting for pulled up in the driveway. Michael got out of the passenger seat.  Mara looked over to him to see that he was already dressed in the uniform of their school's cheerleader.  \"Awe, you look so cute.  But, we still have to do something with your hair.  If you leave it down like that, then it's going to get all in your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will help do it while he sits in the backseat with me and you.  Brit since your the taller one, you can sit up front .\"  Rosie said as they got in their seats for the ride to the gym where the game was going to be held.  During the ride, Rosie took the 2 hair ties that were holding her hair up and helped Michael with his hair.  \"There all done.\"  She announced as she backed away from him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I look now?\"  Michael asked the group of girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better,\"  Mara announced as they pulled into the parking lot of the gym.  As Michael got out of the van, he looked into the mirror to see that he now had his hair up in pig tails.  \"Well let go inside and get this game on the road.\"  With that they went inside, as Michael's mom went back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**** Towards the end of the game ****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now the 4th quarter, the game was kind of one sided, much tanks to Brit's new found height and strength.  She completely dominated the game and scored 75% of their team's points. Michael was on the sidelines doing his best and cheering his little heart out like Rosie would.  He seemed really enthusiastic and knew all the cheers, just like Rosie would.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had a small break during the cheering and he looked up in the stands to see his friends, 'There's Mara, Rosie, and....  Wait Josie?  What was she doing here?'  Micheal wondered, 'I will have to talk to her once the game is over in 2 minutes.'  Brit was able to score 3 more 3-pointers to bring the ending score to 107 to 33.  Finally the last 2 minutes passed and the team celebrated  their victory and congratulated Brit for the good game that she played.  Finally Michael was allowed to see everyone that were in the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you cute,\" Josie said as she walked out of the stands toward Michael.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoyed it.\" Michael said to her as they made their way toward the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I volunteered to take you guys home\"  Josie said to them \"that way Mrs. Parker can rest and not worry about it.  So I bet your ready for tomorrow night, right Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, I will be happy to get back in my old life again.  I mean no offense girls, but I will be happy living my own life again.\"  Michael said to the girls almost apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's alright, I know your ready to go back to High School and driving and stuff.\"  Mara said to him, \"But, just letting you know that we will be there too.  Melody and Josie invited us over so that we can play too.\"  Michael was taken aback and didn't know what to think. \"And we are going to switch back with you on Saturday.  That way it will be exactly a week since we switched.  Don't worry you will get your traits back, sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laughed at this and Josie drove them home.</span></div></div>",

He had to admit that he really enjoyed his break from his real life and actually had fun while this past week too.  As he walked up to his original house with the girls he called his friends over the last week, Michael couldn't help but feel nervous.  He didn't know if it was because of he had the insecurities of a 13 year old girl or it was because he was showing back up to his house with a group of 13 year old girls too.  \"So what's the plan tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are going to swap back your life and we are here too, so that we can offer, uh, support and so that we won't forget about you.  I mean, we kinda want our stuff back and I am sure you will want yours.\"  Rosie said as they walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom and Dad went out on a date tonight, so we have until 10 or 11.  Anna went on a date too, so it will just be us tonight. Lets go upstairs and start playing.\"  Melody said as they made their way upstairs.

We just wanted to make sure that you got all your stuff back with out any 'interruptions'.\"  Josie said making sure that she emphasized the last part. \"Actually, we didn't invite perv because I didn't want to scare the girls over there and Jeremy is the one keeping Philip busy so that we can play.  So how about we get this show on the road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please. So are we just playing one game to get my life back?\"  Michael asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was the plan, just one game and that way we can have fun.\"  Josie said with a wink, then she leaned in closer to whisper in Michael's ear. \"Then we can have some fun later on.  I know about your changes down below, even though that''s how I remember you being\"  She whispered with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael why are you blushing?\"  Melody asked as she began to deal out the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing really.  I was wondering, can I get my voice back too tonight?\"  Michael wondered as he began to look at his cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can do that we will play 3 or 4 rounds or until you get your life and voice back.\"  Melody agreed as she looked at her cards too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so who won this round?\"  Brit wondered as she laid down her pair of 2s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I won this one.\"  Melody said as she laid down 3 of a kind of Jacks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEveryone agreed as they showed their hands and it turn out that she did in fact win this round. \"Alright, time to switch our lives back and don't forget you have 2 minutes to do it.,\"  Michael said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.  I remember.\"  Melody said as she announced her choice.  \"I want to swap lives with Michael.\"  As she announced it, they switched places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay.\"  Michael nearly screamed. \"Lets deal out another round to see if I can get my voice back too\"  With that Michael dealt out the cards to see who the next winner would be.</span></div></div>",

And what about Josie?  If he knew better, he would have to say that she is now Brit's girlfriend instead of his.  '<i>At least she was here when it happened.</i>'  He thought to himself as he breathed a sigh of relief.  He watched as she dealt out the next hand and couldn't believe that it had been almost an entire week since he'd been able to be with her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Michael, how are things looking for you?\"  Mara asked without her usual timid manner.  \"If things are getting to be too much, we can stop.\"  She let out a slight grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sure you girls would like that wouldn't you?\"  Michael huffed as he picked up the cards to see that luck wasn't favoring him so far tonight.  At least he was able to get his own life back and hopefully some other parts of his body that he'd given away last weekend.  \"I don't have anything.\"  He said as he threw down his cards in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be too bad, I'm sure of it.\"  Josie replied with a consoling voice to her diminutive boyfriend.  Thanks to the power of the cards, she now thought that he was always around 5' tall with C cup breasts, and long blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm the winner of this hand.\"  Melody announced with joy as she laid down her hand to show the 2 pairs, Kings and 3's.  \"Now lets see what I want to get, hmm?\"  She started to ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is there to think about?\"  Michael declared with Melody's voice.  \"Let's start getting me back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But whats the fun in that?\"  She asked as she started to have a devilish look in her eye.  \"I want to swap breasts with Michael.\"  She announced to whatever gave the cards its power.  The group watched with awe and wonderment as Michael's, formerly Rosie's, C cup breasts started to shrink down in size until they looked a lot like Melody's did just a few seconds ago.  Michael looked over at Melody and watched as she started to poke her new bust with her finger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my voice?\"  He squealed in frustration.  \"I don't want to have to deal with this any more.\"  He brought his hands up to his throat to help emphasize his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looked at the clock and noticed that they still had around 30 minutes before she had to be home.  \"I think we have enough time for another hand or two.  What do you guys think?\"  The girls nodded their head in agreement.  Most were happy they way that they were now, but Rosie was ready to get her vagina back and Mara was ready to get her underwear back, but they would have to wait and see if the luck will be in their favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to deal this round.\"  Micheal decided as he reached over and grabbed the cards.  He was happy to have the weight off of his chest from Brit's breasts, but would have liked to have had his own chest instead.</span></div></div>",

With all the cards now in the player's hands, he picked up his cards and gasped with delight.  '<i>I might just be able to win with these cards.</i>'  He thought to himself.  He felt a sly smile start to creep on his face.  He picked through his cards and started to put the 3 Jacks, that was going to possibly win this hand, together.  \"Well what do you all have?\"  He asked wondering what each of them had.  \"I've got these 3 guys here.\"  He said tossing his hand to the table to show them that he had this hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, Michael.\"  Melody sighed as she folded her hand in defeat.  Knowing that they weren't going to be able to beat him, the other girls soon followed Melody's example.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mikey, what are you going to pick?\"  Brit asked wondering if she was about to lose her new strength or the height that she got from him.  She then had an idea on how she may be able to keep them for now.  \"Michael, you're still going to be cheering for me on Friday right?  I mean, you have your life back and I just want to make sure that your going to be doing it instead of her.\"  She motioned her head over to Melody, thanks to the swap a week ago, now didn't really think of her as a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, I totally forgot about that.\"  He said out loud as he reached for his phone to check to see if he had a calendar entry in it.  As he brought up the app on his phone, he let out a groan.  Michael looked around the group and noticed that they all were looking in his direction wondering what the answer was, but by his groan, they all knew what the answer was going to be.  His calendar said that he had practice several times next week and a game on Friday.  \"I'm still considered a cheerleader.\"  He closed down the app and locked the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you going to do about it?\"  Josie wondered, but deep down she hoped that he would keep it and parade around the room showing her his uniform.  She looked over a Michael who had a vacant look on his face, this look often meant that he was working something through his mind and had to take a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know how to phrase it.\"  He announced to the group.  \"I want to swap after school activities and the knowledge how to do it with Rosie.\"  He looked around wondering if it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, did it work?\"  Rosie wondered as she looked around the room to see if she could find any evidence that it did.  Looking around she could see her old pajamas littering the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me check.\"  He said as he reached back for his phone and opened up the calendar.  \"And...\"  He paused for suspense.  \"I'm not a cheerleader anymore.\"  He smiled as he thought about how to do some of the formations and realized he didn't know how to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, that sucks.\"  Brit fumed as she crossed her arms in disappointment.  \"I guess it's my turn to deal out the cards, hmm?\"  She reached over and grabbed the cards, hoping to win in order to keep her new found height.</span></div></div>",

But she still, at least, still had his height and strength.  \"Alright let's see what we've got here.\"  She said silently to herself.  She spread out her cards and noticed that she didn't have anything good.  The hodgepodge of cards didn't look like a winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"  Mara timidly said to herself as she looked at her own cards.  \"I've got a pair of aces.\"  She laid out her cards to show what she thought might be the winning hand.  All the other players, including Josh threw their cards down in disgust.  \"Wait, I won?\"  She asked while looking around to the group and she felt her mouth grow into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  Melody laughed, glad to see that her friend won a hand.  \"Wait, you really didn't think that you were going to win?\"  Mara shook her head.  \"Well, you did.  What are you going to pick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mara, what are you going to pick?\"  Rosie asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking about trying something new.\"  Mara added when she looked over at Rosie and started to blush ferociously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Why are you blushing so much?\"  Rosie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about swapping our things.\"  She suggested as she looked down at Rosie's groin where she found a slight bulge where Michael's penis now sat snugly between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Michael asked, a little taken aback.  He'd always thought that she'd been really reserved and didn't expect that from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think that would be a great idea.\"  Rosie suggested as she thought about it a little more.  \"Honestly it's been a pain in the butt waking up to it every morning and plus I don't want to have it with Cheer Leading practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group couldn't remember the last time they've seen her so happy.  \"Umm... I want to swap groins with Rosie.\"  She felt odd with the sensation of something growing out of her and soon found her jeans to be too small in the crotch area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is much better.\"  Rosie said out loud.  \"Michael, it was nice, but it certainly lost its fun after a couple days.  It's nice to have lady parts again and I think your underwear will be better than mine to handle it, Mara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was thinking about that earlier tonight and was hoping to win.\"  Mara replied back to her, as she tried to get a peek of it by opening up her fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know.\"  Michael suggested to her.  \"You could've just swapped back our underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But whats the fun in that?\"  Brit laughed as she tried to get a peak of it, by leaning over to Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its getting close to time for us to quit.\"  Melody said as she looked at her phone.</span></div></div>",

Michael went back up to his room to see her smiling at him, almost like she was holding in a guffaw of laughter, as he walked in.  \"Well, that went differently that I expected.\"  Just then, the multitude of laughter erupted from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael couldn't help but blush at the predicament.  \"Yeah, yeah laugh it up.\"  He replied as he closed the door behind him.  \"Looks like I'm stuck like this for a few more days.\"   He looked at himself in the mirror and couldn't help but wonder how he got into this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes, Josie finally settled down and sat down next to Michael on the bed.  Bringing her arm around him, she guided his head to her body and embraced him in a loving way.  \"You know Anna and Jeremy are getting pretty mad.  They're tired of having each others legs and want to swap back.\"  Honestly, Michael had forgotten about his friends, or rather Brit's friends for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I will see about putting things right with them.\"  Michael sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>***  20 minutes later  ***</b></i></div><br>\r\nMara opened the door to the duplex that she shared with her parents and called out to the seemingly empty home.  \"I'm home.\"  Not hearing anything, she made her way into the kitchen to find a note from her Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mara,<br>\r\nYour Dad and I went out to have a night to ourselves.  We'll be back later on and we've left you money for some delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXOXO<br>\r\nMom</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was unexpected.\"  She said to herself as she put the bag that she was carrying on the sofa.  As she did, she inadvertently felt her hand go over her crotch and jumped back in surprise.  \"I had almost forgotten about that.\"  Mara could feel the blood rushing to her face as she blushed, thinking about what she was about to do.  Within a few minutes, she made it to her own room and had completely stripped off all of her clothing.  \"Oh my.\"  She exclaimed as she saw the piece of meat that lay between her thighs.  Making her way to the mirror that she had in her room that used to hold all of her makeup before it was swapped to Michael a week before, Mara almost tripped over some of the boxers that lay dirty on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why Rosie didn't like this too much.\"  She said to herself as she made her way to the bed.</span></div></div>",

While she was looking around, she found that all of her clothes had magically appeared here in her new room.  \"I have never been alone in a boy's room by myself before, well, besides Jeremy's but that is different.\"  Melody then heard a knock on the door.  \"Hey Lil' Man, did you have a good birthday?\"  Melody turned around and saw Micheal's mom, no it was her mom, for the time being anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mom, it was great.  Uhm... Thanks for letting my bring my friends by.\"  Melody answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\"  She told Melody as she ruffled her hair.  \"I can't believe my little boy is now 17 years old.  I guess, they are right, time sure does fly.  I know it's been hard with your dad on the month long medical trip to Nepal with the Doctors without Borders.  But here is your last present from the both of us.  You had to deal with me and your sister and all of the estrogen for the past 2 weeks and we are going to give you the credit card for the night.\"  As she said this, she handed Melody a Visa card.  \"Now don't go crazy with it and invite some of your guy friends and have a guy's night out.\"  With that she turned and started to leave the room.  \"And don't go crazy.\"  She winked as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, I can't believe she just did that.' Melody thought to herself.  Then she reached for her back pocket and felt what Micheal was looking for earlier after the life swap.  She pulled out Micheal's wallet and put the card in it.  as she was closing it up, she glanced at his, no for the time being, her License.  Melody Ferguson, Male, 17 years old.  Then it struck her.  She quickly pulled out her cell phone and quickly dialed Phillips number and told him about tomorrow night.  After that she was done with him, she hung up the phone and dialed her brother's number and let him in on what was going to happen.  She even told him that it was guy's only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal was overcome with what was going on.  All he could do now was work on the paper, at least then he didn't have to look around the pink and purple color of the room.  He was able to complete the paper within an hour, since he had to do the same thing last year and it was his favorite time in history.  Then he had to look around the room again.  Micheal went over to the backpack and quickly found the cards that had caused this whole dilemma.  He then had time to text Melody and tell her that he had finished her report and to get some information on who all was invited over for \"fun\" tomorrow night.    Micheal put down the cards on the night stand and texted Melody to see what will be going on.  Then he heard the unmistakable 'ding' of an incoming message.  He looked at the screen and saw what he had dreaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Madison Taylor she was the dancer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Alexandra \"Alex\" Westerman  Basketball Player<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Turner  Cheerleader<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I know their names now,\" Micheal said to himself.  Then he heard another 'ding'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There are 2 new girls that just arrived about a month ago, twins and I thought they would like to come too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought I would only have to deal with 3 girls\" Micheal said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Makayla and Mackenzie Birdwell  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, I need to go tell Mom about this.'  He thought.  He went downstairs and looked for his 'Mom'.  He found her in the kitchen writing a list of what she needed to buy for tomorrow night.  He glanced at the list and nearly choked.  \"Nail Polish?!?!\" he nearly screamed.  \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey there Micheal.  You nearly gave me a heart attack.\"  She replied back to him. \"Well you said I can get whatever I wanted for the sleepover tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I really don't want that.  At least not on me.\"  He quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, your going to ruin my fun and try to break this tomboy streak your in?\"  She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, there are going to be 5 girls tomorrow, not 3\"  He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey.  I already know.  Are you feeling okay?\"  She said as she felt his forehead. \"Your not running a fever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uhmm... yeah, I was just making sure that you knew.\"  He quickly said recovering from the mess up.</span></div></div>",

Micheal heard this from his temporary room and had a sense of dread.  Ever since Jeremy left to go on the Boy's Night Out with Melody and Phillip, he has had this dread.  'Maybe I can tell Mom that I don't feel well and she can call the whole thing off.  Can I fake the mumps?  Do people even still get the mumps?' the thought to himself.  Then he heard it... 'Ding Dong' and the sound of the door opening and the giggles of the girls heading up the stairs.  He could feel his heart beat in his chest as he slowly saw the handle of the door move downward and the door opened to reveal his temporary roommates.  First to come in were the twins.  Makayla and Mackenzie 12 years old and they seemed to be about 4'11\" based on some quick calculations.  They both had black shoulder length black hair.  It seemed that Makayla was going through a phase where she is wanting to differentiate from her sibling.  She seemed to have pink highlights going throughout her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micheal, thank you for letting us join you,\" Mackenzie said as she ran up to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure\" he quickly said as he let her hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lizzie walked in.  She seemed to be the same height as the twins but a bigger bust.  Melody said that she was 12 years old too.  She seemed to have all the curves in all the right places.  It would seem that his sister and most of his class would envy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Madison the blonde dancer walked in.  She was the tallest of the group but had the smallest bust.  Her blonde hair went past her shoulders and cascaded down her back.  If he could remember correctly, she was 13 and so was the last member of the group.  Alexandra had an athletic build but not too tall.  She was only 5 feet even and had blonde hair with a slight wave that went to her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all convened to meet Micheal near his bed where he was scared stiff.  \"What's wrong with you?\" Lizzie wondered as she playfully pushed him over onto his bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.  Just glad you all could make it.\"  Micheal lied and quickly turned it around by asking.  \"What would you ladies like to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know your Mom was telling us that she wants us to break you of your Tomboyish phase your in.  She bought a whole bunch of stuff and I think we should go through it and see what is in there.\"  Makayla said with her pink highlights flowing as she turned her head to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\"  Micheal was trying to get out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh leave her alone.\"  Alex came to Micheal's defense.  \"I am sure we will slowly break her will tonight.\"  She looked at you and winked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal wondered, 'Were they planning something tonight?'  Then his mom came in the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, if you want to go ahead and get your pajamas on, I have the pizza ordered and some movies ready to go.\"  She said as she look at the group.  \"Oh and Micheal, here are some \"supplies\" I got for your party tonight.\"  she said as she did quotation marks as she said supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Mrs. Parker.\" was the group response.  As she said this they began to strip down to their underwear and get their pajamas on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micheal, are you going to get dressed?\"  Madison wondered.  \"Don't think we don't know about your little secret.\" she said as she pointed to his groin.  \"And your missing some goods up top too, but don't worry, we don't think any less of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Micheal quickly covered his crotch and blushed.  \"Awe did she embarrass you?\"  Alex wondered as she only had her pants on and no shirt.  Leaving her B-cups out for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal then snapped out of it and started to dress in his clothes.  An old gaming shirt with some blue pajama pants.  After a few minutes they were all dressed and he then looked around to verify that everyone was dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins had a matching pair of short shorts and camisoles, Alex was wearing her favorite jersey from the Oklahoma City Thunder and he was hoping that she was wearing shorts under there.  Madison had a Hello Kitty set on with short shorts. ' What is with all the short shorts tonight?'  Micheal thought as he looked over to Lizzie.  She had a low cut shirt with a pair of pants on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie then started to look for something on his nightstand?  \"Micheal do you have any lip gloss that I can use?\"  she continued to look around and found the cards and read the back of the box.  \"Are these things real?  Win a hand of poker and swap something with another player for 2 days\"  she asked as she read the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy...  I doubt it..\"Makayla said as she looked at Micheal, \"Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" Micheal told the group.  Then he went through the story and how this wasn't his life.  Even though they wouldn't believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we have been in the same class for years\"  said a shocked Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is only one way to properly show you.\"  He said as he dealt out the cards.  \"The winner will get 2 minutes to swap, if you don't then the game will choose something for you.\"  he explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, it turns out that Alex came out on top.  \"I win.  So all I have to say is I want to swap ____ with ____?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, give it a try.\"  Micheal said as he was sure that he would be in the clear.  He thought that they would swap among themselves and leave him alone and suddenly found himself shrinking down to the same height as the other girls.  \"What happened!\" he nearly yelled with Melody's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls just looked at him with awe as they soon found Alex the height that he was formerly.  She would now be the tallest member of the team or atleast until he got his height back.  Then Madison broke the silence.  \"Alex swapped your height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet I can dunk now that I am this tall.\"  Alex was in pure ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like it back when we can in 2 days.\"  Micheal said to her as he craned his neck upwards to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Micheal as talking to Alex the other girls were talking among them selves.  Mostly giggling, they looked at Micheal and Lizzie broke the silence.  \"Micheal, I know that your a tomboy, but we are wondering if we can swap with you for tonight.  I mean...  There are somethings that the girls are looking at and we would like to trade with you for a bit.  Will that be okay?\"  she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal was at a lost for words.  \"Is this what you girls are wanting?\"  They all nodded as Micheal.  \"So I have no choice do I?  As long as we switch back I will be okay with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1 week\" Alex said as she looked toward Micheal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can do 1 week\"  Micheal said mostly to himself.  'I will have to talk to Melody, I am sure she will be mad if I stay in her life for some time.'  \"Alright, I will do it for 1 week.  Do your worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we plan to\", said Lizzie as she looked toward him laughing.  This in turn caused the group including Micheal to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, doll me up.\" he said as the next hand was dealt out.</span></div></div>",

Her frame on the other hand, looked like she as put in torture rack and had her limbs stretched out and her trunk too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I chose it because, even though I am doing well on the team, I don't get any play time.  I am a bench warmer, at least not anymore, I am hoping.\" Alex was saying almost on the verge of tears.  Micheal was seeing this and instinctively went up to her and gave her a hug.  After seeing this, the other girls joined in and surrounded Alex on all sides.  Her tears dried up almost instantly.  \"Thanks girls, I really needed that.\"  Alex told the group.  Micheal honestly didn't mind being called a girl as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies, are we ready for the next round?\"  Lizzie asked as she started dealing out the cards.  The groups looked at their cards and Micheal thought he might be able to win this.  He had 2 pairs, but when it came time to show the cards, he found out that he lost to Makayla.  She had 3 of a kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I win!\"  she celebrated very enthusiastically.  \"As you guys know, Mackenzie and I are identical twins.  For the past 2 months, I have been trying to separate ourselves visually.  So without further to do.  I want to swap hair with Micheal.\"  Within a couple seconds, Mackenzie's hair was sucked back into her head and then Micheal's blonde hair sprouted out of her head until it matched Micheal's hair that was down to his ears.  The opposite happened with Micheal.  His hair sprouted Makayla's shoulder length black hair.  After it was down to his shoulder, a pink stripe came out of his roots above his left eye until it reached the tip.  \"Micheal you look so cute.\"  Makayla told her friend.  Micheal, not used to have such long hair, was fighting to keep it out of his face.  \"Would you like me to help you with that?\" Makayla wondered as she got behind Micheal and fixed his hair into a high pony tail.  Micheal got up and looked in a mirror that was close by.  He was still getting used to 5 foot even, but what he saw in the mirror him like what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mackenzie\"  Micheal started, \"I like what you did.  I can't believe I said that\"  He found his hair up in a high ponytail but had the pink stripe still hanging down in front of his eye.  \"Thanks for the help by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Micheal, you do look nice.\"  Lizzie said as she glanced over to him.  \"Are you ready for another round?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let me go have a seat.\"  Micheal said as he sat with the group.</span></div></div>",

Almost instantaneously, her chest deflated to match what Micheal's looked like a few seconds before.  Micheal on the other hand, had his chest beginning to swell up to a perfect pair of C-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal looked down and had his newly acquired pink hair block some of his view of his new bust.  \"These are too heavy\"  He complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the reason why I wanted to get rid of them.  They have been nothing but trouble for me over the past year and a half.\"  Lizzie said as she started to tear up.  \"For the past year, I have had people make fun of me and accusing me of stuffing.  While in the locker room, I have been called all names in the book and it doesn't help matters that I am a cheerleader too.  Also I went from an A to a C cup in a single summer.  It hurt so much that I was in tears most of that summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok.  I will deal with them for the next week.  That way you can have a small vacation.\"  Micheal said as he was hugging her.  She felt better and liked the security that girlfriends offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micheal, you are starting to get pretty cute, if I say so myself.\"  Lizzie said.  \"But, I think I can swap something with you that will help you for the next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dealt the cards and the group found out that Lizzie came out on to again.  \"Are you ready for some help, Micheal?\" She wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal didn't know what she was talking about.  \"Umm... Yeah, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lizzie started, \"I want to swap underwear with Micheal\"  Soon, she felt the useless piece of cloth that was around her chest disappear and felt something else in her pants.  She looked down and saw Micheal's boxers.  \"I think I messed up.\" she quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why what happened\" Makayla wondered as she looked at the two of them.  \"What happened?\"  she started to say more urgently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have her panties too\" Micheal said with a blush<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, I want to see\"  Madison said as she looked down his pants and saw Lizzie's blue panties and saw a glimpse of her blue bra too. \"Your getting cuter and cuter with each hand.\"  She said to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder when the pizza will get here, I need a break.\"  Micheal said as he was starting to feel a little overwhelmed.

He then saw his own face looking back at him with his blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you choose that?\"  Makayla wondered.  \"Is is to help with keeping me different from my sister?\"  Micheal nodded as he looked back at her with her face.  He knew that he now had her almond shaped brown eyes and full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys feeling weirded out yet\" Micheal wondered as he looked around at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit, but you are taking some of the traits that we don't like.

He dealt out the cards again and after a minute the girls were surprised to find out that Makenzie came out on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finally get to choose something,\" She cheered as she thought about what to say.  \"Micheal, I know you have had fun being a tomboy for the last several years or however long you have done it.\"  Micheal dreaded what was coming.  \" I want to swap girlyness with Micheal\"  There wasn't any bells or fireworks to let the know that it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\"  Lizzie wondered, \"I hope it worked, then tonight will get so much more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it worked\" Makenzie said as she looked down at her pajama set and felt disgusted and liked Micheal's so much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal felt different.  He looked around the room and loved the colors and he envied what the other girls were wearing.  \"Yeah, I think it did.  I really want to wear something more comfy, much like you girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and how do you feel about makeovers and nail polish and what not.\"  Madison wondered as she was holding up the bag that Micheal's mom brought in earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want to try it.\"  Micheal said confused.  \"I don't know what to think.  I like the colors in the room now and I am envious of what you girls are wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\"  Lizzie said \"you were there for us for all those years and now we are going to be there for you.  Because we love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal was starting to cry. \"I don't think I deserve you girls.\"  He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, Pizza is ready to go\"  Micheal's mom said as she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we are going down now.\"  Micheal said as they all got up and made their way downstairs.</span></div></div>",

I want to swap legs with Michael.\"  As soon as the phrase was uttered, Mackenzie's legs slowly lost some of their shape and started to gain more muscle.  They also started to grow hair until they looked just like Michael's athletic legs.  Michael on the other hand had her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are going to be a nice pair once you get done growing.\"  Michael said to Mackenzie as he was feeling them.  \"Do have to keep them shaved too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do.\" Mackenzie replied back \"If you don't, then I will start your shaving routine with these ladies.\"  Lifting up her legs, Michael knew what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"  Micheal said \"I will try to keep them looking nice and when you get them back in a week, they will look spectacular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then they heard what they were waiting for.  \"Pizza is here!\"  Michael's mom yelled from downstairs.  \"Let's go girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sighed as he made his way downstairs and he noticed that he had to walk faster to keep up with Alex's longer frame and walking gait. \"I like the way these legs look\" Michael said with the other girls smiling at him.</span></div></div>",

I am going to put in a movie and we are going to do some activities.\"  As she was saying this she was pulling out the bag of \"supplies\" that she brought up to the room earlier.  \"Does anyone have any suggestions of which movie we should watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's watch the new Hunger games.\"  Mackenzie and Makayla suggested at the same time just like a pair of twins that were thinking on the same wavelength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we do Pitch Perfect 2\"  Madison said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to see Avengers 2\"  Michael said to the group of under enthusiastic girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Michael?  How about something girly for once?

He held up a movie.<br>\r\n\"Lets see, Hunger Games?\"  He asked the group and 2 girls, the twins, held up their hands.  \"Ok, two for that one.  How about this one, Pitch Perfect 2\"  The 3 remaining girls held up their hands. \"Well it doesn't matter what I do now, I am not going to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you aren't\" Alex said looking down at Michael.  \"You know we are only one game away from helping you like these types of movies.  You never know, you might find something that you'll find enjoyable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was at a loss as he looked at the group of girls, who were wide eyed in anticipation for his answer.  \"Well so far, tonight is a night for new experiences.  I will try it out.\"  The twins ran up to the room to get the cards as the others sat on the group getting ready for them to return.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael what would you rather be doing?  I mean, if you were by yourself what would you be doing\"  Lizzie wondered as she looked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, I just bought Fallout 4 and would love to be playing that right about now.\"  Michael said without a thought.  Just then the twins arrived with the cards and they handed them over Lizzie as she dealt them out.  After about a minute, Mackenzie was the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I word it?\"  Mackenzie asked the girls, \"Oh, I know...  I want to swap likes and dislikes for media with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is that supposed to do\" Alex wondered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it worked like I thought it would, it would mean that he would like all the movies, songs, and games that I do.  Come to think of it, I think Avengers would be great, it does have a lot of action and some suspense too.\"  Mackenzie said to the group of wide eyed girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, what would you like to watch?\" Lizzie inquired to their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael thought about it for a short bit and said. \"Well Avengers has a lot of action but the romance isn't really there.  But in the Hunger Games there is a lot to watch especially with the love growing between Peeta and Katniss over the series.  Wow, I think those cards are messing with my head.\"  He said as he put both hands on his head and shook it slowly.  He now had all the media interests of a 12 year old girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your favorite group to listen to.\"  Lizzie wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Taylor Swift has some nice music, Katie Perry, and some One Direction.\"  Michael quickly said without giving it another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Mackenzie?\" Alex wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to listen to Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons, and some Bruno Mars.\"  Mackenzie said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think it worked, so lets watch the movie and we can do whatever afterwards.\"  Alex told the group.</span></div></div>",

He put it on the nightstand under the lamp so that it wouldn't move.  Then he got laid down on the floor and put his face in the pillow.  Since he had swapped clothing with Madison, he now wore her hello kitty pajama set with the short shorts, which showed off his new legs compliments of Mackenzie.  After a few minutes, he was asleep and could be heard lightly snoring.  \"Uh oh.  I think somebody has fallen asleep.\"  Lizzie said as she motioned over to Michael.  \"We can't say that we didn't warn her.\"  She then went around the room to see what she could do to mess with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I have an idea,\"  Madison said while looking at the instructions for the cards. \"It doesn't say anything about having to play the game to change something, see listen. 'Player must hold cards in their hands, if player does not play within one minute then he or she will automatically fold.'  **CAUTION**  Player may not be able to see the changes, depending of the level of consciousness.  So all we really have to do is deal him in and place his hand on the cards and let it sit for one minute.  But we have to be sure that we don't fall under that rule too. \"  After hearing this, the girls got really happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you girls, but there were some stuff I didn't want to tell him about and wanted to trade with him.\"  Lexie told the group. \"But what does it mean with the warning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he may be confused whether or not he really had it or not.\"  Madison suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... what do you girls think? Should we do that and give him up to 3 traits that we choose and we will write them down on a separate sheet of paper too?\"  Lizzie suggested to the group.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me, I mean, as long as we write it all down and switch it back, then I am okay with it.\" Alex said and the other girls agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's agreed then, lets see if this works.\" Madison said as she got the cards out and everyone gathered around sleeping Michael.  Lexie got his newly feminine hand and stuck it out so that the would be easy to just lift his hand up and place it on the cards.  Madison dealt out the cards and Lexie put Michael's hand on top of his cards and left it.  The winner was Madison with a pair of Kings.  After finding out the winner, Lexie got out her phone and started a timer for 1 minute. \"Recently I've been getting tired of Dance classes.  Having to do them up to 3-4 nights a week was getting boring and really time consuming.  I've been needing a small vacation from everything and need time to reboot.\"  Soon, the timer went off and Madison told the group, \"I want to swap after school activities with Michael.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\"  Alex wondered as she looked around the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it did, then we should check the closet for her dance gear.\"  Madison suggested.  Lexie then rose from her seat to check out the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lookie here girls.\"  Lexie said as she drug out the bag that had the emblem of the dance studio that Madison goes to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one.\"  Madison said with a big grin on her face.  \"So are you girls ready for a vacation this week?\"  The other girls nodded as they played games with the slumbering Michael.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She started doing this when we both began to become withdrawn from her since we moved here last month.\"  She said as she heard the alarm go off for the 1 minute.  \"So I want to swap family times with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean, exactly?\" Madison asked Mackenzie with a perplexed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for the next week, it means that Michael will be coming over to our house for family game night and movie night.  Plus I do believe they will be going to the spa tomorrow for mani-pedi day.\"  Mackenzie said as she winked over to the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would funny to see him with french tips or something.\"  Lizzie said giggling.  As she was giggling a little too loudly, Micheal started to turn in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to be quiet if we want this plan to work.\" Alex said to the group of girls in a whispered tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Lizzie whispered back \"So do we need to check his phone to see if it actually happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I always put it in my phone because if we missed it we would get grounded for a couple days.\"  Mackenzie said as she reached up to the nightstand to see if she could grab Michael's phone. \"Almost... There we go.\" She then pulled down the phone and checked the calendar. \"Yup, Sunday at 1pm. Mom &amp; Daughters day out.  So it looks like it worked alright and now I will be able to spend time with Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play some more.\"  Lizzie said as she dealt out another hand.</span></div></div>",

And yes, I know it worked because I don't remember how to do an attitude.  I know its a dance move, but my mind keeps thinking its something that a teenager would have towards an authority figure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Michael's dream just changed from a video game he had been playing over the past week to him being dressed in a leotard and dancing on stage with a group of other girls.  The spotlight was on him and he danced to his heart's content. Doing all the moves he loved and practiced so hard to train for.  Little did he know, he was not the one training for the recitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, lets do 3 more rounds. I think she has learned her lesson for falling asleep.\" Makayla pleaded to the group.  \"I mean, I don't want to be on her bad side when she wakes up\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I second\" Madison said, I mean, I got what I wanted and I don't want to be on her bad side too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\"  Lizzie said, \"but 4 more rounds and we will be done.\"  The girls nodded and they dealt out the hand.</span></div></div>",

He brushed his long hair out of his eyes and tried to remember where he was.  'I am at Melody's house with a sleep over'  He then felt something pressing up against his back like a finger was poking his back.  He sat up and looked around to see the other girls scatted around the room.  He then got up, did a big stretch and glanced over to the clock and saw that it was now 9 am.  He felt something strange and realized that he had Lizzie's breasts and underwear.  He made his way over the bathroom to wash his face and get ready for the day.  He stood in front of the toilet and dug into his pants for his \"equipment\" and didn't feel anything.  He quickly pulled down his pants and saw female plumbing.  He then pulled off all of his clothes to get a full stock of his situation.  He then made a mental list in his head of everything he got, somehow he missed something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex                   Height<br>\r\nMakayla             Hair<br>\r\nLizzie                 Chests<br>\r\nLizzie                 Underwear<br>\r\nMackenzie          Legs<br>\r\nMackenzie          Tastes in media<br>\r\nMadison              Clothing<br>\r\nMadison              Tastes in clothing<br>\r\nMakayla              Arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he made a list of the stuff that he didn't remember getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis manhood... Gone.  And why did he have chipped nail polish on his nails. \"I really need to take care of that later on.\"  He said to himself.  His hair around his groin seemed to be shaped differently and he felt his face... nothing.  \"What is going on here.\"  He really needed to use the bathroom.  He sat down on the toilet and let it flow out of him.  After everything was out of him, he got up and wiped like he remembered people saying in some books and shows he would watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie turned over to see Michael's spot empty and she had a smile creep across her face as she saw her come into the bedroom.  \"Are you okay, Michael?\"  Michael was startled to hear his name being called, he looked around the room to see Lizzie sitting up in her sleeping bag with a quizzical look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... yeah... I don't remember what happened last night is all.\"  Micheal replied as he looked around the room to see if he could see any of the changes with the girls.  'Lets see Lizzie has no breasts and I currently have on her blue bra and panties.  Madison, Madison, Oh I have her clothing and her taste in clothing.  No wonder I like these pajamas so much.  Mackenzie, I have her legs and tastes in media.  That would explain the twilight books and Taylor Swift music everywhere.  Hmm... Alex, I have her... well shortness.  Why does she have a 5 o'clock shadow going on?  And lastly, Makayla, I have her arms and hair.'  \"Did we swap any other things last night that I don't remember?\"  Michael asked Lizzie who now had an impish grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we did and I will tell you what was swapped if you can give me 3 items that you don't remember swapping.\"  Lizzie demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... I don't remember having a vagina... hmm... why does Alex have a 5 o'clock shadow... one more thing...\"  Michael started to tap his foot rhythmically and he looked down at his hand. 'I really need to take care of these nails today... wait...'  \"Oh, why do I have nail polish on.  That doesn't' make sense.\"  Lizzie had a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got the 3 things, but we have to wait for the other girls to wake up and I will give you the list.\"  Lizzie said with a defeated look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\"  Michael said almost a little too loudly, because the other girls began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on?  Did Michael find out about our gifts?\"  Makayla said as she began to sit up.  She, of course, now had Michael's short blond hair, slightly messed up from a night's sleep.  As she got up, Michael couldn't miss what he saw next.  She had morning wood in her shorts.  He then saw that she was sleeping right next to him.  So that's what the poking in his back was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that thing in your shorts?\"  Michael demanded. \"Is that my penis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is\"  Makayla said as she smiled toward him.  \"And I want you to take good care of my lady too while I take good care of your not to little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew I should have put the cards up before I passed out for the night and I have to live with it for the next week.\"  Micheal said to the 2 girls almost screaming.  \"I am going to go take a shower and clear my head.\"  He said as he made his way over to get some underwear to wear.  He opened the drawer and found a bra/panty set that was pink with little flowers embroidered around them, 'I think I will wear these today'.  He picked them up and made his way to the shower and got it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see her smile when she picked up pink underwear?\"  Lizzie said over to Makayla<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought it was kinda cute.\"  Makayla said back to her friend as the 2 girls began waking up the others so that they can get ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael got in the shower and started to wash his longer hair and after he put in the conditioner, he began to work on the other parts of his body.  Getting the body wash, he lathered up the poof he found and started to clean himself off.  After that was all done, he began to get to work on his body hair that he had to get rid of... wait... he looked down and saw that his body was now void of any unsightly body hair. \"That would explain it, I have Alex's pubic and body hair\" Michael said as he looked over his body.  But his body couldn't fight it.  He started to shave his legs and underarms as if on autopilot.  He quickly finished up his shower and got his towel.  He wrapped it around his chest and grabbed another one to wrap around his hair, then made his way over to the mirror to start his routine that he somehow knew how to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were all up and somewhat ready to go.  They were all getting dressed and laughing at the sight of each other while getting dressed.  \"I am glad you girls are laughing at this situation\"  They all turned around to see Michael dressed in his pink bra and panty set.  He walked over to the closet and looked for something to wear and noticed a duffle bag in the floor.  \"What is this\" he said as he pulled it out for the group to see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is my gift to you.\"  Madison said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gift?  I don't know how to do ballet, an Assembl\u00e9, or Grande Jet\u00e9.\"  Micheal froze as he heard the words coming out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do, I made sure you did.\" Madison said to her confused friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get dressed\"  He said as he looked for something to wear.  Then he spotted something nice.  He pulled out a pink sundress and immediately put it on.  \"why did I choose this?\"  Micheal said really confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I really like pink and you now have my taste in clothing, remember?\"  Madison said to her friend as she was now dressed in an old pair of jeans and a T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I do, this is giving me a headache.\"  Micheal said as he shook his head. \"I need to finish getting ready and I want to see that list after I get done.\" He demanded as he made his way to the bathroom once more.  Once he made it in there, he made his way over to the mirror and as if on autopilot grabbed the makeup and started to apply it to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she liked what we did, I knew we should have stopped sooner.\" Mackenzie said to the group<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she will be alright\"  Lizzie said, \"I mean, she did fall asleep first and we aren't going to keep them forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not keep them forever, I want everything back in 1 week.\"  Michael said as he appeared in the door way with his face made up like a 12 year old girl's would be.  He had a little to much eye makeup on with some dark blush on too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She looks just like me when I put my makeup on before school.' Lizzie thought as she saw him. \"Alright, here is the complete list, like we promised.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex                   Height<br>\r\nMakayla             Hair<br>\r\nLizzie                 Chests<br>\r\nLizzie                 Underwear<br>\r\nMackenzie          Legs<br>\r\nMackenzie          Tastes in media<br>\r\nMadison              Clothing<br>\r\nMadison              Tastes in clothing<br>\r\nMakayla              Arms<br>\r\nMadison              Dance Classes<br>\r\nMackenzie          Family time<br>\r\nMadison             Dance Class knowledge and abilities <br>\r\nAlex                   Body Hair<br>\r\nLizzie                 Makeup<br>\r\nLizzie                 Morning and Nightly routines<br>\r\nMakayla             Groins<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain everything, but Mackenzie, what is the family time?\"  Michael wondered as he continued to look over the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that.  I swapped that so that I can spend time with my boyfriend, Josh.  You will be doing game nights and spa nights with my mom and sister, Makayla.\"  Mackenzie told her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too much\" Michael said as he looked at his friends.\"Mom is up and cooking pancakes, we should head on down.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He heard the door open and close and heard a voice talking... Wait... That was Anna's voice.  Melody was here.  He had to talk to her.  He got up off of his bed and made his way down stairs to talk to her... in private.  He made his way down stairs with great haste.  He soon was right next to her and found that she was now an inch taller that his current height.  \"Hey Michael, did you have fun last night?\"  She started to say.  \"I hope they didn't mess with you too much, I mean, your hair looks nicer and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to talk to you.\"  Michael interrupted her \" in private.\"  They made their way up to his room and he shut the door.  \"How would you feel if we keep our current lives for another week?\"  Melody was taken aback and didn't know how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you wanting to do this.\"  Melody wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why.\" Michael said as he showed the list to Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\"  Melody wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what happened last night.\"  Micheal started, \"They found the cards and one thing led to another and all that stuff got swapped with me last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looked at the list and didn't know how to respond.  She remembered him to have all these traits to begin with, but then again, she knew how powerful the cards could be.  \"I will let you keep my life for another week.  I have a big test in Biology next week anyhow.  I think we should swap class schedules with each other if we are going to stay like this for another week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was shocked at how easy it was and eagerly agreed to swap that with her.  After a quick game he now knew her schedule and she knew his. \"Thank you Melody.\"  Michael quickly said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, I know how those girls can be...\" Melody started to say but was interrupted by a dinging sound.  Michael looked down at the cell phone and saw a message from Mrs. Birdwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hey Michael, Makayla and I will be there in about 30 minutes to pick you up for our spa day.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ok, see you then~  Michael texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, can I use the cards tonight, everyone will be there.\"  Melody started to say. \"Well, I will just say that you had a prior engagement.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not.\"  Michael said as he gave them to her.  She then started to make her way over to Jeremy's room to hang out with her \"friend\" and leave Michael alone for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later, Michael heard a car honking in the driveway and he made his way downstairs to see a minivan being driven by Mrs. Birdwell.  She seemed to be about 35 years old with a pixie cut of black hair.  \"Hey sweety, glad to see you again.\"  She started to say. \"Are you ready to be pampered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. you know it...\" Michael said to her as he started to get into the car.  Makayla was already in the car with Micheal's short blonde hair on her head and he saw his hands with the finger bitten nails he had grown accustomed to.  After a 10 minute drive, they found themselves at the local mall.  They all walked up the escalator to find the spa ready for them.  Makayla was called first and she made her way to the first booth and they started on her hands.  Michael was nervous, he had never done this before and didn't know what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what??\"  Mrs. Birdwell started to ask. \"I never noticed that you don't have your ears pierced.  Makayla had hers done when she was 4, I thought you had yours done too.  How about after we get done here, we head on down to Claire's and get yours done too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's okay, you don't have to, I mean, I am happy right now.\"  Michael said as he heard his name being called.  He automatically stood up and made his way over to the young blonde girl that had a comforting look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked \"You okay, sweety?\"  Micheal nodded as she helped him to the station that they would be working in.  \"Do you have an idea of what you want done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's been awhile since I have been here. You can do a normal manicure.\"  Micheal lied as he answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like for ever, she was done and he looked down to see his nails looked perfect.  \"What color would you like on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael wanted to say 'No thanks I am good', but instead, he said \"What do you have in alight purple?\"  She then went over to the wall and found a color that he would like and showed it to him.  \"I like that.\"  He said to her as she opened it up and started to put it on his nails.  After another 10 minutes, she was done and then led him over to the pedicure station.  He looked at it and noticed it looked like a fighter jet seat, but with a sink on the bottom for his feet to sit in.  He sat down where she indicated and he relaxed, relaxed a little too much.  Micheal had fallen asleep as she worked on his feet and work him up when she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweety, it's time to wake up.\"  She said to a slumbering Michael.  He woke up to see that she had finished her job and the other 2 ladies were finished just waiting for him to wake up.  He then looked down at his feet and saw that they now matched his fingers.  Mrs. Birdwell paid for the services and they left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I almost forgot...\"  Mrs Birdwell started to say and Micheal knew what was going to happen next. \"Let's stop by Claire's and get Micheal's ears pierced.\"  She suggested.  Micheal didn't know what to do so he just followed along.  They small group made the way to the nearest Claire's and they met an attendant, whose name incidentally was also Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what would you like to have done to her today?\" Claire inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we would like to match my daughter here.\"  Mrs. Birdwell said as she showed the piercings of her Makayla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Double piercing in the lobes on each ear and a cartilage piercing on the right ear.  Not a problem.  Just pick out the earrings you would like her to have and I will get them done in no time.\"  Claire suggested to her.  She had Makayla go and pick them out for her friend and she made her selection and they made their way back to Micheal.  \"This is only going to hurt for a second.\"  Claire said as she squeezed the gun into his ears.  \"What do you think?\" she asked as she pulled out a mirror and showed her handiwork to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal eagerly took the mirror and was in shock.  He had a pair of pink hearts with purple diamonds in each ear with what looks to be a diamond in the upper part of his right ear.  \"This is going to be a long week,\"  He muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what was that sweety?\"  Claire and Mrs. Birdwell asked Micheal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, they look wonderful, thanks,\" Micheal lied.  Then he noticed Makayla's hands, or his hands.  \"Umm... Makayla, what did you get done back there at the salon\"  He asked his friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I decided to get a french tip done.  Do you like it?\" She asked as she showed her fingers to him.  \"I had to do something about your nail bitten hands and they suggested this.\"  They were now pink with white tips and they were now extended by a half inch.  Michael wondered if they would transfer over to him when they got swapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they look good\"  Micheal said with a grin.  Claire then gave him a kit to help with the cleaning of his ears and told him how to use it.  They then made their way back to drop Micheal off and head back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal made his way back up to Melody's or now his room and sat down.  He looked down at his body took in everything that has happened to him in the last 48 hours.</span></div></div>",

He decided to stay home from the game tonight and didn't want the others to see him in his current form.  However to them he always was 5 feet tall, with shoulder length hair with a pink stripe going down his right eye, a perfect pair of c cups breasts and wore women's underwear.\"Hmm... I wonder.\" Micheal said as he went over to the photo that was right next and looked at it.  Before when he looked at it he saw 2 blonde girls, 1 brown haired, and himself in the photo.  Now, however, was a different photo, at least to him.  Now the photo showed 4 girls: 3 average sized ones with 1 super tall one.  Micheal saw himself in the photo with a nice grin, the black hair and he could see the breasts that he now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you have fun with Mrs. Birdwell and Makayla?\"  Micheal turned around to see his new mom in the doorway. \"Oh my god, what did you do to your ears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal instinctively touched his ears \"Why do they look bad?\"  He wondered as he looked toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they look amazing, I would have taken you out for getting that done, if you wanted to\"  She insisted. \"I like your nails too, I am glad she invited you along, you tend to be more out of your shell when you are around them.  Well, the reason that I am up here, is to see if you wanted to watch a movie tonight with me?  I mean, Jeremy is out at Melody's house and your dad is still on his trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I would love to.  But first, can you help me with my ears, they went through it so fast I don't think I got everything.\"  Micheal admitted as he picked up the solution and gave it to his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its not that bad, here let me help you out.\"  She insisted as they sat down on the bed.  Micheal noticed that his feet no longer touched the floor when he sat on the bed.  She got a Q-tip and put some of the cleaning solution on it and started helping Micheal with the cleaning of his newly pierced ears.  \"There you go honey, you look so cute with you ears like that.  I've been wanting for you to get them pierced for years and now you do.\"  She said as she started to tear up.  \"My baby girl is growing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom\"  Michael said trying to stay in character as her daughter. \"So what movie are you ready to watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of a classic, Sweet Home Alabama,\"  She said with a smile on her face as she looked down at Micheal. \"I've already made the popcorn.\"  They made their way downstairs to watch the movie.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning came a little too quickly for Michael, he was hoping for a meteor to hit the school or something, so that he wouldn't have to go to school in the form he's currently in.  \"Micheal it's time to get up and don't forget to clean your ears.\"  Michael's mom said to him as she pulled the covers off of him.  Michael was always a morning person, but since he got the routines from Lizzie, he has been a nightmare to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm up...  I'm up.\"  He said as he got out of his bed and did a big stretch to get himself moving.  He then did a quick graceful turn to the dresser and got his underwear ready for the shower.  As he reached down into the drawer, he noticed the light purple nails that he got the day before from the adventure to salon, courtesy of Mackenzie. After he got done with his shower, he checked his legs and determined that they didn't need to be shaved again, at least from his standpoint.  He finished getting himself ready and then made his way over to the closet to see what he would wear today for his first day at school.  Then he saw it, the outfit that he dreaded to wear.  The school girl uniform of St. Agnes's.  Micheal sighed as he begrudgingly put the uniform on and made his way down stairs to eat breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning, sis\" Jeremy called out as Michael reached the bottom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, I hope you guys didn't miss me too much last night at the game.\" Michael asked his friend as he pour himself a bowl of cereal.  Be unbeknownst to him, Jeremy actually swapped lives with Michael (Melody).  She did it so that she could keep a better eye on her life and so that Michael wouldn't mess it up too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's always a bummer when your not there, I mean, what did you have to do last night that made you not want to come?\"  Jeremy asked, but she already knew the answer, she wanted to see if Michael could see through the magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just didn't feel like it was all.\"  Michael replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't because of a list of names and traits that kept you, was it?\"  Jeremy asked back to him with a sly smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was in shock when he heard this, the only person who knew of the list was...\"Melody?!?\"  Michael asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy nodded, \"Yeah, but I switched names with him too, that's why you think of me as Jeremy.  Oh, and here are the cards back, Anna wanted to keep them 'safe', but I told her that I would give them back to you so that you know where they were at.\"  she stated to him.  \"I mainly did it so that if I wanted to use it later on, I would be able too as well, if you know what I mean.  Oh, I see that they got to you.\" She said as she pointed to his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I think they look good.\"  Michael said as the thought that was weird to say, 'It must be Madison's choice in clothing that made me say that.' Michael thought to himself.  Just then their Mom walked in to make sure they were eating and getting ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael did you remember to clean your ears like I asked, I would hate for them to get infected.\"  Their mom asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did it after I got out of the shower.\" He replied back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great are you guys ready to go to school?\" She inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" They both replied as they both grabbed their backpacks and made their way to the mini van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Michael made his way to the school he will be going to for the next week he saw his friends waiting for him in the front of the school.  He got out of the car and made his way over to the group and greeted them all with a hug.  \"So Mackenzie, are you going to try out for the track team this afternoon?\"  Michael wondered as he looked around the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hope I get on it, because then it would be a waste of getting your legs.\"  She said with a laugh, \"Oh and thanks for doing the spa thing last night, I finally got to spend some much needed time with Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it wasn't a problem, but you can see that your sister had fun with my hands.\" Michael said with a smirk.  The group of girls laughed as Mackayla showed the group her nice French Manicure that was on Michael's old pair of hands.  Just then the bell started to ring and the girls made their way to their homeroom classes. 'I get to go to Mr. Merriweather's History class first' Michael thought to himself.  'Thank you Melody for the information'</span></div></div>",

Everyone's but Philipp, who couldn't contain his joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" - So much power in my hands...Fear me, mortals!\" proclaimed Philipp, definitely amused by his friends reactions.<br>\r\n\" - Don't forget Uncle Ben's words! Something about power and responsibility\", continued Jeremy. <br>\r\n\" - Why so serious, Jeremy?\" replied Michael, with the best Heath Ledger's imitation a 13 year old girl's voice could perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which Jeremy, Philipp and Josie burst out laughing. Melody did not get the reference. Michael was too embarrassed to join them, self-conscious of his voice and shy about his laughter. Same for Anna, who was also the most worried about the upcoming swap.<br>\r\n\" - Stop wasting time! I don't want to risk another random swap!\", she suddenly irrupted. Everyone went silent, Michael's voice had its benefits she conceded.<br>\r\n\" - Way to kill the mood, girl. But you're right, let me think for a few seconds.\", reassured Philipp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was a bit of a pervert, he did not want to anger his friends: they <i>were</i> his friends, after all. Besides, he'd never get to play with the cards again if he went too far: \"Maybe the best course...would be to tread lightly\" Philipp thought to himself, never missing an opportunity to quote a TV show.<br>\r\n\"What are my options here? I could swap my bad eyesight away, or I could get taller. Michael's gaming rig would be nice too.<br>\r\nWho am I kidding? Of course I want to swap with one of the girls, the call of the boobs is too great. Josie's the best in that regard, but she's Michael's girlfriend ; Maybe I'll swap with her later, when the game will have progressed more. Anna however, she's not too bad either and I know Michael won't mind too much.... Plus, It'll be fun to make her more masculine with the provocative outfits she usually wears. Let's go for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" - Ok guys, I want to swaaaap..... \", Philipp announced<br>\r\nAnna rolled her eyes at this sad attempt of a cliffhanger<br>\r\n\" - chest with Anna\", finished Philipp triumphantly. \"Congratulations to the happy winner ;)\", joked Philipp.<br>\r\n\" - Noo! My breasts! Philipp, you're an asshole\", Anna replied. Which was a strange thing to hear since she had Michael's voice.<br>\r\n\" - And you're a sore loser. Keep playing and maybe you'll get your revenge. Don't worry, I'll take good care of them ;)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Anna's chest got flatter and flatter, hairier and hairier. She was really regretting her choice of clothes for tonight ; as usual, she had chosen to dress somewhat provocatively. But now her skirt and her low-neckline top were offering nothing but a sad view. <br>\r\n\" - Do you mind waiting me for a few minutes while I'm getting something more comfortable? I don't think you guys want to admire the view anymore\", Anna asked with a slight sadness in her voice.<br>\r\nNo one minded, and up she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp's chest on the contrary, got fuller and fuller. However, he had an advantage over Anna: since he was not very athletic or versed in fashion, his wardrobe was more on the comfy side. The slightly over-sized sweat-shirt he picked today was doing an acceptable job concealing his new assets (his lazy posture contributed as well). Quickly, he peeked into his sweat-shirt. A gaze that lasted a solid ten seconds: Anna's breasts were gorgeous, full and perky. He was taken out of his peering when Josie pinched one of his newly sensitive nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" - Ouch, that hurts like hell!\" moaned Philipp, instinctively moving one hand to his right breast in an attempt to alleviate the pain. It did not work, but he enjoyed the feeling nonetheless. He began fondling himself, as subtly as he could.<br>\r\n\" - You're putting quite a show, you know?\", teased Jeremy. As for Melody, she was starting to feel jealous to be less endowed than a <i>boy</i>. \"It was sooo unfair!\", she thought. She wished she could touch herself like that, but kept her thoughts to herself. Still, she could not look away from Philipp's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great regret, Philipp realized he could not take full advantage of his assets right at this moment and moved his hand away. He noticed however that crossing his arm felt a lot less comfortable than it used to, and the movement of his breasts when he changed position was very new, very noticeable, and a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Anna came back from upstairs, dressed in a modest t-shirt and pants. A lot more bland and functional than she was used to. She was not bothered however, for she had something in her mind.<br>\r\n\" - Hey guys, I've had an idea! What do you think about doing some activities every few rounds of poker? It'll make all the swapping more fun if we have to cope with the changes as they come. What do you think?\" <br>\r\nAnna was used to being a pretty, smallish girl since her teenage year. She was proud of her body, but she was also curious and sometimes envious of what it felt like to be tall and strong like the boys. When she was changing and discovering her masculine body in her bedroom, she realized this game could be an opportunity like no other to experience it first-hand. What better way than playful activities for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" - That's a great idea sis', that could be fun! I suggest the two swappees face each other in an activity the rest of us will chose\", replied Michael with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n\" - You know what Mike? You're too cute with your voice <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\", said Josie. Michael began blushing, which Josie found even cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" - So, what do you suggest we do?\" asked Philipp, a bit worried about where all of this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie was smiling, as she saw what Anna had in mind. \"ooh, this <i>will</i> be fun\", she thought.<br>\r\n\" - You two should jump rope!\" Josie suggested, giving a smile to Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone realized what it meant for Philipp, who hadn't got a bra with his swap, and everyone was on board with the idea. Everyone but Philipp, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, this was not a great moment for Philipp, whose breasts were hurting like he never experienced before. With every jump, his unsupported rack was pulling his torso up and down. Worst yet, his sensitive nipples were chaffing against his low-quality t-shirt. All the players were either laughing at Philipp's obvious uncomfortable sensations, or captivated by the movement of his ample bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna however was delighted. She used to like jumping rope a lot when she was younger, but the fun went away when her breasts began growing. She felt light, agile and swift like she hadn't for a few years. It felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept going for a few minutes and regain their places for the next round. Everyone was having fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp had mixed feelings. He was bracing himself in pain but was enjoying feeling his breasts anyway.<br>\r\nDespite starting the night angry, both for the loss of her legs and for missing an evening at the mall with her friends, Anna got into the game and was planning to have fun ridiculing the boys.<br>\r\nMichael was happy that his sister was having fun. Sure, they quarrel sometimes, but he cared about her anyway. <br>\r\nEven though she had not swapped anything yet, Josie was enjoying the evening too. Plus, she got to know Anna a bit more and was pleasantly surprised by how fun she seemed to be. She, too, was eager to feminize Michael.<br>\r\nMelody was mostly keeping to herself, a bit shy around her brother's older and more developed friends. She would not miss an opportunity to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey played the next hand, which was won by ....</span></div></div>",

The most worried were Josie, Philipp and Jeremy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie and Philipp had assets that any 13 year old girl would want to try. Philipp, especially, had noticed how she couldn't keep her eyes off his chest. He was proud about this, up until now that is.<br>\r\nJeremy was worried because of his position as the older brother. If she ever wanted revenge about anything he might have done in the past, she now was in a position to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could have imagined what she said, however.<br>\r\n\"humm, i would like to swap knowledge about mathematics with Jeremy. please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! why would you do that?!\", cried Jeremy<br>\r\n\"I have a test on Monday, and I don't want to spend, like, the weekend studying so I thought you could study for me, maybe? I wanted to go the mall and stuff with Emma and Alice you know? I thought maybe if we swap back on Sunday evening you will have your knowledge back for school, and I will be ready for the exam. And if we don't, I'll still have your knowledge so I'll do great anyway. Pretty clever right?\", said Melody.<br>\r\n\"I have to say that you are very clever indeed\", said Josie.<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Don't worry Jeremy, I'll help you if you happen to have trouble with 8th grade maths ;)\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you sis'. I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stood up to fetch some paper and a pen.<br>\r\n\"Melody, can you write the hardest math problem you can think of?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then casually proceeded to write an integral to be calculated. <br>\r\nWhen she was done, she handed the paper to Anna. Melody could not refrain from smiling when she saw her rising an eyebrow and frowning at the paper.<br>\r\nAnna gave the paper and the pen to Jeremy. \"Try to solve it now\".<br>\r\nThat's when Jeremy's heart sank. He was never gifted at maths, but he always put the work necessary to pass, spending evenings and weekends if he had to. And there he was, not able to even <i>understand</i> a problem his little sister wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you\", she said. \"It's easy, really!\".<br>\r\nShe kept talking about integrating this, and that, and writing symbols he did not understand. Nothing made sense to him anymore.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry big brother, someday you'll understand and you'll be as good as me :)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worst weekend ever\", thought Jeremy.<br>\r\n\"Phew, safe for now. Let's not tempt Melody further though\", thought Philipp, slouching forward and awkwardly crossing his arms on his chest.<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The idea of swapping something with Melody came to mind, but then again she was only 13 years old, she really didn't have anything worth \"borrowing\" for a while. Skipping past Jeremy and the pervert that was Philipp...Josie's eyes settled on her boyfriend, and her curiosity peaked. \"Okay...I want to swap genitals with Michael!\" she blurted out...surprising everyone...including her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to WHAT?\" Michael called out, almost shrieking in his girly new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had he said that...he felt his semi-erect penis retracting into his body...followed by his testicles. \"Ooh....that feels weird!\" he muttered quietly as his girlfriend's vagina formed between his legs...leaving him 'flat'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not weird...amazing!\" Josie grinned...as she rubbed the erection now forming a bulge under her long skirt. \"I was wondering how we could spice up our relationship, well...we can give this a try\" Josie winked at Michael, as the others just sighed and grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...okay\" Michael responded nervously, as he rubbed in between his legs...getting slightly aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want a dick?\" Melody suddenly asked Josie in Michael's deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that I'll know who really does have the better time during sex, men...or women!\" Josie responded with a smug smile. \"Maybe you should give it a try yourself the next time you win\" she then said to Melody, who just grimaced at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course when Michael does climax he'll probably squeal louder than you\" Philipp suddenly joked, looking at Josie as he referred to Michael having Melody's voice. Josie just ignored the comment, as did Michael...as he nervously gathered up the cards ready for the next hand.

This was an all new experience and she really could not wait for some \"alone time\" with Michael. \"Ok now... What do I want next?\", she mumbled and looked at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still nothing she wanted to swap with either Melody and Anna. To choose next was not something she wished and anticipated. She wanted to keep things interesting but did not want to swap anything she would regret swapping. Something minor would be wrong as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do? What do I do?\", she thought but could not come up with a possible solution. \"Then I have to continue swapping with Michael. But what? I think he would mind if I swap my boobs. But what else should I swap? How about... no...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I got it! I want to swap chests with Michael.\", she said finally. She was absolutely certain that he would not like it but there was nothing else that she wanted to swap. Also she wanted to experience sex completely as a man. Second plus for this swap was that Michael had a real problem to keep his hands of her breasts when they were alone. It was really annoying and now she could do it with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels strange to wear a bra for no reason...\", she mumbled and looked down at her flat chest which was slightly hairy. She then looked at Michael who looked shocked down at his new bust size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know why you swapped it...\", whispered Michael more to himself than to anybody else. \"They're big... Heavy... This will really be strange...\", he said, this time loud enough that everyone could understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now we get to see the whole thing.\", grinned Josie and looked at her boyfriend. She glided closer to Michael in order to whisper in his ear. \"Also I can now get back at you. Now I am the one who can't stop groping your breasts.\", she whispered grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shuddered. \"I hope we don't regret this...\", he mumbled and looked at his girlfriend. He would be lying if he told anyone that he did not find this exciting. Who would not? This was the ultimate secret. Sex from the other side. His face began to lighten up. \"But I'm really looking forward to this. This will be quite a unique experience.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you two lovebirds stop making out and continue playing?\", said Philipp annoyed that he had not yet won anything and worst of all that Michael now got the objects of his desire. Not that he could not swap them from Michael but it was just unfair that he got them much sooner on his chest than he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like there is someone jealous.\", grinned Anna who had leaned back and was relaxing a bit. She enjoyed seeing her brother transform into her sister. She wished for an older sister since she was young but all she got was Michael. Even if she found a way to make Josie her sister it would not be the way she wanted it. She wanted a cool older sister not someone like Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy meanwhile was fully occupied looking at his legs. He really had to admire how good they looked. If it were not so humiliating he would swap pants with Anna so he could show off his legs. \"Man, I'm starting to think like a girl... Which brings me to a question... Will girls find my new legs attractive?\", he asked himself in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp moaned out loud. \"Can we PLEASE continue playing?\". Everyone looked at him. \"Yeah, yeah. Don't be so impatient.\", said Josie and dealt the cards.</span></div></div>",

This look IS unbelievable. You sure you're not cheating?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie just shook her head finding it strange that there are no strands of hair swishing with her head. \"Calm down, will you? I'm not cheating, okay? How should I even do it? Philipp mixed the cards and you, Michael, found the cards. I haven't been in touch with them until we started playing.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you were the one who placed the cards here.\", theorized Philipp. It was obvious that he was annoyed that he did not win so far. It was less obvious what he wanted to swap but still obvious enough that it was something that belonged to Josie and well, now belonged Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're being ridiculous. I haven't seen this cards before and why should I place them there? I could have brought them to begin with. Now I should hurry with my swap.\". She looked at Michael. \"Sorry, sweet-heart. But I think this swap might help you a bit on the following days.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael gulped and prepared himself for the worst. \"I want to swap underwear with Michael.\", she said and the bra that was not filled by anything disappeared on her chest and the panties that were straining to contain her penis were replaced by more comfortable boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael meanwhile received a bra which held his big breasts and his crotch was covered by soft panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should call him Michelle now.\", grinned Philipp. \"Do you really have to be so mean?\", asked Jeremy who was still left with Anna's legs. \"I thought we were friends.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think he should continue being so mean.\", grinned Anna. \"This way I'm more amused.\". She certainly enjoyed that she did not win and was not involved in this swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody!\", said Philipp with a stern look. \"Deal! Now!\", he ordered. Melody was intimidated by this and quickly grabbed the cards. \"Will you stop shouting at my sister?\", asked Jeremy aggressively and nearly jumped out of the chair and in Philipp's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, man.

I just have luck. Believe me.\", she pleaded. \"Alright, alright. I believe you.\", he said. \"Then just choose something.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\", she mumbled and looked around. The last swap was a lucky one because she did not have to swap with her boyfriend and she noticed that she liked having breasts after all and she could tease Anna. Win-win situation. But what now? She wanted to keep her penis, she was very curious of what sex feels with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what should she swap then? There was nothing interesting there, right? Anna had nice legs but they were on Jeremy. Also she did not want to upset Michael. It would be strange for him to rub his legs against the ones of his sister. Well, it would not be that strange but strange enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie sighed. It was more of a curse to always win in this game, especially if there is nothing you want or it would result in something bad for the winner person. This lead to her conclusion that she had to continue swapping with Michael. She had looked at all alternatives and there was none she was interested in. Sure she could have swapped with Anna in order to get long hair back but it felt very interesting to have short hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly realised that the time limit was nearly over and she began to panic. \"I want to swap shoes with Michael!\", she screamed out, fearing that it might be too late to swap anything but her fears were for no reason. She looked down and saw Michael's white sneakers on her feet. Looking over to her boyfriend she found her low-heel pumps on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him with a big \"I'm sorry\"-smile. Michael just sighed and looked at his new shoes and then up to Philipp in order to silence him with an evil glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp gulped but then regained his old self. \"If Josie wins the next round, I'll quit! Then it is true that she must be cheating.\". Everyone, except Michael, agreed with him. Michael knew that Josie was not cheating.

Anna felt a tingling in her lower extremities again and she watched as her long, hairy male legs morphed into Josie's feminine ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...stay everyone, I'll quit playing if you want me to\" Josie murmured forlornly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone sit down,\" Michael then muttered in his girly tone, \"Except you Philipp, you can quit if you want to\" Michael added with a feigned smile, as he adjusted the bra holding his impressive D-Cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you give me your legs?\" Anna asked Josie, her voice dripping with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...I didn't want you to leave,\" Josie responded, \"Honestly, I'm not cheating!\" she then said, as she inspected her new hairy, male legs. \"I know mine aren't as pretty as your legs are, but I figured you'd like having female legs again\" Josie explained to Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you still have my boobs!\" Anna scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you win...you can swap with Michael and take mine!\" Josie told her, causing Michael to frown. He didn't like that idea as he was actually starting to enjoy having his girlfriend's breasts, not to mention her vagina and hair, even her shoes. Reluctantly, Anna sat back down...as did Melody and Jeremy, they were willing to give Josie another chance. Philipp however, chagrined that he hadn't yet acquired what he lusted after the most (Josie's breasts) wasn't sure what he was planning to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal the cards please!\" Josie mumbled to Michael, hoping to god that she didn't win again. There was very little of her original body left, apart from certain aspects of her female anatomy that remained...she was very much a boy now.</span></div></div>",

Horrible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... If you say so...\", Michael said and folded his cards. \"Still no luck...\", he sighed in his girly voice and leaned back. The breast on his chest were incredible. They felt heavy but he enjoyed having them. Maybe he could talk Josie into keeping them for a while longer. On the other han the clear void in his unfamiliar panties was strange but kind of exciting. Josie was right, the idea of having sex this way was really exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair which he had done into a ponytail even though he struggled to do so, felt kinda nice. It smelled good. No wonder that Josie always needs so much time in the bathroom with her hair and everything but the time sure is worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie sighed with a relief as she folded as well. \"Finally, I'm not the winner.\", she said with a glad smile.

Maybe you should swap something other than body parts or clothing?\", suggested Josie who was really glad that she did not win this time.

Just like herself he was not himself anymore. Few was left of what really was his. He currently possessed her hair, breasts, vagina, underwear, shoes and Melody's voice.

Anna looked at him and you could easily guess that she was not happy about the swap either. \"I think this feeling is mutual.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. To think that these two are going to live under the same roof...\", Michael in his girly voice sighed. \"I think we can call an ambulance cause in the next 24 hours one of them might get deadly injured.\", he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be intersting to have a cool brother like you.\", smiled Melody. \"Especially since you're more my sister now.\", she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I have one question though...\", Josie then got into the conversation. \"How did the swap actually work? Did it make Melody part of Michael's family or Michael part of Melody's family?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question.\", Michael said, brushing a strand of his long, red hair, which had been losened out of his ponytail, away. \"And the only way to answer this question is to look at someone's ID.\". Michael looked at Melody. He would have gotten his own ID out but that was in his room right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody quickly grabbed her purse and got out her student ID. There she saw that her last name was...</span></div></div>",

Now you just want to quit?\". She was slightly angry at him now. \"I say we keep playing. Otherwise I could have kept my legs!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right though.\", Anna suddenly said. \"I can understand her. I lost my legs today as well and it would be a punch into the face if we would just quit right now.\". Josie looked disbeliviengly at Anna. \"My ears are still working correctly, right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked at Josie. \"Yes, they do. It doesn't happen that often but sometime I agree with you.\", she said. \"But Michael has a point.\", Jeremy then tried to get the attention. \"There's next to nothing left of him. He looks more like Josie and has suddenly lost his family and got a new one. This cards really might be too dangerous to use. Who knows what else had changed just to accomodate these changes?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But aren't the cards meant for this?\", asked Melody. \"We should use them to experience something different, right?\". Jeremy had to agree, she had a point there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... But... On the other hand, too many swaps aren't good either. It'll be hard for someone to lose his complete identity at once.\", Jeremy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should let the person we're talking about decide if we should continue or not.\", Josie suggested and looked at Michael. \"Would that be ok? But remember I sacrificed my legs for you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded, which resulted in swining of the tail of his long, red hair. Now that he heard the opinions he thought about what to do now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others wanted to continue. Well, two of them. He wanted to quit but on the other hand he did not want to let his friends down, especially since Josie might get angry because of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself, at the breasts and bra he now had on, at the low heel pumps he currently wore and the nude pantyhose his feet and legs were covered in. What he could not see but feel was the vagina along with the panites he currently wore as well as the girly voice he currently possessed. To make it even worse: He now seemed to have another family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then decided:</span></div></div>",

I think the changes for me are enough for the moment. I just want to keep myself, okay?\", he explained to her. Josie sighed. \"Okay... If this is what you want... Then we stop playing for now...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was as disappointed as Josie was. She wanted to play as well in order to get atleast a pair of boobs back. On the other hand she did not want to end like her former brother did. \"Then we meet again in two days.\", she said, stood up and was the first to leave the table. She immediately went upstairs into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody smiled at Michael. At least she got a nicer brother. This are going to be the best two days in her life. \"Come on then.\", she said cheerfully in her deep voice. \"Let's get home, Michael.\". Before Michael could respond, Melody was already at the door. Michael looked at Jeremy. \"I hope you enjoy your new family.\", he said. \"See you tomorrow.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael grabbed Josie's hand and the two followed Melody. \"See ya.\", Jeremy said and closed the door behind the three of them. \"Great... I'm now living in my best friends house...\", he sighed and went upstairs, feeling strange to walk around in his female legs. At first he wanted to knock on Anna's door but then he decided against it. She would just shout at him instead of help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went into Michael's room which was now his room. Jeremy was surprised that the room really looked more like his own than Michael's. Everything he possessed was there even though slightly rearranged in order to fit into the different layout of Michael's room. \"Amazing.\", gasped Jeremy surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wandered around the room and held his breath. The power of the cards were really quite unique. He sat down infront of his computer and looked at Facebook. His account and everything staid the same, luckily he had not used his last name as an email address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more interesting thing were the photos he found there. In most of them, Jeremy was showing off his female legs. \"It seems I'm very proud of them...\", he muttered. \"Man... This two days are certainly going to be very interesting.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Melody, Josie and Michael reached the Parker's house. Josie turned off the engine of her car and the three got into the house. \"Weird... To think I'm going to live here for the next two days...\", mumbled Michael. \"Don't worry. You can do it.\", smiled Josie and tried to cheer him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the three were greated by Elizabeth Parker, Melody's and now Michael's mother. \"Ah, you're back.\", she smiled. \"I can't understand why you wanted to celebrate your birthday over at Jeremy's but I hope you had fun.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael simply nodded. \"Yeah, er- mom.\". He found it strange to call another woman mom. \"It was quite a unique birthday...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled. \"Good then.\", she said. \"I can make you three some dinner if you want.\". Melody shook her head. \"No thanks, mom. We already ate there.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\", she smiled. \"Oh and Josie. I'm sorry but you can't stay over tonight. I know it's Michael's birthday but I'm just not comfortable with the thought. \"It's okay, Mrs. Parker.\", Josie said. \"I'll just stay here for a little if that's fine. I don't want to leave my boyfriend so soon on his birthday.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth nodded and three went upstairs. They quickly headed into Jeremy's old room and were surprised that it changed to look like Michael's just a few changes here and there to make it fit. \"Amazing.\", gasped Michael not knowing that this was the first thing Jeremy said when he saw his new room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody nodded agreeingly. \"Yeah...\". She then looked at Michael. \"You can come over and do something with me when Josie is away.\", she smiled. \"You know, like brother and sister.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael wanted to say no because he needed time for himself to make up his mind but when he looked at her he could not say no anymore. \"Alright...\", he said and Melody walked out of the room cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the two were alone Josie looked at Michael and grinned. \"Now...\", she said. \"How about I steal you virginity?\". Michael looked at her confused. \"But we have done it be- Oh, that you mean.\", he said looking down at his nearly complete female body. Josie grinned even wider. \"Yeah, that I mean.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael thought about it for a moment. \"Okay.\", he agreed even though he was not sure if this was the best idea. \"Good.\", Josie said seductivley. \"First we have to get you out of your clothes.\", she said and grabbed his t-shirt and pants and got them off of him as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael now stood there in Josie's underwear. His pink lacy bra held his D-Cups and the matching pink panties hid his vagina. His legs were still encased in the nude pantyhose Josie put on this morning. On his feet were still the low heel pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie still grinned. \"You look hot.\". Michael looked at her a bit embarressed. \"Shouldn't you take off your clothes as well?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie shook her head. \"That comes later.\". Michael then kicked off his pumps. \"Could you er... help me out of your... er... my pantyhose.\", he stummered and Josie helped him grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same motion she clapsed his bra open and got if off of his chest, letting his breasts hang loosely. \"Your boobs are wonderful.\", grinned Josie, well knowing that these are her boobs in reality. \"I think the panties stay on. At least till I'm undressed.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to dance slightly and got off her blouse which revealed her C-cups, originally belonging to Anna and kicked off her shoes in the same motion. She then got her skirt off, revealing her hairy and male legs in full glory. \"Just don't look at them, okay?\", Josie said slightly embarressed at her legs. She then got her boxers she got from Michael through a swap off and revealed Michael's former penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe penis was already errected. \"I see there is someone very excited.\", joked Josie. Michael gulped. Now he had doubts if he really wanted to do this but when he looked at Josie and how much joy she had in her eyes, he knew this would be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid himself on the bed. \"Then come over here.\", he said and spread his arms. \"Take me.\". He stopped for a second. He had never thought he would ever say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie rubbed her raging hard-one. \"You don't have to tell me twice.\".</span></div></div>",

Strange to have them for sure, but it felt different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door let him wince. \"It's me!\", blurted Anna like her usual friendly self and entered the room without even waiting for his answer. \"I hope you're not doing something weird with them! I know you're probably jerking off or anything.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerem looked at Anna annoyed. \"I assume you don't come in here just to tell me your paranoid theories, do you?\". Anna grinned broadly. \"Clever boy.\". She sat down on Jeremy's bed and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me the cards.\", she ordered. \"You already saw them when we were playing.\", said Jeremy and looked at her as if she has got something between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I just want to see them.\". Jeremy sighed and got out the cards. \"Here. What do you want?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna grabbed the cards and looked at them. \"Well...\", she began. \"I was thinking of ways to use the cards for my advantage.\". She grinned at him. \"Think about it. I could swap with someone rich and get rich myself.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you could surely decide which hands win, mh?\", he said, raising an eyebrow. \"That is what I was going to work out. There has to be a way. Maybe I should mark the cards.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy shook his head. \"Won't help you. That way you just know when to fold.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Mh... But there has to be a way!\", she looked at the deck from all angles. \"Something... Just one trick.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would have to find someone really stupid who never played poker before. You explain to him that only one person mixes the whole time and you have to learn how to mix the cards so you win every time. But seriously, where would you find such a stupid person?\", Jeremy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mh... I think...\", Anna stood up. \"I'll leave you alone now, dear brother.\", she said polite and got out of the room. Jeremy looked confused after her. \"What's gotten into her now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then wanted to put the cards away again but noticed they were gone. \"Oh no...

Michael just breathed heavy and looked at how the big orbs positioned on his chest were moving up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.\", he gasped and looked at his male looking girlfriend. She on the other hand grinned at him. \"I said it would be, didn't I?\". Michael nodded astonished and in agreement. \"You did.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sat up in the bed. \"Well then.\", she said and got dressed. Michael looked at her. \"You're just leaving now?\", he asked disappointed. She turned her head. \"Isn't that what man normally do?\", she joked. \"I just think it would be better if I get dressed as soon as possible. It would be arkward if your new mom comes in and sees me naked.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\". Michael sat up as well and grabbed his bra, strands of his red hair were falling into his face. \"Can't believe I really have to wear one.\", he mumbled and looked down at his chest. \"I can't believe I have them...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie who was now fully dressed looked at him. \"No don't put that one on.\". Michael looked at her confused. \"Why not?\", he asked. \"You're my little dress up doll now.\", she explained and went over to his waderobe and opened the underwear drawer. \"And for now I want you to wear... Where did \"you\" put it?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at his girlfriend rummaging through his underwear drawer and looking for a bra to wear for him. If someone had told him this morning that this was going to happen, he would have thought that this guy would be insane. But this was for real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Josie found what she was looking for and proudly presented a black, seethrough bra with a sexy flower pattern. \"I never saw you were it.\", Michael gasped surprised. \"No wonder. I just got it two days ago. I wanted to wear it today and surprise you but then I thought it was a better idea to show it to you on our anniversary next month.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\". She throw it over to him. \"Put it on.\", she ordered. Michael caught the bra and looked at it if it was some alien artifact. \"But I have no idea how...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie sighed. \"I can't help you. Tomorrow morning you will have to put one on and I'm not around. And no you can't wear it over night.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just ask Melody to help me put it on.\", he responded but Josie look at him told him that he would not do it anyway. \"Yeah, you're right.\", he sighed and began putting it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was amazed that he found himself able to put it on without problem. \"How come I suddenly know how to do this?\", he asked Josie. \"The way I see it, it might be the cards. They probably gave you the ability.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked over to her boyfriend who was sitting unsure on his bed and positioned the bra in a more comfortable position. She smiled and brushed one strand of his red hair behind his ear. \"It suits you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at his girlfriend. He kind of like being treated like a girl. \"Thanks.\", he smiled. \"Did you buy matching panties?\", he asked. \"Of course I did, duh.\". She went back to the closet, got the panties out and threw them to him just like she did with the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael caught them and put them on as well. \"Well, what do you think?\", he grinned. \"Sexy.\", she responded and kissed him. \"I could get used to seeing you like this.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael blushed slightly. \"Maybe we should keep it that way.\", he grinned. Josie cocked her head and grinned as well. \"Yeah, wouldn't be so bad, eh?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they were interrupted by a knock. \"Sorry to interrupt you two, but it's getting late and Josie has to go home.\", Michael's new mom Elizabeth said from the other side of the door. Fortunately she did not burst in like Michael's old mom would have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom.\", Michael shouted back and for the first time since quite a while he realised that his voice had been swapped. He really grew to used to the swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael threw his t-shirt and pants back on but left the pantyhose were it was and guided Josie to the door. \"See you tomorrow.\", she smiled and both exchanged a passionate kiss before departing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael closed the door behind Josie and then went back upstairs. Like he promised he went over to Melody's room. \"Hey... sis...\", he said finding it stange to call her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro.\", she smiled happily. \"I thought we could braid our hair.\", she suggested in Michael's deep voice. \"Since you now have Josie's wonderful hair this will be fun.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at her bright face and could not say no to her. \"Okay fine... But I have no idea how to do it.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\", she smiled. \"I'll show you.\". Michael took seat beside his sister and let her show what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Michael had two braids in his red hair, while Michael just managed one braid for Melody before bed time. After brushing his teeth, Michael followed Josie's advice and got the bra off. Fortunately he still had his own pajamas.</span></div></div>",

Minutes later he heard a knock on his door. \"Mom said you should get up and don't just turn off the alarm like you usually do!\", he heard a very familiar voice shouting from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My own voice?\", he mumbled and heard a high pitched voice instead of his own. Shocked, he got up quickly and felt two short braids banging against his neck. His hand went quickly over to his neck and he grabbed the braids. That let something on his chest moving up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shocked he looked down and saw two big orbs on his chest. It was then that he remembered what had happened yesterday. \"Oh yeah right...\", he mumbled in his girly voice. \"The cards...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got out of the bed and started with getting the sexy bra Josie showed him yesterday back on. Sure he could have gone with something more conservative but he found himself so sexy in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly occured to him that he had to shower so putting it on now was completely pointless. \"I'm not really me today...\", he joked and got into the bathroom were he got into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later he was dressed in the sexy underwear, a blue shirt and brown shorts and went down into the kitchen. \"Morning.\", he said to his \"mom\" and \"dad\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody not here, yet?\", he asked. \"Your sister went back up again. She'll be down any minute.\", his mother explained and gave him his favorite cereals. \"Thanks.\", he said and began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody came down minutes later. Nobody asked her why she went up again. The family ate breakfast quitely and soon Michael and Melody had to go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael slipped the low heel pumps he found himself wearing after the swap back on and got out of the house with Melody. Both their schools were not too far away, so both walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael and Melody did not talk during the walk. They had no idea what they should be talking about right now. \"I have to go that way.\", she said after a while and pointed in one direction. \"See you after school.\", she said and went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you.\", Michael replied and went the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later he arrived at school and went in. There was no sign of Josie, Jeremy or even Philipp yet. Michael shrugged his shoulders and just went to his locker. Just when he wanted to grab his books someone pressed against the locker door and closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your help Michael!\", said a serious looking Anna. Michael stepped back frightened. \"I have a plan to use the cards to my advantage.\", she explained before he even could get his mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy had this idea that I could use them if I found someone stupid and who had never played poker in his life before.\", she continued explaining. \"So, I thought about Nancy McDonnel. She's really, really stupid but I don't have to tell you that, but incredibly rich. I'm sure she never played poker in her life.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael got his senses back and looked at her confused. \"And why do you need my help?\", he asked. \"I can't get her to play with me. She hates me since I accidently dropped my food on her dress.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want me to ask her to play with us?\", he asked to make sure what she wanted from him. \"But you can't say for sure you win.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you have to ask her and yes I can manipulate it. We just tell that only one person, me, mixes and deals the cards. I practised all night and I'm now ablte to make it look like I mix the cards but still can decide who gets what cards.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you think should I get her to play with us?\". Anna shrugged her shoulders. \"That would be your problem. I can't solve everything, can I? So. Do you help me or not? We could get rich!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael thought about it for a moment and then decided what to do:</span></div></div>",

We just say it'll be good for her reputation.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mh... Fine... I'll see what I can do... Meet me after lunch, okay?\", Michael said and went to his first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked after him. \"Thanks.\", she smiled. \"You're the best.\". She began thinking about all the possibilities she had as soon as she swapped lives with this rich idiot. People will think she'll be stupid but who cares? She will be rich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to have slowed down for Anna but eventually lunch time approached and she could see Michael talking to Nancy. From far it seemed as if she agreed to it, although it was pretty hard to read her snobbish face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna smiled and hoped her former brother succeeded. Not moving her eyes away from the two, she ate her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtfer lunch Michael walked over to her, his braids swinging rhythmically. \"And? Did she say yes?\", asked Anna him excited. Michael nodded. \"Yeah she did. I told her it was some kind of internet blog thing.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna grinned broadly. \"Great. When will she do it?\". \"After school. Luckily I talked her out of the idea that we should be wearing fancy dresses.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, \"bro\".\", she grinned. \"Now we just need a host. Who should we ask? Jeremy would be fine I think but Josie is more charismatic.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie might think this is some bad idea. She doesn't like to play tricks on people.\", you thought loudly. \"Jeremy might want to help us but I don't think if he can impersonate a beliveable host.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna decided you two should go ask...</span></div></div>",

She might probably endanger this whole plan.\", explained Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael swished his long, red hair back and looked at his former sister. \"I think you're right.\", he said, adjusting his bra strap. \"My lovely Josie is just too kind to participate in such a heinous plan.\". Anna rolled her eyes. \"Whatever. Come on, girly boy.\", she teased him and both walked over to the other end of the cafeteria where Jeremy was sitting with Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two finally deign to talk with us. What an honor.\", Jeremy said sarcastically. \"Just shut up, bro. I need to talk to you.\", replied Anna, grabbed Jeremy on his arm and dragged him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\", asked the male looking Josie her female looking boyfriend. Michael shrugged with his shoulders and pretended he did not know anything about it. Would be the best if Josie did not know about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I thought we could go shopping after school.\", Josie suggested. \"I thought about some bras and panties for you, maybe some shoes. You know, stuff.\". Josie, with her flat chest, bulge in her pants and her short hair grinned broadly at her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting to know a kinky side of you.\", Michael grinned back. \"But unfortunately I've got to be elsewhere after school. I don't think it'll take too long, how about we meet an hour after school at the mall, okay?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie raised an eyebrow in suspicion. \"Aha? What do you have to do?\". Michael gulped. \"You know... Stuff. I've er... got to help coach Johnson to er... arrange everything for the game tomorrow.\", he stummered and hoped Josie would believe him. She would surely try to sabotage their plan if she found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie nodded slightly. \"Okay. We then meet later at the mall.\", she said and Michael was relieved that she believed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school day felt like eternity for Anna. She could not wait to finally get to swap something with that bitch Nancy. The whole day she was now praciticing mixing cards in order to deal the cards like she wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Jeremy decided to help her without wanting something in return. It was weird but maybe he was not so bad after all. Or he had something in mind. Anyway, Anna was now on the way to the room where Michael and Jeremy already built up a videocam as well as the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Anna and the cards were there, the only one left was Nancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical.\", groaned Anna. \"The bitch is too late every damn time.\". She crossed her arms like she usually did if she was annoyed and looked over to her former brother who had done his hair in a more fashionable way, with a curly, strand hanging off each of his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why and how did you do that with your hair anway?\", she asked. Michael shrugged his shoulders. \"Just thought it would be more appropriate. I didn't have the time to get a suit or something so I thought I should have my hair in a more fashionable way. Apparently I received some skills I would need with these hair as well as some equipment like the curler I used.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna shook her head. \"You're trying to look good for that bitch? Can't believe it.\". Michael gloomed at her. \"It has to look that way. She would suspect something otherwise.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\", mumbled Anna and the three sat down and waited for Nancy.</span></div></div>",

On her legs she wore tight white jeans and on her feet some white 2-inch heel pumps. In her hair were some sunglasses and over her arm was an expensive designer purse slung. If white was the colour of innocence than she needed to wear black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, we were waiting for you.\", smiled Anna, looking as nice as possible which scared both Michael and Jeremy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy pushed her long, blond hair behind her ear with a snobbish attitude. \"Whatever.

She took the sunglasses she still had in her hair and put them in her purse which she then put down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really hard to not feel superior when you're Nancy.\", she thought and looked at herself. \"Now I'm not sure if I want to give my former brothers their fair share. I'm better than them, aren't I?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then her thoughts were interrupted by a man who looked like a snobbish designer or something like that. His nose was raised to the ceiling and he wore a white men's blouse which was open in the front and showed his shaved chest. He also wore tight, black, leather jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Anna.

She had no idea what the usual was but she had no idea what he did in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe discovered that he did her hair into a more fashionable way. Afterwards he did her fingernails as well as her toe nails. After waxing off all her unnecessary body hair Anna was finally released but felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're looking perfect.\", Alfredo said. \"This is my best work.\".

She was not quite sure if it was really hers but as she looked in the tremendous waderobe and recognised some of Nancy's outfits, she was certain that this was now her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was big. Really big. Inside were a big bed, a big mirror, hell everything in this room was big. Anna amazed at the number of different make-up articles she now owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really like this.

What are you doing here?\", one of the cooks, a rather fat one, dressed in the typical white clothing with the typically cook hat, asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, just wanted to grab something to eat.\", answered Anna, not quite sure why everyone was so shocked to see her. \"Ah, but you could have told Alfred.\", the cook answered. \"We'll prepare something for you.

A blue, knee-length, glittery dress with showed a lot of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put it on and looked at herself in the big mirror. \"I'm hot.\", she grinned. \"It seems now I'm dressing as provocatively as Nancy.

Easier said than done. The waderobe was huge, let alone the collection of shoes which was positioned just beneath all the dresses, skirts, tops and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while she found a matching pair of strappy sandals with 4-inch heels. Anna looked at herself and grinned broadly. \"I'm really looking hot.\", she smiled. Just then someone knocked on the door.

He could not believe that he lost so close to Jeremy and therefore could not get his hands on Josie's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we know about the time limit, I should think quickly.\", Jeremy mumbled, \"And maybe something funny. Maybe swapping something what would be interesting.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy cocked his head from one side to another, looking at his friends and Anna. \"How about getting something else from you Anna?\", he said sheepishly but only got a disgusted grunt from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy shook his head. \"Nah, wouldn't be funny.\". Jeremy stroke his new shapely and shaven legs while thinking. His best friend Michael looked at him with concern. \"You should hurry.\", he said with his new high-pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. How about this? I want to swap lives with...\". Jeremy wanted to say Michael. In his opinion it would be funny swapping lives with his best friend. After all they knew themselves since they went to elementary school so there was not really something they did not know about the other. Also it should just be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, things did not go like planned. Anna who was bored and had taken out her phone and texted her friends. In exact the moment Jeremy wanted to say the magic words, Anna received a call and immediately answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis however disturbed Jeremy. \"Anna, could you please stop that-\", Jeremy continued nearly instantly and realized too late what he said. Within the blink of his eyes he suddenly found himself on another chair and on another side of the table. He heard a girl speaking to him through a cellphone he held in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ya doing, Jeremy?\", the girl asked. Jeremy was stunned and stammered sillables and quickly hang off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, Jeremy?!\"; Anna cursed and looked at him. \"You swapped our lives?! Are you insane?!\", she yelled and stomped her hand on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't mean to... I wanted...\", Jeremy stammered. \"I thought it would be f-funny swapping lives with Michael. And then... Then you redirected my attention. Because of your stupid phone!\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, things can't be reverted for 48 hours so you two should be glad that you didn't end up being physical transformed because of the life swap.\", Michael tried to calm the two down, still adjusting to his new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it swap anyway?\", Josie asked curiously. \"Except for the positions they were before.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'm still called Jeremy. I still have my body and clothes.\", Jeremy explained, \"The girl Anna was just receiving a call seemed to want to talk with me so I think I have at least her friends.\". Looking inside his pockets he found his wallet. Inside he found an ID. Looking at it he found something incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ID was his photo as well as his first name. So far correct. Then there were the wrong things. First of all he did not have a middle name and it was certainly not Elizabeth. His last name was different as well. Instead of Parker like his correct last name was, there now was Ferguson. His gender was wrong. He was male not female. And his birthday was like the rest wrong. According to this he was now 15 years old and not 16 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I think I only kept my first name, body and clothes. According to this I'm Jeremy Elizabeth Ferguson, 15 years old and a girl.\". Looking at the cellphone he put on the table right after he hung up he concluded something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that every other article which is not included in clothes got swapped. Otherwise this phone couldn't be mine. Also it seems that purses are regarded as clothing because the ID was in my pockets and I can't find a purse around here and by looking at Anna I think the same goes for Make-Up.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna has stopped grumbling and stood up. \"I go up to my room! Your stupid game just makes everything worse!\", she grunted and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you go home?\", Jeremy asked grinning. \"Don't forget you're me now. Also you can't go now. You have to take Melody with you, she's your sister now.\". Jeremy was not comfortable with the thought of living Anna's life but he enjoyed it to pick on her. \"And by looking at her, I would say she doesn't want to go now.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna crossed her arms angrily. \"Fine, I'll stay but I quit! I don't want anything to happen to me again!\", she said and tossed herself some inches away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\", Josie said. \"Let's continue without Mrs. Spoilsport.\".

This could put a serious damper on their relationship if she's always going to be a goody-goody, he thought.  Then an idea hit him.

Compared to making me and Michael in a relationship, that's pretty tame,\" said Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some things are better left a mystery,\" Phillip said with a smirk.  Then he leaned in to Josie and whispered into her ear.  \"Sorry about that babe, I figured switching her bitchy personality with yours would protect us from any torment she might come up with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie nodded.  That did make sense.  She knew from her time with Michael what a bitch Anna could be.  She didn't want to be on the wrong side of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, still have any complaints about messing with the rest of these guys?\" Phillip asked in a whisper.  Josie thought about it.  She knew a moment ago she had been complaining about that, but for the life of her, she couldn't figure out why.  The idea of screwing with Michael, Anna, Jeremy, and Melody sounded pretty fun.  No wonder she liked Phillip so much, they were so alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, let's have some fun\" Josie whispered back, an evil gleam in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, everyone else was just confused.  But Michael was still hoping to undo some of the mayhem, so he dealt the cards.</span></div></div>",

Pretend Josie swapped relationships with Jeremy instead of Anna, and that Michael and Jeremy were the ones that were mad.  And that Anna had decided to get back in on the action.].<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!  It's about time something good happened\" Jeremy said, seeing that Michael had won.  \"What are you going to swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I can't swap back how Josie feels about me for 48 hours.  If I swap my relationship with you to her, it would be weird for her to be my girlfriend now that she's my sister.  I am tempted to swap how I feel with Phillip with her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, Josie and Phillip both looked sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... but I don't think I could live with finding Phillip attractive, even to save Josie. So I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillip and Josie snickered to themselves, so far their plan to stop Michael from separating them had worked perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better hurry, you don't want something swapped for you,\" Phillip urged his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.  Okay, I want to swap lives with Phillip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Phillip yelled, but it was too late.  He was already sitting in what had been Michael's chair, looking at Michael sitting next to Josie.  Josie immediately pulled away from Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ick.  Just because you're in his spot doesn't mean I want to be with you.  I still like him.\"  Josie stoop up and walked over to stand next to Phillip.  She reached out and held his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you can't win them all Michael,\" Phillip smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well neither can you.  Unless you think Mrs. Ferguson is going to be okay with her son and daughter dating!\" retorted Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" gasped Josie.  Everyone except Melody looked at their licenses.  At this point, it was getting tough for the group to keep track of who was who.  A quick look around the ids confirmed: Phillip and Josie Ferguson, brother and sister.  Josie and Phillip looked at each other uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we know we're not really brother and sister, it's just this game.  You haven't ruined anything,\" said Phillip, but both he and Josie looked uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy stared at his id.  Jeremy Elizabeth Mason.  In a few rounds, he had gone from a Parker to a Ferguson to a Mason.  And he was still considered a girl.  \"Great,\" he mumbled.  \"Now I'm not even sure whose girlfriend I'm supposed to be, Michael's or Phillip's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked around what was formerly Michael's, now Phillip's, bedroom.  On the desk, where Michael kept a picture of him and Josie at the beach, was a picture of Phillip and Jeremy at the beach.  Michael pointed to the picture.  \"I guess that answers that question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, meanwhile, looked at her id.  Anna Justin Parker.  16 year old male.  She still felt like herself, but now the world saw her as Melody's older brother.  Although she wasn't happy, given the recent turnabout to Phillip of being in love with his sister but having a guy for a girlfriend, things could be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If everyone is done figuring out who they are, can we get back to the game?  I'm not ready to quit yet,\" said Anna, dealing the cards.</span></div></div>",

Now I can get to work on getting my life back,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, wait,\" Michael interrupted.  \"I know you aren't happy about being stuck as Jeremy for two days, but think about it.  You can't swap lives back, so no matter what, you're still going to be seen by everyone as a guy for two days.  Instead of trying to get something like your legs back, how about you do me a favor and I'll give you the money in wallet.  We all know Phillip comes from money, so let's see, there's one hundred dollars in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Phillip yelled.  \"That is so unfair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.  Don't talk to me about unfair you backstabbing girlfriend thief.  You should have thought of that before you took Josie.\" Michael said to Phillip, relishing finally being able to make him unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna thought about what her former brother had said.  It's true, she was stuck in Jeremy's life, unless she wanted to swap lives with Josie.  But then she was worried she might end up somehow making herself fall for Phillip, which she had no intention of.  Better to be stuck in a boy's life than that, or being seen as a middle schooler again if she swapped with Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine ex-bro, I accept.  And I'm guessing I know what you want me to swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and Michael whispered together quickly, then Anna quickly said, before the two minutes ran out, \"I want to swap how Josie feels about me with Phillip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Phillip yelled.  \"I hate you guys so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The feeling is mutual,\" Michael replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being such a whiner 'bro,'\" Josie said.  Josie looked at Phillip.  She knew a minute ago she felt desire for him, but now she couldn't find anything about him she liked.  Her dislike of Anna was now applied to Phillip.  Then she looked at Anna.  Even though Josie didn't think of herself as a lesbian, she felt attracted to Anna.  Although the world might see her as a boy, to Josie, she was still a girl.  Josie moved her chair away from Phillip, closer to Anna, but not right next to her.  She wasn't sure how to deal with her feelings just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael opened his wallet and gave all his money to Anna, with a heartfelt thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play again!  This is fun!\" Melody said.  No one else was sure they agreed with her about the fun part, but they all had things they still wanted to swap.</span></div></div>",

Due to all the swapping, she had been ping-ponged around the most, now being Phillip's sister, while disliking him as much as she used to dislike Anna.  She was no longer anyone's girlfriend, and she now was in love with Anna, who was a boy to everyone except the five of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Anna, I'd say turnabout is fair play.  You wanted to make me like you, well two can play at that game.  I want to swap how Anna feels about me with Phillip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gasped.  Suddenly Anna felt an overwhelming lust for Josie.  Now she understood why Phillip had created this whole mess in the first place, Josie and her chest were hot!  But she wasn't gay!  She didn't like girls.  Anna thought to herself, she still found herself attracted to boys if she thought about them, and not other girls, but when she looked at Josie, she felt an almost primal lust for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confusing, isn't it?\" Josie asked with a smirk.  She knew the conflicting emotions Anna was experiencing, since she experience them herself.  Anna blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillip, for his part, no longer felt like Josie was all that attractive.  In fact, he found her a little annoying and holier-than-thou (just like Anna used to).  He wasn't even interested in her breasts anymore, although breasts in general still excited him.  This was indeed a strange game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think this is what anyone expected from tonight.  Should we stop now, before things get even weirder?\" Jeremy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no one wanted to back out yet, so another hand was dealt.  Who won this time?</span></div></div>",

I'll make you not even want one.  I want to swap Phillip's sexual preference with Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" yelled Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" Phillip stuttered.  He closed his eyes for a second.  \"YOU MADE ME GAY!  You are dead if I win again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful there Phillip,\" Josie teased, \"we all know that kind of passionate outburst is really hiding underlying sexual desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillip looked away, no snappy comeback rising up in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, meanwhile, looked over at Josie again.  Where before she was conflicted about her feelings of attraction for the busty redhead, now she felt fully attracted to her naturally.  She was attracted to not just Josie's rack, but her feminine curves, her pretty long red hair, her made-up face, the whole girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie...\" Anna whispered to her, \"come here.\"  Josie stood up and walked over to Anna.  She was shocked as Anna stood up and kissed her full on the lips.  Everyone else at the table watched in awe as Josie, surprised, found herself returning the blonde girl's kiss.  Anna pulled away, leaving Josie gasping and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that...\" she stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was how I feel about you.  And there's more where that came from.\"  Anna smiled a predatory smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie blushed, then whispered to Anna.  \"I liked that, but I don't like girls.  I'm not sure this is going to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna whispered back.  \"Hey, the world sees me as a boy for the next two days already.  Why don't we work on making me more into one, that way you can enjoy me as much as I enjoy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie smiled and nodded.  Melody and the boys didn't know exactly what was going on, but they could tell Anna and Josie were up to something.  Another hand was dealt.</span></div></div>",

Micheal wasn't really worried about Melody's innocence, he was just a little uncomfortable with how physical his sister and girlfriend were being.  At least it was better than seeing her with Phillip, but it still stung to see her this attracted to someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Melody,\" Josie said with a smile.  \"I got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm not some little baby.

Anna's chest was now uncovered, fitting since she didn't need any support.  But her silk panties had also changed into Jeremy's loose boxers.  If felt weird to be almost wearing a set of shorts underneath her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy suddenly felt his chest pulled up by the new garment that appeared beneath his shirt.  He had to admit that Anna was right, having the bra did feel a little better than just having his new breasts hang, although it was extremely weird to him to feel something wrapped around his chest and shoulders.  He was less happy with the panties that replaced his boxers.  They were silky and smooth, but also tight, and not at all comfortable for a guy.  He tried adjusting himself to a better position, but couldn't find one.  Anna saw what he was doing and and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, I probably could have phrased that swap better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie whispered in Anna's ear \"I think it's hot that you're wearing boxers.\"  Anna's face turned crimson and she bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next game!

The change in wording had made a difference, though Phillip still sat in the same seat he didn't take up nearly as much of it, afraid to look at Melody he ran his hand through his hair which was long enough to be tied into pigtails, he looked down to see Melodies cloths on his smaller frame sticking out thanks to small but obviously present breasts, with a nervous reach he felt his crotch to find nothing familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be a teenage boy!\" Melody moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna for her part smiled seeing how much worse it could be, Jeremy for the same reason cringed.

Phillip reached for his back pocket to find not only was his wallet not there, but the pocket in question was gone. Melody at the same time went to get her pink backpack from the corner. Pulling her wallet out of it showed a picture of Phillip, the it read Name: Melody Jenkins, age:13 gender: F and on the back taped over it listed Melodies own class schedual but with Music last period instead of Art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too weird\" Melody gaggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atleast I don't have to trust one of you with my position in Music.\" Phillip said self conslolingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody then reached in to her new back pocket and took out Phillips wallet and Drivers Licence \"Name Phillip Parker age 16 sex M, and it has my picture\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should end this\" Josie suggested nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

With a sigh the girl stood up, I was amused to see how much more leg her dress showed then Josies skirt, and the icing on top, she wore pink 4inch heels.

Anna was still sitting on the table but had her arms crossed angrily in front of her chest and looked at everyone with a very grim expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't decide!\", Melody whined. \"There's so much I want to swap.\". She cocked her head from one side to the other, hoping she could finally decide what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I want to swap hair colour with Josie.\", she smiled and a second later her brown her was suddenly red. \"I really look better with this colour.\", she giggled, which sounded really strange in Michael's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the last swap, Anna did not notice anything and just looked at Melody, who now was supposed to be her little sister, with her red hair, which was for Anna completely normal. Anna kept quiet like the last time because she knew nobody would her believe her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie sighed with relief that Melody only swapped her hair colour and not the voice with her. \"Phew. She totally forgot that she could have a female voice. Maybe she doesn't want to lose her new voice. Either way, I won't remind her of that.\", Josie thought and quickly grabbed the cards to deal the next hand. She did not want anyone to tell her what she could have swapped, neither did she want her to find out herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, next hand.\", Josie smiled uncomfortably.</span></div></div>",

Only good thing with winning is that I get to choose what I want swapped.\". He looked around the table really not sure what he wanted to swap or if he even wanted to swap something. Nearly every swap that was done so far had a down side for at least one of the participants. How can such a game be fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Josie, now called Jeremy, who was now completely flat while Philipp had her D-Cups sitting on his chest. Philipp was feeling himself up and was not even trying to hide that. Right beside the former Josie sat the new Josie, formerly Jeremy. Around half an hour ago the new Josie was Michael's best friend, now he or she was his sister. Michael then looked at Anna. His actual sister was his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were \"Josie's\" legs which originally belonged to Anna. Not to mention the girly voice, which belonged to the now red-headed Melody,  he now had due to the time limit. \"Speaking of which.\", he thought. \"I have to swap something, otherwise I end up as Melody or with something else.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Michael did not know what he should swap. Everything would be bad and it was hard to find the lesser evil of all the possibilities. \"I want to swap...\", he started but the pressure of time made it hard for him to come up with something minor to swap. The reflection of the swaps done so far costed him much time and did not help him in swapping something. His mind was blank, he did not even get the idea of simply swapping hair or eye colours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I swap, what would be something I would not mind being swapped?\", he asked himself in mind and many different ideas appeared before his inner eye but none appealed to him. Soon it was too late. The fear of swapping something he did not want to be swapped left him petrified and soon the two minutes were over. Michael did not notice it right away still too confused and paniced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the other players looked down at themselves but no one could find anything that should not belong to them since the last played hand. \"What did get swapped?\", asked Philipp, resting one of his hands on one of his breasts. Michael blinked suddenly realising that he was too late. \"I don't know.\", he squealed in his girly voice. Michael got out his ID but did not found anything strange on it. \"No name change, no age change, no gender change Everything on it is as it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... Do you feel different? Maybe your hobbies were swapped.\", Josie suggested. \"No, nothing changed there. I'm not having an urge to do anything I wouldn't do normally.\". \"This game's broken anyway.\", Anna barged in. \"The last three hands nobody said anything about swapping and nothing has been swapped and now you try to tell me that it's different?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael ignored Anna because no matter what she would not believe that she did not notice any swaps because she quit. \"What could it be? Maybe friends?\", asked Michael. \"Hm... Could be...\", Josie mumbled. \"We should get upstairs to your room and check. If you really swapped friends with someone you should find some evidence there. Your facebook account should be changed if it is really friends.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded and everyone except Anna went upstairs. She did not understand were the problem was. When Josie swapped with her the games was still working and then they pretended to have been swapped. As if Jeremy had breasts. But now that her half-brother was on the turn they all are confused. As if.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs in Michael's room the five players immediately looked at Michael's facebook account but could not find anything unusual. \"So this theory is wrong as well.\", \"Jeremy\" sighed and sat down on Michael's bed, resting her pretty head in her hands. \"Hm?\". Josie noticed something strange on Michael's bed table. She grabbed a photo and looked at it confused. \"What's that?\", she asked and Michael and the others turned around. \"What's wrong?\", Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie showed the photo. \"That. It's you with a woman I don't know. You seem to be pretty close.\". Michael looked at it. \"This woman seems familiar. \"That's my mother!\", Philipp blurted out. \"Don't say... I swapped my mother with yours?\". Michael looked at Philipp and the thought of being the son of the mother who gave birth to this boy was cruel for him. \"Well, mystery solved, let's get back down and continue playing.\", Melody said in her new deep voice, enjoying the colour of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a second.\", Michael said. \"I have another mother.\". \"Mine to be precise.\", Philipp said. \"I think this will be an improvement for you. My mother's the best.\". Michael looked at Philipp and was sure if the swap was that good. \"But wait. If Philipp's mother is now my mother and vice versa. Why do I still live here?\", he asked. \"That should be simple.\", Josie explained. \"I think you both stayed with your dads. Maybe both your dads had an affair with the other mom. Either way, Jeremy should now be both your half-sister.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael held his hand against his head. \"I think when this game is over I really need a therapy...\", he mumbled and everyone got back down to Anna. \"Finished looking up imaginary differences?\", she asked annoyed. No one had any interest in talking with her about that. \"Whatever.\", Michael said to her and took place again. \"Who's next?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody grabbed the cards and dealt the hand.</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure if I should continue being your friend.\", Michael said. \"Ah, Mikey, you sound so cute if you're angry.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just decide for something, okay?\", grunted Josie, just like Anna usually did. Anna who refused to participate for a while looked at Josie and grinned broadly. \"Now that you're not winning it's no fun anymore, eh? But hey at least you don't need to swap.\". Anna still refused to accept that any changes had been done. It was not her fault but the card's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up.\", yelled Josie at Anna annoyed. She was really pissed off by Anna's attitude. She disliked her to begin with and now she was even more annoying. \"Oh, little Jeremy is pissed off.\", laughed Anna, calling Josie by her new name even though for Anna it was her actual name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp was still thinking while carressing his new D-cups and the time limit was soon over. \"Okay, I should decide for something. I want to swap underwear with Josie.\". Instantly his clothes felt different, well everything under it. His boxers now felt slightly more districting and did not cover the upper parts of his legs anymore. Also they felt softer. He also felt something constricting around his chest. Like his panties it felt soft. It went over his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie, who was still amazed of her brown hair colour, looked at him surprised. She was now lucky that her chests had been swapped with the pevert Philipp because now that she lacked the support of a bra it would have been very painful. Still surprised she looked at him. \"May I ask why on earth you swapped that?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp who was currently taking a good look at his D-cups clad in the cute pink bra they were now clad in did not look up to speak to her. \"Well, I thought they would look good in a bra and the panties feel good.\", he grinned still looking down under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna decided again to keep her mouth shut. She seriously did not understand why Philipp was looking at his breasts right now. He was really a pervert. \"Could you continue or stop? It's getting late!\", grunted Anna again and was absolutely bored by now. \"I want to go home!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sighed. \"Okay, okay. Last hand then we call it a night.\", he announced and dealt the cards.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure of it.\", he added and began looking through the swapped players in order to find anything not horrible to swap with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far he had two traits he really did not want and one he could life with. The latter being the name he now possessed. He could not swap with Anna anymore because she stopped playing a few hands ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody, his former sister when he still had his own life, was also out of question. She was his sister! It would be creepy if he had even one of her traits, even if it was just her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie or Michael were two people he could consider swapping with. He already had Josie's name anyway. Maybe swapping eye colour with one of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no. Even though he did not want to swap with one of them especially since he was sure it could only get worse but on the other hand he was kinda excited. Jeremy had the opportunity to live the life of the sister of his best friend. As creepy as it was, it was also a unique experience he would never get to have in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was slowly running out and Jeremy had to make a choice. \"Okay... I want to swap lips with Jeremy.\", he said slightly paniced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", gasped Josie as every feeling left her lips for a second and returned in the next. She licked them only to discover that the lipgloss was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy had the same feeling that Josie had and also licked his lips and discovered the missing lipgloss. \"I simply paniced you know.\", apologized Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry...\", sighed Josie. \"I guess I can 'endure' having your lips for a while.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Are we done, yet?\", grunted Anna, unlovingly as ever. \"I have to live this creeps life and have his legs and are forced to wait until you scumbags are finished.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael simply shook his head. His sister could be really... annoying sometimes. Well, mostly. \"Yeah, we're done now... Grab Melody and get lost. We'll see you tomorrow.\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not have to tell this twice to Anna. As soon as the words had left his mouth, she and Melody had vanished. \"I really wonder who's punished... Anna or Melody...\", mumbled Jeremy and then looked at Michael and Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp vanished rather quickly without any noticing. He really seemed to be interested in groping Josie's breast and do even more perverted things with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, big bro. I guess we'll live under the same roof for now.\", he said to his best friend and now brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael grinned broadly. \"Right, sis.\", he joked and grabbed the card deck. \"Until the day after tomorrow this is your home.

This thought lead to the second worst change the evening brought to him: His girlfriend Josie was now called Jeremy. The third worst change was his voice. He now had Melody's high pitched voice instead of his own deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\", said Michael's still smiling mother. She then looked at Jeremy who she thought was her daughter. \"And I'm sure Michael  appreciates it that his sister was at his birthday party.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy simply nodded, just like Michael did. He had no idea how to react to his new mother. He was rarely in the same room as Anna and her mother and he was sure that Anna reacted totally different when other people are around, so the few times he had seen them interact could not tell him how to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, you're all exhausted. Then I won't bother you three anymore.\". Michael's mother then went away. The three went upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was arkward...\", mumbled Jeremy. \"I think the hardest part will be to have a new mother who thinks I'm her daughter.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichal looked at his \"sister\". \"You're sure that's the worst part?\", he asked him. \"Don't you forget \"your\" boyfriend Greg?\". Jeremy gulped. \"Oh... Riiiight...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie grinned sheepishly. \"Maybe you should have swapped sexual preferences with Anna. Then this won't be that weird for you.\". Jeremy looked at Josie. \"You're right... How about we three play a round. You both fold and I get to swap sexual preferences with Josie.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked at Jeremy with her \"No-Way\" face. Jeremy sighed. \"Fine... I guess you don't want to be gay especially since Michael is a boy...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie nodded. \"Right. You're going to have to endure that.\". Jeremy sighed again. \"Yeah... At least I get to stay at my best friends house all night.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded. \"Yeah. Only problem there: If anything is like it was with Anna, than you and I probably are merly in the same room. So no playing video games or anything like that.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Jeremy sighed. He was getting used to getting disappointed at this moment. \"Isn't there anything I can enjoy?\", he asked sadly. \"This seems more like a punishment.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie grinned. \"Well, it IS a punishment in some way. You're supposed to be a girl.\". Jeremy nodded and let out the same noise he has made during the whole conversation. \"Yeah... At least I can change into the girl's locker room without anyone screaming.\". Jeremy thought back at the time he mistakenly went into the girl's locker room and changed there. Unfortunately he was the only one when he got in but when he was naked he was not alone anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right. Remember that one time, huh?\", grinned Michael. \"I'd suggest you stop daydreaming, face the fact that you're now my little sister and let us inspect your room. I'm curious how Anna's room has changed.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before Jeremy sighed but agreed with Michael. \"Okay... Let's go... Er... Show me where \"my\" room is. I have no idea.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Michael who sighed. \"You're my best friend, you visit me at least once a week and you still have no idea which room belongs to whom?\", he asked. Jeremy grinned broadly. \"You know me.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael simply shook his head and took the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three entered what was now Jeremy's room they were astonished how little had changed. The bed, the desk and the poster stayed all the same. The waderobe was the same, although it now contained Jeremy's clothes. The make-up table had vanished. It was now probably in Jeremy's old room. The only trace of make-up where some lipsticks and some lipgloss on the desk. He probably used it now that he had Josie's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last change were the pictures showing Anna and her friends. While the positions of the person on the photos stayed the same, they now showed Jeremy in Anna's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is where I'll be sleeping tonight...\", mumbled Jeremy and walked disbelievingly around the room. \"The cards really changed a lot.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael and Josie nodded in unision. \"They sure did.\", said Josie. \"But we have to live with that, right Josie?\", she grinned and giggled at the fact that she just called Jeremy with her own name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Jeremy... Man this two days are going to be very strange.\". Again, Michael and Josie nodded in unision. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning was as freaky as Jeremy could think it was. Not only was he woken up by his best friend's mother, he also got a message from his \"boyfriend\" who told him that he would give him a lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great... Of all people I had to swap lives with, it had to be Anna...\", he sighed. \"I'll just hope she and Greg were not very intimate... I can't imagine what I would do if he wanted sex for me. Even though I'll try to not mess around with Anna's life, I hope she'll do the same, having sex with a man is definetely a no go.\", he thought while brushing his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy thought about the last night and how boring it was. All of Anna's friends posted absolutely boring stuff on the internet, so facebook was by far no alternative of spending the night. Michael and Josie had some intimate time. It was Michael's birthday after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the only way he could kill some time was looking through Anna's facebook account, which was now his, and try to learn something about her friends. Their his now aswell, right? By the time he went to bed he could at least connect name and face. If he could join their talk or anything like that was of course a completely different question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope this evening won't be as boring as the last one...\", he sighed again and went back to \"his\" room and got dressed. By the time he reached the kitchen everyone excluding himself was already eating breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Josie.\", smiled the real Josie. She definietely liked calling him like that. Jeremy simply greeted her back and tried to do his best Anna imitation and began eating breakfast as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, honey.\", Cindy, Michael's, and now Jeremy's mother as well, began a conversation with the latter. \"How about we do a little shopping after school?\", she asked who she thought was her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael knew that once in a while his mother always asked Anna if they wanted to do something together. For mother-daughter bonding like she said. Normally, Anna said no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, you don't like hanging out with your old mom but there's so many precious time we could spend together that we lose.\",  Cindy argumented like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was curious. Normally he would now hear a variation of \"No\" but this time his mother was not talking to Anna. She was talking to Jeremy who had no idea how Anna would react in this situation. He could see it in Jeremy's face that he was thinking about what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael wanted to help his friend but could not without making his mother suspicious. \"Sorry, buddy. You've got to go this one alone.\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy meanwhile decided for one answer he could give his new mother:</span></div></div>",

Normally she would have rejected her and even though she tried every once in a while to get her daughter to do some activity with her, the results stayed always the same. The whole asking her thing was becoming a ritual. And now? Now she agreed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled happily. \"Great. I'll meet you at the mall.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was surprised at how happy his mother seemed. She really wanted to spend time with her daughter. Maybe these swaps had something good aftere all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakfast was uneventful and soon Jeremy found himself in Greg's car. \"This is so not right.\", he thought as he looked over to Greg who was currently concentrating on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he's not talking to me... Wait a second...\", he thought and looked out of the window. \"This is certainly not the way to our school.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked over to Greg. \"Erm... Aren't you er... driving in the wrong way?\", he asked. Greg looked at Jeremy confused. \"You forgot already? We're a couple for exactly a month now. You said that you wanted to go to the lake for that.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\", Jeremy thought. \"And I thought I was safe!\". Jeremy tried to smile. \"No, how could I forget that. I was waiting for it all the time.\", he lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded and turned his view back to the street. \"I have to get away from here. Anna could have told me that she was going to do something like that with her boyfriend today.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the whole ride, Jeremy was thinking of many different scenarios with which he could escape but there was not a single one which would not let him escape and not ruin Anna's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived and Greg got out. \"I know you like the romantic stuff, so I brought a picnic basket.\", Greg explained. Jeremy nodded and tried to smile. \"I've got to get away from here!\", he screamed inside.</span></div></div>",

Jeremy was meanwhile still considering all the alternatives he got and it was not looking very good for the poor boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna will kill me if I reject Greg. But having some quality time with Greg will be expensive, sine I'll need the best therapist in the world... Dammit... I guess I have to endure this. Anna owes me a big one. A really big one...\", he thought and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy got out of the car and looked over to Greg who was busy getting everything out of the car. Jeremy sighed and got over to \"his\" boyfriend. \"Er... Can I help you with anything?\", he asked Greg and tried to sound like a nice girlfriend. That type of girl he could never imagine Anna would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked at Jeremy and smiled. \"No thanks. Just look for a nice place.\". Jeremy shruddered. He knew that boys like him are only that nice when they want to get into the girl's panties... Well, in Jeremy's case the term \"boxers\" would be more fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it like a man...\", thought Jeremy. \"Even though this is rather unmanly...\". Jeremy looked for a place where nobody would see the two of them even though nobody would notice anything strange anyway but Jeremy was still embarrassed at the thought that someone might see him with cuddling with Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy finally settled down just under a big tree. In order to maintain his disguise he positioned himself with view on the lake but still at a position where he could not be seen from the street. Greg had followed him with a bit distance between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks good, the place, too.\", grinned Greg and put the blanket on the ground and the basket right onto it. \"Well, take a seat, beautiful.\", he said charmingly. Jeremy almost had to puke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er yeah... Thanks.\", mumbled Jeremy and sat down. He wished he could escape from this nightmare but certainly could not, not unless he wanted to unleash another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's er so beautiful out here... With you... I am so happy.\", Jeremy said and tried his best to not sound sarcastic. \"It certainly is.\", replied Greg and laid an arm around Jeremy's shoulder. \"And it will be even more beautiful.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god. Please let something happen that ends this... NOW!\", cried Jeremy out loud in mind but nobody listened  to his words and so he had to have a picnic with Greg who was eager to show himself from his best side to impress his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Greg began rubbing over Jeremy's shapely, shaven leg. \"Well, at least one part of your original girlfriend that you can get.\", thought Jeremy and tried to made the best out of this situation. But he just could not. Greg's hand wandered up his leg and reached Jeremy's crotch. Jeremy...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy gulped and let Greg continue moving his hand up to Jeremy's crotch and began stroking it. Even though Jeremy was disgusted, his crotch was not touched by anyone besides himself for quite a while and so it began to harden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you're enjoying this.\", whispered Greg into Jeremy's ear and continued stroking his penis. Jeremy simply nodded in shame, his face as red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great. Now I can't escape this anymore.\", thought Jeremy and tried his best not to puke in disgust. After a while Jeremy's penis was rock hard and Greg stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have to turn me on now, baby.\", he grinned and opened his trousers. \"We want to enjoy this both, right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy gulped again and looked at the penis right before him. With shaking hand he grabbed it and began stroking it slightly. \"Don't be scared. It won't hurt you.\", said Greg to calm who he thought was his girlfriend down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy continued although he was just grossed out. He wished Greg would disappear every second but nothing happend. It felt like an hour until Greg's penis was swallen enough. Jeremy felt like he was in a delirium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jeremy even realised it, he was on all fours and Greg pushed his penis right into Jeremy's ass. Even though Jeremy refused to do so, he found himself moaning slightly but the pain kept him from enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone help me!\", he shouted out in mind but in vain. There was no one that could hear him and so he had to endure the eternity Greg spent with pumping his raging cock into Jeremy's asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun was setting when Greg and Jeremy finally went back to Greg's car and drove off home. Jeremy felt dirty. He would have to have a loooooong shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This day was special, right?\", smiled Greg happily at his supposed girlfriend. \"You were amazing.\", he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy gulped and forced himself to smile. \"Yeah it was really... unique.\", he mumbled and tried to forget what had just happened to him at the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded satisfied and continued driving his \"girlfriend\" home. Jeremy looked out of the window, trying to forget what had happened and trying to think of tomorrow where he would be able to trade back his life and then just imagine this was all just a bad dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun nearly set when Greg's car finally arrived at Michael's and, for the time being, Jeremy's house. \"Here we are, sweetheart.\", smiled Greg and planted Jeremy a kiss right on the lips. \"I'll get you tomorrow, like always, ok?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy, getting used to being kissed by Greg, nodded and left the car, waving his hand to say good-bye to Greg when he reached the door, and entered the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was greeted by \"his\" mother. \"Josie Elizabeth Ferguson!\", shouted his mother at Jeremy. \"Where were you? I waited for you at school for a whole hour only to find out you never arrived at school.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy stepped back a little. He had never seen his best friend's mom that angry. No wonder, usually people try to behave when other people beside the family are around. Also Jeremy had never done anything to make her angry and neither did Michael, at least not when Jeremy was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it weren't bad enought that you just let me wait and broke your promise, you also skipped school. That's unforgivable.\", she continued enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\", thought Jeremy. \"I've totally forgotten that I promised her to go shopping with her. And because of that she found out that I was skipping school.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm sorry.\", whispered Jeremy frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sorry? I know you're not. I bet you were away with Greg. He has a bad influence on you. If you continue skipping school you won't graduate this year...\", continued the enraged mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy gulped, listened to her. He was to afraid to say anything to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're grounded for now!\", she finally said after a long talk. \"You're not going to watch TV or see you're friends, especially not Greg. I'll take you to school for now and take you back. Here you'll go straight upstairs and learn.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... mom...\", mumbled Jeremy and lowered his head. \"I'm upstairs then...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and let Jeremy continue upstairs to \"his\" room. In there Jeremy laid down on his bed and sighed heavily. \"Just great. I think I've done anything besides trying to preserve Anna's life. I hope she won't get as angry as her mother.\", he thought and looked at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then someone opened the door before even knocking on it. \"What have you done now, you dofus?\", asked a familiar voice in an angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked back from the ceiling to the direction where the voice was coming from. It was Anna who just went into her former room although it did not belong to her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard mom scream that you're grounded. What did you do?!\", she inquired. Jeremy sighed. \"I'm sorry. I tried my best to pretend I'm you. Didn't work quite as well. At first I promised your mother I'd go shopping with her today. I didn't know you had other plans with Greg... And well... I had sex with Greg. So... At least that part of your life is safe.\", he said shuddering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna listened to him and looked with a stern look at her. \"Okay... You're rather stupid, aren't you?\", she asked him. \"But well, it's my fault as well. I should have told you how to deal with mom and Greg...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy was surprised how Anna reacted. He never saw her acting like that. \"And... How was you day? Did you do anything comparable with what I did with your life?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked at Jeremy and said...</span></div></div>",

It'll be just tomorrow anyway.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began talking about everything they needed to know. Jeremy discovered that Anna was not as bad as he had thought all the time.

You're kinda bitchy sometimes.\", he said. \"And sometimes means always when I'm around.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna continued to stare at him but after a few moments her face normalised. \"I guess you're right. I'm sorry for that.\". Jeremy was surprised. He had never thought to hear this words coming out of Anna's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right.\", he said still surprised by Anna's reaction. \"After living you're life a day, I guess I can understand why you're like that.

She then got out of the room and out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy laid back on the bed. \"What a weird day...\", he sighed. \"But I've learnt things I wouldn't have learnt if we hadn't played that poker game yesterday. So there was something good about this swaps after all. I think I can live with the fact that most guys think I'm gay.

If I can avoid it, I don't want to have anything to do with him anymore. Luckily mom said she wanted to drive me to school tomorrow. So that way I won't meet him and tomorrow evening everything will be back to normal.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded in agreement but was surprised that he just called Anna's mother mom so casually. \"I guess it was an eventful day for you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Although some events should have never happened.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was another knock on the door and \"his\" mother entered the room. \"Michael. I'm surprised that you're here.\", she said. It was indeed something special. Normally he talked around 50 words with his sister in a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still you shouldn't accompany your sister when she's grounded. I know you just want to be nice to your sister and all but this should be a punishment for her. She has to stay in her room and learn instead of doing something else.\", she continued. \"So no talking to her at all, you understand? Nothing that would keep her away from waiting.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at his mother and wanted to say something but from the look in her eyes he knew that she would not change her mind no matter what he said. \"Okay mom...\", he mumbled. She looked at him. \"I'm your step-mother, just call me Cindy. It sounds so wrong if you call me mom.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael suddenly remembered that he had switched moms with Philipp, so that was not his actual mother but his step-mother. \"Okay... Cindy...\", he continued and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jeremy was alone with his mother. \"And you heard me. No contact to anyone besides my self for at least a week.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week?\", blurted Jeremy out. \"How am I supposed to swap back tomorrow?\", he added in mind. She nodded. \"Yes, a week. Now give me your cellphone. I don't want that you talk with one of your friends while you're supposed to learn. I won't let you fail classes.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy sighed and looked for \"his\" cellphone and found soon enough a pink one lying on top of the desk in the room and handed it over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. You'll sit down and learn now. I'll come to check on you once in a while and when I find you doing anything besides learning then you're punishment will get even worse. You understand?\". Jeremy nodded. \"Good.\". She then left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great...\", Jeremy sighed and sat down on the chair in front of the desk. \"How am I supposed to swap if \"my\" mother refuses to let me play poker with them?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked at the books which were on the desk. They looked like Anna had not touched them since she got them. \"At least she's a grade below so I know everything she needs to learn.\", he thought and rubbed his feminine legs absent-mindedly. \"But still I won't convince her that I know all of that till tomorrow evening. This day is getting worse and worse.\", he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy started learning or at least he prenteded to learn. He already knew all the stuff so it was not really learning but just writing the correct things down. His mother came in once in a while to check on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter these worthless hour of \"learning\" Jeremy got up and went to back.</span></div></div>",

By turning over, he was now facing the window, the sun light piercing the curtains, continued though his eye lids, causing him to cover his eyes, while he woke up. He heard his 'step' mother, Cindy call, \"Michael, Josie, Breakfast is ready.\"<br>\r\nMichael, got up, for a second confused to why his girl friend was here, when he remembered the swap. \"Coming!\" He called back with his squeaky voice, borrowed from Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael left his room, coming across his best friend, leaving his little sisters life. He looked over Jeremy, with Anna prized legs and Josie had lent him her lips and name. \"Morning, Jer..osie,\" He corrected him self.<br>\r\nJeremy smiled, \"I'm still not used to my sisters voice coming out of your mouth.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm still not used to it coming out of my mouth, or my best friend, being my little sister,\" they both laughed a little before going down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael and Jeremy walked into the kitchen to see that Cindy had made then breakfast, and put it on the table, Michael sat down to his normal place to eat, while Jeremy sat where Anna would. Cindy sat down, having finished the morning requirements, sat down with them. Michael looked to her, swallowed, and started speaking. \"Mom...\" Michael started, but was interrupted by the same look as yesterday, when he last called her that, \"Cindy, if you don't mind telling me, how did you become my step mother?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, we all went to high school, Me, your father William, Your mother Claire, and your Step Dad Wallace, and we were all friends, it started off as me and Wallace and William and Claire, which is where Phillip and you came from, but as we continued to meet us as friends, we started loving each other more and more, until we decided we should change the couples, and I went with William, and Claire went with Wallace, which is where Josie and Robert came from. Speaking off Claire, don't forget your weekend visit to Claire's.\"<br>\r\nMichael thought for a second, \"I won't,\" he said, realizing it would be easy to play there, and find out, what kind of person his 'Mother' is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both finished their breakfast, and gone to get changed. Michael was ready first, and decided to wait for Jeremy. It took a little while, but soon Jeremy was done. Jeremy stood in front of Michael, 3 things were off about Jeremy:<br>\r\n1) He was wearing the younger years girl style uniform.<br>\r\n2) He was wearing a skirt, to show off 'his' legs, it only just scrapped by Cindy's and school regulations.<br>\r\n3) He was wearing lip gloss on the lips he had borrowed from Josie.<br>\r\nJeremy wouldn't eye contact with Michael, he quickly said, \"Thanks for waiting.\"<br>\r\n\"What are friends, or brothers, for? See you later... Cindy,\" he waved Cindy.<br>\r\nJeremy tried a, whatever, later, wave Anna did, but it didn't come out right but it was close enough, and they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before they meet up with Josie, and Anna and Melody.<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Josie said, thought Jeremy's lips, and got Michael in a hug, avoiding an awkward kiss.<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Melody said, taking her self by surprise, with her voice borrowed from Michael.<br>\r\nAnna managed a more pleasant greeting then anyone had expected from her. <br>\r\nPhillip wasn't there, despite normally meeting up with Jeremy and Michael, here one the way to school, a couple minutes ago, but it only took one guess to where he was, and why he was late, and Josie was certainly annoyed at him for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before they were all at school, in their own classes, Jeremy had a little confusion for a moment, before Anna pointed him in the right direction.<br>\r\nMichael and Josie sat down in form, and school began, Phillip, only just arriving in time, out of breath, chest wobbling, and Claire's car leaving the parking lot. He had obviously run very late, literally and figuratively.</span></div></div>",

Josie was trying to contain her angry, which she can normally do well, but it was beginning to surfacing this time, Michael tried to calm her down, but it didn't help all that much. <br>\r\nIt was only a couple minutes before another large change revealed it's self, when a boy and girl from one of the lower year walked in.<br>\r\n\"Excuse us,\" The boy asked in a higher pitch voice. The girl then asked \"We need Michael Ferguson for extra choir practice.\"<br>\r\nThe teacher dismissed Michael and he followed them to the music room where he saw the chore group, and the music teacher. <br>\r\n\"Welcome Michael, if you'll get in your place, we'll begin practicing.\" Michael took an empty place at the back, towering over most of them.<br>\r\nThe all started, Michael couldn't figure out what was going on, so he just started singing. He song the word he felt like singing, and they were the words the choir had been practicing. Somehow he found him self, enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoir practice over ran the bell, so Michael couldn't Join Josie and Phillip to P.E. The two discovered something while in there.<br>\r\nIn the boys changing room, with Phillip.<br>\r\nPhillip was changing, taking of his shirt, but still not used to it bumping into Josie's breasts, and it getting caught in the bra straps, while it was stuck, two boys nearby got a good look. \"What is with Phillip, wearing a bra?\" Asked one with a tone saying he thought it was wrong at every angle.<br>\r\n\"Those boobs need the support, Kyle.\" The other boy said, sounding a little distracted.<br>\r\nKyle replied, with a shocked tone, \"What, you find those hot, Albert?\"<br>\r\n\"Boobs are boobs, the face behind doesn't change that.\" Albert explained.<br>\r\n\"Are you gay!?\" He asked in an aggressive tone.<br>\r\n\"No, I never said I was attracted to Phil.\" He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the girls.<br>\r\nJosie was also getting changed, slightly relieved to have lost the extra weight on her chest but missing them all the same.<br>\r\n\"Hey look, it's Jeremy Flatgusen, what's the matter, forgot to shave again, all that hair your gonna look like a guy.\" the girl said insulting Josie.<br>\r\nJosie broke eye contact and turned a light shade of red.<br>\r\n\"It won't all be bad, her chest is kind of hot.\" The other giggled.<br>\r\nThe first girl gasped, \"Well stay away from me.\" and walked away, the other followed saying it wasn't like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in other classes. <br>\r\nJeremy living Anna's life.<br>\r\nJeremy sat in class, and one of Anna's friends sat next to him, and another on his right. \"Hey Josie. Where were you yesterday, I hope it wasn't with Greg, he's hot and all, and he's got a car, but he is no good for you, neither is your brother or his friend, especially Phillip and Josie.<br>\r\nThis kind of speech went on all lesson, them just pushing Jeremy and just being a bother in a lesson he has already done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile with Melody who was retrieving books from her looker. A bully from her year, came.<br>\r\n\"Hey Low-pitch,\" She said aggressively. Melody gave no response. The bully's sadistic smile fell to a frown, and she dropped a hand quickly on to the book in melody's arms, knocking the books off, \"Looks like you dropped it.\"<br>\r\n\"What was that about!?\" Melody exclaimed in Michael's voice. \"There is. Your stupid voice, gah you said ridiculous.\"<br>\r\nThen a faintly familiar voice came, \"Leave Melody alone,\" the voice was Veronica, a rather popular girl in Melody's year, the two hadn't spoken much outside class teamwork. \"Beth, just go way and stop bulling Melody, before Myself or the teacher get involved.\" somehow this caused Beth to back off, and Veronica helped Melody pick up her book, and walked with her to their next class, strangely, Veronica was closer to melody then before.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jeremy left, while Michael got the cards from the hiding place, and went down stairs too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael put the card an the table.<br>\r\n\"I didn't think this card would show up again,\" She said, going though the cards and instructions.<br>\r\n\"You know these?\" Michael asked, astounded.<br>\r\nCindy nodded, \"Your Father created them.\"<br>\r\n\"He did?\" all three of them cried in surprise.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n\"We played, but there isn't a point in telling you, your dad made it so no one can hear the swaps if you try telling them. Where did you find them?\"<br>\r\nMichael stepped forward, \"I did, on the front garden.\"<br>\r\n\"So what is it you needed to say Anna?\"<br>\r\n\"I think you need to look over Josie's punishment, the cards forced her into a situation when she didn't want to be there!\"<br>\r\nCindy stood there for a while, thinking, \"Come to me when the swaps are undone.\"<br>\r\n\"That should be tonight,\" Jeremy pointed out.<br>\r\n\"But I'm going to my Mum's,\" Michael said.<br>\r\nCindy gave her contribution, \"And she may not like it if all your friends came over when she was getting time with her son, she see you so rarely these days. While you get ready, I phone and ask her if tomorrow you could have a group of friends over.\"<br>\r\nAnna and Jeremy reluctantly agreed, while Michael felt rather cautious as he was going to be with a woman, who he had never been in the same room as, and a pervert for a night.<br>\r\n\"I see you tomorrow then,\" Jeremy said.<br>\r\n\"See you,\" Anna said, half waving as walked out the door.<br>\r\nMichael went up stairs to pack while Cindy got on the phone, Jeremy just returned to his borrowed room.</span></div></div>",

Cindy reflected on for a second, before turning around, and opening the door.<br>\r\n\"See you later, Michael!\" Jeremy said from the top of the stairs, disappointed by the fact he would have to spent an extra day in this situation.<br>\r\n\"See you, Josie.\" Cindy found Jeremy's actions odd, but remembered the cards, and pushed it out of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy and Michael walked out the car, and got in either side. Michael tossed his bag into the back seat, he had filled it with a few things he thought he would need, a change of clothes, his PSP, some toiletries, the cards among a few other things. And sat down in the passenger seat.<br>\r\nCindy took the drivers seat and set off.<br>\r\nThe drive was an awkward silence for the first bit.<br>\r\n\"So Michael, what was it like for you using the cards?\"<br>\r\n\"Quite stressful, some where feeling victimized, having things stolen from them, and no one wanted Phillip to win,\" Michael recalled, remembering the atmosphere from a few nights ago. <br>\r\nCindy opened her mouth, but realized her view won't apply, as her views and Michael came from two different worlds, so stopped that train of thought.<br>\r\n\"Your father made them for fun, and to resolve arguments.\"<br>\r\nMichael turned, and question her.<br>\r\n\"Well, he thought it would be fun to swap traits with his friends, me, Wallace and Claire, and when he was fed up with people complaining about how their lives were hard, he made the cards, they were only used for fun between friends,\" Cindy explained, \"Remember, it's a game, have fun, no one is getting hurt, and stop before anyone feels harmed.\"<br>\r\nThe car slowed down, ad Michael felt a chill down his spine, he didn't know this street, but he knew where he was, this was 'his' other home with 'his' mother. A woman he didn't know, but would have to treat her like he would treat Cindy before he found the cards.<br>\r\n\"We're here,\" Cindy said, as the car came to a stop, \"Wallace said he'd bring you back on Sunday.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, Cindy,\" He said, still uncomfortable using her first name.<br>\r\n\"See you later,\" She waved as Michael retrieved his bag, and stepped out of the car.<br>\r\nMichael stood in place for a second, and Cindy drove off, and looked over the house, it was unfamiliar, and unnerving, but he new he had to go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up the stone pavement, each stone was a different shape,  but fit together to make a straight, neat path. The grass was cut short, and the only things on the front garden were a variety or plants and a garden gnome. Michael stood in front of the red door, decorated with a gold coloured handle, and knocker, it had tainted windows on either side, and a peephole. Michael reached for the knocker, but stopped, \"This 'is my' house, should I knock,\" and lowered his hand to the door handle, and twisted down, and the door opened, and Michael stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside he felt very out of place and like he was intruding.<br>\r\n\"Is that you Michael!?\" a Woman's voice called out from upstairs.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" He cried back, a little tougher with the smaller, effeminate voice.<br>\r\n\"Just wait there, I'm getting changed.\"<br>\r\nMichael took a step forward, \"Why's she getting changed in the afternoon,\" Michael asked himself under his breath.<br>\r\nThe front door had lead into a hallway, which connected to several doors, being feeling it would be rude to do snooping, he just waited at the bottom of the stairs. Only a couple of minutes later, someone had come down the stairs. He recognized the woman from the photo in his room. An average height blonde woman, only a few inches shorter than him, and she was very attractive for a 40 year old, and a mother of two. As Michael looked over his new mother, he noticed her shirt was undone, and turned his head, \"Oops,\" she blushed covering her self, and continued on, pretending nothing had happened.<br>\r\n\"There's my birthday boy,\" she said, at the bottom of the stairs, and embracing Michael in a hug. Before he got of the awkwardness of the moment, he hugged her back, trying not to act strangely to her.<br>\r\nClaire took a step back, and smiled happily, \"How's my birthday boy.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fine...Mum,\" Michael replied, feeling awkward referring to this stranger as Mum.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I missed your birthday Mike, I have a few presents in the room for you,\" She gestured to the nearest door, and you walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large room with several sofa's around the room, position to see the TV inside of the large cabinet, which was a large rack of DVD's. Around the room was pictures of the family, with a mix of combinations between him, Robert, Phillip, Claire, and a man who he guess was Wallace. And around the room, was some banners, \"Saying happy birthday\", and \"17\".<br>\r\nCurios he asked, \"Where is everyone.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, Robert is at school for Soccer practice, Wallace is with friends this evening, and will collect Robert on the way back, and Phillip is at his cousin's for tonight. So it will just be me and my birthday boy.\"<br>\r\n\"You know it's not my birthday anymore,\" Michael said.<br>\r\n\"I know, I just wanted to recreate the day,\" She said hopefully.<br>\r\n<i>\"Good luck with that,\"</i> Michael thought.<br>\r\nIn the center of the room was a small coffee table, with a small stack of wrapped presents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sat down at the table. On top of the presents was a letter. He opened it.<br>\r\n\"A wish for a very happy birthday.... For my very special Boy,\" Michael read of the text from the letter, which circled a shooting star. Michael opened it, there was a few Dollar notes, Michael slipped them out, and placed them on the table. <br>\r\n\"Dear Mikey,\" He read out. \"Wishing you a wonderful birthday, love, Your Mum and Wallace.\"<br>\r\nMichael smiled, feeling quite loved for, as he placed the hand made card down, and Picked up the presents, opening them one at a time, taking his time, and savoring the moment. There was a flash, so Michael turned to see Claire taking a photo, smiling behind the digital camera.</span></div></div>",

From the presents, Michael had a new game, a few films and picture frame, with a picture in it, From left to right, Claire was standing next to you, while Robert had his arm around your neck, looking a little tight, next Wallace, with either hand on Phillip and Roberts shoulders, while Phillip was on the end, looking away, and something off camera, Michael guessed that this was from a family holiday recently, as it looked like a theme park and they looked like they did now. <br>\r\n\"So what would you like to do Mike?\"<br>\r\nMichael struggled for a second, not knowing what he normally does, \"Watch some films,\" he said, trying to cover his nervous little tone.<br>\r\n\"Okay, you take your things upstairs, and I'll make some popcorn,\" Claire smiled, getting up, and walking out the room, Michael gathered his things, and went upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the top floor, there was five doors. His eyes flick between them, so he check a few. The first door he opened was just left of the stairs, and it was a mess, with dirty magazines not to well hidden, and barely dress woman on posters, \"This one is Phillip's,\" he said closing the door, and moving on. The next door was a bathroom. But the one after that, It was kind of small, Space for a bed, a wardrobe and a few cabinets, on the cabinets at the end of the bed was a TV connected to an X-BOX 360, with a stack of games beneath. Looking around, there were some pictures, each of him, with a mixture of others, from both of his families, William, Cindy, Wallace, Claire, Robert, Phillip, Jeremy (In place of Anna), Josie, Anna (in place of Jeremy). \"I guess this is my room,\" Michael pondered, putting his stuff down, and going down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael peered in the living room door, and Claire wasn't there, so Michael checked the other doors, and confined his mental map of his temporary home, with a cloakroom, another bathroom, a basement, a shortcut to the garage, and lastly, the kitchen, where he found Claire.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mike,\" she greeted warmly, \"The popcorn is nearly done, would you like to go and get the film ready?\"<br>\r\n\"Which one?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\nShe gave a supportive smile, \"Your pick.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay... Mum,\" he accidentally squealed excitedly as he turned to leave, still not used to calling Claire 'Mum'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael picked up one of the film he had gotten, and putting it in the DVD player, after turning everything on, and gathering the remotes, and taking the seat opposite the screen. Michael spent the time skipping thought the adverts, and when Claire arrived, she pulled up the coffee table, and put the pop corn down, so Michael pressed play on the film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an action film, lots of gun fire and explosions with some comedy thrown in, Michael was really enjoying the film as he took a couple handfuls of Popcorn, and mushed them between his teeth. He looked over to Claire, she didn't seem to be enjoying the spectacles on screen, instead, she was happy spending time with her son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Credits rolled, and Michael was feeling quite happy for the situation, of siting with a stranger in an unfamiliar house.<br>\r\n\"Would you like some dinner Mikey?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\nMichael nodded, and thought for a second, \"Maybe Pizza?\" He requested with Melody's voice.<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll go place an order, while you put on the next film,\" Claire said, moving to another sofa, as the other sofa had a small table next to it, with a phone on, she picked it up, and dialed. Michael took another film from the coffee table, and put it on.<br>\r\nMichael had finished skipping the adverts and a similar time to Claire having placed the order, so she took her seat next to Michael again, \"The Pizza showed be here in half and hour, Mikey.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mum,\" Michael said, less awkwardly, and pressed play.<br>\r\nThis film was similar to the first, another action film, but this time it was played for humour, being a satire of most actions film, on how ridiculous the stunts and situations could be. Michael found this film just as enjoyable as the last, Claire enjoyed this one more, Michael could only guess it was because she could understand this one better, as it was focusing in humour, and Claire preferred comedy over action, he still wondered if she was still enjoying the company most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't to far into the film that the door knocker knocked, \"Go get the door, Mikey, the pizza is already paid for.\"<br>\r\nMichael paused the film and went to the front door, and opened it. The pizza Delivery guy stood there in uniform, with two boxes. \"Two pizza's for, Michael Ferguson?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" he replied, his voice giving it a sweet tone.<br>\r\n\"Happy Birthday, Mike\" he wished happily, handing him the boxes and leaving. Michael took the boxes to the front room, where Claire blew on a party blower, the coffee table now had two plates on, and a few cans, Claire handed him a coca-cola can. Michael placed the boxes down, and opened the top on, it was Michael favorite, extra spicy stuffed crust, pepperoni and mushroom pizza. <br>\r\n\"Eat as much as you want, but remember there's cake afterwards, and what you don't eat, your brothers and Wallace will,\" Claire said, as she put a couple of pieces of pizza on each plate, and sat down, passing the other plate to Michael, and he pressed play, eating away at the pizza on his plate, frequently putting more on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually stopped himself, putting his plate on the second box which was half empty.<br>\r\n\"Could I have cake in a bit,\" Michael asked gently, the small voice making it harder to resist, but it wasn't necessary as Claire nodded, \"I get it ready in a bit, let your Dinner settle.\"<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder if this is the reason Phillip thinks she is best?\"</i> Michael thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe credits rolled, Claire stood up, \"Wait here Mike,\" She said, and she turned of the TV, and the light on her way out, taking the pizza and plates with her leaving Michael sat the dark for a few minutes. A light flickered in the corridor, it got brighter and brighter, as it came closer, and turned the corner. The light was going from candle on a cake.<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday to you,<br>\r\nHappy Birth to you,<br>\r\nHappy birthday, Michael,<br>\r\nHappy Birthday to you,\" Claire sung as sweetly, as she placed the cake in front of him. She turned on the light, and got out a camera, \"Make a wish.\"<br>\r\nMichael took a deep breath, and blew out, putting out the candles, his breath accompanied by a small \"Whew,\" noise. Claire cut the cake, taking a slim piece herself, and giving Michael a thick piece. <br>\r\n\"I feeling tired Michael,\" She said wiping away crumbs from her mouth, \"I'm going to bed.\"<br>\r\nClaire had got up, and kissed Michael on the forehead, \"Good night.\"<br>\r\n\"Good night... Mum,\" He wished her, finishing of his cake. Michael took the cake into the kitchen. Just then, a figure approach, an arm wrapped around, his neck, and knuckles dug into his head.<br>\r\n\"How's the birthday boy,\" a voice asked, as the arm wrapped, and Michael was released. <br>\r\n\"I was fine!\" Michael cried rubbing his head, and he dug though his memories, to when Claire was listing family members, \"Robert.\"<br>\r\nRobert broke into laughter, \"That voice never gets old,\" he mocked, and took a slice of cake.<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" He sighed quietly, making his way up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael entered his room, it was much darker now, so he closed the curtains and turned on a light. He pickup up the X-box controller, and booted up his new game, and got lost in it for the next few hours, feeling quite spoiled by his birthday.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jeremy opened the phone, from 'Anna Parker'.<br>\r\n\"Remember we're swapping back tomorrow, so shave my legs tonight, I don't want any fur on my legs when I get them back, Josie,\" Jeremy sighed, reading the message, feeling a little frustrated by Anna, but not wanting to upset her, he did as she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got into the bathroom, and his phone sounded again, another facebook message from Anna, \"And DO NOT cut them!\"<br>\r\nHe then just dialed Anna, \"What do you want Josie?\" She sounded a little irritated.<br>\r\n\"I Don't know how to,\" Jeremy pleaded.<br>\r\nThere was a long angry sigh. \"Under the sink is basket, labeled with your.... my... Argh I don't know, just look,\" she growled, confused by the terminology she was having to use.<br>\r\nThe sink was part of a cabinet, opening the doors, at the bottom was a wicker basket, with a piece of paper sellotaped to it, with the world 'Josie' written on it.<br>\r\n\"Inside, there should be a bunch of toiletries. Normally I would wax my legs, but I think your to wussy for that.\"<br>\r\nJeremy grunted, feeling emasculated, but knew it would be true, so ignored it.<br>\r\n\"Put the phone on loud speaker, and somewhere it won't get wet, and I'll talk you thought it.\"<br>\r\nJeremy turned it down, and placed it behind the sink and the windowsill.<br>\r\n\"Okay Josie, strip down, and get in the shower.\"<br>\r\nJeremy did so, taking of each bit of clothing, and stepping into the shower, and setting it up.<br>\r\n\"You only have you get the place your shaving, so take a seat on the bath rim, and try and spread the water around my legs,\" Anna instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy had been doing this for five minutes before the next instruction came.<br>\r\n\"Now, Josie, you need to apply the shaving cream, I think you know how to do that, and like you would with your face, slowly, and carefully.\"<br>\r\nSo Jeremy did that, he applied the shaving cream to his slender legs, and used a razor from the basket to remove the hair grown in the last few days.<br>\r\nAnna had given some tips on how do it, to make sure the legs she was proud of didn't get hurt.<br>\r\n\"How you doing?\"Anna asked, sounding more casual.<br>\r\n\"With my life, or your legs?\" He replied sarcastically.<br>\r\n\"Both.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm fine, but this task is kind of boring, and at the same time nerve racking, thinking of what you might do if I mess up,\"<br>\r\nAnna laughed, \"What do you think I'm going to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Tearing off my head for one thing,\" Jeremy replied in a flat tone.<br>\r\n\"Do you really think I would do that?\"<br>\r\n\"Metaphorically,\" Jeremy elaborated, he said moving onto the other leg.<br>\r\n\"Well take care of them,\" She said sternly, \"Anyway, so My half-brother is going to be organizing a swap poker game tomorrow, anything you're looking forward to getting?\"<br>\r\n\"Just my old life, and a few other things,\" Jeremy answered.<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Anna asked, inquisitively.<br>\r\n\"Can't tell you, you wouldn't believe me.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, Josie, you can trust yourself,\" Anna said, and Jeremy gave a fake laugh, \"Well, as for me, legs and life are a given, but I have a few other plans I would like to enact.\"<br>\r\nJeremy shuddered at the thought as he rinsed his legs.<br>\r\n\"I can see why you like these leg so much,\" He said lifting one into the air, as the the light reflected of the smooth skin, \"So soft, and well formed.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, don't get attached, I'll have my legs back soon.\"<br>\r\nJeremy stepped out, \"Oh, and you're in my life, a girl, if you wrap a towel around your waist, you'll be flashing everyone you chest, so cover up.\"<br>\r\nJeremy tried his best, and got a towel covering his chest and privates, after drying himself off.<br>\r\n\"TTYL,\" Anna said, as the phone hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy grabbed his clothes, and reached for his phone, as it rung, with a photo of Greg, Jeremy turned pale.<br>\r\nHe picked up, against his best judgement.<br>\r\n\"Hey babe,\" He breathed though the phone, \"Where've you been? I've been trying to contact you since our special picnic.\"<br>\r\nJeremy moved the phone away, took a breath, and prepared to be Anna, like she taught him, \"Well, because of our anniversary and skipping school, I got grounded, I managed to smooth it over for awhile, but I'm not allowed to be near you, or talk to you, because your a bad influence.\"<br>\r\n\"Me, a bad influence, they never even tried to get to know me, and since when did you listen to your parent?\" he asked, finding it odd of Jeremy.<br>\r\n\"Since I realized that they still have to much control over me for the next few years, so until this all calms down, and I can love you freely again,I can't talk to you,\" Jeremy said, \"See you later, love,\" He sighs hanging up, Jeremy fall against the wall.<br>\r\n<i>\"Was the Anna enough?\"</i> He thought to him self, <i>\"I hope I didn't mess it up.\"</i><br>\r\nJeremy went to 'his' room, locked the door behind him, and dressed himself after drying while explaining to Anna what had just happened by text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie wasn't to happy with her changes either. <br>\r\nJosie had finished her shower, and shed her towel, and prepared to get dressed. She reached into her underwear drawer, and pulled out a pair of boxer shorts.<br>\r\n\"Two days, and I'm still not used to them,\" Josie sighed, pulling Phillip underwear up her legs, \"Less then a day left, and I can get my underwear back,\" She said as she put on her pajama's, pulling her top down over her head, and past her chest, she straightened it out, her hands brushing over her flat chest, she pulled the neck of the pajama top out, and saw the chest hair she now had, it wasn't thick, but it still disgusted her.<br>\r\n\"And I can get you to back,\" she said hugging her self, feeling at a loss with out her normal assets. She pulled her pajama bottoms up, and collapsed on her bed.<br>\r\n\"Soon,\" she comforted herself. She picked up her phone, and called Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang, *Brinng* *Brinng* *Brinng*<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Michael greeted Josie warmly over the phone with a high pitched voice.<br>\r\n\"Hi, can we talk, I want to tke my mind off of things,\" She said, looking away from her flat chest.<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Michael replied, \"Anything on your mind?\"<br>\r\n\"How are you doing at your Mum's place?\"<br>\r\n\"Better than I thought, at first it was kind of scary, the thought of being in a new house with a stranger that I would have to treat like my mother, but she was really nice, giving me a second birthday, we didn't do much, watched a few film, had Pizza and cake, but she was so kind, I wonder how being raised by her changed me in this reality, and how Phillip is the person she rose.\"<br>\r\n\"Put one point for Nature,\" Josie said, trying to forget about Phillip and what he might be doing with her traits.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how I feel about having two Mum's, I love my Mum, but Claire is so nice to be with,\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe you and I can swap mother's tomorrow, that would give me and chance to Really mess with Phillip,\" Josie smirked,enjoying this idea, \"Anything you would want to get tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n\"Other then my things back, no,\" Michael said.<br>\r\n\"Even your Mum?\"<br>\r\nThere as a pause, \"I don't know, and my Dad did make them for a fun, and weird kind of fun, but maybe when we stop trying to get at each other, we could have fun with it.\"<br>\r\n\"Your Dad made the cards!?\" Josie cried in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and long time ago for my parents, both biological and step.\"</span></div></div>",

He was not even allowed to talk to \"his\" brother, his new mom was very strict about it, probably because of Anna's attitude concerning school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy was currently working towards the school with his brother for the time being Melody. \"It really sucks...\", sighed Jeremy. \"Mom doesn't even allow me to play Poker with you guys for at least another day. I hope you guys can endure at least another day without playing.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looked at him and smiled. \"Ah, don't worry. We'll wait.\", she said. What Jeremy did not know, the four of them were playing. Philipp was not allowed because everyone knew that his sex drive would prevent him from listening to the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jeremy was occupied with learning as Anna, the others were playing just for fun. Without Philipp to worry about it was way more fun. Everyone got to discover a complete new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Melody had Michael's life, Anna's clothes and Josie's hair. She was the one who did not win very often and was seldom selected as a swapee. She somehow missed the time when she had Michael's penis. It was kinda gross but exciting as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway... I have to head to class... If I'm late I'll probably get even more grounded time.\", he sighed and went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looked after him and smiled. \"I hope he won't come back anytime soon. It's just too much fun having all these swaps and my smart, older brother doesn't notice a thing.\", she giggled.</span></div></div>",

Although you would not call her a girl anymore if you were able to see the swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody found her on the hallway chatting with Michael who was currently inhibiting Jeremy's old life. \"There you are.\", grinned Melody and walked over to Anna and kissed her at the lips. Melody lost her shyness around 4 days ago. It did not matter to her what people thought at least not when it was normal like kissing \"her\" girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna grinned at the little girl. She really changed over the couse of the week. All have. Living someone other's life, having someone other's belongings or body parts really changes the person, seeing life from someone elses eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you guys doing?\", asked Melody and smiled at the changed Anna. She currently had her brother's chest and penis, which made her more or less Melody's boyfriend although the world would say otherwise. The brown hair she got from Josie who originally got it from Melody, did not help that much. Although she was wearing one of Josie's pink tank-tops and Josie's favorite jeans skirt which had two little flowers on it right above her right knee. If someone would have looked beneath it, he would have seen that Anna was wearing Michael's underwear. On her feet she was wearing Michael's blue sneakers. She was putting her big, hairy hands, which she got from Michael, at Melody's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at the two and ran his red-painted, manicured hand through his short hair, a mannerism he had gotten over the course of the week. He had not gotten the chance to get his hands back since Anna swapped them with him 6 days ago. At least he got to keep his hair so far and he really loved the feeling of his sister's hand against his head. He also acquired Josie's face last night. It was arkward to see her face mimic every motion he did. \"At least we didn't do any personality changes so far.\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael scratched his crotch slightly because it itched and thought about how Josie might feel with having his penis right now. The three girls made a deal with him so that they could have his penis while Jeremy was not allowed to play. He still had Anna's vagina who acquired his penis first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting horney?\", teased Anna her brother who was now considered her boyfriends best friend. Michael looked at her. \"No.\", he said with Josie's voice. He had swapped his voice back with Melody the first day but Josie thought it would be more fun to swap the voices. So he had her voice since then. \"It's just that Philipp's... er  I mean Jeremy's underwear is really itchy. At least Jeremy was so kind to take your breasts away from me, Anna. Although she has to deal with my underwear.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your own fault for swapping underwear with Jeremy.\", said Anna shrugging her shoulders. \"I only did it becase she said that she felt uncomfortable in 'the boxers of these pervert'. I didn't have any choice, she's just more comfortable in my underwear.\", he replied and stomped with his foot which was clad in one of Anna's 1-inch ankle-boots. \"I don't understand what she meant with it anyway. These are her boxers.\", Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you've grown fond of wearing high-heels.\", smiled Melody and tried to take the conversation to a different subject. \"No I did certainly not.\", he said. \"Especially since I was walking in the shoes of all you three literally. Josie...\", Michael stopped there because he knew no matter what he told her, just like it was the case with Philipp's underwear, Anna would never believe him. She was not playing at the time these swaps took place. \"Jeremy just wanted me to wear them because I looked so cute in them. It's her favorite pair.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\", said Anna and looked at Melody. \"I guess we've got to get to class, I'll see you at lunch.\", she said and kissed Melody again. Anna also began liking to play a different role in life. \"Come on, Michael. We're going to be late.\".</span></div></div>",

Any suggestion what we might swap if we win?\", asked Michael who just got to the cafeteria. \"How about you get into Melody's life and get her clothes. Would be fun.\", grinned Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shook his head. \"No way. I'm just not ready for that. Getting into the girls bathroom is one thing but in that of Melody's school? No thanks.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lame-O.\", grinned Melody. \"How about we-\", she then wanted to continue but then was interrupted by Michael. \"Tsch! Jeremy... I mean Josie is approching.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\", smiled Jeremy. \"Finally lunch. The only time when I get to talk to my friends... Well, I get to talk to your friends.\", he said and looked at Michael who Jeremy thought was his best friends sister, although in reality he was actually his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you have the five minutes here were you can talk to us.\", said Michael and tried to not smile at him, he did not want that Jeremy began to think anything strange about Anna. That was the confusing thing about all these swaps. The whole world perceived Michael as Jeremy while Jeremy perceived him as Anna, just like Philipp but he has not spoken to him for a while, he's probably pissed off that the others did not allow him to play or he was too busy with his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? Does mom allow you to play with us tonight?\", asked Melody just to let the two other hear what Jeremy told her this morning with their own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said this morning, I don't think so. Michael, you really seem to did some grave things concerning school.\", he said. \"I gotta go now... My girl friends are waiting.\". Jeremy then left the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\", smiled Anna. \"This way we don't have to swap back, yet.\".</span></div></div>",

But this, however, didn't stop them from having their fun later that night.  At the agreed upon time they met at Melody's house, only so that Jeremy won't suspect a thing.  \" I still think you should give my life a try Micheal.  I mean, you have already had Josie's and now you have Anna's Life.  You never know, you might actually like it.\" said Melody trying to coax him into trying it out.  'I honestly just want to see him wear my uniform,' thought Melody with a slight grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you.  I don't want to do it because I really don't want to be a foot taller than everyone else I go to school with.\" exclaimed Michael as he was getting the cards out of Anna's backpack.  ' I honestly want to try and get back to my own life,' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is that all that is keeping him from doing it?' wondered Melody.  With that she began to think of a way to get him into her life and a few moments later she actually thought of a way to do it and to feel accepted by the rest of the group.  \"Hey Josie, I need to talk to you about something\"  Melody whispered to Josie as she was passing by.  Over the next minute, while Anna and Micheal were squabbling about where they are going to play the game, Melody told Josie of the plan and how she felt about the entire thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that whats going on?\" wondered Josie, \" If that's the case, then I think we need to have some fun with my boyfriend.\" Josie told Melody with a wink in her eye.  \"Do you think we should get Anna in on the plan too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can, but she doesn't have anything of yours to share with him\" Josie told Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but it was worth a try\" Melody shared halfheartedly with Josie.  Then they heard a rhythmic tapping on the floor. They both looked over next to Melody's bed to see Micheal with Anna's boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys ready to get this game going?\" Micheal asked them.  He was wondering what they were talking about over there. \"Well, lets get this game going.  Who is going to deal first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it last time, so I think Melody should do it.\"  Said Anna to her \"brother\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, 'ladies',\" Melody said with a slight grin.  Within a few minutes she discovered that she had won the hand with a 3 of a kind over Micheal's pair of Jacks.  \"Yay!\" Melody squealed with delight.  She looked over to Josie and immediately thought of what to swap.  \"I want to swap bodies with Micheal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Wha......\" Before Micheal knew it he had Melody's small 5 foot frame and her small bust. \"ttt.  Why did you do that?\" Micheal squealed with Melody's high voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you must know, I did it so that you can get a chance to live my life.  You said earlier that the only thing that was keeping you from trying it out was that you didn't want to tower over every body in the school and now you won't.\" exclaimed Melody.  'Plus, now I think I can finally feel accepted by the others with his body.' she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so cute \"big bro\", Anna said jokingly to Micheal. \"Hey look on the bright side, at least you still have my wardrobe instead of Melody's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I would rather have my clothes.\" Micheal said mostly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't anything wrong with these clothes,\" Josie said slightly moving around so that the group can see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am stuck like this for the next couple days.\" Micheal sighed, \"Let's get this game back on track\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie took cards and started shuffling them.</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed slightly bigger he thought to himself as he glanced around the room.  'I don't think it will be as bad as I thought it was, but I still need to fight it so that I can stay in High School with my friends, even if I don't have my correct body for the time being. Well, I haven't had my correct body for the past week, I have had parts of mostly Anna and Josie with some parts of my own intermingled between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think I am ready to choose.\" Josie announced matter of factly. \" I want to swap wardrobes with Micheal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, are you two ganging up on him tonight or what\" said an amused Anna. \"I don't know, but I kind of find it funny.  It's not everyday that I get to see him squirming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Anna.\" said Micheal now dressed in the school uniform that Melody wears to school.  He had to change the way he was sitting so that they couldn't see up his new skirt, which was slightly shorter than what he was wearing of Anna's shortly before.  \"Okay Melody, are you happy with what you wanted to see?\" wondered Micheal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, are you enjoying yourself?\" She bounced it back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that I am happy to get out of that uniform\" chuckled Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn to deal the cards\" Micheal said as he had to reach a little bit further. \" But first, I need to use the rest room.  I didn't have to go until I got your little body Melody.  I will be right back and don't play without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I was actually holding it before we started the game, but I wanted to see if it would transfer too\" chuckled Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Anna and Josie said at the same time while laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Micheal was back and ready to deal the cards.  He has had a quite a bit of practice over the past week and has become somewhat of a pro using the restroom as a female.  He had the card dealt out and soon found who had won that round.</span></div></div>",

I just want you to be happy and we can always swap it back after awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were taken aback. Neither of them thought that they would hear those words come out of his mouth.

She was sitting very rigidly on the floor and not looking at Josie. 'I can't do this, I mean faking a relationship at school is one thing, but this is something completely different.' Melody thought to herself.  \"I don't know if I can do this, I mean I am attracted to guys and I am so confused.\" Melody said.  She was on the verge of tears and didn't want to cry in front of her new friends.  All of her friends were looking at her and actually started feeling sorry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked at Micheal, \"You did this and you need to fix it.  I mean she may have a teenage boys body, but mentally she is still a 13 year old girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will fix it in the next round if everyone will fold.\" Micheal said as he was taking charge.

But now, I see you as a little sister.  These cards are something, huh?\" she whispered back. \"And as for why I chose a body swap.  I envied how everybody chose to swap with you and left me in the shadows.  I thought that if I swap with you, then people will want to swap with me and I can try out other things without having to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news devastated Micheal.  First, he now had a crush on his best friend's little sister and just found out why.  She had a crush on him to begin with. Secondly, she was feeling ostracized from the group.  He now was going to feel how it felt to be in the shadows and not get chosen.  'Okay, I can get through this, I mean, I am still in High School at least.  I can hang out with my friends at school and after.  Although he will still be smaller and more fragile in his new form, he was sure that reality will change to suit his new form.  But if I do gain Melody's life, then everything will be suited for my new frame.  Man, I am so confused!' Micheal thought as he grabbed his head.  Then he looked down and saw what Melody was saying.  He saw a body that looks complete, no abnormal body parts that shouldn't be there, nothing.  This actually comforted him, somewhat.  \"Melody, can I talk to you in private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.  Alright, no swapping until we both get back.\" Melody stated and the other players just nodded. All the time wondering what was going on.  Melody and Micheal the went into the hallway and closed the door behind them.  \"So what did you want to talk about?\" wondered Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just wanted to see if I could make an offer with you.\" Micheal told his now crush. 'Damn it!' he thought, 'I can't even look at her in the face with out this feeling in the pits of my stomach.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What offer would that be?\" wondered Melody. \"Are you now considering to take my life for a couple days?  If so, what would you like in return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal blushed, \"I want you to take Jeremy's Life.\" he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" answered Melody as she leaned in closer to Micheal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to take Jeremy's Life!!\" Micheal said almost shouting then immediately dreaded it. As an overwhelming wave of shyness overcame him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, are you blushing?\" Melody teased. \"I will do it, that way if you have any questions on school, friends, family, or even my life, I will be there for you.\"  Upon hearing this, Micheal had his shyness overcome with sheer ecstasy.  \"Lets go back into the room and finish up this night and get you into a new life with your new brother.\" Melody said as she winked in his direction.

Prior to the switch, Josie could be seen snuggling up next to Melody and thanks to Micheal, Melody didn't seem to mind it one bit. But soon after the phrase was uttered and Josie soon found herself snuggling with Melody's small body.  She instantly backed away and soon found herself next to Melody with Micheal's body with some \"upgrades\" from some of the other girls.  \"So Micheal has his own life back,\" Melody stated to the group. 'But I don't know for how long, though.' she quickly thought to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder if I can stay in my life,' Micheal thought to himself.  'I mean, if I don't win, I can stay in this my life and I can go back to High School.'  After thinking this he automatically felt giddy because he knew that meant P.E. 'OMG, I can't believe that I cam getting turned on about P.E.'  \"I think I made a mistake with the previous swap\" he muttered to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which mistake would that be?\" Anna answered back to her brother.  \"The fact that Melody is now attracted to her \"younger\" sister or the fact that you are now attracted to Melody's, or should I say, your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I would have to say both, but I didn't think about the consequences that the last swap would have had on the new reality.\"  Micheal said mostly to himself but quickly found out that the others were listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are still playing and we can fix this problem over the course of the night.\"  Melody said to the group as she got nearer and nearer to Josie.  \"What do you guys think?  Should we play another 4 or 5 hands and then call it a night?\" Melody asked the group.  \"It's starting to get dark outside and I think Mom is going to come in here soon to tell us that \"Melody\" needs to go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group agreed to this proposition and the group got together for another quick game of poker to see who the next person will be to get swapped around.</span></div></div>",

As soon as he heard the door click he went to the nearest mirror to check out the \"damages\".  When he reached the mirror he saw a young girl with blonde hair cascading past her shoulders.  He now had cute doe-like brown eyes, a cute button nose and a large A-cup bust.  While he was standing near the mirror he glanced over to a calendar that was hanging up close by.  There was a Saturday circled. \"Melody's Sleepover\".  After seeing this he called for Micheal to get over here as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Sis?\"  Micheal questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know anything about a sleep over tomorrow night?\"  He questioned his new brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, that is tomorrow night isn't it?  I honestly forgot all about it.\"  A distraught Micheal said to her sister.  \"I guess you will have to take my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody sighed when he heard the new situation. \"I guess I have no choice, I mean it will be bad to cancel for no real reason and when or if you get your life back I don't want you to have fewer friends than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a million!\" Micheal said as she hugged Melody. \"I will owe you big time for this, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody was shocked and didn't want to move, here he had his crush hugging him and he was now in heaven.  'I don't want this moment to end at all.'  He thought to himself.  But like most great things it had to come to an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go and finish up a project that will be due on Monday and I will see you later.\" Micheal said as she let go of the embrace that Melody was absolutely loving.  With that it was all over and Melody was left alone again.  He went about checking the contents of the room to see what has changed and how he was going to have to get by.</span></div></div>",

So every Michael had to get up there and get the cards, which resulted that poor, little Melody had to climb up on the dusty attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have really hidden them in a place not that filthy and dusty.\", she mumbled annoyed and looked for the place Michael had shown her two days ago. It was not a problem if they went up there after the game, because Michael's parents usually went to bed early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is.\", she mumbled and grabbed the box in which the cards were stored. \"No wonder that this is the perfect hideout. I wouldn't go up here if I didn't have to.\", she thought and went back to what was currently her room. Melody thought about what they should swap this time. \"It should be something funny, 'cause my brother won't notice it.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted as soon as she saw a fourth person sitting in what was currently her room. Melody was so surprised by the look of her brother, with his smoot, hairless, feminine legs which were covered in some shorts he usually wore around the house, sitting there on the ground with the others, that Melody accidentely let the box fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy!\", she shouted out surprised. \"What are you doing here?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Mom' allowed me to play with you guys because I have done so much for school that I can have one evening of fun for now... As long as it is around the house. Not that I'd want to go out.\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\", she mumbled slightly disappointed. All the fun she had in the last couple of days was over now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should swap all back now, right?\", asked Melody out of that disappointment but received shaking heads from the others. \"No, we can't Philipp isn't here. I guess we can have some fun swapping.\", Jeremy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie's right.\", answered Anna who still thought that Jeremy's real name was Josie. \"We can't swap back but some swaps might be fun. Everyone should just be okay with whatever we're swapping.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll nodded in unision.  \"Yeah,  it's not like it's permanent and the pervert isn't here, so we can have the intended fun we should have with the cards.\", smiled Josie. Jeremy was kind of surprised to hear his little sister referring to Philipp as a pervert but he kinda was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then get the cards out of the-\", began Michael and looked over to the box Melody let fall down. \"What's that?\", he asked and pointed at a hidden \"door\" which opened slightly when the box fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crawled over and opened it completely, to find four cards stashed in there. \"Four additional cards?\", he asked surprised. \"Joker cards... Wait here is a note as well.\". He grabbed the note and began reading it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These cards are special cards which can be used additionally to the game. When you want to use them, simply mix them into the card deck. If someone wins with one of the cards on his hand, you cannot swap something between yourself and someone else. Instead you can choose two of the losers and choose one aspect to be swapped between the two of them.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if we use them and we win, I could decide that Michael has to swap something with Anna?\", asked Josie to make sure she understood it correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded. \"As far as I understand it, it works just like normal. Ah, here is a not what we have to say to make the swap happen. I want that X swaps Y with Z.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Shall we use the cards? Might be fun.\", Jeremy suggested. He was just glad that  he could do something else than simply learning the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else agreed and they began playing. The poor Jeremy who was not allowed to play during the last days won as the first one. The question is, did he won with a Joker on his hand?</span></div></div>",

He did not want that something like Philipp happened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone shook their head. \"No, no problem.\", Melody said. \"I guess everyone is okay with everything. We're swapping back in a few days or weeks anyway.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when Melody mentioned swapping back, that Josie noticed that she probably won't get everything back. Her breasts and her underwear was still in possession of Philipp and she was sure that he would not want to give them back. \"Maybe I can discuss a solution with the others...\", she thought. \"But not now... Try to ignore it... For now...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\", smiled Jeremy. \"I think I'll go for something small. I want that Josie swaps hair with Michael.\". Nothing happened. \"What's wrong? I'm still in the time limit. It's only 30 seconds ago that I won.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked at Jeremy. \"Well, I think you have to say Jeremy instead of Josie. You remember? We swapped names.\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy nodded. \"Ah, right. Okay then. I want that Josie swaps hair with Michael.\". Right after than, Josie's long, blond hair, she acquired from Anna, was getting shorter until it was cut the same way Michael's did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's hair on the other hand has gotten longer and styled in the same way Anna's was. He ran his manicured hand through his hair. He would really miss the feeling of his sister's hand on his short hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good, Michael.\", grinned Jeremy. \"Okay, then let's continue.\".</span></div></div>",

Then she took a look at her former brother, Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at Josie she smiled and said, \"I know.  Since Josie is well on her way to becoming a girl and everybody outside this group already things of her as such.  I am going to make it official.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie had a terrified look on his face.

Melody was smaller than he was so the changes weren't too noticeable.  His hips widened out only slightly and his butt got just a little bit bigger.  One change that he did notice however was that the one thing that he had left that made him still feel like a boy was now gone.  Josie reached down and ran her hand over her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gone!\" he exclaimed almost in fear.  He glared at Melody who giggled.  The she looked down at herself and realized what she had actually done.  She had been focusing on making Josie a girl.  She had forgotten that that also meant she would now technically be a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillip looked at Josie and grins, \"Hey babe!

She looked around at everyone at the table.  \"Switching something with Michael might be interesting,\" she thought to herself.    Perhaps she would take a cue from Melody and switch their genitals.  She continues to look around the table.  She had the same thought about Phillip that Melody did.  She didn't really want anything of his, and he'd enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she settled on Josie again.  There was a bit of a trend now in giving her things that would make her new life as a girl more authentic, and she had started it with her name.  She decided to continue the trend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to donate my upper torso to the 'make Josie a full girl' cause,\" Jeremy announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wanted those!\" Phillip exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Josie needs them,\" Jeremy snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\"  Josie exclaimed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all waited for a few seconds but nothing happened.  Then Jeremy rephrased, \"I want to swap my upper torso with Josie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael observed the whole scene with amusement.  On the one hand, his girlfriend wasn't as much fun now, however Josie's plight was kind of funny.  Anna just rolled her eyes completely unable to follow what was going on and had given up trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie felt her shoulders that had just started to broaden pull inward.  She also felt her waist pull inward and become more narrow and trim.  She'd have Jeremy's hourglass figure if it wasn't for Melodies small hips.  She also felt her ribs pull in and her whole upper body become more trim and skinny.  The most noticeable change however was her chest.  She felt it swell outward in a veritable explosion.  In almost no time her flat male chest was now adorned with Jeremy's D-cups breasts.  Her shirt was pulled tight, but it also expanded a bit so as to accommodate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see your nipples,\" Phillip announced as he stared at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy short Phillip a disapproving glare, however Phillip was to engrossed in Josie's breasts to even notice.  Jeremy reached under her shirt and pulled out the bra that she no longer needed, not noticing that it had shrunk down to be totally flat, not even an A cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell do you have a bra?\"  Anna, still oblivious, asked with disgust.  \"Are you a pervert too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael tried desperately to explain to Anna about all the swaps that had occurred since she stopped playing, however Anna couldn't hear him and just thought he was being weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy actually got up from the table and walked over to Josie to try to help her be a bit more presentable in front of Phillip.  \"I think Josie and I are going to sit this hand out,\" Jeremy said as she took Josie to the bathroom to put the bra on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two girls were in the bathroom Jeremy said, \"This is probably cheating but I don't want Phillip staring at my ... er, your breasts.  Take your shirt off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie was stunned.  She was both excited and terrified at the same time.  She still had her old sexual orientation and was highly uncomfortable with this whole situation that she had accidentally gotten herself into.  Nevertheless, she decided to do it.  Phillip's staring made her even more uncomfortable.  It was awkward on so many levels to be started at by her friend Phillip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie took a deep breath and lifted the shirt above her head.  Jeremy was ready almost immediately with the bra.  Josie didn't even really get to peek in the mirror before Jeremy had her nipples covered up by her bra.  \"Oh no,\" Jeremy exclaimed.  \"It doesn't fit.\" as she realized that the bra had shrunk along with her chest.  Josie looked over and saw her reflection and her incredible body in just a tiny bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really strange to see his male head and face sitting atop this attractive busty female body.  He also still had his arms which looked just as out of place as his head.  Josie got a great view of most of her new breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This didn't work out at all,\" Jeremy said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK,\" Josie started.  \"I'll just go up to Michael's room and borrow several extra shirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie put her shirt back on without the useless bra.  Jeremy put her unnecessary bra back on.  They both walked upstairs into Michael's room and pulled out some clean thick sweatshirts.  Once they were done with that they went back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was still sitting around the table.  Josie and Jeremy tried desperately to see if they had played a hand while they were gone, but everything looked normal to them.  They all sat back down and dealt another hand.</span></div></div>",

Josie wanted to do an exciting swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonal Information. What is meant with personal information? She should try it out but start with something small. A name? Address? Hobbies?

If she doesn't want to play anymore we can't force her and she can't win her things back.

I <i>am</i> a man of simple tastes. And there are so many options available.

Immediately Philipp's butt started to increase in fullness until it stretched out the fabric of his jeans, taking the shape that Josie had. Similarly, Josie's butt started to deflate slightly until it resembled a more boyish look. Both of their hips also changed curvature to accommodate for the change, but not enough to qualify as an actual swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is interesting, my jeans seemed to have expanded as if they were custom-fit for Josie's-- er, my butt!\" Philipp laughed, as he began to feel his newly-acquired 'asset'. \"Well, that's part of the reality change\" Josie reminded him, as she looked down at herself and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Melody cleared her throat. \"Umm... do you think we should write down all of the swaps that happen?\" She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Josie replied. \"It's pretty easy to see what has been swapped between each of us. Between Anna and Jeremy's legs, my room and Anna's, Michael and my handedness, and now Philipp and my butts, it should be obvious to each of us what traits are ours or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, let's get the next hand going!\" Philipp said gleefully, as Josie shuffled the deck and dealt out the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wins the next round?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jeremy--  Philipp and I both have third hour band class together. And no offense or anything, but you couldn't play a musical instrument or read sheet music to save your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much less be the first-chair.\" Philipp interjected, feeling a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this could be problematic.\" Jeremy mused. \"That is... unless I swapped musical talent with you too, Phil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way dude!\" Philipp spat. \"Do you know how hard I worked for that distinction? How much practice it took??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need it anymore, the way I see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says you! You just stole my classes from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I didn't know you cared so much about school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let's take it easy now!\" Josie interrupted and raised her arms out as if to block the daggers shooting from Philipp's eyes. \"This is only for two days, get over it! If you didn't want to swap something then you shouldn't have played.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Philipp calmed down and smiled. \"OK, fine. But you'll have to win it off me first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sighed in relief. \"This is certainly the most <i>interesting</i> birthday I've ever had.\" He muttered. \"Are we all good?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Michael's decision to stop playing for the night, the game ended and the remaining participants tried to make sense of where to head home for the night. Jeremy's house remained unchanged since all he swapped were his legs and leg-wear. His new sister Anna found out, after a quick look at her social media accounts, that she now lived at Josie's house. With Philip gone and Melody sleeping upstairs, Josie reasoned that she lived with Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god that I get my own house for a while,\" Anna said, \"I could use a break from my idiot brother for the next two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise,\" Michael retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>sis</i>,\" Jeremy gestured towards Anna, \"how about I give you a ride to your new home then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me. You better not mess up my legs or I swear I will shave yours.\" Anna said back. Jeremy could only gulp as the two of them started walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Birthday, see you tomorrow at school Michael,\" Josie said blowing a kiss. She stumbled a bit with her new larger feet but caught up with Jeremy and Anna and walked out with them leaving Michael to clean up the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will certainly get interesting tomorrow,\" Michael sighed. He picked up the cards and hid them in a secret spot in his room. It would be disastrous if anyone else were to get their hands on them. With nothing else to do, he crawled into bed and drifted off to sleep. Michael's life, as described by someone else, was great: he was healthy, he had decent grades, he was dating a beautiful girl, and had an average social life to top it off. Michael, however, thought that his life had become boring recently. He enjoyed going to school, playing sports with his friends on the weekend, and spending time with Josie, but he felt that there was something that he was missing. He envied Phillip's fantastic musical ability, Jeremy's insane intelligence, and even Anna's way to life. He had a good life but he didn't have anything to define him: he was just an average Joe. While stroking his girlfriend's hair half asleep, he thought about the possibilities that the cards could hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, after getting dropped off at her new house, was welcomed by her new host family who treated her somewhat like an exchange student. She exchanged a few words but quickly ran to where Josie said her new room was. It was weird enough having Jeremy's manly legs underneath her new jeans, she didn't want to get into the details of her rooming arrangements. Her new room had the exact same decorations as her previous one but was a tad bit bigger. Anna fell in with the wrong crowd early in middle school. She became friends with the wrong people and has been acting out ever since. To her and her group of friends, popularity was everything. Since then, Anna had been dressing more provocatively and acting out more which bled into her developing personality. Deep down, she knows that her friends are a bad influence and wants to break up with them but she could never do it to save her face. Now that she had the cards, however, things might change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip arrived at his home and was almost immediately sent to bed. He had previously had a curfew of midnight but now had to be in his room, and in bed, by ten. The cards had really changed everything; Part of him was scared about what changes they could bring but part of him wanted to continue playing and win some more <i>parts</i> from others. His new feet were only the first thing that he wanted to try out. As he sat in his new room caressing his feet he heard his mother shout \"Lights out Phillip! It's past your bedtime.\" He knew she was serious and obliged. Philip had no idea why he became so perverted in the first place, but he has come to accept it about himself. Philip's innate perversion was only rivaled by his love for music. These two things made up who he was and wouldn't change it for the world. However, he was still very excited to play cards on Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy was having trouble dealing with Anna's legs and her new short skirt, but he knew the others probably had a worse time. Driving home was especially difficult with his new proportions and he almost crashed twice. Luckily, both him and Josie made it to his house safely. Jeremy had a test the following day and wanted to get some last minute studying done. He liked to keep his life relatively calm; his intelligence had put him into more demanding advanced classes so he had less free time than normal. He enjoyed playing sports with Michael on the weekend but his weekdays were usually filled with homework and studying. It didn't help that his parents were pushing him very hard to get into a good college. As he went over the long list of Latin root words, he couldn't help but think that he could use a vacation from his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie had the same reaction that Anna had upon entering her new home: she exchanged pleasantries with Jeremy's parents but quickly left for her room. Josie's life was very similar to Michael's which was one of the reasons they started dating. She was exceptionally average in everything that she did. Her parents were extremely religious and forced her to dress and act conservatively all the time. She was very non-confrontational and simply adopted it as her own. She would like to know what its like to act out once in a while instead of being known as the goody two-shoes with the big tits all of the time. She sat on her bed, disturbed by Phillip's feet and slightly thrilled by Michael's hair, as she contemplated the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody thought that she was the biggest winner of the night. Not only did she not have to go to bed so early, she was also living under the same room as her crush, Michael. As she dreamed of the two of them spending the day together, she couldn't help but think that the cards could make it a reality. Melody had always been envious of the things around her. Her parents often held Jeremy in higher regard since he was smarter and older. Melody, while above average, was nowhere near as intelligent as Jeremy was and didn't receive the same attention that her brother did. She was jealous of some of the other girls in her middle school who had started developing before her. Mainly, she was jealous of Josie, who snagged the attraction of her one and only true love. She had to have him and the cards could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality had altered their lives quite a bit and they all wanted to play with the cards again. However, Friday separated them from their Saturday night poker game.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Philip awoke the next morning earlier than he normally did. Going to bed earlier than normal had messed up his biological clock. He groggily rolled out of bed and pulled the curtains open on his window only to find that the sun was not shining yet. \"Great,\" he thought to himself, \"I can't sleep in anymore.\" Reluctantly, he started his morning routine. By the time the sun finally started to rise, he had taken a shower, eaten breakfast, and gotten fully dressed. \"Why do people wake up this early?\" He questioned himself, \"There is nothing to do.\" Philip went back up to his room to inspect his new feet some more until it came time to catch the school bus. His parents acted exactly as they did before around him. They didn't notice that his feet had shrunk by two inches and had their toenails painted pink. \"At least I don't have any wardrobe changes like Jeremy.\" Philip shuddered at the thought of wearing a skirt and having everyone think it was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus ride to school was the same as it had always been until he reached Josie's house. The bus made an unexpected stop that broke Philip's train of thought; the bus normally passed right though this stop ever since Josie had started driving to school. He was startled when Anna's grumpy face climbed up the steps of the bus. After seeing Philip, she made a beeline for where he was sitting. She was wearing some of Jeremy's baggy jeans in an attempt to hide her manly legs; however, nobody made a big deal as they saw Anna, whose skimpy top showed off plenty of cleavage, wear baggy jeans that covered her entire bottom half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your night?\" Philip prodded her as she sat down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was horrible!\" she exclaimed, lightening her demeanor now that she had someone to talk to. \"My new <i>parents</i> are extremely strict. As soon as I walked in the door, they asked about everything that I had done at the party and if there were any drugs there. They even gave me grief for my makeup and clothing choices this morning. I actually prefer my stupid family to Josie's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her parents are very religious so they would be against you showing this much skin,\" Philip replied, \"although, I thoroughly enjoy your choice of tops today.\" He glanced down at her very visible cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh piss off,\" Anna shouted as she shoved Philip against the side of the bus. \"I should've known better than to sit next to your perverted ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus rounded its last corner and pulled into the school lot. Philip and Anna said their goodbyes as they headed off to their individual classes. Philip caught several guys checking out Anna's new ass as she walked away and he shuttered. The cards are very powerful indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip's day was relatively normal; he didn't have any of his friends in his classes until after lunch and he didn't have a big change like Anna's legs. Although, he was still stumbling a bit on the stairs due to his new feet. Even at PE, where he had to expose his girly feet to the entire locker room, nobody thought that pink nail polish was out of place on him. About an hour before lunch, he started thinking about what he could accomplish with the cards. The obvious choice was to get Josie's breasts. However, that was only temporary and would definitely be swapped back after two days. But what if there was a way that he could make it appear to the other players that it was normal? Philip wanted to make it so that everybody, including the other player thought it was normal for Philip to have Josie's parts. That way, he wouldn't arouse anybody's anger when he had them and could even have them forever if he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pondered his idea throughout the entirety of his English class before lunch. He quickly ruled out Josie's breasts as his permanent addition. He wanted to know what they felt like but didn't want to lug them around forever. It took some thought but he finally decided that he wanted to be Josie's boyfriend. That way, he would be able to get access to them as much as he wanted without having to have them forever. After deciding this, he needed to figure out how to make the other players think that this is normal. He knew that all players realized that the switches have been made and all non-players recognized it as normal. It was going to be difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could start on a solution, the school bell rang for lunch. He headed to the cafeteria pondering his situation on the way. At the cafeteria, he spotted Michael and Josie sitting together but Michael gave him an evil eye so he just passed them. Instead he sat next to his other friend James. James was a 5'8\" tall brainiac who was also good with a saxophone. James had been a close friend to Philip throughout middle school and he felt comfortable discussing the situation with him. To top it off, James was also somewhat of a pervert, although to a lesser extent than Philip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey James,\" Philip said, \"I have a problem that I think you can help with.\" James, who was mouth deep into a sub sandwich looked up at Philip before finishing taking a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you Philip,\" he replied, \"what kind of problem are we talking about.\" Over the lunch period, Philip drew out the problem of swapping so nobody would notice. He replaced parts of the story with random people and didn't talk about the poker cards at all. He didn't want the secret of the cards to leak out yet. James listened carefully and tried to map it out on paper while the two talked. At the end of the lunch period both friends had finished their lunches and were now fully engrossed in trying to solve this problem. The lunch bell rang just as James reached an ultimatum.</span></div></div>",

She looked down and nothing had changed except one thing: Instead of her blond hair, there was now long red hair falling into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Josie and still saw her own head over there. Looking closer she saw that the neck seemed to have stayed the same although it was pretty hard to tell.

She grabbed her purse and got out a compact mirror and looked at her own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beautiful.\", she smiled and made several grimaces finding it funny to see Josie's face copying every move.

On the other hand Cindy was now going as Anna and lost all memory of being a mother and now had the memories of being a 15 year old in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Cindy stood up and told the kids that they were done for the night and that they needed to go home. Cindy couldn't wait to lay down in bed and call her husband. The new Anna had been texting her boyfriend Jake and was hoping they'd have some fun tonight. </span></div></div>",

I'm not an entirely uncool mom you know. It's perfectly natural for you kids to be curious and to play a little strip poker,\" she said, still not believing in the magic of the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said Mrs. Ferguson.... it isn't like that. It really is magic. Here, let me show you,\" he said, readying his swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that's my mom!\" Michael chimed in. \"No picking her until she's seen it and understands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Philip said, throwing up his hands. \"Fair's fair. But I'm almost out of time... um..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Phillip,\" Josie said sticking her tongue out at him. \"Don't screw it up... tick-tock, tick-tock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on now Josie,\" Cindy Ferguson said, trying to keep things polite amid the group of hormone driven teens. \"Be a gracious loser, have fun out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Philip said, ready with his swap. \"I want to swap chests with Josie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that is so uncool,\" Michael said, miffed that Philip was doing this just to get his hands on Josie's breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert,\" Josie said, folding her arms over her ample bosom. A minute went by, then two, and everyone stared fixedly at Josie's chest... and at Philips, but neither changed.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was interesting I guess,\" Mrs. Parker said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that fucking sucks,\" Philip said in Melody's squeaky teenage voice. His eyes went wide in shock as he heard the sound coming from his own mouth. \"What the fuck? Shit, I missed the time limit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Michael said, laughing deeply. \"Dude, that is freaking hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Parker tried hard to stop from laughing but failed completely. \"Philip... normally I don't abide much swearing in the house... but... in that voice... you can say whatever you want. Oh this is going to be really fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Philip,\" Anna said, losing the last of her anger at seeing someone get a worse end of the stick than she had. \"Say it again, say how much this fucking sucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shove off,\" he said, pushing the cards towards Melody. \"Here you go short stuff,\" he said in her voice. \"It's your deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay,\" she said with a bit of a giggle that sounded really strange in Philips voice. \"I love it when I get be dealer, then even when it's not my turn I have something to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a good two minutes, Melody just shuffled the cards. It was nice that people were really starting to treat her like she was the older brother and she didn't want the night to end. This was too much fun! </span></div></div>",

I mean, you can do everything with this game, right?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, mom.\u201d, said Michael. \u201cYou can swap everything you can think of. Doesn\u2019t matter if it is physical or abstract.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled. \u201cThanks, hun.\u201d. She then looked at everyone on the table. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve thought about it. How about we all swap lives with each other?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want what?!\u201d, asked Anna astonished. \u201cSwapping lives with each other?!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy nodded. \u201cYes, Anna. Just think about it. It might help you all to understand other people. I think this will be a great experience, especially for you Anna.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think this is a great idea.\u201d, smiled Josie. She had something like that in mind before but was too afraid to suggest it to everyone. \u201cI mean this could be fun. You don\u2019t get the opportunity to live someone else\u2019s life. Nobody will notice anyway.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure this is a good idea\u2026\u201d, said Michael but he was alone with this thought. Well, nearly alone but Anna had no voice on this subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp had hoped to get some feminine parts, that are not the voice of a little girl, but the thought of getting into a ladies changing room was appealing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody was curious as well about how a different life was. She was still not quite sure why Jeremy had to go instead of her but that did not matter for her at this point. She hoped she could swap with Michael\u2019s mother. Being a grown-up woman with such a handsome husband was very appealing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen that\u2019s decided.\u201d, smiled Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how will we decide who gets which life?\u201d, asked Anna annoyed and hoped they would drop the plan just as quick as it had come up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d, smiled Cindy at her daughter. There was something mischievous about her smile. \u201cWe\u2019re six people, right? So, let me get a dice.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and got a dice, and then she sat down again and continued explaining her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow everyone gets a number.\u201d, she explains. \u201cWe\u2019ll roll and swap with the person whose number we roll. If you roll your own number, roll again. If you roll the number of a person who already is involved in a swap, roll again. When you have rolled, we\u2019ll play a hand, everybody except the person who rolled will fold and then swap lives with the person he/she won.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, number are like this:<br>\r\n1-\tMichael<br>\r\n2-\tJosie<br>\r\n3-\tAnna<br>\r\n4-\tPhilipp<br>\r\n5-\tMelody<br>\r\n6-\tCindy<br>\r\n\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy shoved the dice over to Michael. \u201cSince this is your birthday, you can roll first.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael hesitated but grabbed the dice and rolled.</span></div></div>",

How could she? Philipp was always nice to parents, teachers or other persons he would not hang out with. Only the people that are around him long enough get to see how he really is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp smiled at Cindy. \u201cYes, indeed.\u201d. He tried to act as professional as he could. Inside he was jumping joyfully. He only thought of what he could do with the life he was going to get not even thinking about the fact that he would be married to a man or mother of two children. He was too busy thinking of all the boobs he could see when he goes into a ladies locker room. \u201cI\u2019m certainly going to do some sports tomorrow.\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Cindy looked over to her daughter and her son\u2019s best friend. \u201cAnna, Melody. Since you two are the only ones available, you\u2019ll swap.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed. \u201cGreat\u2026\u201d. Melody was more enthusiastic. She was going to become an older girl. \u201cWay better than my life.\u201d, she thought smilingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group then began playing and everyone folded so that Cindy could win. \u201cOkay.\u201d, she smiled. \u201cI want to swap lives with Philipp.\u201d. Like the last time nothing happened but they knew it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Anna\u2019s turn to swap something. She thought at first that she should simply swap something else but decided against it. She was happy with her life. There was nothing she wanted. \u201cI want to swap lives with Melody.\u201d, she said unhappy and again nothing seemed to had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d. Cindy looked at the others. \u201cWe could stop now and see how the other person\u2019s life is. Or we could swap clothes. Maybe hair. To make it more interesting. No swapping of genitals or something like that. I think that would be too much\u2026 for now. But clothes should be fine.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp was the first one to say something. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea Mrs. Ferguson.\u201d, he said and thought about her bra and panties he could wear. He would rather have her breasts but that was something he could live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody was taken with the idea. \u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d, she said and looked at Anna\u2019s clothes. She dressed provocatively but what 13 years old girl would not be agitated to wear clothes a two years older girl was wearing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked at Melody\u2019s clothes and was against this idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Let\u2019s stay like this, okay?\u201d, she said and hoped that Josie and Michael had the same opinion on the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was also against that idea. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be wearing my girlfriend\u2019s panties.\u201d, he told his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all the eyes went over to Josie. Since Cindy suggested it and it would make it hard to decide if there was a 3 pro \u2013 3 con vote, she decided that she did not have a voice on that matter. So the decision was Josie\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie gulped and thought about it before telling everyone: \u201cI think we\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

He did, it was always hard for him to be mad at her when she looked like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood then.\u201d, smiled Cindy and grabbed the cards again. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be swapping clothes with the person we have swapped with.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was the first who was supposed to swap.

Another swap and he also had her bra and panties which made him even more happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy on the other hand found herself dressed in a blue hoodie and baggy jeans. On her feet some black shoes. The underwear was uncomfortable but that was something she knew beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly Melody and Anna swapped. Melody was now dressed in Anna\u2019s skimpy, pink tank top, matching miniskirt and matching pumps. The underwear she now wore felt sexier and she caught a glimpse of a black bra when she looked at her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was not so happy with the clothes she now wore. A pink pullover, jeans and pink mary janes were now her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow the last question. Should we swap hair?

Michael now had Josie\u2019s long, red hair. Josie had Michael\u2019s short, blond hair. Melody had Anna\u2019s long, blond hair while Anna had Melody\u2019s long, brown hair which was in a pigtail.

He wanted to try out girl's equipment especially Josie's breat but he got the life, clothes and hair of the mother of one of his friends. \"At least\", he thought, \"I can dress myself in women's clothing. Not that I'm into crossdressing but this is kind of exciting. Also I can sneak into a women's locker room without problem. I wonder if Mrs. Ferguson...  No, ME! I wonder if I'm signed in at at gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this thoughts, Philipp had stripped put of the clothes he had gained and put on a tight cocktail dress with matching heels. \"This would look so good on Mrs. F. I have to find a way to swap lives with Michael's dad when we swapped back. Preferably without anyone finding out... Michael's life wouldn't be so bad either. Hot girlfriend\", he thought while trying to get used to walking in these heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cindy and the others continued watching the movie and laughed at most of the unbelievable parts. Neither of them, especially Cindy not, thought about what Philipp might be doing upstairs. They were just too engrossed in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis scenes was disturbed when the front door opened and Cindy's \"ex-husband\" entered. He went to the living room where the friends were sitting. Cindy almost wanted to get over to him and plant a big kiss on his lips but then she remembered that for the next 48 hours he was not her husband anymore. He was one of her friends father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought Jeremy home. I guess my wife is upstairs then\", he said and looked at the round. \"Don't worry, we won't bother you for the rest of the evening. Just don't let it get too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, dad!\", replied Josie when her \"dad\" went upstairs. Michael then looked over to his mom. \"Well now you can be absolutely sure that the life swap worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy nodded but looked kind of guilty. \"Yeah... But poor Philipp won't be too happy about it. I know that look and this stand. He wants to have sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much information, mom!\", replied Michael grossed out. He may be 17 but the idea of his parents having sex still creeped him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically I'm not your mother anymore. We're not even related in any way. And he is not your dad anymore\", explained Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I still don't like the idea of my parents still being sexual active... Although... Oh, just think about poor Philipp up there. Dad will want to have his way with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael!\", yelled Cindy. \"Don't be so mean! He's your friend after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he really deserved this in some way\", replied Josie. \"Let's just not talk and think about this anymore, okay? We wanted to have fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the \"kids\" downstairs continued watching their movie, Philipp was surprised when a man, who he now had to call his husband, entered the room. Philipp had just found a skimpy maid outfit, which was probably used by the two for sex games, and he just finished putting it on. Philipp had to admit that he liked the feel of the nylon stockings against his now shaven legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you're just in the same mood as me\", grinned William at who he thought was his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp immediately knew where this was leading to but he could not do anything against it, could he? There was no logical explanation for him dressing in this skimpy outfit except for wanting to seduce his husband. He could not tell him he was one of his son's friends who just happened to swap lives with his friend's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!\", thought Philipp. \"I now regret the swap. This was kind of a dumb idea. I now don't have any other chance than playing along. Even if this means that I have to sleeps with Michael's father! For the boobs in the women's locker room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp slowly moved over to William. He tried to walk as seductively as he could, which was easier said than done, considering that he had a hell of a time walking properly in the 3-inch heels that went with the outfit. Philipp tried to mimic the seductive look of all the women he had seen in porn. When he arrived by William he put his right hand on the man's chest. Philipp's fingernails were still as short as they were before they swapped but since the clothes swap they werw painted red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. I'm so horney and I thought that this outfit might make you just as horney\", explained Philipp and tried to sound as seductively as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I am\", replied William and unbuckled his belt. He then lifted Philipp up with ease which surprised him. He weigthed definetely more than Cindy, so William was either very strong or Philipp had inherited Cindy's weigth, even though his figure stayed the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp then landed on the bed but with his face down and his ass was facing right at William's throbbing erection. Before Philipp really understood what happened, his pantied were down and William's penis entered Philipp's butt hole. He never thought that he would lose his butt-virginity. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following morning was not as good as Philipp had imagined it to be. After he had sex with Michael's father mas night, something he never thought possible, he fell asleep as soon as possible so he had not to think about it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dawn came too soon. The alarm on Philipp's side of the bed rang at 7. He groggily got out of the bed. \"Why is it ringing so soon?\", he asked himself and then remembered that it was friday, Michael and Anna had to go to school. \"Stupid Michael! Why did he have to celebrate his birthday on a thursday?!\", he mumbled groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went downstairs, the lilac nightgown he had slipped on after he did that which he did not want to talk about, was too chilly for this morning. He should have gotten the robe that he saw in \"his\" room. But he did not want to go upstairs again. So he decided to take this like a man, as ridiculous as it might sound consindering his current outfit and haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began preparing breakfast. Well, he at least tried. \"We should have swapped skills...\", thought Philipp. Fortunately he still remembered how to make pancakes. His mother showed him once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael, dressed in the same clothes as Josie had worn yesterday, and Josie, who was dressed in a red t-shirt and jeans, were the first to come down. Michael's long, red hair was in good shape and it seemed as if Josie had helped him to get ready. Philipp's own long hair on the other hand was completely unsightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised\",  whisteled Michael. \"Hadn't thought you would get up so soon to make us breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I DID!\", replied Philipp annpyed and brushed a strand of his messy, long hair out of the face. \"By the way, who did allow you to sleep over here, 'Josie'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you know. It was Michael's birthday and you two were sleeping so soon. But 'Philipp' said it would be okay. Oh and by the way, we haven't swapped names. So try to not call me like my boyfriend\", explained Michael and sat down on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Philipp turned around and put the pancakes he had already finished on the table. Soon Melody, who was living Anna's life, as well as Philipp's \"husband\" came downstairs. William greeted Philipp by kissing him on the cheek what unfortunately reminded him of last night. He immediately lost his appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the breakfast was not that spectacular and the four non-cookers left the house as soon as they were finished with the meal. Which left Philipp alone. Finally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can have some fun! First I have to find a gym nearby!\", he thought with glee. His excitement vanished when he saw a letter that Michael had left behind. It was a to do list from the real Mrs. Ferguson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's way too much to do! Did she purposely do nothing so I have to do everything?!\", he thought and then decided to...</span></div></div>",

I'm not her maid! She can do all these things when she gets back to her own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischievous grin then appeared on Philipp's face. He quickly went upstairs and got out of the nightgown he was wearing. He looked into the mirror and saw himself standing there in just panties but with big, feminine nipples. He had been surprised when he found out that the life swap gave them to him. He was also more surprised how good they felt when William sucked on them last night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to think about it!\", he told himself and went over to the waderobe. He decided that he might as well change underwear. He got out of the ones he was wearing and put on black, lacy ones and a matching bra. He then decided to put on a black, short skirt. Unfortunately the shortest skirt Mrs. Ferguson had was a knee-lengthed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will do as well\", thought Philipp and stepped into the one he just chose. He then got out a pink blouse. He did not know why it had to be pink, he just thought that it would be right. Lastly he decided for some low heel pumps. As much as he loved high heels, he just was not ready to wear some when going out. He had trouble in walking them yesterday, so he would have trouble today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last things he fetched from the waderobe were sports clothing of the woman whos life he currently inherited as well as a sports bag. He put it all inside and then walked out of the house. Just before leaving he remembered that he probably should take the purse he saw on a counter in the master bed room with him. When he had it he was finally able to leave and went straight for the next gym. It was not that far away but he had completely forgotten that he could have taken the car he now owned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Phillip had stepped out the front door he heard a voice call out, \"I see somebody's just as eager to start our run as I am.\"  Philipp turned around and had to pick his jaw up off the ground.  Standing before him was the hot blonde friend of Cindy's with one of the biggest racks he'd ever seen in person.  It took a second to register it, but he figured this must be Tiffany.  Michael had told him about her once and had told him she was this hot trophy wife chick who was somehow friends with his mom but Philipp just thought she may have been hot for a older lady, but this chick was a 10/10 knockout, especially with the way she was dressed in the short shorts and extra tight top that showed off her ample cleavage.  \"So are you just going to stand there and look like a fool or are we gonna run?\"  Tiffany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp had his mind set on the gym and the shower there but the chance to run next to that set of knockers instantly changed his mind.  As quick as he could Philipp went back in and changed into Cindy's modest sweats and went out to meet Tiffany.  \"So how does 5 miles sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say pal.\"  Philipp said, Tiffany gave who she thought was her friend a weird look at her odd turn of phrase but shrugged it off and began to run.  Within minutes Philipp was regretting agreeing to 5 miles.  He hadn't run this much since track in middle school, and even then he'd never hit the 5 mile mark.  But the sight of Tiffany's massive chest going up and down and her perfect ass going side to side motivated him enough so that he was at least able to finish the run without passing out.  Finally the two ended up in 'Philipp's' kitchen taking a much needed water break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good run Cindy.  Good run.  You were a bit slower than normal if you don't mind me saying.  I'd say we should do even more tomorrow.  But after tonight I doubt you'll be up for running.\"  Tiffany said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...do you...mean.\"  Philipp said still gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you forgot?  We're having our girl's night poker game over at Amanda's tonight silly.  Her husband's out of town and she's promised she'll open up a few bottles of wine for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poker game?  With girl's?\"  Philipp suddenly was no longer exhausted as he felt an adrenaline rush at the thought of playing with the magic cards with a group of adult woman, hopefully with at least a few of them as hot as Tiffany.  <i>I'll be able to swap whatever I want without getting judged or scorned by those goodie goods.</i>  \"Oh right, that game.  I can't wait.  I'll see you their, and I bet I can come up with a few fun bets for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the sound of that.  See you later at 5, I'll pick you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great,\"  Philipp said showing Tiffany out.  As soon as she was gone Philipp rushed to Michael's room to try and find the magic cards.</span></div></div>",

I looked and I found. Now I just have to endure this day and I can swap some parts of this Tiffany woman. I can't wait to own her big boobs\", he thought grinning broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... What to do now? I guess I can be a little bit nice and at least prepare some dinner or anything\", he mumbled and did so, after watching some TV. It was still early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie and Melody eventually came home. Philipp just started preparing dinner. Philipp looked over to Josie. \"Where's you're girlfriend? I thought you were inseperetable\", he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funn\", she replied. \"You know very well that I normally babysit my little brother at this time. So Michael has to do it today. And I couldn't leave Melody alone with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hurts, Josie! How can it be that you don't trust me? I mean, I'm very trustworthy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiight\", she said and rolled with her eyes. \"I'd say you're as trustworthy as the earth is flat. Anyways, I'm going upstairs and do my homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp nodded but knew that this was not the truth. She wanted to check if the cards are still there. Nothing Philipp needed to worry about. They looked like any other card deck so he just bought a used one and put it in the box were the real ones were stored. Just in case she or Michael would look into the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody followed Josie quietly. Josie stopped just before she exited the kitchen. \"Oh, right! I almost forgot. The real Cindy said that I should tell you that she and her friends have a poker night and that you should try to lay it low. Just try to not embarrass her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\", replied Philipp. \"As if I could embarrass her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie simply shrugged the shoulders and followed Melody who already went upstairs. Philipp was now alone again in the kitchen. \"Don't worry\", he mumbled. \"Trust me they won't even notice that I'm not really Cindy.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Tiffany would arrive Philipp decided he should try on some more of Cindy's clothes since after tonight it might be the last time he'd see it.  Making sure to lock the door so his 'husband' wouldn't barge in mid change, he tried on multiple pairs of underwear and a couple of dresses and skirts before seeing that it was nearly 5 and decided on some black set of underwear, a white blouse, and a blue knee length skirt.  Phillip took a look at himself in the mirror and laughed at how ridiculous he looked.  He may have gotten Cindy's life but that was just about it.  He was still himself outside of the clothes and Cindy's long blonde hair, he also still had Melody's voice but he tried not to dwell on that.  And as much as he liked himself this image wasn't turning him on.  He actually wanted a pair of breasts to play with and do with as he wished.  That was his number one goal for the night.  And hell maybe he could get something more although he wasn't sure off the top of his head what else he'd want, but he figured something would come to him in the moment.  Finally 5:00 came and Tiffany honked signaling Philipp it was time for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he got in Tiffany's car, after taking a good long look at her chest, Philipp asked, \"So who all is playing tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The usual, me, you, Miranda, Amanda, and even Heather.  Although of course she won't be drinking with us with the baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Baby?  What the hell?  Am I just playing with a bunch of housewives?  Oh well, hopefully there is at least a MILF in the bunch to look at besides Tiff here.</i>  Philipp though as the car pulled up to what Philipp gathered was Amanda's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my place ladies!  Heather and Miranda are already at the table ready to go.\"  Amanda said.  Philipp got a good look at Amanda and liked what he saw.  Amanda was a 5'10\" mother of two with a body that showed that but still looked great.  She had a huge set of DD breasts and an ass that matched but she was by no means fat or anything, in fact she seemed to be in pretty good shape.  Philipp figured if she didn't have kids to hold her back she'd be a 9 or 10 but instead Philipp figured she settled at about a 7 or 8 in his book.  Philipp and Tiffany entered the house and went to the table where the two other players were waiting.  Philipp deduced the very petite girl with a little bit of a belly to her had to be the pregnant Heather.  Heather couldn't have been taller than 5 feet tall, but the high made a huge difference, she barely had a pregnant belly to her and her breasts seemed to be a nice B cup, but on her small frame her features all seemed much bigger than they really were.  <i>Might have to keep that in mind.</i>  Philipp thought observing the attractive petite girl.  And finally there was Miranda.  She seemed to be the oldest of the group.  She seemed to look about 40 although her hair was already mostly grey and her large breasts were sagging a bit, although they were sagging in what looked to be very very expensive clothes.  And although she was older she seemed to be very built, as if she did hard work or went to the gym every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we ready for the game?  I assume we're betting the usual friendly $20?\"  Heather said as she poured herself a glass of water as Amanda poured everyone else some wine which Philipp practically raced towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Cindy was telling me she had an idea for the game tonight although she didn't go into detail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter downing his glass Philipp took a deep breath and thought, <i>Well, last chance to back out, things could go really wrong if I go through with this.</i>  Philipp thought with his eyes lingering on Miranda's grey hair and Heather's pregnant belly.</span></div></div>",

You get me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the ladies were giving Philipp and each other odd looks, \"Did you spike the wine with anything Amanda?\"  Tiffany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I know it sounds weird, but just roll with me on this.  In fact it would probably be easier if you just all fold so I can show you.\"  Philipp said not able to hold back a smile thinking he had the girls where he wanted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\"  Heather says pushing in the cards without even looking at them.  Tiffany and Amanda followed her lead.  Miranda however wouldn't give Philipp the win so easily.  \"All right, I get it.  It'll be like truth or dare or something like that.  All right I'm in, I can't believe you girls are letting Cindy get away with playing you like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Philipp was a little nervous.  Outside of aiming at getting Tiffany's breasts he hadn't really thought out this entire evening, and if Miranda won who knows what she'd do.

If you do I promise I'll let you off easy.\"  Miranda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit, if I lose this hand that means she'll definitely be targeting me.</i>  Philipp thought but put on a fake since of confidence and said oh so cleverly, \"You first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda simply laughed at the younger player and revealed her cards.</span></div></div>",

I'm wearing your shoes Cindy!?  What?  How did you?!\"  Miranda lifted her leg up to show the table this stunning revelation that she was now wearing the pair of black flats Philipp had been wearing and sure enough Philipp looked down and saw that he was now wearing Miranda's 2 inch high black heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time it clicked for all of girls at the table.  \"Wait, you weren't messing around when you were talking about magic.\"  Tiffany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if it could do that, what else could it do?

This totally worked!\", exclaimed Tiffany. \"I had seen your shoe swap but I still could not believe that it would work with this as well! Amazing! It's so nice to not have these things hang from my chest. My back will thank me this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...\", mumbled Heather. She carefully stroke her belly and thought that if she would win, she could swap it with Cindy so that she had some pregnant free days. \"And can we swap back the things we have swapped?\", she asked Philipp. She wanted a break from being pregnant, not losing her baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After 48 hours\", explained Philipp. \"Before the time is up we can only swap traits with someone who did not have the trait in the last 48 hours.

No side effects or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp shrugged his shoulders which caused his breats to bounce up and down. \"Not that I know of. I haven't used the cards before\", he lied. \"I just figured they would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk!\", said Miranda. \"We're here to play some poker and to punish Cindy for talking us into folding so she can just win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far the plan Philipp had, had worked. He acquired Tiffany's breasts. He just feared that Miranda might win because he seriously did not want anything from her. And he also feared that Heather might win. The questions she had asked indicated that she wanted to swap her pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Philipp, one of the two who should not win, won. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

I mean you've already swapped shoes with me, I don't see why you have to swap something else?\"  Philipp pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  Miranda said opening her eyes a little wider, \"So my shoes on your feet are a punishment are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no I didn't mean it like that!\"  Philipp said backtracking as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure you didn't mean it like that, but that doesn't mean you can get away with saying that without a little bit of punishment.  I would like to swap hair with Cindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said it, the real Cindy's blonde locks that were formerly on Philipp's head fell down upon her, while Philipp gained the curly and prematurly grey hair of Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been meaning to try out a new hair color for a while now.  Well girls, what do you think of me as a blonde?\"  Miranda said with a hint of youthful energy that wasn't there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply wonderful,\" Heather said giving the swap a polite feux smattering of applause.  \"Ravishing.\"  Tiffany added with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile those girls were distracted with Miranda's new hairdo, Amanda leaned over to Philipp and whispered, \"Look, I think I know why you wanted to do this whole swapping thing in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\"  Philipp said afraid that someone may have noticed the way he was bouncing and touching his new chest when nobody was looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, and I promise if I'll win, I'll help you out with your 'little problem'.\"  Amanda said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh well, thanks I guess.

I guess.\"  Philipp said confused but trying not to look a gift horse in the mouth, finally something was about to happen to him that wasn't a punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we all know about Cindy's little 'problem'.  In fact if I had to guess that was probably one of the reasons she brought these magic cards with her tonight.  And as her friends I have no doubt that any of us would be glad to help her out.\"  All of the ladies at the table nodded while Philipp just sat still confused.  Amanda turned to Philipp, \"There's no need to be modest or even ashamed of it.  You've gone through life with no problems.  You been a great person and an even better friend.  You didn't even let it get away with your love life.  Hell you've even managed to give birth to two kids somehow with it, but even if it's only for a few days I will happily take on the burden of penis for my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...wait.  WHAT!?!\"  Philipp said shocked at what he was hearing, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap genitals with my friend Cindy.\"  Amanda said and before he knew what had happened, Philipp's penis, which had been noticeably at an upright and ready position since he'd gotten Tiffany's breasts, was simply gone leaving him with a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really REALLY didn't have to do that!\"  Philipp said trying not to get angry at the lady who was now looking down wide eyed at his, now her junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no it's okay, I really don't mind at all Cindy, in fact...\"  Amanda started to blush, \"I was thinking of having a special night with my husband tonight if you know what I mean.\"  All the girls at the table either blushed or giggled at that remark, but Philipp most certainly wasn't amused as he tried to think of a way to get his penis back.  <i>Maybe if everyone wins and swaps it around, maybe the cards will get confused and let me have my junk back.

Not good at all!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess when you put it that way...and it's only for a few days...alright then.  I want to swap pregnancy's with Cindy.\"  Heather finally said just before the two minutes ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all changes, this one was instant.  Philipp didn't even have to look down to know that a lot of weight had just fallen on him.  Or in him in this case.  Still afraid to open his eyes Philipp just nervously put his hands on his now inflated pregnant stomach.  <i>I've got a flesh beach ball for a stomach, and something's in there.  I think it's moving.</i>  Philipp was just about ready to flip out and scream that this was all just a nightmare when a small soft hand touched his own hand on his belly.  A soft whisper said, \"Mommy will see you very very soon.  I promise.\"  And Philipp could feel a pair of lips touch his belly and those same lips kissed him on the cheek and whispered in his ear, \"Thanks Cindy for this, you're the best friend a girl could have, not everyone would do this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once Philipp felt a little proud and very very overwhelmed.</span></div></div>",

He now had Miranda's greying hair, Amanda's vagina and worst of all: He had obtained Heather's pregnancy, meaning that his belly was now bulged out and he could feel something inside of it. Still, it could not get any worse, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, Ladies. Next hand\", he said with the little girl's voice he had gained last night and had gotten used to over time, while dealing the cards. When he took his hand in one hand, his other hand unconsciously went to his belly which he carefully carressed. Philipp did not even notice that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winner was decided moments later and it was Philipp. At least he has some luck tonight. Well, the high heels he was wearing were not really something he would call luck but they were not that bad either. \"I wonder if I obtained all of her shoe collection\", he thought. \"But first things first. What should I swap? I guess there is no way for me to swap back my penis. But what else should I swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to Tiffany who was the obvious choice for his swap.But what should he get? Decisions, decisions. \"I want to swap legs with Tiffany\", he finally said and just in time. His legs instantaniously changed their form, becoming more shapely and feminine and losing all of their hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\", growled Tiffany. \"Don't you want to swap anything from someone else? I mean, what do you need my legs for anyway? Now that you're pregnant again it's not like you can go running with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just like them, you know?\", Philipp explained shortly. \"Now hurry up, we wanted to play, so don't chicken out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said the last part more to himself rather than to the others...</span></div></div>",

And suggestions?\", she asked the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I doubt you want Cindy's hair, now that she has mine\", said Miranda half to Heather, half to herself so that she can think. \"How about you swap make-up with her? I've never seen her wear some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather nodded. She liked the idea. It would be nice to not have to wear make-up for a change. Also she wanted to know how Cindy would look with it. Her friend refused to wear it all the time, but now she had no choice but to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPregnant Philipp on the other hand was not so happy about the current situation. He was getting female but not in the way he wanted to. He just wanted to get slme boobs to play with, maybe a nice ass. He certainly did not want a vagina, at least not the one of an old woman, Josie's vagina would be something else, and he also die not want to become pregnant! And now he should be forced to wear make-up? Well, what horrible could come out of it? He would wear it now and then never again until he can swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather smiled. \"Okay then. I want to swap make-up with Cindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Heather's face lost some of it's colours while Philipp's gained the ones Heather's lost. He now was wearing lipstick, eyeshadow and mascara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilarious!\", laughed Amanda. \"Cindy with make-up certainly is a sight. Especially since she now is pregnant again.

Cindy Cindy Cindy.  So young and naive.  We agreed that you needed to be punished for misleading us at the start of the night.  Down to the last hand.  And you know what?

But when he looked across the table at Miranda Philipp gave a huge gasp.  He should have seen it coming, but where once was an older, not really attractive lady, was now sitting a smoking hot 16 year old blonde bombshell.  If he were in any position to he'd be immediately trying to get into her panties, when a thought crossed his mind that scared him.  <i>Wait a second, she just turned into a teenager.  Surely the girls realize this and have gotta be wondering why a swap between to old ladies turned one into a teenager.

All this helpfulness just reminded him of the situation he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily neither Josie nor Jeremy who had been in house all night yesterday, had noticed that Philipp had exchanged the cards. His only problem was: How could he stop them from wanting to play tonight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp sat alone on the kitchen table, thinking of a possible solution to this whole fiasco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I let them play, then I might not get my age back or become unpregnant... On the other hand, if I decide not to play they might get suspicious and then I might be stuck as Cindy forever... Something I don't really want to... There is no way that I can win...\", he thought and could pull out his long, grey hair out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is just no way how this could end well! I had thought of swapping breasts, then I could have had some for the rest of my life which would be kinda cool... But now I ended like this!\", he continued. \"I guess I'll do the laundry like Cindy said I had to... There is just nothing else I can do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp got up and walked through the house, gathering all dirty laundry. It seemed that no one brought his clothes to the laundry room. When he put the dirty laundry in the washing machine, he began vacuuming the rooms and cleaning the windows. Especially the last task was not easy due to his new condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile doing his tedious tasks, Philipp continuingly tried to find a way to get out of his misery. \"There has to be a way! There has to! Wait... If I just let the fake cards where they are... They probably won't notice a difference, right? Then we'd play and nothing would happen... Then I could persuade them to play next week, when I'm back to mostly normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp smiled and continued rubbing the window he was currently cleaning. \"Good plan!\", he thought. \"But wait! What if I can't persuade them... Maybe then we will never play again and I'd be stuck in this life and with this little girl's voice! This would be kinda risky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and tried to think of an alternative. He had almost finished all of the windows when he did find one. \"What if I just let the fake ones vanish. If I do this correctly they will believe me that I did not got them. Then we can't play until next week where we will find them again. The only problem would be to make them believe I really did not have the cards... Those are the only two alternatives I have and time is running out... What to do?\"</span></div></div>",

It still felt incredibly good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\", he moaned. \"I think jerking off with a penis and boobs would be better but this is not so bad either. I just wished I did not have Melody's voice. I feel like a paedophile when I moan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not held him back. He continued until he climax, which caused him to moan loud. \"This was good!\", he mumbled. \"And I believe I could go again... This really is not so bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him was this the moment when the door opened and Josie, Melody and Michael entered the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I love you Josie, I can't survive another day with your pest of a little brother. I'm really glad when I can swap back to my own life\", told Michael Josie when they entered the living room where they found Philipp who had repositioned his clothes to look like he did not jerk off moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, kids\", smiled Philipp although he could not stop grinning slightly perverted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross! Did you really have to do it here?\", asked Josie immediately. She had no problem to look through Philipp's bad poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pregnant boy held up his hands excusingly. \"It's not my fault that I got horny so often. It's the pregnancy's fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiight\", rolled Cindy with her eyes. \"Anyways, the real Cindy and Anna will come shortly after. As well as Jeremy who wants to be freed of being his little sister, as far as Anna told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he can stay in this role a bit longer. Maybe then he'll be nicer to me\", giggled Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\", smiled Philipp and tried to look as normal as possible. \"Then we can all play and get back to our normal lives.\" He added a \"Not!\" in thoughts.</span></div></div>",

He knew that no matter who wins, there was nothing that would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was the first winner of this evening. \"Okay, let's swap back, shall we, Philipp?\", she smiled.

I dunno... Tastes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May be...\", mumbled Cindy. \"Let's play another round. We swap immediately. No talking, no thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", agreed everyone. They played another round, Michael came out in top this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to lose! I want to swap clothes with Josie!\", he exclaimed, but of course, nothing happened. Michael was still dressed in the pink T-shirt and jeans he put on this morning. \"I want to swap clothes with Josie! I want to swap clothes with Josie! I WANT TO SWAP CLOTHES WITH JOSIE!\", he repeated over and over again but with no success. He was still dressed as Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cards don't work?\", asked Jeremy who feared that he was now stuck as his little sister for ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this can't be... Maybe the time is not over and we can't swap back and again tastes were swapped\", thought Anna out loud. She was not happy either to be stuck in Jeremy's life and having to wear Melody's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play another hand and swap something new. Then we know for sure\", said Philipp and tried to look and sound as worried as the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hand was played, just like Philipp suggested. The winner of the third hand this evening was Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, something new... I want to swap hair colour with Anna\", she said and everyone looked with big eyes at the two of them. Nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap eye colour with Anna!\", Josie said and hoped that this would work. Again, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be!\", exclaimed Michael. \"The cards! The cards are not working! We're stuck like this... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, kids...\", mumbled Cindy. \"If I hadn't have this great idea, we would not be in this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, mom. We would have played either way and then we would be stuck in another way\", replied Michael. \"I guess we have to make the best of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't be stuck as Melody! I don't want to be a 13 year old girl!\", said Jeremy and luckily for him, Cindy did not listen to him, otherwise she would now question him because to her, he always was a 13 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... We can't do anything about it... I... I'm sorry. It's my fault... I found the cards\", said Michael and stood up. \"I... have to be alone.\" He walked out of the room. Josie and Jeremy followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this was it...\", said Philipp, trying to look innocent. \"I'm sorry for kind of stealing your husband, Cindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be. It was my idea. I think I'm going home... I have to think about some things... I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Cindy left as well, which left Anna, Melody and Philipp alone. The two were too shocked to say something and simply left as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was alone, Philipp grinned broadly. \"I love it when a plan comes together. Now I just have to think of a way to bring them all back to play. But I have a week for this. Let's just enjoy this for now.\"</span></div></div>",

Then forced himself into the kitchen where he kept having to cook the toast and eggs until they were not burned.  And then came the family.  First was Melody who came in and just kept asking questions about what it's like being pregnant, Philipp didn't want to think about the subject at all so he just answered in 'Yes's' and 'No's'.  Then came Cindy's husband.  Philipp had been bracing himself for more kissing and holding and stuff but what he got was even worse.  He knelt down and started baby talking Philipps stomach.  <i>This day can not get any worse.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly out of nowhere Philipp heard Josie's very angry voice shouted out, \"MOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!  I need to talk to you in my room.  NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a feeling he knew what what he was getting into, but the conversation had to be had eventually so Philipp waddled his way to Michael's room where Josie was sitting their steaming.  \"Where are the cards Philipp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what you're talking about,\"  Philipp lied nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a load of bull and you know it.  Now I can live with you being a pervert because for some reason you and Michael are friends even though I've always thought of you as the creepy, old, guy from school who got himself knocked up by someone.  But taking the cards is messed up.  I don't know if you are enjoying your little housewife fantasy enough so that you want to leave the rest of us in our spots, but I won't have it.  It's not fair to the rest of us, including the woman who's life you're living.  So just give back the cards so we can play tonight at the 48 hour mark and swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp's first instinct was to just run but knew that he couldn't do that for long, so he just said, \"I had to because I can't play tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just mean I can't, you have to trust me.\"  Philipp said fairly honestly, although he had no desire as to explaining any further as to why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not good enough Philipp, you have to tell me why or else I'll search you and the whole house until I find the cards and force you to play tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't tell the truth, and I can't just run away.

Bye bye!\"  Philipp said practically pushing Josie out of Michael's room and all the way to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll leave for now, but I want answers, real answers when you get back from your 'vacation'.\"  Josie said right before Philipp slammed the door in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, she kinda bought it, now what?</i>  Philipp thought to himself now that he had a moment of peace, at least so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that Michael said about a vacation?\"  Cindy's husband William said seemingly coming out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was nothing.\"  Philipp said trying to cover his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not nothing, he definitely said vacation.  Are you planning something?\"  William said playfully backing Philipp up against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh I was planning on surprising you.  I was planning on going on vacation.\"  Philipp gulped,  \"With you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam looked ecstatic, \"Honey, this is so impulsive of you.  I love it.  And this will probably be the last time the two of us can have some time alone together before baby number three.\"  William said as he wrapped his 'wife' in a loving embrace before kissing Philipp.  Philipp was so resigned by this point that he didn't even try to fight back.  \"I'll arrange everything, I'll book the hotel, I'll pack the luggage, I'll leave a note and money for the kids.  You just sit down and relax my pregnant princess.\"  William said as he lead Philipp to the couch.  Philipp gave William a weird look, \"Sorry, I won't call you that anymore honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp just sat back on the couch and just tried to let it sink all in, but he felt as if he couldn't quite grasp what he'd gotten himself into.  So he took a nap.  He was awoken about an hour later by William who had two suitcases in hand.  \"Come on Cindy.  Let's get out of here.\"  As he helped Philipp stand up, which was now much much more difficult than before due to the breasts, pregnancy, and aging, Philipp asked William, \"So, how long are we going away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a week's worth of vacation days stacked up for just such a time.  We're going to go all out this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"  Philipp said in a half-assed manner.</span></div></div>",

Or was this just his imagination? Either way, his bladder felt like it was bursting any minute and he die not like it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here, sweetheart\", smiled William when he parked the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a minute too soon!\", mumbled Philipp and tried to get as fast as possible out of the car seat which unfortunately resulted in him shaking way too much and therefore increasing the pressure on his bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is horrible! I think I'm gonna die!\", thought Philipp as he waddled across the parking lot and hoped to find a toilett somewhere. He was sure that if he ever gets the chance to drink something, no matter what, again, he would turn it down. This was just pure torture. The thought of releaving himself right here on the spot crossed his mind but that would be in appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam got in front of him while Philipp was still thinking of relieving himself right here. He opened the door for Philipp so he could get in fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", mumbled Philipp as he entered the resort. Moments later he saw the object of his interest: A bathroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead\", smiled William. \"I'm gonna check in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp nodded and woddled as fast as he could to the door where he would finally get his relief!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the bathroom which was luckily empty and sat down on the toilet. Waves of pleasure washed over him. \"This feels good...\", he thought happily as the urin ran down into the toilett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished, he could finally think straight again. \"This was a horrible experience! Not something woman-exclusive but still! HORRIBLE! I just hope that the way back won't be like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp then finally left the stall and went to the mirror to wash his hands and see his wrinkly, old skin. \"A look I'm still not used to...\", he sighed in his girly voice and left the bathroom. Outside he woddled over to his husband who just finished checking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist, a beautiful, young, blond woman, looked at Philipp and smiled. \"This must be the lucky wife\", she mused as she handed William the keys. \"I hope you'll enjoy the stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We certainly will\", replied William and took the key. \"Right, sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp responded with a nod. It was now that Philipp had noticed that William had brought in most of the luggage when the two entered the resort. Philipp felt s little bit ashamed that William had to carry it inside all by himself. Then again, Philipp was pregnant. He was not allowed to carry heavy, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam then went back to the car to get the rest of the luggage and when he had brought it in the foyer, a page boy got the luggage and brought it upstairs to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", smiled William. \"What do you want to do first? Get rest at the pool or in our hotelroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp gulped. William had a strange look when he said hotelroom. He probably meant that he wanted sex, something Philipp knew the had to have when they arrived here. Still it was kind of too early for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, he did not want to wear a swimsuit or bikini and sunbath. Was there a third solution for this problem? Well, not one he could think of right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say we go to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGuess I win this round,\u201d Josie replied flashing her hand to the other participants, trying to hide a brief grimace behind a triumphant smile as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe worried that someone at the table would begin to notice her growing discomfort and would, out of concern, question her as to what was wrong. The truth however, was that nothing was actually wrong. She had won after all and was having a great time as far as she could tell, which under normal circumstances would be cause for much joy and little apprehension. No what was bothering her, filling the pit of stomach with dread was the fact that Mrs Ferguson had only recently joined the group and that circumstances were far from the norm. Honestly she enjoyed the company of Mrs Ferguson and would often converse with the woman whilst waiting for whatever engagements said woman\u2019s son was occupied with to be completed. This usually being the case with the boy having a knack for last minute wardrobe changes before a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say she had become quite fond of Cindy and over the years had become quite familiar with the the Ferguson matriarch whose son she was dating. It was because of this that Josie valued the woman\u2019s opinions and did not want her boyfriend\u2019s mother to think less of her. Suffice to say a game whose premise made it ,oftentimes, easy for one to make their innermost taboo desires common knowledge was not a safe place to be. A fact that Phillip had time and time again proven. She would have to pick her swap carefully as to not upset anyone especially Mrs Ferguson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table, Cindy who had become quite adept at gauging the emotions of others, a trait cultivated over her many years as an adult and mother. Was beginning to take pity on the round\u2019s victor. She had gotten to know her son\u2019s girlfriend pretty well over the years and had oftentimes seen her as a second daughter. As such, whilst it hurt to see Josie in a state of uncertainty, she was proud of the girl\u2019s consideration for others and especially as she had begun to realise, for her. Perhaps she would have to reward Josie by letting her stay the night with Michael or, as it dawned on her, reward the girl now using this game. With these thoughts in mind, a smile etched its way onto the mother\u2019s face as she began to put her plan into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosie, I don\u2019t want to rush you dear, but I\u2019m a bit concern about the time limit this game has and I don\u2019t want you to end up like Phillip over here,\u201d said Cindy as she gestured to the pervert sitting beside her. \u201cI remember you saying that you were envious of the way I filled out a dress, now whilst I know you will no doubt grow in these departments,\u201d she continued, gesturing to her chest and waist as she did so. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fun to get a taste for it right now,\u201d she finished with a wink towards the uncertain girl who breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, are you crazy!\u201d Said the two Ferguson children each with contrasting expressions. Michael\u2019s face twisting in horror at his mother\u2019s idea, whilst Anna gripped the seat of her chair in silent fury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now children, I was merely spitballing ideas, the decision is entirely up to Josie,\u201d their mother replied whilst looking over at the girl in question to await her answer. The look of relief mixed with excitement coming from Josie was all Cindy needed to confirm her suspicions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful idea Mrs Ferguson,\u201d said Josie casting an apologetic glance to her boyfriend, who had been about to protest but stopped when he saw the excitement on his girlfriend\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d exclaimed Cindy, who upon hearing Josie\u2019s verbal confirmation couldn\u2019t help but feel excited about the swap too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, here goes,\u201d said Josie with a gulp of anticipation. \u201cI want to swap measurements with Cindy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the words both parties experienced a tingle across their bodies, concentrated in three main regions, the hips, waist and chest. Cindy looked down at herself in amazement as she watched her breast melt away revealing her previously obscured waist and hips which had both begun to shrink. She marvelled as her waist pulled into itself giving her an hourglass shape, this figure was short lived however as her once child bearing hips began to compress to more teenage proportions hiding any indication that she had birthed two children. She also felt herself lower in her seat as once plump rear was replaced with Josie\u2019s smaller cushion. The final adjustments came in the resizing of her clothes which now appeared to tighten to best fit her body as if she had always been this size. Overall Cindy felt a lot lighter and whilst her son\u2019s girlfriend was quite endowed in the chest area, the size change from her previous bosom to Josie\u2019s more manageable one was liberating to say the least. She was a bit disappointed however to notice that whilst she now had the figure of a teenage girl she still had the sag and looseness of mature woman who had birthed two children. This however, she realised, could be remedied later in the game. Perhaps she could use it as a form of punishment for one of her children who had protested against her swap idea with Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Cindy continued to think of the possibilities she had with the game, a satisfied Josie was investigating her own changes. Gone was the girly figure she once had to be replaced by a more full womanly figure that screamed sexual maturity. She loved the way her once straight skirt now curved tightly against her widened hips and larger rear. Looking further up she noticed that her once wasp thin waist had, sadly, expanded to a size more befitting a housewife who no longer had to engage in the physical education sessions imposed by schools or varsity volleyball but still showed signs of care like a good diet. This negative aspect however, was offset by the larger mammaries she had acquired which now created a deep valley of cleavage that strained against her enlarged bra and tight blouse. It was heavier for sure but as she gave her new rear and breast a pinch and prod she was delighted to find that everything still had the same tightness and perkiness they always had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her excitement she found herself reaching under the table to find her boyfriend\u2019s hand before guiding it back to her new ass so that he could judge for himself the success and benefits of the swap. Initially Michael resisted, but after feeling the increase in circumference of Josie\u2019s rear. He couldn\u2019t help but find himself looking forward to seeing the other physical aspects of his curvier girlfriend, even if said curves were originally his mom\u2019s.  Whilst this act went unnoticed by everyone, Anna seeing the looks exchanged between Michael and Josie bit her lip in frustration. Despite the little joy she had experienced from Phillip\u2019s voice swap she had wanted the game to further please her by creating strife between Josie and her mom, making things awkward for Michael as a form of revenge for what he and this game had put her through. So far these transgressions had yielded the complete opposite effect. At this rate she realised, she would have to take matters into her own hands if she was to stand any chance of getting what she wanted tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cJosie, a moment if you will dear,\u201d asked Cindy as she removed herself from the table and motioned for the younger girl, whose figure she now possessed, to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to argue, the now curvier girl extracted herself from her boyfriend\u2019s grasp whose hand had been firmly clutching her now inflated rear. Walking over to the Ferguson matriarch, Josie noticed how her now larger breast swayed and tugged against her strained blouse. The short walk also gave Josie a moment to notice how her wider hips dipped to a much larger extent with each stride. Her entire centre of gravity felt completely off too. Did the larger dimensions she now have really effect women of her current size that much? She wondered, as she looked towards her feet only to realise they were now obscured by the increased fatty mass on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the now skinnier Mrs Ferguson, Josie couldn\u2019t help admire the figure she once had. Cindy appeared smaller and less mature with Josie\u2019s developing figure. Whilst her skin still showed the signs of ageing she had accumulated over the forty years, her now reduced mass made it difficult to tell that she had ever had children. She had loss the swell of her breasts caused by pregnancy and the thickened hips caused by childbirth. In fact, looking down at herself, Josie realised that she herself was now the owner of such traits. The thought made her internally giggle. These breasts and hips were technically given to her not by Cindy, their previous owner, but by Anna and Michael. The knowledge that her very own boyfriend had given her this figure made Josie happy and proud. It was at that moment she knew she had to do whatever she could to prevent Cindy from ever reclaiming these dimensions. However upon seeing the look of approval and delight on the older woman\u2019s face, she knew that task wouldn\u2019t be difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, Josie, my figure looks wonderful on you!\u201d Exclaimed Cindy in excitement as she brought her hands to rest on Josie\u2019s larger waist. \u201c I must say, it makes you look so mature and commanding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Mrs Ferguson, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re stuck with my lacking one,\u201d replied a bashful Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense dear, I haven\u2019t felt this light and free in years,\u201d said Cindy, as she noted over the shoulder of Josie the lustful stares of her son to his girlfriend, before leaning in and whispering in the girl\u2019s ear. \u201cI think my son approves, you know if you want we could stay like this for awhile,\u201d she finished with a cheeky grin, pulling back and seeing the look of excitement on the girl\u2019s face and quite yes that escaped from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, noticing how the attention of everyone in the room was focused on the two switched women, the round\u2019s dealer, Anna, set about capitalising on the distraction. Dealing out the cards to everyone in a methodical order, Anna ensured that her hand would be this round\u2019s winning one. Sure enough once everyone had returned to their seats and resumed playing, Anna was found to be this round\u2019s victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, looks like I\u2019m the winner,\u201d grinned a triumphant Anna. \u201cNow, usually to the victor goes the spoils, but since I won with a joker it seems that I won\u2019t be receiving anything this round but two of you will,\u201d Anna continued, not that it bothered her, after all this was what she wanted. \u201cOkay, I want to swap the feelings Cindy and Josie have for Michael!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a paused at the table as everyone tried to process the swap that had just occurred. Then as if a switch had been flipped the room erupted in unanimous roars of disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What! Anna how could you!\u201d Michael screamed as he felt his girlfriend shift away from his hand that had been lingering on her leg in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna, dear, why would you do that?\u201d Said a nervous Cindy as her gaze flitted between her daughter and her son, with the latter now having some kind of magnetic pull on her thoughts. She realised that she wanted to be physically nearer to him. She also experienced a pang of jealousy directed towards Josie, whom she knew held his sexual interest. It was with these revelations that she realised she no longer wanted to be just her son\u2019s mother but also his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna tried to stifle back the laughter threatening to escape her lips as she looked at the trio most effected by the swap. She revelled in the panic registering on Michael\u2019s face as it dawned on him that his girlfriend no longer had an inkling of sexual inclination towards him. In contrast Josie looked uncomfortable being seated next to the boy she saw as a son but knew was sexually attracted to her. Meanwhile a blushing Cindy tried to edge nearer to Michael and attempted to capture the boy\u2019s attention to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it would be good if you got to experience the love Josie has for your son, mom,\u201d replied Anna. \u201cThat way you could see how serious their relationship is and better understand them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d stuttered Cindy as she once again found herself gazing at Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a load of bullshit!\u201d Shouted Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow young man, mind your language,\u201d Cindy quickly dismissed, motherly instincts overriding her current state of lust for her son, before adding with a suggestive grin and flash of cleavage, \u201cWhilst I let Phillip\u2019s language slide on account of his cute voice, I might have to punish you later if you don\u2019t behave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this new side of his mother who now possessed his girlfriend\u2019s figure and knowing full well where it was coming from, Michael decided to bite his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, now since that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s play the next hand,\u201d continued Anna as she handed the cards to Phillip who began to shuffle and deal out the hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winner of the next round was found to be:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The round began with an instantaneous fold from Michael, who barely took the time to register the cards that made his hand. As far as he was concerned he had already lost the game, all because of Anna, his mom was infatuated with him whilst his girlfriend held only the platonic love a mother had for her son. As far as he knew, no swap could fix his problem and so with a dejected sigh he had folded, opting to watch the game play out with the remaining participants. He had notice the looks his mother had started given him, a violent flutter of eyelashes and a good view of a cleavage that had once belonged to his girlfriend as she leant towards him from across the table. Whilst this had bothered him greatly, real pain for the boy was experienced long before when he physically felt Josie recoil under his touch and awkwardly shift away from him in discomfort. Before, the two had been practically melded together below the table in an event initiated by Josie as she commandeered her boyfriend\u2019s hand, guiding it over her newly acquired mature thickness. This gentle guidance had quickly turned sexual with Michael, spurred on by his girlfriend\u2019s new found confidence, had slipped his hand beneath the waistband of his girlfriend\u2019s skirt to better feel her assets. His brazen assets had been well received by Josie, who had shifted in her seat and adjusted her skirt to provide him with better access. Just before the swap the boy had been exploring his girlfriend\u2019s vagina, fingers running along a familiar labia nestled between unfamiliar hips. Needless to say the latest swap had completely killed whatever semblance of intimacy the two had, with Josie immediately wrenching Michael\u2019s hand away from her sex and out of her skirt before pulling her chair further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table Cindy looked at her hand and then at the last participating player that currently stood in her way of winning the round and, more importantly, her son\u2019s heart. Cindy bit her lip, she cherished Josie and prior to the swap thought she was the one for her son. However now she envied the younger girl who had stolen her figure and who had \u2018stolen\u2019 her son. As far as she was concerned that made Josie an enemy. No one could love Michael the same way she could yet, now looking at the object of her lust, couldn\u2019t help but feel silent fury as he continued to focus on that bitch. What was it that she had that the older woman did not? Was it the chirpy voice? The luscious red hair? Or perhaps it was her wardrobe? Whatever the case, Cindy realised she had to have it, if only to win the affections of Michael. With these thoughts motivating her and strengthening her resolve, the woman revealed her hand and was delighted to see she had bested Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears that I won this round dear,\u201d said a triumphant Cindy to Josie as she fought to hold back a smirk of satisfaction at having beaten the girl. \u201cNow what should I swap?\u201d She thought out-loud. Pausing for a moment with the previous thought still lingering she eyed her son\u2019s girlfriend, she could take one of the aspects she had recently considered but realised that being only allowed one meant that she would have to choose carefully, she didn\u2019t know when she might next win. So what was it that Michael found attractive about Josie but not about her? She was conscious of the time and knew she would be required to make a decision soon and then it hit her, with a knowing smile on her face she uttered the words. \u201cI want to physical maturity with Josie!\u201d She cried in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood still in shock and then, like clockwork, witnessed the changes between the two women. They watched as the crows feet that marked the corners of Cindy\u2019s eyes slowly recede as skin tightened and became subtle with teenage youth. These same feet now found themselves a new home on the face of an older looking Josie, whose once shiny hydrated red hair was now dull in comparison with specs of grey from the stress of adulthood. Further down the redhead\u2019s arms had begun to soften as muscle wasted and fat redistributed, she noticed the pronounced veins that had started forming on her now weathered hands and knew that in a few years she would begin developing bingo wings. The biggest change for Josie however, came when she suddenly found herself lurching forward as her large mammaries loss their teenage perkiness and began to sag from fighting forty years worth of gravity. These boobs, now marred by blue spider veins, hung only marginally above a softer tummy whose edges saw the beginnings of cellulite creeping in from a sagging ass and thickened thighs that hid an older less used vagina.In contrast moans of pleasure could be heard from Cindy as she felt her entire form tighten along with waves of renewed energy and vigour that pulsated throughout her body with the youth she had acquired. These sounds emanating from the now younger looking matriarch shifted in pitch as her sexy huskier voice became one of teenage lilt and innocence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes neared their end and pleasure subsided, Cindy cracked her eyes open in horror realising the atrocious act she had committed. The absence of the youthful high she had experienced had long since left her and upon seeing the now aged Josie and horrified Michael, a great sense of shame washed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosie, are you okay?\u201d Michael asked panicked as he looked towards his now much older girlfriend who could only mutter incoherent noises of shock in a now much more mellow voice. \u201cWhat were you thinking mom! How could you do this!\u201d Michael yelled now directing his attention to his teenage  mom who looked the same age as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-,\u201d Cindy choked out, having never seen her son look at her with such disgust before, then with violent sobs flung herself from the table pausing for a moment to look at everyone, before fleeing the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden act of a fleeing Cindy stunned everyone into silence. Both Michael and Anna realised that they had gone too far. It dawned on Michael that none of this had been his mother\u2019s fault, she currently had Josie\u2019s feeling for him and knew that if the shoes were reversed and it had been him, he would have acted the same way. He had been too harsh. Likewise, Anna realised her revenge had gotten out of hand and that she had never wanted to hurt her mom. With a deep breath and a heart ladened with guilt, Anna broke the quiet of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she stuttered before continuing. \u201cI\u2019ll go talk to her and see if we can straighten this mess out,\u201d she finished before making to leave the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wait,\u201d Michael spoke, signalling her to stop. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault too, I\u2019ll talk to her and apologise,\u201d he said waiting for Anna to cease her attempt of leaving before he left the room to find his mother and repair the mess this game had made.</span></div></div>",

Normally, a reassurance like that from Anna would only have set off alarms in everyone's mind.

She was looking at Michael and thinking it would be really funny to trade genders. She wondered how people would treat her if she were 'male.' Though it wouldn't be as cool as it would have been before she traded authority and respect with Anna, she still thought it would be interesting to see if people treated her better if she was male or if that was all a bunch of 'grass is always greener' thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Anna,\" Cindy said, \"What's your idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should swap friends with Michael so you can hang out with all of us more for the next few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Melody chimed in, realizing how that would change things since she had Jeremy's life. \"That would be cool Cindy, you'd become my best friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Anna, that would be cool, but even if I do want to swap friends with Michael,\" Cindy said, not thinking before she spoke. \"I still think my idea is cooler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, mom, I think you might just have done it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't have,\" she said. \"I didn't say 'I want to swap friends with Michael', I said... oh wait... uh oh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Michael said pulling out his phone and looking at his contacts. Jeremy was gone, so was Philip, along with most everyone he knew from school. In their place, he found twice as many contacts for women in their early thirties, some a little older and a few still in their late twenties. They were grouped into social circles... the 'Sisters of Alpha Delta Delta,' his mom's old sorority sisters to the neighborhood ladies club, the socialite women of the block who spent at least two days a week gossiping over tea and cards at one of their houses while their husbands were at work and the kids were at school. It was all there. \"Yeah, it worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Cindy,\" Melody said, throwing an arm around Michael's mom's shoulders. \"I'm going to round up the guys tomorrow night and we'll go out for pizza and a party, you'll have a great time I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys,\" Anna said, picking up the cards to shuffle. \"Two more hands and we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before she'd thought there was nothing worth winning from the other players, but now she was really in it to win. \"What do you think I should swap Ms. Ferguson?\" She asked Anna, eager to win the approval of her boyfriend's sister. After all, if Anna said it was okay, she could spend the night with Michael. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have an idea... but it's kind of naughty,\" Anna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table, Philip's hand crept into his pants, rubbing at his stiffening manhood and hoping no one was noticing. This game was getting really interesting, but the next hand was the last one... he'd wanted Josie's boobs, but maybe if he won the next one he could trade lives with Michael.... then he could get the benefits of living here and having Josie sleep over... with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me,\" Josie said, looking to Anna. Anna leaned in close and whispered in Josie's ear. The longer she whispered, the more Josie blushed, but she also grinned with excitement and nodded a great deal. \"I love it!\" She said at last. \"I want to swap sexual knowledge, experience, and skill with Cindy Ferguson,\" she said, well before the time limit could expire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough!\" Cindy said standing up. \"I don't think I'm playing any more, this is getting to be a little much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sit down Cindy,\" Anna said. \"Play the last hand, then you and I can talk to dad before you go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine,\" Cindy said sitting down to play the last hand. \"But this is the last one.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good evening Dr. Ferguson,\" Josie said when he walked into the living room where they were all sitting, eagerly awaiting his return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Josie,\" he said, taking off his coat. William Ferguson was a tall man, broad shouldered with a face that was starting to show the signs of entering his mid forties. He was nearly ten years older than his wife Cindy, and he'd been finishing the last year of med school when he met her as an incoming freshmen, but she'd absolutely taken his breath away.  The two had fallen head over heels in love with each other and had married within her first year. Michael had followed on not long after that, a fact that had a bit to do with how quickly they'd gotten married. Not that he'd ever minded the rapid courtship and marriage, and he'd made sure that having a child didn't stop Cindy from finishing her degree, even if she never did anything with it, he hadn't wanted to be the reason that she'd had to stop school and regret it for years later. \"And I think you and Michael have been together long enough Josie, that you can call me Bill. Are you getting ready to head out then? I see the others have already left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Dad,\" Anna chimed in. \"I was thinking that, seeing as it's Michael's birthday, it'd be a nice present to let her sleep over tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Bill paused in thought, looking over the young couple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill,\" Cindy said, looking stunned that he seemed to be taking the suggestion seriously. \"You can't really be considering this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush for a second Cindy, let me talk this one through with Anna and our love birds over here. Maybe you should head up stairs and make sure your homework is finished before we need to go to bed, I wouldn't want to see you getting in trouble at school because we kept you up late with family discussions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Bill,\" she started, only to be cut off by Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad's right mom,\" she said, her tone serious even as she fought to contain the giant grin that wanted to escape. \"You got to hang out with your friends tonight during Michael's party but that's no excuse for not finishing your home work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine,\" Cindy said, throwing up her hands and heading upstairs to her room. She was stunned though to find that the window bench and reading nook she'd enjoyed so much had been transformed to a student desk, littered with text books and a few half finished papers. \"Oh my god,\" she said sitting down at the desk. \"I just got sent to my room to do my homework! By my husband!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack down stairs Dr. Ferguson was finishing up his speech on safe sex and STD's. \"Look, I know exactly what you kids are going to be doing tonight, and that's fine. Anna's right, you guys are old enough, and Cindy wasn't that many years older when she had Michael. And Mike, I've really appreciated the way you stepped up around the house when Cindy decided to go back to school,\" he continued, as though it were perfectly natural for a woman in her mid thirties to go back to high school. \"It might not be the traditional way of doing things, but I think you're going to be an excellent stay at home dad when you get to that point. But that point isn't now, no kids until Josie is in college, and I'd prefer if there weren't any till she had a stable job. I don't want you two to become a pair of young parents with no way to make it in the world. So, no glove, no love, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Dr. Ferguson,\" Josie said, amazed at how this was all working out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, I really appreciate you opening my eyes on this one,\" Bill said, giving his daughter a fatherly hug. \"Some times, I miss the little stuff that's going on right underneath my nose. Between you and Michael though, we're in great shape, and I really appreciate that. Tomorrow night, why don't we all sit down for some vacation planning, I know I kind of blew you off when you brought up Hawaii last week, but I think it's worth a second look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's eyes went a little wide at that last one. It hadn't been that long since she and her dad had a huge fight over the family vacation and he'd said Hawaii was too expensive and that they should look at the ski trip to Aspen because it was closer. But now, he respected her opinion... the same way he had respected Cindy's opinion that Aspen would be an easier vacation to plan for last week. This, she thought, was awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I want to take our time and really enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Michael said, a little unsure. \"So does that mean I get to take your clothes off,\" he asked, reaching for the hem of her own top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, not yet,\" she said, running her long manicured nails down his ribs, pressing just hard enough to make him gasp. \"You don't want the night to be over too quickly after all. Now, don't ask any more questions, just kiss me,\" she commanded, drawing his lips to her own and savoring the taste of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking slowly, Josie pealed his shirt off, reveling in the feeling of his firm muscles under her hands. Tonight was hers, even if it was his birthday, she had taken control of the evening in a way she never could have dreamed before. She craved to feel him inside her, craved to give in to her teenage hormones and screw his brains out, but an older and wiser sexual perspective prevented her from doing so. Instead she teased him, torturing him as she pushed him onto his bed and nibbled her way down from his neck to his rock hard abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a wonder that Michael endured the first twenty minutes of her attention as she finally took off her shirt to let him gaze on the pale wonders of her twin mounds, nestled in a satin bra that lifted and emphasized her cleavage. Finally, she began to unbutton his pants and Michael reached for the condom he'd promised his father he'd use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still too soon,\" she said, taking it away from him and pulling his pants and boxers down far enough to gain access to the stiff appendage that was the focus of her attention. Slipping her lips around it she licked at him eagerly, intoxicated by his taste and the feel of such power trembling beneath her. Michael couldn't hope to last long under such a skilled assault and came quickly, his seed eagerly devoured by Josie who licked every drop clean off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I'm... just.. wow...\" Michael said, gasping for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't think we're done,\" she said, taking her bra off at last and letting her twin D-cups swing free, moving to press them against his chest and looking into his eyes from inches away. \"Because round two is going to be so much better....\" she said, taking the condom out of her own pockets at last and smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the master bedroom, Bill stepped up behind his lovely wife where she was studiously working on her homework, getting the last few answers penciled in. \"Hey,\" he whispered into her ear, brushing her long blond hair back from her neck and leaning in to kiss the hollow where neck met shoulder. \"Done with your home work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said closing the math book that had belonged to her son only a few hours ago. It had been a struggle for her to get through all of it, not because she didn't know how, but because it had been so many years since she'd done anything like this. Her major in college had been music and dance, she'd only taken the minimum required math or science classes to graduate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Bill said, drawing her out of her chair and into an embrace. \"Then why don't I do a little something to reward you for working so hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Cindy, the experience was unlike any she'd had in the bedroom for a long time. She'd always been the more aggressive sexual partner, using her limber and tone body to push Bill to his limits and draining every list drop out of him. But now, she felt as nervous and unsure as a school girl, trembling under his every touch and nervously anticipating his next move. She was awkward at first but quickly surrendered to Bill's strong guidance and allowed him to do his best work on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the night, she drifted off to sleep against her husband, exhausted and fulfilled in ways she hadn't been in a very long time. Maybe, she thought as she drifted off, this wouldn't all be a bad thing after all. And who knows, when she got the chance to trade back in a few days, maybe she wouldn't want to. </span></div></div>",

He was up first, even though he didn't have school today, because he needed to make sure everything was ready for everyone else. Stepping into the kitchen he started by preparing lunches for Josie, Cindy and Anna. He'd had lunch often enough with Josie to know she'd be fine with the tuna salad sandwich he was making for everyone else, the trick was Anna's. Anna loved tuna salad, as long as there were no pickles, so he made sure to set up her sandwich before adding pickles for everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunches packed, he turned his attention to the coffee pot, brewing up a vanilla caramel machiato for his Dad and setting it out with a plate of toast, scrambled eggs and a lean ham steak that didn't take too long to pan fry. His timing seemed perfect as his father walked into the kitchen, fresh from the shower to pick up his breakfast and coffee. \"Smells great Mike,\" Bill said, sitting down to kick his feet up with the news paper for a few minutes while he ate. \"I still don't get how you do that leaf thing on the coffee, but I swear it tastes better than when you just do it with a drop of cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Dad,\" he said, turning to work on his batter for pancakes and setting out several glasses of orange juice. \"Can you do me a favor and wake the girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. Your mom was out like a light when I got out of the shower, she may be a bit late to breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her that there are hazelnuts in the pancakes this morning and that if she doesn't get down here soon, I'll just eat her portion myself,\" Michael said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill just chuckled as he set down his coffee and headed up stairs. \"That will get her moving, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp stairs, Cindy was amazed how far the magic of the cards had gone. In her closet, in the space that used to house several of her comfortable outfits to wear while cleaning around the house used to be, she instead had an array of school uniforms. More shocking though, was to realize how many of those uniforms had been custom tailored, skirts a little shorter than dress code allowed for and tops cut just a little bit tighter to show off her impressive bust. \"What the hell,\" she said, reaching for the shortest plaid skirt she could find and the tightest white top, even going so far as to pair it with a black lacy bra and matching panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good honey,\" Bill said from the door. \"Better run that by Anna before you go though, you know how she feels about you wearing shorter skirts than hers to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Cindy said a little stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm with Anna on that one. You know how much I love you in those short little skirts, but if she's not flashing that much leg, I think she's right that it's not fair for you to flaunt the dress code either. But... if she's okay with it, I won't complain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you like the idea of all the strapping young men at school drooling over my legs in a short skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it babe. Mike says breakfast soon by the way, hazelnuts in the pancakes this morning. He said you'd better hurry or he's eating them himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll check with Anna on my way down,\" Cindy said hurrying from the bedroom. If Michael's hazelnut pancakes were anything like the ones she usually made, she certainly didn't want to miss them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Anna, morning was a little bittersweet. She'd loved how things had ended last night, but this morning, as she dressed for school, she was reminded that she still had Jeremy's sturdy and unshaven male legs. She considered shaving them, but to get rid of that much hair would take too much time when she needed to get ready for school. Turning to her closet she found another surprise that went with the legs... her usual collection of daringly short skirts and shorts was gone, replaced by far more pairs of jeans and several longer skirts in the school plaid. \"So, it looks like I'm not one to flash my legs anymore,\" she sighed, pulling out a longer skirt and dark hose to go with it. The hose at least concealed how hairy she was, and even though her legs were well muscled and sturdy, they didn't look too bad once the hose was on. \"I wonder what this did to Jeremy's wardrobe?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door interrupted her musings as her mother appeared, wearing an outfit that stunned Anna. Had Anna herself tried to wear a top that tight, or a skirt that short, she knew that not only would she have been sent to her room to change, but she'd likely have been grounded for the weekend and lost the scandalous outfit. \"Um, Anna... Bill, er, your father said I should check with you if this was okay to wear to school,\" she said, clearly uncomfortable with the fact that she now had to ask her own daughter's permission to go out in public in an outfit she had chosen to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Anna was tempted to do exactly what her mother would have done had she worn such an outfit. In the end though, she had a better idea. \"No, you can't go to school like that mom,\" she said with a heavy sigh. \"If you're going to wear a skirt that short, you need to do it with stockings and a garter belt, not just the basic uniform hose. After all, if the guys can't get a peek at the top of your stocking and maybe a little bit of bare thigh above it from time to time, what's the point. Now, back to your room and change, quickly, we don't want to be late to school,\" she finished with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Anna,\" Cindy said, both relieved that Anna wasn't going to be petty with her and really enjoying her suggestion for changing the outfit. \"You're the best\" she said, giving Anna a hug and heading back to her room to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I can't wear it, at least someone can,\" Anna said, making the last adjustments to her own outfit. \"Besides, maybe she'll let me wear something like that when we all trade back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown stairs, Michael smiled as the rest of the family gathered for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right everyone,\" Dr. Ferguson said, getting the last of his things together. \"I've got a full day booked, so I don't expect to be home till late tonight. Mike, are you going to be out with the ladies tonight, or are your friends coming over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know yet,\" Mike said, remembering that his mom usually spent Friday nights out with her friends at parties that seemed to rotate from house to house each week. \"When do you think you'll be getting home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. We get a lot of people who try to book their surgeries for Friday so they don't have to use as much time off with the weekend to start recovering. Most of my schedule today is in and out stuff, tummy tucks and some breast jobs, but my last surgery of the day is some facial reconstruction, jaw, nose, brow, so that could take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what dad,\" Anna said, piping up. \"How about I just order pizza tonight, we can give Michael a night off from cooking so he can go out with his friends and you can heat some up when you get home. Oh,\" she added, remembering her promise to Michael the night before. \"And if she wants, Josie can come over tonight too. She can spend some time with Mom and I, just have a girls night in until you and Michael get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me,\" he said picking up his keys and heading for the door, stopping to give Cindy a deep kiss, enjoying the look of his wife in her school uniform. \"Take care everyone, I'll see you all tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone,\" Michael said, finishing off his own breakfast and looking at the others, ready to enjoy a day when his mom had to go to school.... and he didn't! \"You've got until I get a pair of pants and a shirt on to be ready to go, then I'll drive everyone to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can drive us in Michael,\" Cindy said, heading for the table by the garage door that held the car keys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you can't mom,\" Anna said. \"Michael will need the car for shopping today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" she said, putting the keys down. \"Well, I guess Michael's driving in today. Kids, this is really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a little weird,\" Josie said smiling. \"But I really kind of like it. And thanks for letting me stay over again Ms. Ferguson,\" she said to Anna. \"I'm really starting to feel like part of the family here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone,\" Michael said, picking up the keys to what used to be his mother's mini-van. \"Time to go to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After dropping the girls off at school, Michael headed for home, planning to spend at least a good half of the day sitting around and doing nothing. After all, what exactly did his mom do all day everyday anyway? It wasn't long after he got home that he found out though when a knock at the door interrupted his laying about on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door he was greeted by the sight of Tiffany Holbrook, the twenty seven year old trophy wife of one of the well off lawyers down the street. Tiffany was the type of girl that caused traffic accidents, from her long sexy legs that she showed off in her short jogging shorts to the surgically enhanced DDs that rode high on her chest in a figure hugging sports bra. Michael's father had done the work on her chest a few years ago and she and his mom had been best friends ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Tiffany,\" Mike said, trying to figure out what she was doing at his door step with a work out bag slung over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleepy head. Come on, get your shorts on and let's get going. I want to get our run finished today before it gets too hot out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Michael said, waving Tiffany to come in and have a seat while he changed. A few minutes later he was back down stairs in a pair of loose basketball shorts and a tank top. \"Ready when you are,\" he said to the smiling brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she said, dropping her bag by the door and tagging him lightly on the arm before darting out the door. \"Because you're 'it', loser buys at Jamba at the end of the run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" he said, darting after her. It took him half a mile to get close enough to her to tag her, even though she was several inches shorter than him at 5'7\", she had the well muscled thighs of an obsessive jogger and while Michael was in good shape from playing foot ball at school, he wasn't used to the distance running that Tiffany seemed to just eat up. \"Tag,\" he said, passing her at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long,\" she said, not even winded at this point in the run. The jog stretched out past the end of the first mile, and the second,  with the two tagging back and forth as they pushed each other to run harder and faster. By the time they were finishing the loop, they'd gone nearly five miles and were moving at a flat out run. Michael bounced off the door only a handful of steps ahead of Tiffany, tagging her in his final sprint to the finish line before slumping against the door to catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Tiffany said, walking around the front yard and cooling down, one hand pressed to her neck to gauge her pulse. \"That was something else Michael. I don't think we've ever finished that fast before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said, stripping off his sweaty tank top and opening the door to get inside where the air conditioning was already working to stave off the mid day heat. \"You wanna run for Jamba now, or get something cold to drink and cool off here first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that,\" Tiffany said stepping inside. \"Can I borrow your shower before we head to Jamba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he said waving her down the hall. \"It'll give me a chance to get this morning's dishes straightened away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Michael had finished the dishes and was looking around the house at the other things he'd need to get done today when Tiffany came into the kitchen wearing nothing but a towel. \"Hey Michael,\" she said, as though it were nothing out of the ordinary for her to do so. \"I thought I packed a spare top in my gym bag, but it doesn't look like I did. Do you mind if I borrow one of your t-shirts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure,\" he said, trying not to stare too much as she left the kitchen, heading for his room. A few minutes later, she'd come back to join him in the kitchen, now wearing a short denim skirt and one of his old t-shirts, stretched tight across her full bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Michael. I'll make sure I bring this one back tomorrow... along with the shorts I stole from you last time we were out at the lake. But I still say the shorts are your fault for tossing me in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Tiffany,\" he said. <i>And here I thought having mom's friends would suck</i> he thought. <i>I could get used to this.</i></span></div></div>",

Not more than five minutes after that though, those fears started to melt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy!\" Melody called, running over from where she'd been leaning against a pillar waiting for Cindy and Josie to arrive. Melody was loving how things had changed when the cards had swapped her life with Jeremy's. Now she was in high school instead of middle school, and instead of people treating her like she was an awkward little girl they gave her the same kind of respect her brother used to get as one of the most popular guys in school. It had been even better to watch him have to put on her old school uniform, including the skirt and white knee high socks, though he did look pretty nice in the skirt with Anna's legs. Jeremy might not have been too happy about it, but Melody was loving it. \"Come on, we've got first period math to get to with Mr. Cranston and he's a pain if you're late to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Melody,\" Cindy said, grateful that she'd gotten such a nice best friend from Michael. \"You're tie is a mess you know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Melody said, adjusting the tie slightly along with her the collar of her button down shirt. Her breasts might not have been very big, but she was noticing the lack of a bra in her boy's school uniform. \"It's no biggie,\" she finally said, giving up on fixing the tie. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy had been afraid that people would treat her strangely, being an adult in high school, but people seemed to take it like it was normal. Her first two classes were ones she shared with Melody, and then she had gym with Josie. What she wasn't prepared for though, was what happened when she got to gym class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone,\" Coach Roberts called to the class. \"I need everyone who's going out for fall foot ball out on the track, if you can't belt out a mile under seven today you're getting cut.\" When she didn't pay much attention, coach Roberts brought her sharply back to reality. \"Ferguson, that goes double for you. If anyone needs the leg work it's our kicker, come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Josie said to Cindy as she headed to the track. \"I thought when the cards gave you Michael's 'job' at high school it would make you a cheer leader or something, but it put you on the football team like he was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said, heading for the track. \"Thank god Tiffany's had me jogging with her every day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the track, she started off at her normal jog, but quickly realized that this wasn't about doing a five mile tone and trim work out, but a one mile, fast as you can belt it out push. Thank god that even though the cards had put her on the football team they hadn't made people think she was male. She couldn't have done it without a really good sports bra to keep her DDs in check. Sometimes she wondered if Tiffany fared better with her enhanced bust, but it didn't feel like the kind of question she could ask now that Tiffany was Michael's friend and not hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cindy,\" Melody said as Cindy came out of the locker room after gym class. \"You wanna catch a movie tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't. We're having Josie over to the house for pizza and a movie at the house tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's cool,\" Melody said, eager to spend time with Cindy who she'd always admired. \"Mind if I join in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cindy said considering it. \"It's honestly kind of a girls night. You'd probably be bored... we'll likely be painting our nails, talking about boys and watching chick flicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Melody said, more interested in being there than before but trapped in her role in Jeremy's life. \"I guess you're right,\" she said finally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we can hang out tomorrow though,\" Cindy said, trying to find a way to stay on good terms with her new best friend. \"Why don't we get together with some of the other guys and go down to the lake tomorrow, we can ditch the family and just have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but aren't we playing cards again tomorrow... you know, to swap things back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we are,\" Cindy said, though she wasn't entirely sure that she wanted to swap everything back just yet. \"But we can do that in the evening, I'm sure Anna will be okay with it, maybe everyone can stay the night,\" she continued, becoming more and more used to the fact that Anna had the authority in the family she used to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your daughter is pretty cool about things like that,\" Melody said with a smile. \"Okay, enjoy your girls night tonight. I'll get Alex and Rick and see who else we can get to go for the lake tomorrow. See you at lunch,\" Melody finished walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He won't be back for a few days and she doesn't want to leave the kids at home since her oldest is only nine. So, she's invited us to all come over once the kids are in bed and she's opening up Tom's wine cellar for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Michael said, excited for a moment before he realized that he wasn't old enough to drink. \"Let me guess... I'm designated driver for the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want to, but Heather volunteered to play designated since she's already into her second trimester. Besides, if you get a bit plastered, I promise, I won't tell Anna or your dad that you were drinking with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that sounds great. When should I expect Heather to pick me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plan for six... the rest of us are going out to dinner together, I've already got reservations ad Cafe La Sol for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks Miranda,\" he said. \"And you know, I just might have a fun surprise to bring to tonight's card game,\" he said, thinking that it could actually be a lot of fun to see what happened with the deck of cards at a lady's night of wine and cards. After all, so far, things were turning out great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was during lunch that Anna found out some of the other things that having her mother's authority meant. She'd reached into her purse for change to get a soda and found that not only did her purse contain more cash than she was used to carrying, it contained a collection of credit cards. The platinum visa, the blue american express and the gold master card were just the starters. She also had cards for department stores, electronics stores... she even had a 'Victoria's Secret Angel Card.' Some of them were joint cards with both her name and her father's, but many of them had just her name on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the food court she spotted her mom having lunch with Melody and a bunch of Michael's friends. A few tables over, Josie was looking a little lost without Michael to have lunch with, sitting with the rest of his friends and Cindy just didn't feel right to her. Smiling from ear to ear, Anna walked across the food court to sit down with Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Ms. Ferguson,\" Josie said when Anna sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm still getting used to that. You know the dance teacher asked me if I could drop by to share my thoughts on the dance team's new uniforms? And Principal Edwards asked me to sign some of my mom's enrollment paperwork that had he said had been missed, along with the release forms saying that we were allowing Michael to opt out of school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really?\" Josie said, surprised how far things were going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... and there's more,\" she said, pulling out her purse and showing Josie the collection of credit cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, do all of those have your name on them?\" Josie asked, flipping through the stack of cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. And I was thinking that we could use a few of them tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have this scheming feel to you Anna, but for once, I think I'm really going to like it,\" Josie leaned in close to whisper with her co-conspirator. \"So what are you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm thinking that after school, we all go out for a manicure, pedicure... the works,\" Anna said, grinning hugely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want a pedicure while you have Jeremy's legs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding... I'm thinking that I'll get them waxed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Ferguson!\" Josie gasped, stunned that Anna would go so far. \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie, I've had furry legs under tights all day long. I'm more than ready to be rid of the fur, even if the legs aren't sleek and feminine underneath the fur at least I can wear a skirt without feeling like Chewbaka! Besides, after we swap back, Jeremy can just wear pants for a few weeks while the hair grows back, no big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm in, but Anna... this is a lot from you. I really mean that. We never spent time together like this before... did something else swap with your mom that I don't know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I be really honest with you?\" Anna asked, getting very serious for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking a lot today. You had sex with my brother last night, and you did it with my mom's sexual experience. Did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's, um, really personal Ms. Ferguson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's important,\" the younger girl said very genuinely. \"Please, just humor me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, yeah, I liked it. I more than liked it, it was unbelievable! I've never felt so confident around Michael and I felt so... sexy, so powerful. It was the most amazing thing ever. Michael and I had made out before, but never past 2nd base. But last night... it was incredible, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, well that's kind of what I wanted to hear. See, with the swaps, our family just got a whole lot closer. You're sleeping with Michael, and I'm the one giving you permission to do it. My mom is hanging out with Michael's friends and going to school with us. We're all closer together than we were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. It's going to be kind of sad when we swap back tomorrow.... I'll miss some of this. Is that why you're doing so much right now? To make the next two days really special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Anna said, her tone very serious. \"Well, yes I want to make the next two days really special. But... aside from my legs, when we can swap back... I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ms. Ferguson,\" Josie said, shocked at the notion. \"We... we have to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? And who says? You're happy right? And I'm happy, and my parents are happy. I think Michael is pretty happy about it all too, especially after last night with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" Josie said blushing. \"Yeah, he was pretty happy. But I don't know... I mean, won't your mom be upset? Most of the swaps were with her... her friends, her authority and the way everyone respected her... she's back in high school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I need your help. I'll try to delay us swapping back, I'm working on how but I'm sure I can come up with something... the longer we can make this normal, the easier it will be to get her to just live with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Josie said, reaching out and taking Anna's hand. \"I'm in... but only if Michael wants to do it too. If he doesn't want to be a house wife for the rest of his life and wants to go back to school... if he wants his own friends back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Anna said, knowing she was already one third of the way to victory and very certain she could convince Michael to join her side as well. </span></div></div>",

The restaurant he was going to with the other women of the neighborhood was four star and actually had a dress code. Men in sneakers or without a jacket would find themselves turned away at the door, or at least politely asked to come back appropriately attired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike had opted for a simple black jacket and slacks, accompanied by a soft cream button down shirt and no tie. He'd thought about the tie, but this was a social night with friends and it just felt too business. Next to the door he had a small overnight bag with a pair of comfortable shorts and a t-shirt that had a design on the front that looked like a name tag reading\"Hello, my name is: Inigo Montoya.\" Heather had called ahead to make sure he knew that everyone was planning to change into pajamas once they got to Amanda's house and he was relieved. As sharp as he looked in the jacket and button down shirt, he didn't exactly find it comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael,\" Anna called from the living room. \"Your ride is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Anna,\" he yelled back, grabbing his bag.When he got down stairs, Anna, Cindy and Josie had already sprawled out on the sofa and were looking through a stack of movies to decide what to watch first.\"Hey everyone,\" he said, stopping by Josie to give her a quick kiss before he left. Or at least, he had meant it be a quick kiss. Instead, Josie pulled him into a deep, sensual kiss that he felt clear down to his toes. \"Wow,\" he said, taking a moment to catch his breath, \"Yeah, wow. Okay,\" he continued, getting his mind back on track. \"I made up a veggie tray to go with the pizza, and there's plenty of fresh juice along with the soda in the fridge. As an extra bonus, I made up a batch of double chocolate walnut cookies for all of you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Michael,\" Anna said with a huge smile. \"You're the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Michael,\" Josie said with a huge grin. \"Keep this up and I won't let you swap back! I kinda like the idea of you working around the house and baking me cookies,\" she teased. She kept her tone light, but in part, she was gauging his reaction to the notion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as much as I would hate to give up school forever to wait on you hand and foot,\" Michael joked, \"I think you'd have to marry me first, after all, what would my friends say if they knew I had surrendered to be a kept man before I'd gotten married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tempt me Michael,\" she teased. \"The right game of cards and you and I can be married and your mom and dad can be dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Michael could respond, the door bell rang, announcing the arrival of 'Michael's' friends. \"Saved by the bell,\" he said, opening the door to reveal Tiffany in a stunning little black dress that displayed her enhanced assets to their best effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" Tiffany asked, as she stepped inside, her four inch heels clicking on the stone tiles of the entry way. \"We've still got Miranda to pick up before we get to the restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Michael said picking up his overnight bag. \"Take care of yourselves girls,\" he said waving to his mom, girlfriend and sister. Thankfully, he had the cards with him... he was almost worried what the girls would do if they'd had the cards for a night... he might come home to find himself married to his mother!</span></div></div>",

Like Tiffany, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was a young member of the group having just turned thirty. Her petite figure, only just barely five feet tall with slim waist and hips showed her pregnancy to an extreme, making her look further along than the mere five months she was into her term. The evening gown she was wearing emphasized her slender figure and showed a plunging amount of cleavage, in the way only women with 32 B-cup breasts who can go bra-less truly can. Michael had seen her before, but it seems like she'd opted to cut her once waist length auburn hair short, stopping it at her shoulders. The look, he decided, really suited her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" she said. \"Out of all of us, aside from Miss Party Girl in the back seat, I make the most sense to drive. I <i>can't</i> drink, and even though you technically shouldn't... none of us are going to tell if you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I really appreciate it,\" Michael said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Heather continued. \"Even though he doesn't have any kids of his own yet, Michael takes care of his family, and my first is on the way... Tiffany, when are you finally going to settle down and start a family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?\" Tiffany laughed. \"My husband may be all over me to 'practice' making a baby, but he keeps a darn close eye on my birth control. I don't think he wants to 'ruin my figure' with a baby just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now,\" Heather said, glancing into the rear view mirror to glare at Tiffany. \"I don't think there's any figure ruining that's required. Besides, the way you work out, you'd be in bikini shape within a month. And we're here, Tiffany, you wanna hop out and get Miranda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she said, bounding out of the back seat and heading up the walk of Miranda Witt's impressive home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda, the oldest of the group at forty five, had hair that had gone to gray early, but stayed full and lush even as she aged gracefully towards fifty. Unlike Tiffany, Heather and Michael, she held a day job as a designer and had her own lines of both clothing and furniture. Her figure had become slightly more pear shaped over the years, and her kids were about the same age as Michael and his sister Anna. She could easily have spent her money on liposuction or a breast lift to address her sagging 44Ds, but instead focused her clothing design on women her own age, staying well dressed and professional without trying to look like they were ten years younger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Heather, Michael,\" Miranda said climbing into the car. \"I'm sorry to spring the changes in plans on everyone so last minute, but it seemed like too good an opportunity to pass up. And, my own husband will be in London for his book signing next week, so we can do it again next week at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda's husband is in Japan,\" Tiffany said with a sigh. \"And your husband is going to London next week... I wish my husband traveled so I could have some more time for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't complain,\" Miranda said with a smile. \"The rest of us are insanely jealous of how much time and attention your husband gives you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Heather chimed in from the front seat. \"And how often you two have sex. The past two years, the only times Steve and I had sex is when we were trying for our baby. And now that I'm pregnant... nada.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Michael said, listening to the chatter. \"I'm really glad we're all going out tonight, and I think it's going to be a great night of cards.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a lavish dinner where the foursome spent nearly six hundred dollars between meals, deserts, and the first two bottles of wine for the evening, the group arrived at Amanda's sprawling home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone,\" Amanda said from the door as the group walked up to the house. Amanda had been a sorority sister of Cindy's and was only a few years short of forty, but most people would mistake the bubbly blond for thirty. She'd been a Midwestern all american girl before coming out west for college and her 5'10\" frame and sparkling blue eyes spoke volumes of her scandinavian heritage. In college, she'd boasted what most would call 'perfect' breasts, full perky C-cups, and a toned, fit farm girl physique. Since then however, nursing two kids and spending more time being a mom than a hard working farm girl had softened her figure, her breasts swelling to DDs and her hips and hind end expanding to match. \"The kids have been put to bed and I managed to convince my normal baby sitter to spend the evening in the study at that end of the house in case they wake up. We should have the game room to ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for hosting our game night tonight, Amanda,\" Miranda said, hugging the other woman warmly. \"We missed you at dinner this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but you know how it is with kids this age. We really try to make sure that at least one of us is around for every meal and school event. Tom had 'absentee parents,' that spent more time chasing and spending their money than they spent with him and I agree with him, I don't want our kids to feel they're being raised by nannies and not by their parents. Here, let's get everyone in and changed and I'll make sure that we've got a few decent bottles chilling in the game room for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, most of the group had gathered around the game table wearing comfortable sleepwear that ranged from shorts and an old Gears of War shirt that Michael was wearing to Amanda's silk kimono or Miranda's cotton men's style PJ set in purple. It was when Tiffany walked in sporting a pair of satin pj shorts and a Gears of War shirt that matched Michael's own that everyone started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Tiff,\" Amanda said, looking the other woman up and down. \"You stole that one from Michael didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. I just don't have anything in my wardrobe that isn't tight, see through lacy, or insanely low cut. If not all of the above. You guys should see the top that goes with this, I feel like I'm going to fall out of it if I breathe wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That my dear,\" Miranda said with a knowing smile, \"is because you go shopping with your husband and you listen when he gives his opinion of what he would rather see you in. Seriously, you give that man too much control of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you're stealing my shirts all the time,\" Michael laughed. \"And here I thought you were a closet video gamer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wish I could go for some things that are just more comfortable but there's no way Bill would buy me anything that's 'frumpy.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Michael said, pulling out the deck of cards. \"Maybe you can win a chance to wear something frumpy. I brought a special deck of cards for the evening. I know this one is going to be a little hard to believe, but it's a magic deck. After each round, the winner gets two minutes to pick something they want to trade with the looser and the cards make it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's kind of like a bet,\" Heather said. \"If Tiffany wanted to swap outfits with me,\" she continued, gesturing to her own floral print satin robe, \"Then I'd have to trade with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than that,\" Michael said. \"It really is magic, so the sky is the limit. If you want to trade outfits with her, than instantly what you're wearing will swap between the two of you. And resize to fit to boot. But it's even more than that. Say you wanted to be a bit taller Heather, if you wanted to swap heights with me or Amanda, the cards would make that happen. Since all of us are at the game, we'd all know, but everyone outside of the game would think things had always been like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said we have two minutes to make the swap?\" Miranda asked. \"What happens if we don't swap within the time limit? We loose our chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Michael said as he shuffled. \"The cards pick for you. And it could be something subtle that you don't notice at first like your taste in food, or it could be obvious and the next thing you know, Heather is sporting Amanda's bust. Oh, and once you lose something, you can't get it back for two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days eh,\" Tiffany said with a grin. \"Why don't we make it a week. Swaps last till our game next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it,\" Miranda said as the others all nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing I wanted to suggest,\" Michael said as he started dealing. \"We have two minutes. Take a minute to talk things over before you swap. I want to make sure we all stay friendly and I don't want people to feel like they're having parts of themselves 'stolen.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea Michael. I'd hate to see any friendships lost over a game,\" she said, not realizing that her own friendship with Michael was a result of the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, everyone settled in to a much more interesting game of cards than usual and uncorked the next bottle of wine for the evening. Most of the players were evenly matched but the first round's clear winner was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Author's note: I had asked Damaho to lock things down for me to develop this arc to this point and appreciate that he did.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, so let me get this straight Michael,\" Tiffany said once she realized that no one had anything to beat her three sevens. \"To make this happen, I just say 'I want to swap <i>thing</i> with <i>person</i>' right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's it. So what are you thinking you want?\" Michael asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I was thinking of a solution to my clothing problem. Seeing as I don't own anything that's not low cut, tight, or otherwise sexy... I want a week to wear something that's more normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're about to ruin my reputation as a sensible older designer aren't you Tiffany,\" Miranda laughed, sipping on her wine and getting ready to see if any of this really worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, since I keep stealing his stuff anyway, I was thinking that I would trade every stitch of clothing I own with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Heather laughed. \"That would be so funny. And cute! Michael, you have to do it, just so we can see you dressed up in Tiffany's tramp wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, it's not tramp wear... it's not like I'm showing off a lower back tattoo or anything,\" Tiffany objected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I don't think I'd be okay with every stitch,\" Michael cautioned. \"If you did that, I'd wind up with your underwear and you'd have to go jogging bra-less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that would be bad,\" Tiffany said, hugging her enhanced bust. \"But what about everything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" Michael said, hesitating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got about thirty seconds left,\" Amanda chimed in, watching the seconds tick down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Michael said, agreeing more to prevent a random swap than anything else. Not that he minded, it was just clothing... how bad could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best Michael,\" Tiffany said. \"I want to swap every article of clothing I own except underwear with Michael,\" she said and waited expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group didn't have to wait long before things changed. Tiffany found herself sitting comfortably in the same shirt she'd been wearing, but now also wore Michael's lose shorts over a set of familiar and comfortable panties. The fit on the shirt had changed slightly but it still hung lose the way a men's shirt should on a woman a size smaller than the shirt in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael on the other hand found himself in for quite a change. Not only did his shorts vanish to be replaced by a pair of tight fitting women's pj shorts in pink satin with black trim. Those, however, had been expected. The pink satin top trimmed in black lace with a plunging neckline that revealed his well muscled chest however had come from nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Amanda said, staring at Michael. \"Tiffany... is that the top you were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one. I got it before I had my boobs done and it was fine when I was a B-cup like Heather, but now, if I breathe, I swear I'm going to fall out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why didn't he get his shirt back from you Tiffany?\" Heather asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" Michael said. \"She swapped everything she owns...  so she 'owns' all my t-shirts. And I'm not the one who always borrows things. I bet, if I raided her closet right now, I'd find my entire wardrobe, along with one or two of her sexiest outfits that she had to borrow for when she wants to feel sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're probably right,\" Tiffany said. \"I've always been a closet raider... so you think the cards just changed the sorts of things I raid from your closet now that we traded wardrobes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure of it,\" Michael said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys,\" Heather said, chiming in. \"I have a really awesome idea. Something that would be a totally fun way to use this game tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Heather,\" Miranda said, turning her attention to the diminutive mother to be. \"What do you have in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm just looking at Michael here in Tiffany's sexy getup, and I was thinking... just for a week, how fun would it be to give Michael the ultimate makeover and make him the perfect little housewife for Josie? I mean, he's one of the best friends I've ever had, and I never thought I'd have a guy friend I could feel so relaxed around, but wouldn't it be cool to have just one week where we had Michael with us as a girl friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I love the way you think,\" Amanda said, smiling and looking towards Michael. \"What do you think? Each time someone wins, they get to pick what girly element of theirs they want you to have for the next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do I get if I win?\" Michael asked, trying to stall a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win, you get to pick what you want from one of us,\" Heather said, trying to entice him.  \"Come on, it will be a ton of fun.\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe next week, or the one after that, if one of you want a week where you don't have to mind the kids, since I don't have any yet,\" he said. <i>Yet?</i> Michael thought. <i>When had it become yet?</i> Was spending this much time as the best friend of a bunch of housewives changing how he was thinking about his relationship with Josie? Or was it some other portion of what he had swapped with his mother that made his heart flutter a bit at the opportunity to raise his own children with Josie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's reasonable,\" Amanda said, already thinking of a future week when she could swap her family responsibilities out and have a week off... maybe even relive a bit of the free spirit life that she'd had in college if she swapped a few things with Tiffany.... but that would be another week. \"Any others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds silly, but I don't want to swap my name, or my whole personality. I don't mind pieces changing, but I want to be able to keep track of it all.\" Michael paused and thought for a moment. \"Oh, and I don't want to trade anything that would mess up my relationship with Josie, no swapping spouses or changing my sexual preference okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's all pretty reasonable,\" Miranda said, smiling that her youngest friend was making such responsible decisions. She didn't quite know how it had happened, but as a group of friends, they were lucky to have someone as special as Michael. \"Why don't we get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Michael said, taking the cards and dealing. Looking at his own hand, he knew that he was doomed this round, but that's okay, because the fun wasn't in winning, it was in seeing what changed when anyone won.

It took a few moments for the change to get started, but when it did, everyone watched in wonder as Michael's frame began to compress, his legs, arms and torso all shrinking until he stood barely five foot tall.

Not your muscles, you'd still look  strong, but the strength itself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Michael hesitated. He was already short... now he would be short and weak... weak as a girl. But then, wasn't that the point? The wine he'd been sipping was starting to slow his thinking and make things a little fuzzy, and when he thought about it, it was better than risking something random. \"Okay, go for it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Heather cried with a giggle. \"Okay, I want to swap strength with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Miranda started. \"Did it work? Neither of you look any different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an easy way to find out,\" Amanda said, pulling out another bottle of wine. \"Michael, will you uncork another for us? My glass is empty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Michael said, reaching for the bottle. When he picked it up from her outstretched hand he was surprised at it's weight... it felt like it must be really thick glass. It took a little more effort than he was used to to put in the cork screw, but when he tried to pull it from the bottle he was stunned. It didn't move, not at all. Of all people, he should have been prepared for what it would be like... he knew the power of the cards after all. But there was knowing in your mind... and feeling it with your own hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me try,\" Heather said, reaching out with her longer arm and strong fingers to take the bottle from his hands. Moments later, the cork slid from the bottle with an ease that made it look staged, only Michael knew it wasn't... because it looked just as easy as when he'd opened the last bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Michael said, lifting his own glass. \"I think I'm going to need you to fill mine up too if it's going to keep going like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can stop Michael,\" Miranda said, looking him over cautiously. \"You don't have to keep going on this one if you don't want to... we can swap among each other if you'd prefer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How does Michael respond?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, it wasn't a straight flush, he'd completed it with hearts and spades, but it was still hugely better than Amanda's Ace high card and Miranda's pair of kings. \"Come on Heather,\" he said. \"Beat that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" she sighed, laying down a pair of sevens and a pair of tens. \"Not even face cards for me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Then I win, and I think..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you forgot about me,\" Tiffany interrupted as she started setting cards down on the table. First one Queen, then another... and a third... and a fourth. \"I think it's still a <i>ladies night</i>, and I've got all four ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" Michael said leaning back and taking a larger swallow of his wine than he'd intended. It left him gasping a little and he had to remind himself that he wasn't playing poker with soda and potato chips with his old friends... but the wine made it harder to remember sometimes and he just ran on instinct.  \"Okay, so what are you thinking Tiff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Amanda chimed in. \"You should swap how often you have sex with your spouse. Give Michael a taste of that kept woman / sex toy life you complain so much about Tiff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that's tempting,\" Tiffany said thoughtfully. \"And I'm sure Michael wouldn't mind having Josie ravage him every morning, evening and the occasional quickie at lunch,\" said trailing off in thought. \"But I was actually thinking about something a little different. And maybe it would come out sort of the same in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, spill the beans,\" Miranda prompted sipping on her own glass of wine. \"You have that cat with the cream look again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking that we could trade hobbies and interests. My husband has been talking about spending the weekend in front of our TV to watch football and I had been planning on fleeing the house to go shopping, but maybe it would be nice to watch it with him and enjoy it for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick it quick,\" Heather said, watching the clock. \"You're almost out of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you pick Michael... sex life or hobbies?\" Tiffany asked. </span></div></div>",

Something about not being as hairy as mommy so she didn't need it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was six at the time,\" Amanda said flushed with embarrassment and a little too much wine. \"But yes, that was about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, all fun aside,\" Heather chimed in, ever the vigilant one, and the only one who was sober enough at this point to remember to watch the clock. \"You might want to swap something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Amanda said, turning to Michael. \"I had an idea, if you're okay with it. I know Heather has your strength, but right now, you still look really toned... how would you feel about trading physique? You could spend the week soft and womanly... it might even help so people wouldn't look at you and expect you to be stronger than you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shur,\" Michael said, the alcohol hitting his reduced stature even harder than it would have hit his formerly six foot tall frame. \"Sounds like a plan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Amanda said. \"I want to swap physique with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collection of friends watched in awe as Amanda began to change. Since college, she'd settled well into the role of a full time house wife. Oh sure, she kept up on her yoga and did some pilates, but she wasn't an athlete anymore, and she'd had two children. Baby weight melted from her stomach, revealing toned, firm abs. Her hips narrowed and she felt her backside firming up and changing how she sat in her chair. Her thighs slimmed, taking on the look of runners legs and her large DD breasts lifted, looking more firm and youthful, but losing none of the volume they had gained since her C-cup days in college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Michael on the other hand, the transformation was exactly the opposite. He shifted slightly as his ass plumped, rounding out in a feminine fashion, along with the band of softening fat that settled around his hips and  belly. His thighs swelled, taking on a more womanly fullness, and his once broad and firm chest became soft, almost giving him the appearance of a pair of 'man boobs.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Miranda said, amazed more at this transformation than she had been when Michael traded heights with Heather. \"You know Michael... you're not far off from being a full up woman. I think whoever wins the next round needs to help you with your chest a bit... or maybe take care of that bulge in your panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well see,\" Michael said, looking at the way his new curves filled out his sexy lingerie. \"Remember, I can still win a hand here...\" </span></div></div>",

It was getting harder and harder for Anna to think of her mom as 'Mom,' the longer the swap went on, it really felt right to call her 'Cindy.' Not that Cindy seemed to mind, or, if she did, she hadn't said anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Anna said, sitting back down with Josie and Cindy and setting the plate of cookies where everyone could get to it. She might have Jeremy's legs, but that was no reason not to think about the impact of too many cookies on her thighs after all. And her thighs felt so much better since getting back from the spa and having them waxed! \"I wanted to take a quick break before we put in our next movie and talk about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" Josie said, not letting on that she knew where this was going. \"I have a soft spot for Time Traveler's Wife.... I think I could use a break before we plunge into Lake House or I'm going to go through a whole box of tissues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with you there,\" Cindy said, reaching for a dark chocolate and walnut cookie. \"I haven't done things like this since I was in college... I didn't realize how much I missed it. Thank you so much Anna for giving us permission to do it all, spa day and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're having fun Cindy?\" Anna asked, hoping she could lead her mother down the path she wanted the conversation to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, loads of fun... I'm actually going to miss it a bit when we swap back tomorrow. We'll have to do things like this more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, about swapping back... I was thinking maybe we shouldn't swap back just yet. At least, not tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Anna... we can't stay like this,\" Cindy said, gesturing to her school uniform. \"I'm a grown woman... and I don't belong in a high school... even if I am having a good time with it. And you're too young for all the responsibility you've taken on... you need to grow into those things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Cindy,\" Josie said around a mouthful of cookie.  \"I think you should hear Ms. Ferguson out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Cindy,\" Anna said, this time making deliberate use of her mom's first name in the hopes that it would reinforce the difference in their authority at the moment. \"I'm not saying make all of it forever... but I was thinking about Michael really. He tried really hard at school to be the all american guy, but you know he's much happier at the mall and shopping than out on the field with a foot ball. He's got no real interest in sports, and he's so short, he barely manages to keep up with most of the boys his age on the field. And it's not like he's as fit and as athletic as you are Cindy... you're actually doing way better at his life than he was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I'm his mother... I shouldn't be living his life so he can do the chores and take care of the family. It's not fair to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is it any more fair to deny him the happiness he has in your life?\" Josie asked. \"For once, he can dress how he wants, and not worry about being judged at school for it. He can do the things that interest him, and no one's judging him. Meanwhile, you get to go back to school, and have the kind of fun times you had in college... and in two years, you can do college again too! No one is forcing you to be macho at school, but this let's Michael be as feminine as he wants to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy opened her mouth to say something, then sat back and really thought about it. Had she been playing in the game Michael was currently playing in, she would know that her son wasn't normally the sort to dress in ultra-sexy feminine clothes, and that he really wasn't the short, soft, and generally weak figure of a man he currently was. But since she, and the other girls at the Ferguson house weren't playing, they thought that this was how Michael had always been. And a housewife's life really did suit this version of him better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, but what about the rest of it... I mean... the sex last night was different, and really special, but, Josie, I'm having your first time for you... and you're losing on all those special early times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie fought not to laugh, the only thought that came to mind was 'I remember teenage sex, hot, sweaty, over too soon and filled with too much fumbling,' but she refrained from saying it. After all, if Cindy thought these times were special, let her have and enjoy those feelings. \"I'm okay with it Cindy, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not saying we leave it this way forever,\" Anna said, seeing an opportunity. \"But why don't we leave it like this for a month or two, and then come round again and reconsider it? If I've made a hash of things as the woman of the house, and Michael wants to escape hum drum housewife life... we can put things back the way they were. But for a little while, won't it be nice to have a vacation from all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess it would,\" Cindy said at last. \"Okay... but no more than two months. Then I want to come back and talk about it again. And only if Michael agrees. If he wants to trade back tomorrow, then we do it, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we can talk to Michael about it tomorrow when you get home from the lake,\" Anna said, giving Josie a knowing look that said 'I trust you to convince Michael.'</span></div></div>",

The new sensation of her DDs settling on her chest was enough to rouse Michael from the hangover induced stupor and start moving. Even getting out of bed felt different, having to actually hop down because her feet wouldn't reach the floor while sitting on the bed. \"If I'd known I'd feel like this in the morning,\" she said in Miranda's soft, lilting voice. \"I never would have let them uncork the third bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadding across the soft carpet of one of Amanda's guest rooms, she dug through her overnight bag until she found a pair of panties and a push up bra that hoisted her slightly sagging breasts back up where they should be and created an impressive amount of cleavage. Digging further in the over night bag, Michael pulled out one of her favorite short skirts and began sliding it up over her smooth legs until it settled just above her broad hips. Sure, she would have preferred the skirt be a size or two smaller, but then, she would prefer that her hips were a size or two smaller. Such was not the lot in life of a woman who had born two children... or, a woman who had the bone structure of a woman who had born two children at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael,\" Amanda's voice called from outside the room. \"Are you decent in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on a second.\" Michael called back. Sure, Amanda might be as close a friend as the rest of the girls, but she wasn't quite up to having a man in her room while she was only wearing a lacy bra... even if the man in question was gay. Quickly grabbing a tight black shirt with a plunging neckline, Michael shimmied into it and tucked her breasts into place with a practice motion, carefully not catching one of her long manicured nails on the lace of the bra as she did so. \"Okay, come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Amanda said, taking a look at how Michael had turned out. He had to admit, his breasts really did look good on Michael... especially framed by Tiffany's wardrobe. Maybe he'd have to raid Tiffany's closet a bit when this was all over. Meanwhile, he was getting used to how his favorite lavender robe framed his considerably more masculine frame, and the free swinging feeling the silk boxers was giving him. Amanda had been surprised when swapping genders with Michael hadn't done more than change what was on his driver's license, but after sleeping on it, he couldn't think of himself as a 'her', even if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud,\" Michael said, softly, raising a hand to his temples in a vain attempt to ward off the headache. \"I'm really feeling the wine today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no surprise there,\" Amanda continued in softer tones. \"It's not like you're built to drink that much anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me,\" she said, trying to find a brush to tame her unruly hair. \"By the way... I don't remember much of last night after you got my physique... how many more rounds did we wind up playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't really remember that many more than you do... Heather wrote everything down somewhere. I think we stopped around twenty... maybe twenty five?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That many?\" Michael said, a little surprised. \"I was already getting pretty girly... besides the obvious, what was left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I remember it getting pretty esoteric for a while there. We were all a little buzzed. Why don't you come down stairs, Heather is working on breakfast and she should have the note pad so we can go over things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" Michael said, putting away her pink and black lace nightie and sliding her feet into her favorite pair of comfortable heals before heading down stairs. </span></div></div>",

When she heard the steps she turned around and smiled at the now female Michael. \"Good morning.\", she greeted her cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael grabbed her head. \"Would you be so kind and talk more quietly?\", she asked her. Heather grinned. \"I see, you've got quite a headache. No wonder considering how much you drank yesterday.\", she said nearly whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know...\", she, Michael, whispered in his feminine voice and pushed her auburn hair back with his manicured hand. \"By the way. You have the list, right?\", she asked Heather and received a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's over there.\", said Heather and pointed at the kitchen table. \"We played quite a while.\", she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhu.\", mumbled Michael and took the list with his manicured hand. This was the first thing he wanted to know: To whom belonged these hands in the first place? Heather and Amanda were out of question. He had seen Amanda's hand upstairs and could tell for sure, her's was still feminine and manicured. A quick glance over to Heather told him that the same went for Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked through the list:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Trait   - Person Michael swapped with<br>\r\nClothes - Tiffany<br>\r\nHeight - Heather<br>\r\nStrength - Heather<br>\r\nHobbies - Tiffany<br>\r\nPhysiques - Amanda<br>\r\nHair - Heather<br>\r\nHair colour - Heather<br>\r\nGender - Amanda<br>\r\nBreasts - Amanda<br>\r\nLips - Tiffany<br>\r\nUnderwear - Miranda</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know Miranda had such a great taste in underwear.\", she thought and continued looking through the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knowledge of feminine hygiene - Amanda<br>\r\nFetishes - Tiffany<br>\r\nGenitals - Tiffany<br>\r\nTastes - Miranda</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains why I like her underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sexual Orientation - Amanda<br>\r\nSex life - Tiffany</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\", Michael exclaimed surprised when she read the last swaps that took place. \"I thought we agreed to not swap that.\". Michael was too focused on the last two swaps that she did not notice the fetish swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked at her friend. \"Well, we all were pretty drunk. Although we weren't as much as you do, I remember most of the evening. So we figured it would be fun to swap sexual orientation although you didn't wanted at the beginning. And the the last one... It was the only time you won yesterday... We tried to talk you out of it but in your dunken state you wanted to swap that.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was when we decided it was enough. Unfortunately it was too late.\", added Heather. \"Who knows what would have happened if we kept playing.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Tiffany and Miranda came down. Tiffany still wore the Gears of War shirt and the shorts she wore yesterday. There was a bulge visible in her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked still normal because the underwear was not visible under her pj pants and the other swaps were mental nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, you've seen the list.\", said Tiffany and immediatley sat down on the kitchen table. \"I guess you'll have a pretty interesting week.\", she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at her angrily. \"Yeah right... And you'll have less sex, right? Wait a minute... If I have Amanda's sexual orentation, does that mean I'm not interested in Josie anymore?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda shook her head. \"Don't worry. Although I really prefer men, I like women as well. Bi is the correct word.\", she said and winked at Michael. \"Although you might probably get Josie to swap genitals with a man.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sighed. \"Just great...

It was strange for her that she now had to look up in order to look into Josie's eyes. It was also strange that she was so eager to sleep with her. \"Tiffany's sex life...\", she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie pressed Michael against herself, Michael could feel her D-Cups being pressed against Josie's own boobs. \"Come on, we go upstairs and have some fun.\", whispered Josie into her ear. Michael now understood why Tiffany wanted a break. If her husband was anything like Josie right now, it was really... unpleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael pushed Josie slightly back. \"Yeah... Later, ok? Let me get home before we have sex.\", she said with a stern look. They looked at each other for a few moments before Josie loosened her grip and let go of her. \"Okay, fine. But don't let me wait too long. I also have an idea to discuss with you.\", she said and went upstairs to Michael's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a really interesting week.\", she mumbled in her feminine voice. It had not occured to her once that the others might want to play again today and so swapping everything back in a week could become quite hard if not impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then went to the kitchen where he found Anna and Cindy. \"Hey, I'm back.\", she greeted the two. Anna looked over to Michael. \"Good. We have something to discuss with you. Don't worry, it won't be too long. We know how Josie is and now that she has Cindy's experience I guess she's even more eager to try everything out.\", grinned Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy wanted to say something, that the two of them were too young and so on, the usual mother's speech, but she somehow could not. Anna knew what's best, although Cindy knew it was not really that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\", mumbled Michael and sat down on a chair at the kitchen table, crossing her legs in a feminine way and letting her 1-inch heel dangle off of one of her feet. \"So, what is it you want to discuss?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna leaned back a bit and crossed her arms. \"You see, we discussed this yesterday and we thought you might like how it is right now. You never showed any interest in things normal teenage girls do, well except from shopping. You really seemed to enjoy the day as the housewife. So we thought maybe we should stay like this for... 2 months or so.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael listened to Anna. This was the first time it had occured to her that it would have been really complicated to swap back but this was a chance. She looked at her mother. \"And you're okay with going to school and all that?\", asked Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy nodded. \"Yeah. You seem to enjoy it and I want you to be happy.\". Michael smiled at her mother. \"Thanks.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked at Michael. \"Okay, then we stay like this for two months. I still have to talk to Jeremy, Philipp and Melody but I guess they will agree as well.\", she said. \"Now go off. I guess Josie is already waiting for you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded, got up and want to her room. In there she found Josie, already clad in only her bra and a stap-on. \"Finally.\", said Josie and licked her lips. \"Come here.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael kicked of her heels and slowly went over to Josie. \"I like it when you dress like that.\", she said and ran one of her manicured finger around Michael's quite impressive cleavage. \"By the way. Before we get started, I have an idea how to make sex more interesting for you.\", said Josie while groping Michael's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, although you love me, you still prefer a penis. And I thought about it. Maybe we can get Jeremy or even the pevert to swap genitals with me. That way I can give you what you want.\", she smirked and began kissing Michael's neck, while pulling off Michael's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael thought about it for a moment. It was gross to imagine her girlfriend with a penis, especially the ones of her friends. Then she stopped in mind. Something inside of her was getting turned on by the thought. \"Must be Amanda's sexual orientation.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at Josie and put one of her manicured hands on Josie's cheek. \"Sure, let us ask them later.\", whispered Michael and kissed Josie with her feminine lips.</span></div></div>",

Josie looked over to her girlfriend and grinned broadly. \"Like always, right?\". Michael nodded slowly and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie stood up from the bed and let the exhausted Michael back on it and began dressing herself. \"So what do you think? How about we go over to Jeremy and ask him about our idea.\", suggested Josie while she pulled her blouse over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at her girlfriend. She thought about. It was a gross idea that her girlfriend had a penis between her legs, especially one from Michael's best friend. On the other hand, now that Michael thought more about it, even though it seemed gross, she was turned on by the thought, even more now then last time she thought about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael finally nodded. \"Yeah, let's do it. Just let me get dressed.\", she said and got up, standing wobbly on her legs. \"Still a bit exhausted.\", laughed Michael and went over to her waderobe. Even though she could simply dress in what she had worn before, she had the urge to dress into something differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I change into that pink sundress, with huge cleavage, that you love so much?\", asked Michael smiling at her girlfriend. Josie grinned. \"You always know what I like.\", she said and got over to Michael and cupped her breasts. \"Although... I like you more when you wear nothing.\", she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shook her head. Josie really had changed because of the swap done last night. \"Even though you like me that way more, I won't go outside naked.\", replied Michael and got the said sundress out of the waderobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally dressed, Josie looked over her girlfriend. \"You look beautiful.\", whispered Josie into Michael's ear. \"How about we do another round before leaving?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael turned around and looked at Josie. \"No, not now. You can have your time later. Maybe then with a penis.\", said Michael with a stern look. Josie looked at her but gave in after a few moments. \"Okay okay. Let us go... Maybe we should first ask the pervert.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked surprised at Josie. \"Why him?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he'd probably really want my vagina. You know how he is.\". Michael nodded. \"That's true. He'd probably accept it more easily than Jeremy. But still... It's Philipp who we are talking about. You don't really want to have his penis, do you?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie shook her head. \"No... But I want to have sex with you again as soon as possible.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichal thought about it for a moment. \"Okay. Let's ask ... first.\".</span></div></div>",

They\u2019d dealt three hands so the three of them would be aware of the swap, but Michael and Jeremy quickly folded so that Josie could make the swap with Jeremy. Before Michael had turned away from the door he felt Josie step right behind him and press her new organ right up against Michael\u2019s rear. \u201cI think you and I are going to have a lot of fun, baby,\u201d Josie whispered into her girlfriend\u2019s ear, her voice huskier than before the swap.

She had dropped her underwear and the skirt she had been wearing. Michael had a hard time trying to remember what her own penis had looked like before swapping with Tiffany, but she was pretty sure hers hadn\u2019t been anywhere near that big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie\u2019s new dick, and it thoroughly deserved that word, was impressively long and similarly impressive were the balls cradled underneath.

But you should get you swap done now.\", Heather reminded Amanda. \"Ah, yeah, thanks.\", smiled Amanda. \"I was thinking about what we have to do with him so I forgot. I thought I might swap my hair with him. That way it'll stay blond but he'll get long hair.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others, including Michael, nodded in union. \"Okay, go ahead.\", Tiffany said. \"He'll look cute with your hair. That's for sure.\", she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked at Michael, smiling and began to say the phrase. \"I want to swap hair with Michael.\", she said and instantly her hair was as short as Michael's was while his was now longer and styled the same way as her's was seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels weird.\", mumbled Michael. \"Has it gotten hotter in here? Especially around my head?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany had to laugh. \"I guess you feel that way because of your new long hair.\", she told him. \"I guess...\", he mumbled and dragged a strand of his long hair infront of his face. \"Shall we continue?\", he asked the others while admiring his new, smooth hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda grinned. \"Of course. We're not finished with you, are we ladies?\", she said and dealt the cards.</span></div></div>",

I want to swap muscle tone with Michael,\u201d said Miranda with a smile. In an  instant Miranda's body bristled with Michael's extremely well toned muscles, her abs becoming a rock-hard six-pack and her arms grew to an amazing size. On the other hand, Michael's body became soft and supple, with the musculature of a lady, not a teenage athlete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, that was a surprise,\u201d said Amanda and everyone nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, my husband's always had the advantage as the stronger one of the two, now I get to turn the tables on him. Next time we have some \u201cprivate time\u201d things will be different,\u201d explained Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was still very amazed at the transformation, specially because apart from an unsightly bulge between his legs, he now had a very feminine figure and a hourglass shape thanks to Miranda's slightly wide hips.  He still had some detail work to be done, but from a distance he now looked like a very attractive woman.</span></div></div>",

Hell, he might not even want to switch back for a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll be the judge of that,\"  Michael said taking another generous sip of wine, \"just go on and say what you're thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking along the lines of our sex lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael gave a spit take hearing this?  \"Come again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry, I don't mean like switching partners or anything, I'd never ever do something like that to you.  I think we all love you enough to never do anything that, well, twisted to you.  Perhaps I'll need to phrase it better.  I just want to switch the frequency at which we have sex with our partners, quite honestly I could to with a break from up to 3 times a day when my husband is home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"  Michael said almost involuntarily.  It wasn't like Josie was a prude about the idea of sex, but the idea of sex three times a day at least with Josie was very appealing.  \"I wish I'd thought of it first.  Hurry up and do it before we run out of time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see how you feel about that after a week or so.\"  Heather said with a bit of a knowing glance with the other ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I wish to swap the frequency of sex we have with our individual partners with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael didn't really feel a change at first, but then his mind drifted to what he will do when he gets back home, he started to feel a range of emotions from excitement and anticipation, to a little bit of foreboding, as if sex was now just an everyday thing and a forgone conclusion.  \"I guess I won't be able to fully judge this one til we're done here, alright, next hand.\"</span></div></div>",

And I know exactly what I want that will work out for both of us.  Michael, I think that you need something to balance out your top, something that Josie can get a nice hold of.  I think it's time for you to have a nice rounded butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis drew another round of giggles from the girls at the table while Michael downed his glass of wine and said, a little to loudly,  \"Bring it on sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I want to swap butts with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda seems to sink down about an inch or two into her chair, Michael feels himself almost bounce up a bit sitting on his fleshy behind.  Michael stands up to turn around and get a better look at his new tush.  It certainly was large and round, but with Tiffany's chest and Amanda's butt it gave Michael the impression of a perfect hourglass figure.  In fact the changes had made it so that Tiffany's pink satin pajama shorts, which were already tight, really stretched out giving the room a nice form fitted view of Michael.  In fact while Michael was so fascinated by his new body, Miranda came up and gave Michael a good slap on the tush while Tiffany gave a wolf whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, at your age and that body, you'll get plenty of that when you go out especially with Tiffany's outfits, so get used to it.\"  Amanda said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sat back down retorted, \"Well, those guy's will get a nice surprise when they find out that I'm a dude, in fact as long as my gender stays the same, I might not get those calls since the world still, somehow, sees me as a male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see how long that lasts.\"  said Miranda, \"It's my deal.\"</span></div></div>",

For the first time all night he noticed that he was starting to get a 5 o'clock shadow.  <i>Better shave when I get home...or I could take care of it now</i> Michael thought to himself with a grin on his face knowing he was in control.  \"I've made my decision girls.\"  The ladies all leaned in with what Michael could have easily read as a bit of nervousness, if he could actually read them.  \"I can't go around town as a perfect little housewife if I end up having the beginnings of a beard when picking Josie and the others up from school, so I'm going to exchange body hair with one of you.  And I think it'd be best if it were with Tiffany.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Why me?\"  Tiffany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a bit of chest hair also and since you are the only one here with the chest for it, I though you'd be the safest choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh all right, if you can deal with being girly, I can handle being a little manly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I want to swap body hair with Tiffany.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Michael began to feel all around his body, and I mean all around, and found not a hair on his chest, legs, arms, or face.  Michael was interrupted from his self examination by a squeal coming from Tiffany.  The room burst out in laughter looking at the new Tiffany who sat there squirming in her seat with a band new, full, and absolutely glorious mustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, this is so gross!\"  Tiffany says after she pulled out a compact to examine the damage done to her perfectly crafted face.  \"I can't stand this, I'm sorry Amanda but can I go to your master bathroom to take car of this, monstrosity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of coarse you can.\"  Said Amanda after wiping a tear from her eye.  \"<i>After</i> I take a picture or two or ten.\"  And the room bursts out in laughter again, even getting a laugh from Tiffany.</span></div></div>",

I believe I should swap makeup with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so right!\" Shrieked Tiffany excitedly, I've been wondering what you've been missing, you have the body, skin, and nearly everything but you still looked a bit rough, makeup is just the thing you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I don't really have much of a choice with this, but are you sure you won't need it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweety, I'm pregnant, now, more than ever I'm caring less and less about the little things, I doubt I was going to wear it much next week anyways.  Plus, and no offense to you, I don't plan on going out much with your voice.  So my makeup might as well be put to use for somebody.  So if you have no objections?\" Heather said leaving open the chance to back out that wasn't really there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, go on Heather.  Make me pretty.\" Michael said as girly as he could to get some laughs from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap makeup with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the first thing Michael noticed was a sudden taste of wax on his lips.  Amanda held out a compact mirror so Michael could get a closer look.  Before he reached for it he stopped and said, \"You know what, let's see if I have my own.\"  So he reached into his bag which was now a purse, which he assumed had swapped when he traded clothing with Tiffany earlier, and pulled out his own compact to get a good look at himself.  What he saw surprised him quite a bit.  He'd only expected a little lip balm that Heather had been wearing for the dinner out but he saw that now he was made up the nines.  Lipstick, mascara, blush, eyeliner, the works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look there, it looks like our little rough gander has blossomed into a beautiful swan.\"  Said Miranda, sounding a little in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...I wasn't expecting this.\" Michael said stunned barely recognizing the beauty before him that only showed hints of his normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently all you needed was the means to get it done and you just run with it.  Although now that I think about it, I'm quite sure that Tiffany's clothing and Heather's interests had a great effect on you.\" Said Amanda in a fascinated manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok guys, this is fun, but the changes are starting to mix in some weird ways.

Saturday usually meant mom would take care of any extra chores from the week, leftovers for lunch, and date night out for dinner.  Although Michael's sleeping in didn't last long at all when his mom came in at 9:30 to have a talk with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, baby, are you awake?\" Cindy asked tentatively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am now.\" Michael was a bit disturbed for a second at the lack of a deep raspy voice coming from his throat, but then all of last nights events rushed back to him in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I just needed to talk to you.\"  Cindy said sitting down at the end of the bed.  \"How was your night with the other girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was great, we just played cards all night, drank a few glasses of wine\"  <i>And turned me into the perfect girl</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry about talking about drinking alcohol to me.\"  Cindy said misreading Michael's signals, \"I saw the way you stumbled in last night.  Honestly knowing those girls I would have been surprised if you didn't get at least a bit tipsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just come in here to give me an early start to my handover?  Or do you have something you need me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about cleaning up after our mess last night, Anna made sure we got it done.  She's such a nice and responsible girl, you know when she feels like it.\"  Cindy hushed a giggle, \"Don't tell her I said that.  But I did get you up for a reason, I wanted to talk to you about something.   Something very important to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy got up from the bed and started pacing trying to gather her thoughts.  \"Getting to spend yesterday in high school reminded me of when I was a girl.  I wanted so badly to meet a man, fall in love, raise a family and live happily ever after.  And I did that.  But yesterday I realized something.  I realized that I want more than that.  I want to go to school again, I want to educate myself, I want to pursue a degree.  And I want to have fun with school friends, I never had time for that in school, I was too busy focusing on Bill and eventually you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this have to do with me mom?\"  Michael asks tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm saying is that, I want to finish high school, I want to keep our swaps.\"  The last part she said extremely quickly as if spitting it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa mom\" Michael said, his now spinning and not just from last night's win, \"you're asking me to throw away my future and be a stay at home mom so you can go out and pursue a pipe dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!  I just want to finish out your last few months so that when we swap back, I can then go to the local community college and I'll have the knowledge I'd need to start off so it wouldn't be from scratch.  And you already know so much from school that when we swap back it will be as if you missed nothing.  We'll both go to college, I'll still be the homemaker while you go wherever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know mom, I don't know if I feel comfortable missing the last months of high school, I mean that's a huge piece of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will make sure we swap temporarily so you can experience some of the key high school moments.  I would never ruin that for you, after all what kind of mother would I be if I made my baby girl miss her senior prom.  I'll even open up my savings account so you can get the most expensive and most beautiful gown for prom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking about.  Thanks mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you'll consider it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just don't know if I'm comfortable with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Cindy said disappointed although not surprised, \"then we'll switch back roles and friends tonight at the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight?!\"  Michael said panicking a little.  There was no way he could change back tonight!  If he changed back tonight there was no way he would be able to get back together with Cindy's friends to set everything right!  There was no choice for Michael, \"Ok mom, you win, we'll stay this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Michael you are the best!\"  She said while hugging her daughter.  \"I'll make you proud.  And I promise I will do you proud, and as a reward you can use my gold card to go out and purchase anything you want.  In fact lets do that now!  Mother and daughter shopping spree!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we need to check with dad or Anna first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What they don't know won't hurt them.

He was glad that he did not swap legs with Miranda. He did not know for sure, but her legs were probably rather vainy. Tiffany would have been a great choice, she had nice legs. \"I should stop thinking what could have been and continue dressing.\", he thought and looked at his male but shaven legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then chose some flats, he figured although they did not look as sexy as the high-heeled boots and pumps he had in his waderobe now, but shopping with his mother might be rather intensive and exhausting. Also he did not want to be noticed by Anna. \"Funny to fear my sister when I want to go shopping with my mother...\", he thought. \"But now that Anna is mature and more reasonable... She's kinda authorative. Mom on the other hand has gotten a lot more cooler.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then started applying make-up and doing his hair. He was really surprised when he discovered the vanity table in his room. \"Small swaps, big changes.\", he thought while grabbing his purse and sneaking downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother already waited for him to come out of his room. She joined him on his way downstairs. She was wearing an outfit Michael would have normally seen on Anna but not his mother. \"You think you're dressed correctly?\", asked Michael whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy looked at him. \"I don't have more... appropriate clothes. Plus, I like to show more skin recently.\", she explained. Michael deduced that this was also because of the maturity swap that took place between his sister and his mother. \"Also, you're looking anything else than the cute, little girl you were once.\", she added and pointed at Michael's exposed cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shrugged. \"I also like to show something.\", he grinned. Both had reached the door without alarming someone so far. They finally got outside, got into the car and drove off as quickly as possible. \"We're lucky that Anna didn't swap driving skills with me.\", said Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, mother and \"daughter\" were in the mall. \"Okay then.\", smiled Cindy. \"We're young, good looking and have a gold card. Where should we head first?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael chuckled slightly at his mother's comment. She really was more careless now. \"Well, I'd say...\"</span></div></div>",

Both headed towards it. Michael noticed something new. He noticed eyes following him, especially his cleavage. \"Guys are staring at me because they think I'm a 17-year old girl with huge boobs.\", he thought. \"I'll have to get used to this... for the week.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one looks cute.\", said Cindy and pointed to a pink mermaid dress. \"I think you'd look beautiful in it.\", she added and took it from the stand. Michael looked at the dress but then began scanning the shop for more dresses he could try on. Normally he would have tried on one at a time, although no dress, but now that he had Heather's interest, he wanted to try on as many dresses as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, both had found a few dresses and went to the cabins so that Michael could get changed. Michael got inside and began undressing, looking at his strange reflection in the mirror. \"It's good that nobody can see anything strange.\", he thought. \"We stopped to early, I don't look as good as I could have.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to try on the various dresses he and his mother had gathered. They had found every kind in nearly every available colour. In the end both \"girls\" settled for the pink mermaid dress, which they had found at the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I think you'll need some shoes.\", said Cindy when she paid for the dress. \"And then we should look for some nice clothes.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at his mother. \"Why don't we look for clothes while we're here?\", he asked. \"Haven't you learned enough from me?\", asked his mother. \"First, this shop mostly sells prom dresses, second, we should first get the shoes. Afterwards we forget them.\".</span></div></div>",

So far the whole gender and body switch thing had been mostly just weird and fairly interesting, but here he was seeing and feeling a substantial change, he was getting along with has mother like a real friend.  And it wasn't just the changes Cindy had made with Anna, that really shouldn't have much of a change to Michael's relationship with her, she seemed to be having such enthusiasm watching Michael try on dress after dress and heel after heel.  <i>Even after changing back, I'll have to make a note of shopping with mom more often</i> Michael thought to himself trying on a pink pair of three inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the shoes for you.  I'm sure of it, just look at you, they are making your legs absolutely stunning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right mom, I think I'll pick these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you try on about 5 more pairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael gave as hearty a laugh as he could give, \"Sounds like a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at you Michael, my beautiful baby girl has grown into a real knockout.\"  Michael could feel himself blush, \"You are going to make some lucky boy's day at prom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's going to be <i>cough cough</i>\"  Michael chokes on the air realizing what his mom had just said.  \"some lucky <u>boy's</u> day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, him in his tuxedo, you in your pretty pink dress.

He came up to the door and just asked her out, he even said himself he didn't know what came over him.  He just said that it felt ok to ask her now for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael could now feel tears welling in his eyes, his world was falling apart, he knew he had to swap back as soon as possible.  Michael knew he'd been quiet too long and managed to say, \"That's so great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy turned to her daughter and saw the tears in her eyes, \"Are you crying?  What's wrong sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing nothing I'm just happy for them.\" Michael lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me, oh no, you don't have feelings for Melody do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Absolutely not!\" Michael says genuinely repulsed at the idea of liking his best friend in that way. Although in this reality his best friend was actually his best friend's sister. \"Did she know that he had a crush and asked her because of that?\", Michael wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, come here, give mom a hug, it'll be ok.\"  Cindy says completely misinterpreting Michael's signals of grief and confusion over losing Josie to Melody for losing a puppy-crush on his \"best friend\",  \"You're a beautiful girl and any guy will be lucky to date you.  I know what will make you feel better.\"  Cindy said as she wiped the tears from Michael's eyes.  \"We'll finish up our shopping spree and then we'll go get a bucket of ice cream and we can talk about it.

I just put on my big girl panties and kept trying on blouse after blouse trying to convince my mom I were ok.  I sware if I never see another cute blouse or adorable skirt again it will be too soon.</i> When in the center of the store looking at her own merchandise Michael caught Miranda who seemed to be at the store on business for her clothing company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda!  Over here!\"  Michael called over to her waving to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Michael, Cindy.  What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are celebrating all that is womanhood, with a good old faction shopping spree.\"  Your mother said trying to deal with seeing her old friend for the first time since the friend swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, I know you two, you only go shopping like that if something is really good or really bad, and judging by Michael's smudged mascara it's the latter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were always able to read through me Miranda, you see, Michael here is dealing with a bit of a broken heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!\" Michael said aghast that she would say something like that in public, let alone to your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Amanda said fairly alarmed trying to make eye contact with Michael to get a read, \"Cindy, why don't you go try on this new line of pantyhose we just came out with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sure I guess.\"  Cindy said taking the hint that Miranda wanted to talk to Michael alone.  \"I'll be back in a few minutes.\"  She said before heading for a dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael what's happened?  I know you're upset.  What did she mean by a broken heart?  Josie didn't break up with you did she?\"  Amanda said as she dragged Michael off into a private corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't break up with me, she couldn't.\"  The tears had started welling up again, \"Because I've always been a girl to her we were never dating.  If that's not enough Mom is insisting that I go to prom, and with a boy no less!\"  Michael was close to a break down.  \"I don't know how much more I can take of this, everything is too different, I can't handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh\" Miranda shushed trying to calm Michael down.  \"It will all be ok, just remember that no matter what, everything will be back to normal by next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at this rate, she wants me to start going out with guys, and considering tonight is usually date night, I have a feeling that mom is going to try to set me up with some of her friends.  She always used to do that before Josie and I became a permanent thing and I absolutely hated going out with those girls, imagine what guy friends she'd try to set me up with.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Michael, this is admittedly a bad situation.  Honestly when you swapped genders that worst that would happen was that you'd be hit on by a few guys.  I had no idea your life would be rewritten this much.  I'll tell you what, how about you let me set you up with a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how does that help me?!\"  Michael said offended that she would think a guy would make his pain go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted it's a lose/lose scenario for you.  But look at it this way.  You said yourself that this would be a good way to understand Josie a little better and you can look at it as a learning experience.  And if you have to go out with a guy, I know I'll be comfortable with the idea of it being someone who I know.  Let's face it, outside of your father, Cindy doesn't exactly keep great male company.  I mean she would probably try to set you up with that Phillip boy.\"  A mental image of Phillip came to mind and Michael threw up a little in his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on.\"  Michael said immediately as he could almost feel Phillip groping his breasts and ass right then and there.  \"Like you said it's a lose/lose case for me, but anything is better than either having a heart to heart with mom over situations she can't understand or...Phillip\" Michael said the last part with a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there you guys are, alright, how do I look?\" Cindy said finally finding the two as she showed of her new pantyhose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great, in fact you can have that pair on the house.\" Miranda said  \"Say Michael, me and some of the girls are planning a little get together this evening, how about you join us and we'll help you get your mind off things.\"  Miranda gave Michael a wink that was out of sight to Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun.\"  Michael said forcing a smile.</span></div></div>",

Michael pulled up into Miranda's driveway only to see all of the other cars from the previous nights game parked.  Michael knocked on the door and was ushered into a big group hug by the girls and a rush of apologizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are so sorry,\" \"We never thought this would happen,\" \"We'll do everything we can do to fix this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, it's ok!\" Michael managed to say above the other voices, \"I know you guys didn't mean for this to happen, but at this friday's game we will fix it all.  No worries, really I'm ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, you are such a good sport with everything,\" Amanda said, \"Miranda told us everything and we knew we couldn't let you go through this without help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unless you can magically poof me up a boyfriend to get my family off my back who won't be all over me, I don't know what you guys can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Tiffany added, oddly timidly, \"We may already have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, oh no.\" Michael said getting an idea of where Tiffany was going with this.  \"You don't mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I am now a single man who lives with his best friend.\" Tiffany said kind of sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry.\" Michael said not knowing what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, it just means we're in this together.  And I figure since we're already this far along, why not just go on and work with this universe's weird since of humor and just go out for the week.  Of course it wouldn't really be 'going out' we'd just, hang out with each other even more than we usually do.  It'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Michael still feeling bad about the situation his cards had gotten them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sad Michael,\" Heather said bending down to give him a hug, \"We are all best friends here, we will do whatever it takes to make this easier for you, we know you'd do the same for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Michael said realizing what he had to do. \"Ok Tiffany, it's a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I promise you that I will treat you like a little princess, I'll spoil you so much you won't want to change back.\" Tiffany jokes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hero.\" Michael said playing along pretending to fall into Tiffany's arms much to the amusement of the crowd.</span></div></div>",

The two had decided they needed to call Michael's mom to tell her about their plans for the evening, but about halfway through the call they decided to really have fun with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael!  I'm sorry but you are too young.  You don't know the first thing about love.  You don't know how men are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Tiffany just wants me for my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I'm just saying that I don't want you to make any rash decisions.  Don't go on talking about love on the first date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom mom mom, calm down.  I'm responsible.  I'll make sure we use birth control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael!\" The two couldn't hold it in anymore and burst out laughing.  Cindy hearing the two finally got the joke.  \"Oh you two think you are so hilarious.  So this whole thing was a laugh at my expense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly,\"  Tiffany said grabbing the phone from Michael who could barely hold it due to laughing so hard, \"I am going to take Michael on some dates, but you know Michael hasn't had much dating experience.  I just want her to go on a few dates with a handsome young man who can give her some experience in a safe environment.  I promise Cindy, I will take care of your little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok.\" Cindy said still sounding a little flustered, \"Just...be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much Cindy.  Take care.\" Tiffany said just before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Michael said sitting down directly across from his date, \"now that we have her out of the way, why don't we get back to what we were doing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am going to nail you so hard your head will be spinning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try.\" Michael said with a devil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Tiffany said looking deep into Michael's eyes before saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E2\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.

We've got the whole world before us, we can go out dancing, we can spend a day at the beach, go to the carnival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you want to do that, you might be confused for the bearded lady.\" Michael said putting away another shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany downed her own drink, \"You are so going to pay for that you little bitch.\" And Tiffany threw a pillow at Michael.  Michael responded with a pillow throw of his own.  This combined with the booze resulted in the now inevitable (and slightly inebriated) pillow fight.  The two messed around like this for the next few minutes before the rum started to get to Michael an absentminded swing with a feathery weapon resulted in Michael falling into Tiffany's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're so light now Michael.  I should probably cut you off from the drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that explains why there are two of you.\"  Michael giggled in his girly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get you to bed.  If you think you're in bad shape now wait til your tiny body gets a hangover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention the talking to mom's going to give me.  Can't wait to explain this one to her.\" Michael said before passing out into a very relaxing sleep.</span></div></div>",

He started to stretch before getting up, but noticed his legs getting tangled up in Tiffany's.  \"Sorry,\" Michael mumbled apologetically before thinking to himself. <i>Wait, WHAT!?</i>  Trying not to panic Michael just took a breath and thought <i>Ok, Tiffany got drunk last night, I remember that, but, oh god, I think I passed out.  What happened?</i> Michael began to look around without waking up Tiffany and began to assessed the situation.  <i>All right.  As of right now I can guess Tiffany and I fell asleep on the couch after drinking some rum.  What the heck was I thinking drinking so much?</i>  Michael looked down at himself and took a sigh of relief.  <i>I'm fully dressed still, that's good, it's pretty safe to assume that nothing happened.</i>  Tiffany, still sleeping, moved her legs around further entangling herself with her 'girlfriend'.  <i>And from the position we're in, it looks like we've been spooning all night, with me in the roll of the 'little spoon'.</i>  Michael realized, even though thanks to the cards he now fit the role very well, he still felt a little embarrassed about his positioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael grabbed his phone to check the time but saw it was dead.  He then checked the clock on the wall which read 7:00 AM, Michael realized he was in deep trouble with his family when he got home.  So Michael quickly rolled off the couch, flattened his hair down as much as he could and made for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you for our date later on, <b>girlfriend</b>.\" Tiffany said with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, see you.\" Michael said before realizing that he needed to move quickly and left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of the longest drive homes of Michael's life.  He knew that there was no good way to spin what happened last night.  Even though nothing happened last night, he knew he was going to have a hard time convincing his family that.  Pulling up to the driveway and walking to the front door Michael sudden had a chuckle in spite of himself thinking that this was pretty much the equivalent of a walk of shame.  He opened the door only to find Anna and Cindy pacing in the living room, their school stuff laying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God you're alright.\"  Cindy said running up to Michael to give him a hug.  \"We were so worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok mom.  I'm all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you.  What the hell were you thinking?  We were worried sick.\" Anna said pulling Cindy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael decided it was best to tell the truth, well, a version of it at least, \"It was all my fault.  I was hanging out with Tiffany, we got drunk so I couldn't drive home so Tiff offered to let me sleep on the couch.  It was no big deal.  Nothing happened.  I'm sorry, when I tried to call you but my phone died and before I could call from Tiffany's house phone I wasn't feeling well and passed out on the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Passed out?  Did Tiffany drug you?\"  Anna accused wildly.  <i>I guess along with Mom's respect Anna got some of her rushing to judgment as well</i> Michael thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  She would never do that to me.  I just drank too much.  Way too much.  I can't tell you how much I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to worry you.  I'll be more careful next time.\" Michael said trying to think of anything to say to calm their nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the second time in just a few days you've come home from an outing with Tiffany drunk or hung over.  I don't like you seeing that boy.\" Cindy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not your call to make.\", Michael said walking off to put an end to the discussion.  \"I'm going to get dressed and drop you two off at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come back here young lady!\" Anna said authoritatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second Michael was compelled to go back before simply turning back and saying, \"You're not my mother Anna.  And since when have you called me 'young lady'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was taken aback, it was really the first time anyone had stood up to her since she had swapped respect with her mother, she was also a little weirded out at the fact she had just called her older sister 'young lady'.  The discussion was over.</span></div></div>",

But as was his considerable amount of hair he realized how flimsy his anger at his family was.  As he thought about it more and more he decided that he should apologize to them as soon as they get back.

So Tiffany had taken the liberty of signing the two up for a little co-ed basketball tournament being held at the local gym.  Michael was pleased that Tiffany was thoughtful enough to pick something he'd like to do, even though he knew she hadn't had much experience in sports participant outside of beach volleyball and cheerleading.  Michael went back up to his room to look for some cloths to wear.  Sadly what seemed to be Tiffany's one pair of sweat pants was already downstairs in the washing machine so he had to go through the rest of Tiffany's cloths for something to play basketball in.  But after keeping Tiffany waiting downstairs for 15 more minutes, Michael realized he didn't have anything to wear that he would be able to move around in without showing a whole lot of skin.  He finally reluctantly decided on a very tight baby blue tank top with a matching pair of cheerleader shorts.  Grabbing a towel and a water bottle Michael went downstairs and tried to go straight for the door but Tiffany refused to go yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you walk down the catwalk.\" Tiffany said with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael grumbled some choice words about Tiffany's wardrobe, (including words like impractical and skanky) to himself before twisting around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, we're not leaving til you put some 'umph' into it.\"  Tiffany said while shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael laughed and know how silly this was, stuck out his considerable chest out as far as he could and walked up to Tiffany, making sure with each step to sway his good sized hips as ridiculously far out as he could manage without falling.  Finally reaching Tiffany and blowing a kiss and turning, again with the strong emphasis on his hips and ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany, succumbing to laughter finally opened the door and the two went to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tournament didn't exactly have a huge turn out.  After all, what could you expect for a weekday co-ed basketball tournament that started at noon.  But it was a nice little thing the gym had put together, there was even a nice gift certificate for some fancy Italian restaurant for the winners.  There were only 4 teams so the tournament would only have two rounds.  Michael and Tiffany's first game was against on older couple in their 60's who were just their to have fun post retirement life.  Michael used the opportunity to get used to used to shooting with his body changes.  Thankfully he was a quick learner and was soon making jumpers left and right, meanwhile even Tiffany was having fun running around the old couple and making a few layups.  Michael and Tiffany won easily and shook hands with the older couple who called them a cute couple.  Although Michael heard the lady whisper very loudly to her husband about 'kids these days walking around practically naked'.  Michael blushed hearing this but brushed it off as they got ready for the tournament finals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last game looked like it was going to be taking place with a couple in their mid 20's.  Michael and Tiffany knew they were in trouble as they looked like they had just walked off the floor of a March Madness basketball game.  As soon as the game started the man blew past Tiffany and scored.  The other team scored every time they got the ball in the same way, with Michael somehow keeping the two in the game with his jump shooting.  After making another shot, making the score 10-8 in favor of the other team, Michael noticed the guy on the other team watching his chest bouncing post shot before quickly turning away before his girlfriend could see.  Tiffany also seemed to notice this and gave Michael a quick grin and a wink.  Michael knew exactly where she was going with this, mostly because he'd thought of the same thing (to his embarrassment).</span></div></div>",

Getting really tired of being stared at by this dude, Michael finally decided smiling to himself, <i>He wants a show?  I'll give him a show that neither he, nor his girlfriend, could forget.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo before the whistle blew, Michael walked up to Tiffany, who was guarding the guy, and in as breathily as he could make his pretty soprano voice sound asked loudly, \"Hey Tiffany, you seem to be having some problems stopping this handsome man, why don't you let me have a go at him.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of shock at what she was hearing Tiffany recovered and said \"Sure, just be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will,\" Michael said giving her a wink only she would see before turning back to his prey.  \"Hi, I'm Michael.\" He said while extending his hand, and making sure to bounce as much as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Hector,\" the tall, tan gentleman said, a little overenthusiastic.  Especially considering his girlfriend was in earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hector!?  O M G, that is like, so exotic.  I love exotic guys!\" Michael said with such fake enthusiasm he was ready to barf if he stopped to think about it too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you do.\" Hector said suavely before remember his girlfriend was watching and started to play basketball again.  Hector was able to get past Michael quite easily due to the vast size difference, but Michael did notice that Hector's eyes weren't always on the basket.  With the score now 14-11 in favor of Hector's team, Michael decided it was time to up his game.  So while nobody was looking, he turned away and tore his top a little at the front, just enough to show a very good deal of cleavage, but just before they would have fallen out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Michael suddenly squealed, \"This was my favorite top! Hector, could you go a little bit easier on me?  Pretty please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Hector said first catching a glimpse of Michael's cleavage.  \"I mean, I don't see why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you're such a sweety pie,\" Michael said.  Turning around he could see Hector's girlfriend crossing her arms and giving an disapproving glare at the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first to 21 match continued, but as much as Michael tried to screw up Hector, his team still had the lead.  Although Hector had tripped himself up more than once driving to the basket while looking down Michael's top.  With the score now 20-19, Michael thought to himself, <i>Ok, time for a hail mary.</i> and suddenly screeched, \"Oh no!  Time out!  I've lost a contact!  Please Hector, help me find it please.  I'll make sure to reward you.\"  Before he could respond his girlfriend said while glaring at Hector, \"We'll ALL look for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Hector was on the ground looking for the non-existent contact.  Michael made sure to be bending down to look for it right beside Hector.  After a few minutes of searching Michael heard what he'd been wait for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HECTOR!  Stop starring at that skank's ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wasn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you lie to me, you've been eyeing her up all game.  What?  Am I not good enough for you anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Rose I\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear it.  We're done!  You and that hoe can go screw off into the sunset for all I care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it!\" Michael said putting an invisible contact in his eye.  \"Ok, time in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no,\" said Rose, \"No time in.  This is done.  Enjoy winning you whore.  I hope you, Hector, and that pussy boyfriend of yours enjoy it.  I'm gone.\" With that she stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean anything.  It was just looking!\" Hector said chasing after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Tiffany and Michael were now the local gym's 2 on 2 basketball tournament champions by default.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the car Tiffany said in awe, \"I can not believe you did all that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted to win.  And he was going to be looking at me no matter what I did, so I thought I'd to make him suffer a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did.  That jackass had that coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, he wasn't the only one 'checking out the merchandise' so to speak.\" Michael said to a now slightly pink Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked good, I'm not going to deny that, but the way you were strutting around it was hard not to look.\"</span></div></div>",

Can I have a talk to you for a minute?\" Tiffany and Michael looked behind them and groaned.  It was Hector running up to them and seemed eager to talk to Michael.  \"I was just wondering if you wanted to, you know, hang out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got a boyfriend numb nuts.\" Tiffany said making a move to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously that boyfriend isn't doing enough for her no dick.\" Hector said suddenly taking on a very threatening tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now boys their is no need to fight.\" Michael said trying his best to keep Tiffany from getting her butt kicked by the much bigger and stronger Hector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Said Hector, \"Look pal, you saw the way Michael was all over me at the game.  I mean let's face it, you obviously aren't satisfying your girl and she needs another man.  No shame in it.  I bet you can find a girl who will be willing to cuddle with you and talk about her feelings and shit.\"  With that Hector suddenly grabbed Tiffany by the collar and threw him with little effort over the hood of her car.  Michael shrieked out in surprise as Hector turned to him and said  \"Come on Michael, let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hector.\" Michael said, still freaked out over what he'd just seen, decided this had gone way to far and decided it was time to put an end to this, \"I'm sorry if I gave off the wrong impression at the game, but I'm not interested in you at all.  I have a boyfriend who I am happy with.  Again I'm really sorry.\"  Michael turned to go to the car to check on Tiffany thinking that he'd done a good job of letting Hector down easily when suddenly he felt himself being dragged towards Hector by his forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crazed look on his face Hector said, \"Wrong Impression?  You were practically fucking me with your eyes on the court!  I broke up with my smoking hot girlfriend since it was so obvious you wanted me, and as hot as she is, you're an upgrade.  Now you owe me.  And you're going to leave here with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had never been so terrified in his life, here he was being held by a man literally twice his volume.  If he hadn't been paralyzed by fear he doubted he could even wiggle free.  <i>Oh God, what have I done?  What's going to happen to me?</i>  Was all that kept repeating in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Michael felt himself be let go.  And there was a sudden <b>whack</b> and a <b>thump</b>.  Michael, still quivering, turned around and saw Tiffany with tire iron standing over Hector who was out cold on the ground.  Tiffany panting heavily said, \"Come on, let's get out of here quick before he stirs or the cops get called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany.\" Without thinking Michael ran and full speed and hugged Tiffany with all his might, accidentally knocked her down and falling on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh, can you please get off me, I think that ass cracked a rib.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline rushing through the two of them, Michael did something he never ever would have pictured himself doing under any circumstances.  He kissed Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was surprised by this, but even though she knew she was married and Michael had a girlfriend, she didn't stop it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the kiss ended of it's own accord, Tiffany was the first to regain her sense of decorum.  \"I'll just drop you off back at your place before I drive myself to the hospital for a check up to make sure nothings wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let you do that, I mean it's my fault we got in this mess.  I'll take you to the hospital and make sure everything is ok.  I'm so sorry I'll make sure everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael.\"  Tiffany cut him off, \"I'm a big girl, I can take care of myself, I could have easily stopped you from doing what you did but I didn't.  I'm just as responsible as you.  Hell probably more so, I have more experience with leading a guy on and could have seen where it would lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's all my fault.  I'll just take care...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael!\" Tiffany said cutting him off again before he got into hysterics, \"I'll be ok.  And you've got a family to take care of.  Now do you think Cindy and Anna can handle themselves for a second straight evening without you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing a smile Michael said, \"Probably not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany smiled as well, \"Then it's settled,\" She said while Michael helped her up, \"I must apologize in advance, I was hoping to do something exciting tomorrow as well but I'm not sure I'll be up to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll think of something to do.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Tiffany dropped Michael back off at home, the events that had taken place finally began to really sink in for Michael.  He just kept beating himself up about what had happened to Tiffany even though she'd tried her best to calm his fears.  Michael knew he had to do whatever it took to make it up to her so he did the only thing he could think to do under the circumstances.  He started to cook.  Michael got a roast out of the freezer and thawed it out.  He cut up half of it and put one it into a stew for his family and took the other half and put it in a crock pot to slow roast to perfection for a really nice lunch date for Tiffany.  While Michael was putting spices into the meals he heard the door slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael we're home.\" Cindy yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the kitchen.\" Michael said in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That smells great.\" Anna said as the girls came into the kitchen, \"But do we really need a roast and a stew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The roast is for Tiffany.\" Michael said meekly not sure if he wanted to talk about what had happened today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Cindy said not sure what she wanted to say after what had taken place that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and painful silence suddenly Michael and Cindy said at the same time to each other, \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry I worried you guys last night, I should have called you but I was just drunk and stupid and I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too,\" Cindy said rushing to give her 'daughter' a hug, \"I'm sorry I was so angry with you this morning.  If you say nothing happened last night I believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>We</b> believe you.\" Anna added and with a rare act of remorse added, \"Sorry sis.  Forgive us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing to forgive,\" Michael said bringing Anna into the group hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the embrace finally broke Anna decided to try to lighten the mood by saying, \"So Tiffany has already got you cooking meals for her huh?  Are we going to have to look into hiring a maid to take care of your housework?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha sis, no you don't.\" Then deciding it was time to open up said, \"I kind of really screwed up today and I want to make up to Tiff for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Cindy asked concerned.  And that was all the excuse Michael needed to open up and talk about what had happened today starting with the flirting, going to the parking lot where Hector was waiting for them, finally ending with<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kissed him.\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Anna said looking stunned, \"I don't know if that was romantic or stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My poor baby.\" Cindy said with tears in her eyes as she went for another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm ok.  Really.\" Michael said returning the hug tenuously while trying to back out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go shower up and take a nap.  You're still reek of sweat from earlier.  Don't worry about the food, I'll take care of the rest.  Anna, here's $50, go out and get a bottle of wine and batch of cookies to go with the roast for Tiffany.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom you don't have to do...\" Michael tried to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, now please let me be the dotting mom again just for the night.  Go clean up and relax, you've had a trying day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Michael left to head up to his bathroom for a shower, but before he entered he was stopped by Anna who jokingly said, \"I don't see why I have to get a batch of cookies, I mean you already gave Tiffany his desert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you we just had one kiss.\" Michael snapped at Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, it's a joke.  The kiss was all I was referring to.  You don't have to bite my head off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Michael said sheepishly, \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, I probably took it too far.  Just...be ok.  Alright sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" and once again the 'sisters' shared an embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Michael went into the bathroom, something dawned on him that he didn't really have time to dwell on considering what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I kissed Tiffany?</i> Michael suddenly thought to himself as if it was the first he'd heard of this.  <i>Well, it was just a friendly little quick kiss to show my gratitude.</i> Michael looked in the mirror and saw that even his reflection wasn't believing what he'd just thought.  <i>Well, at least it didn't mean anything.</i>  His buxom and beautiful reflection still didn't seem to buy it.  <i>Well, at least I know I won't do it again.  After all, I love Josie and not Tiffany, right?</i>  Michael's reflection had changed this time, but instead of showing a man confident in what he'd thought, he just saw a confused woman who wasn't sure if what was just thought was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow is going to be an interesting day.\" Michael told his reflection before stripping down for a much needed shower.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tuesday morning Michael woke up for the first time in a while completely unsure of what he wanted to do.  After his crisis of self last night he went down and tried to put the finishing touches on the roast and stew but his mom would have no part of that and shooed him back upstairs to rest after the days events.  Michael spent hours wondering about what his feelings were in regards to Josie and Tiffany.  Now that a few days had passed since his initial shock of finding out Josie was now dating his former best friend, as much as he hated to admit it, he didn't mind it as much as it should.  On the few brief occasions he had seen them when dropping off Anna or Cindy they looked really happy, and as much as it pained him to admit it, Josie looked happier with Jeremy than she had with him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Tiffany, the woman he had kissed.  One of his mom's best friends.  A married woman.  <i>Well, she isn't really married anymore with our gender swap,</i> Michael thought to himself before feeling incredibly guilty for thinking that.  I mean she loved her husband, right?  It suddenly dawned on Michael that he never really heard Tiffany talk much about her husband.  In fact in the last few days she hadn't mentioned him at all.  Tiffany even seemed happier the last few days than Michael had ever seen.  Michael knew then and there he had to talk to Tiffany about what was going on between them.  It may just be anxiety from all the changes in the last week for Michael, but he knew he had to make sure.  So he went to his closet and put on a matching baby blue skirt and blouse.  He sat down at his makeup counter to make sure his hair was decent, but deciding he really wanted to make some sort of impression to Tiffany, also put on some foundation, lipstick, and mascara.  Deciding he was as ready as ever, Michael went downstairs, grabbed the roast, wine, and cookies, and headed over to Tiffany's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael rang the doorbell but didn't have long as almost immediately Tiffany opened the door.  \"Oh,\" Tiffany said, and for the first time since he'd known her Tiffany looked flustered and at a loss for words, \"Um please come in.  I was hoping I'd get the chance to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael entered the house as Tiffany led him back to the living room where just a day earlier Michael had woken up on the couch there sleeping against Tiffany.  Michael blushed and smiled without realizing it before remembering he was there for a reason.  \"I didn't know if you'd be up with going out for today's date so I thought I would bring the date to you.\"  Michael felt embarrassed fearing that he was coming off too forward but Tiffany simply said \"Thanks.  Just put it in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of how to take Tiffany's fairly curt response, did as she said and came back to the living room where Tiffany had taken her place on the couch where she was surrounded by pillows and seemed to have made camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bad is it?\" Michael asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad, the doctor's took some x-rays and it turns out all I've got some cracked ribs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it look like you're sleeping on the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I was.  Since we swapped I've been sleeping in my former guest room which I guess is my room now, but that bed is as hard as a rock and the couch is so much more comfortable.  I'll have to make a note that if we switch back that we replace it with something more comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If?\" Michael said noting the use of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When.\" Tiffany said quickly, \"I mean when.  I mean after all, we can't stay like this.  You have a girlfriend.  I have a husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael thought about why he came here and took a deep breath before saying something that could change his life forever.</span></div></div>",

I'd even say they have some...potential benefits that would otherwise be impractical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like being able to wear dresses without getting weird stares from people?\" Tiffany says trying to loosen up the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I like you Tiffany.\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like a small eternity passed Michael decided to clarify a little bit.  \"I've never felt for someone the way I feel about you.  I liked being around Josie, we had a good time.  But ever since we started this little experiment, I can't keep my mind of you.  I've tried to think about how I'm going to get back to my old life, but when I think about it, it feels just a little empty.  When we kissed, it felt so real.  So good.  I can't imagine feeling that way with someone else.  You've added so much enjoyment to my life that I don't want to go on without you being close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother dead silence took over the room.  Minutes passed without a word said, Michael heard the silence and it felt like a dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I'm sorry.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I'll just get out of hear.\" And Michael went for the door with tears forming in his eyes.</span></div></div>",

I don't know what I was thin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IthinkIfeelthesamewayaboutyou\" Tiffany blurted out.  Both stood in silence, both surprised by what had been revealed to each other.  Michael stepped away from the door and sat down in a armchair across from Tiffany on the couch.  \"Wow.\" He said letting out the only thought running through his head.  \"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Tiffany said sinking down into the couch.  This wasn't exactly how Michael had pictured their confessions of shared feelings going.   It wasn't like the movies where two people confess their love and share a passionate embrace and kiss that possibly leads somewhere more.  Nope, two just people awkwardly sitting across from each other as if it was a middle school dance, waiting for someone to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Michael finally said, \"we like each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany gave a weak smile, \"Looks like we do.  Well, what are we going to do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we do about it?\" Michael said trying to put everything in his mind together.  \"If we are really as serious about this as I think we may be, we have two ways we can go about it and both are going to be tricky.\" Michael got up to pace and think to try to let off all the energy that was suddenly flowing through his petite frame.  \"We switch our genders back.  I have an ugly break up with Josie, my parents probably disown me for pursuing a relationship with a girl a few years my senior.  Although not many years!\" Michael quickly backtracked seeing the look on Tiffany's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention I'll have to go through a messy divorce, which will probably result with me getting nothing.  Hell he'll probably try to sue me for emotional damage or some other bullshit.  Also if your family takes it as bad as you think they will, then we may not have any place to live and since we are both currently homemakers, no income.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we can keep out current genders.\" Michael started, \"It might not have as many difficulties from a family standpoint.  If we understand this universe correctly, you will still be living here still having your ex husband's support, and I will still be in my families good graces.\" Michael silently added a thought, <i>That is as far as Tiffany is concerned, Anna and mom still know I'm dating my mom's former good friend, either universe I choose that's a conversation I'm not looking forward to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we go with that choice,\" Tiffany added continuing the rundown, \"We have the awkward situation of living as the opposite gender for as long as we are together.  Neither are exactly fun choices.  Are you sure you want to go through with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael finally stopped pacing and made a hard b-line to the couch, leaned over, and gave Tiffany as strong a kiss as his feminine body could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  But let's make a decision about how we want to do this before we do anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Michael said, a little disappointed, and went back to his pacing.  After about two hours of weighing the pros and cons of both sides the two finally came to the decision that would change the rest of their lives.</span></div></div>",

What? And ruin my girlish figure? No way!\u201d exclaimed Michael in half-mock disgust. He aware that his new frame could not eat nearly as much as his original body, but he was more than happy with it now. Tiffany laughed softly, warry of the pain. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The switched up couple cracked up laughing and Tiffany felt glad to be able to lift Michael\u2019s mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Michael a while to get everything they needed for their day at the beach and find the bikini Tiffany had mentioned. He decided to wear the turquoise, two-piece suit, with a white sarong dress, sandals, a fashionable, floppy hat, silver wrist bangles, a pair of chandelier earrings. Tiffany was completely at a loss for words when Michael came back out with a beach-tote in hand. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Michael asked, \u201cNo, you ... you look amazing. I didn\u2019t expect you to know how to \u2026 to \u2026 well, look like that,\u201d she replied, \u201cWell, thank you. It\u2019s strange, there are things that simply come to me somehow. It\u2019s hard to explain, but I just know what will go great with what. The moment I saw the bikini I knew what would work with it. It\u2019s strange, but I kinda like it,\u201d Michael said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride out to the beach was quick, and they managed to get a nice spot. Tiffany made the effort of being the gentleman and carried all their stuff and planted their beach umbrella with a grunt. \u201cWow, the sun feels amazing, it\u2019s the perfect day for the beach. Great call, Tiff!\u201d Michael enthused, stretching up, closing his eyes, feeling the breeze and taking in the sounds of the beach. When he opened he opened his eyes again, he turned around and caught Tiffany running her eyes up and down his figure. She quickly looked away, but her reddening cheeks made it clear she knew she\u2019d been caught staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael smiled and said, \u201cCommon Tiff, \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the days activities were not nearly as eventful for Michael.  After finishing the shopping trip he and Cindy came home to get scolded by Anna who grounded Cindy from her all her credit cards until the planned swap back tomorrow night.  Michael even had that ice cream with his mom, they thankfully didn't talk about relationships or anything so heavy, just simple schoolwork and household duties.  As soon as it was time, Michael took the keys and headed over to Miranda's house to discuss his dating life for the next week.  Not exactly something he was looking forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be in much better spirits.\"  Miranda said answering the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just needed time to sit down and really get a grasp of the situation.  I realize it is only a temporary thing and with everything I know about the cards, I'm 100% positive things will go back to normal once I swap everything back.\" <i>At least, I hope I'm 100%</i> Michael thought letting a splash of doubt in his mind, but he quickly put it off.  \"I can either sit down in a corner and cry and pout, or I can go out and attempt to have a 'good' time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you are deciding to make the best of what could have been a dark situation.  I'm very proud of you, you have great perspective and I'm proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now that you've buttered me up you're going to set me up with some boy aren't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me all too well.\" Miranda said with a smile.  \"But before I tell you about him, I just want too make sure that you are ok with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I'm going to marry the guy or anything, I'm just going to date him to get my family off my back before I get myself back next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Using a guy and throwing him away, wow Michael, you're turning out to be quite a little bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael took the joke well but couldn't help but feel a tad bit guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok let me tell you about him, you might even know him.  He goes to Josie and Cindy's school.  He's my nephew, Dexter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PoinDexter is your nephew?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you know his nickname.\" Miranda said, obviously not approving of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Anna had told me about it.\" Michael said in a quick lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they've probably told you about who he is a bit of a nerd who has no self confidence.  So much so that he's never even asked out a girl out of fear of rejection.  But he is such a sweet and gentle boy.  It's just so unfortunate my sister has let him just grow up in front of a tv and computer.  I swear if he let himself get contacts he'd be so handsome, but he's even afraid of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want him to date a real hottie to give him a boost of confidence even though he'll forget that it ever happened in a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, but, I don't know.  He won't remember the girl you, but maybe, maybe if he has a fun time with you he'll be able to have some form of confidence in his subconsciousness after the week.  I doubt it will work, but I'd like you to at least try for his sake.  Plus this isn't all just helping him.  It will get your mother off your back to find a boy and get over 'Jeremy', and I know Dexter.  He's about as safe a boy for you to be with for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down on a very expensive couch to give yourself some time to think.  You knew Dexter from school and Miranda's description of him was giving him too much credit.  He was always the most socially awkward, most nervous, most lonely kid in your school.  In fact hearing what Miranda said and thinking back to the way you treated him, both through ignoring him and making the occasional perfectly innocent joke with friends made you ashamed of yourself.  <i>I swear after this week and I'm back to normal, I really need to rethink the way I think of people, I'm probably a part of the reason Dexter is in such bad shape.</i>  The sense of personal shame was really getting to him before being replaced with a strong resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\"  <i>I <b>will</b> help this guy out.  If I have the power to help people, then I need to make sure I do.  The cards aren't just for my own personal entertainment.  If I think I can help people with them, then by God I will.</i>  Taking a deep breath Michael said strongly \"I'll go out with Dexter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Michael, you are an amazing man.  You know, you're going to make a great father someday.  How do we want to set this up?  We can either set you up on a blind dinner date, or I can call him over and you can 'spontaneously' meet him and let the magic happen.\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, he hasn't much confidence so it would be hard for him to talk to me in a normal situation.\", Michael explained to Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wouldn't that also be the case if you two were on a blind date?\", she replied. The girlified ex-boy shook his head. \"Not quite the same, at least I hope so. Maybe he's more open when we two meet at a restaurant or somewhere else for a blind date. Although it's not bulletproof, I think that would be the best idea.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda nodded. \"As you wish. How about I phone him now?\", she suggested. \"He'll be at home, probably playing some computer game, so he'll have time. If not, I just phone his mom, she'll make him go.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soon?\", asked Michael surprised. \"Yeah, why not? The sooner you get to know him... Also tonight is date night, right? So why not?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded but was uneasy with the situation. He knew he had to hurry in order to get his mom off his tail but this was... too soon. Everything was changing quite rapidly for Michael. Yesterday around this time he was still a rather normal boy and in a relationship with Josie. Now he had boobs and was single and was also going to date a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\", Michael said sighing softly. \"Tell him... Tell him to come here in I dunno... Two hours? I have to get dressed. I can't go on a date like this.\". Normally Michael would not have cared about how he looked, as long as his clothes looked clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do, just hurry back home. I guess now that you have Tiffany's clothes you have a more fitting dress at home.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then hurried back hom in order to get dressed. At home he ran into Anna who was quite interested why he had gotten home so early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were over for a girl's night or something?\", asked Michael's sister. Under normal conditions he would have said nothing but now that Anna had they're mother's respect and authority he had the urge to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just getting dressed.\", he explained. \"I'm having a blind date with a nephew of Miranda.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? My sister finally tries dating someone.\", she said smiling. \"And I already thought that you were a lesbian.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael chuckled slightly at Anna's comment. He was indeed a lesbian, he was a boy. \"Yeah... I just thought it was time...\", he mumbled. \"But excuse me... I don't want to get late.\". Michael then hurried to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down...\", Michael thought. Anna's comment made him think of what he had lost. \"When everything is over you'll get her back... Hopefully.\". Michael took a deep breath, his silicon-filled breasts got up slightly. \"Okay... Let's get dressed.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to his waderobe and looked through it. \"This blue cocktail dress will look good on me.\". Heather's interests really helped him when it came to things like choosing what to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael laid the dress on his bed and then looked for matching shoes. When he found them, he got undressed and got dressed into sexy, lacy, black underwear. He then dressed himself in the dark blue dress and the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Then let's do my make-up.\". He sat himself on his vanity table and applied his make-up. Lastly he did his hair. Then he checked himself in the mirror. \"Yeah, he'll like me.\", Michael giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"boy\" then got back to Miranda's house.</span></div></div>",

Although the idea of being first went away after Michael walked up to the door and saw an old fashion bicycle tied to a pillar on the porch with a Pokemon bike chain. <i>Well, I guess I know whose vehicle we're taking</i> Michael thought to himself before ringing the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael could hear voices approaching, well one voice.   He'd could hear Miranda quickly telling Dexter on the other side of the door some what Michael assumed were last minute tips like \"be polite\" and \"don't stare\" and \"for god's sake talk to her\".  Hearing the footsteps get closer and closer Michael nervously did a last second examination of himself making sure nothing was showing that he didn't want to show and forced himself to keep a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity to both of them, Dexter finally opened the door to see his blind date for the first time and the poor boy didn't know what hit him.  Before him was a beautiful creature he had only admired from afar.  A real life girl.  Michael was kind of embarrassingly pleased to see that Dexter's mouth was literally agape.  Although the shock wasn't entirely on one end.  Michael was surprised by what was before his eyes as well.  Instead of being dressed up for a nice dinner, before him was what one might describe as the living embodiment of the word nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter was not very menacing 5'7\" and slightly overweight 175lbs.  His face was very blotchy as though he seemed to constantly had an allergy rash of some sort.  Atop that blotchy face was a greasy and slicked back black hair which had been slicked back so much in an attempt to look presentable, one could count the individual comb lines, as well as thick nerdy glasses.  Dexter wasn't exactly dressed for a first date in a normal person's eyes, but to him this was as good as he'd could dress.  He was wearing a pair of worn jeans which was held up with an elastic band in the waistline (pulled up too high of coarse) and a yellow poke-doted black polo shirt.  He even had pen and pencil in the shirts pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple stood there from a few incredibly long seconds before Michael remembered his role as the sort of guide for Dexter and mustered up his courage and managed to say in his sweet soprano voice \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael got back a meek \"Hi\" as Dexter nervously moved his eyes around trying not to make eye contact with Michael in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well</i> Michael thought sighing to himself <i>we're off to a great start</i></span></div></div>",

Seemingly wanting to make a good impression, Dexter ran up and opened the passenger seat to the car for Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm are you planning on driving my car?\"  Michael asked genuinely befuddled at what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.  Of course not.\"  Dexter said shutting the door, but in an attempt to save face ran around to the drivers side and opened the door again so the lady could get in first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" was all Michael could think to say to Dexter.  As Dexter got in the passenger seat Michael just sat there thinking to himself, <i>what is he doing?  He has no idea how to act.  How am I supposed to help him out when he's in such a sorry state right now.</i>  Pulling out of the driveway and driving to the restaurant Miranda had booked for the date Michael kept trying to think of some sort of game-plan he could establish to make sure at the end of the date Dexter would be comfortable enough to date again, hell comfortable enough to be social at all, but Michael couldn't come up with anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Michael pulled up to the restaurant Michael was beginning to think it was hopeless and was just hoping the date didn't turn into an all out disaster that would scar Dexter for life.  As Michael shifted into park Dexter nervously jumped out of the car like a bullet and ran all the way around to the other side and opened the door for Michael for a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you don't have to do that every single time?\" Michael said a tad bit exasperatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.\" Dexter said looking like Michael had just burst his bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's getting better and better</i> Michael thought mentally slapping himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the two had gotten seated in the restaurant, Dexter was completely deflated and Michael was, if possible, more uncomfortable looking than Dexter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could this get any worse?</i> Michael thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

Neither could look at the other for more than a second before embarrassingly turning away.  The two just sat there drinking water and occasionally taking a bite of bread in complete and utter silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is ridiculous!</i> Michael thought getting driven a bit crazy by the silence. <i>I've switched genders, shopped for prom dresses, and found out my girlfriend is dating another boy and I managed to get through it.  But THIS is what's going to beat me?</i> Taking a deep breath and going into the depth of his knowledge of things they may have in common and came up with something just crazy enough to work. <i>Time for a hail Mary.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his bread down and looking Dexter dead in the eyes Michael said, \"Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter did a double take as though stunned his date was talking to him, \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle?\" Michael asked again thinking more and more this idea was stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsolutely stunned that a girl was asking him, and not just any girl, a gorgeous girl like Michael, about Pokemon seemed to have sparked something in Dexter.  Finally making solid eye contact with Michael, Dexter started talking about the different beneficial and detrimental qualities of each one.  For the remainder of the dinner and continuing with desert the two found a common interest in the world of an old game boy game from 15 years ago.  Although Michael had lost his interest in things like sports and video games to Heather days before, he still remembered enough about the games to fake it.  Michael was proud of what was happening, Dexter wasn't fumbling over his words anymore and had a sparkle in his eyes that Michael knew could earn him a date with a girl, well maybe if Dexter got a makeover.  By the time the check came Dexter stopped Michael from paying half, Michael felt really good about what he did here today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Michael.\"  Dexter said with a jump in his step on his way to the car.  \"I had a great time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, you're such a fun guy.\" Michael said fairly genuinely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was wondering, would you like to go out tomorrow night?  We can go see a movie.  I'll pay for the tickets and popcorn.\" Dexter said excitedly<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Tomorrow?\" Michael said remembering he had to play poker with his friends tomorrow to set a few things right, \"Sorry, I can't.  I already have plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Dexter said, his spark suddenly snuffed out. \"Of-of coarse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no,\" Michael said quickly, afraid he'd just undone all the good the date had done.  \"I really do have plans for my family game night, but I'd love to go out with you again Monday or Tuesday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter said sadly, \"You don't have to lie to make me feel better, I know the only reason you went out with me was as a favor to my aunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I did not!\" Michael said panicking a bit considering he had nailed it exactly, \"When Miranda told me about you, I made the decision to go out with you.  Me.  Not Miranda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what was it she sold you on, was it the glasses?  Was it the pocket protector?  I know no girl, especially one looking like you, would go out with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep up all this self pity I sure won't\" Michael said deciding to take a more forceful approach.  \"She told me you were a nice and funny but misunderstood guy who just needed a chance to shine.  And tonight you met that description.  Although she didn't tell me you were winy, self pitying, selfish snot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter looked like he'd been slapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael continued, \"Now, I had a good time tonight, and I think you had a good time.  I think that merits another date, so you will take me to a movie on Monday night, you will pick the show, and you will pay for the tickets, although I insist on paying for the popcorn and soda, which we will share.  Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter still looked dumbstruck but managed too meekly say, \"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now let's get into the car and head back to your aunt's.  We don't want to worry her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two of you went back to Miranda's, Michael even let Dexter open the car door for him when they got back, they both walked to the porch and stood there awkwardly one last time before Dexter said, \"So, I'll pick you up here on Monday at about 6?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you have a car by then?\" Michael said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter, for the first time all night laughed.  \"Oh yeah, so I guess you'll pick me up here at 6 then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a date.\" Michael said nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, isn't it.\" Dexter said biking away, smiling wide realizing the for the first time he'd asked a girl out.  And she'd said yes.</span></div></div>",

Miranda already stood at the door and was eager to hear how the date went. \"You really won't give me any time to come in, will you?\", asked Michael looking into Miranda's excited and curious face. She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine.\", Michael sighed and laughed. \"Let's sit down, then I tell you everything.\". Both went to the kitchen where they took seat at the kitchen table. \"So, we both went out. Dexter was very nervous and was kinda...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and then we both arranged a date for monday.\", Michael finished quite a while later. He just hoped that Miranda did not ask why the family had a game night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you had quite fun.\", smiled Miranda. \"And it's good to hear that he was getting a bit more confident. I swear, the boy was too afraid to talk to his shadow.\". Both laughed. \"Yeah, I noticed.\", replied Michael. \"But he's nice. Let's just hope this new confidence stays when we swap back.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We have no idea what swapping back will do.\", agreed Miranda. \"But if it works like I think, then he may not remember going out with you but he'll keep his new found confidence.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael pushed a strand of his long hair behind his ear. \"Yeah, it would be a shame if not.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After going out with him, I feel kinda bad for how I treated him at school. But this was a different life... I guess mom probably treats him now like I did.\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are you enjoying your new life, besides the obvious backdrafts of course?\", asked Miranda suddenly. Michael had made quite a sad face while thinking of how he treated Dexter but Miranda thought that it was because Michael thought that Dexter might turn back to who he was before the date. Therefore Miranda tried to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\", Michael began. \"It's kinda nice, you know? I have a much better relationship with my mother, now that she thinks that she has two daughters. It's also interesting to have Heather's interests. I was really amazed at how much fun I had shopping.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smiled. \"It's good to hear that not everything's bad. I have to say, I enjoy your muscle tone. Picking things up and everything has gotten much easier. You should worry, maybe I'll keep that.\". Again both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look at the time.\", Michael said surprised when he suddenly looked at the clock while laughing. \"I better get home. Anna is not really pleased if I get home too late, even though it's date night.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda laughed. \"Yeah, you're sister really has the pants on, right? Well then, hurry.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael said goodbye to Miranda and drove home.</span></div></div>",

Michael also had the added responsibility of making the nice hearty sausage and bacon filled breakfast for his father and cut up fruit bowl for Himself, Cindy, and Anna.   After getting that ready Michael went back to his room and got out of his revealing robe and got dressed in his Sunday best.  Although for Michael every other time this had meant a pair of khakis and a shirt with buttons on it.  Today Michael knew that he was expected to get dolled up and wear a matching dress with his mother and sister.  With Anna in charge the three went wearing some nice flowery purple attires.  Michael couldn't help but notice that his dress was by far the shortest and lowest cut.  <i>The body hair switch is SO not enough payback for Tiffany for the wardrobe</i> Michael thought to himself blushing catching a glimpse of himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe service was very nice, although when the preacher started talking about the virtues of sharing, Michael, Cindy, and Anna all let out some audible giggles that got a few nasty stares.  The family went on to have a nice lunch at a nice steakhouse where the family had some nice small talk.  Michael learned that his father was going out of town for a few days after lunch which was a relief to Michael and the others as it would mean they could get through the swaps tonight without the risk of interruption or unintended interference.  About half way through the meal Michael excused himself to use the ladies room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join you.\" Michael's mother said abruptly getting up to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they entered the restroom (Michael did have to pause for a second to remind himself which bathroom to enter) Cindy checked under the stalls to make sure they were alone before saying, \"I just wanted to make sure that you were certain that tonight you were ok with me keeping your friends and school load for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've thought long and hard about it, and I'm sure mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it will make things easier on you I'd rally like to trade friends back, I shouldn't have to take so many parts of your life, it's too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I insist.  If you're going to go to school, you are going to need friends.  School will be ten times harder if you don't have Josie and the others with you.\" Michael said, not only genuinely meaning what he was saying, but also because he knew if he switched friends back it could cause consequences with his trades with his mother's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the greatest daughter in the world.\" Cindy said giving Michael a big hug.  \"I swear after we get through High school I will make sure you get to the best school you can get in, and then we'll start finding you a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, enough guy talk.  Besides, I'm dating a boy now.  You should worry about finding Anna a boy for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" Cindy said, a spring seemingly lost from her step, \"You know, tonight if you want I'm sure we can manipulate things around so that you and Melody or Phillip...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!  Enough!\"  Some elderly lady entered the room just in time to hear Michael raise his voice a bit, \"Let's drop the subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Michael, consider it dropped.\"</span></div></div>",

As soon as these changes were made Cindy was brought back to put right the last few changes.  Now in order to make sure that the changes would always take place with the intended people, for the remainder of the changes Melody, Jeremy, Michael, and Phillip were sitting out (much to Phillip's chagrin, he'd had his eyes on Michael's chest all night as Michael now embarrassingly noticed).  First up Anna won next and swapped respect back with Cindy.  Although she didn't give it up quietly claiming up and down that she ran the house very well and was going to switch back next time they played.  And for the last planned swap for the night Cindy won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right mom, switch back everything you know about sex back with Josie and then we can clean up and order a pizza.\" Michael said, eager to put up the cards so that nothing could throw a monkey wrench into his plans for the week.</span></div></div>",

After making fun of some bad infomercials, everyone eventually got up from their pizza comas and went there way after Cindy reminded everybody it was a school night.  Although she did give them a few more hours of hanging out than she usually did.  It seemed even though she had her authority back, she still wanted to have fun with her friends and didn't want to be the wet blanket.  Anna and Cindy tried to help Michael out with the considerable mess that had been left behind but Michael insisted that they let him do his job and told them to get to bed so they aren't falling asleep at school on Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning started like any other school morning. Cindy was putting together her ensemble for the day, Anna was doing the homework she'd neglected to do all weekend, and was getting out the step stool so he could reach all the ingredients for pancakes.  Just your everyday, nice, quiet morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had gotten ready and eaten, Michael dropped the girls off at school and headed home to clean up the kitchen.  It took Michael longer to clean up than it usually did the few times his mom made him do it.  When he wasn't thinking his breasts would push uncomfortably down onto tables and counters.  And he had to reach for the counters because thanks to Heather's height (or lack there of) he was constantly reaching up on his tippy toes and using step ladders and chairs to reach the center of tables and the back of counters and mirrors.  Blowing his hair out of his face for what felt like the hundredth time in the last hour Michael suddenly heard the doorbell ring.  Michael opened the door to see Tiffany there for their usual jog in a pair of Michael's old shorts and a basketball jersey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you forgot about our morning workout again.\" Tiffany said exasperatedly, \"I swear it's as if you didn't want to be the perfect little housewife for Josie.  By the way, how has life been for you so far as the fairer sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael cringed a little bit at the last part, \"Come on in a have a seat.  I'll get you a glass of juice and I'll tell you how much 'fun' I've been having.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany sat in the living room while Michael told her of his interesting weekend.  Tiffany was very good as far as the appropriate reactions.  She smiled when Michael told her about shopping with mom, was distraught when he told her about Josie and him not dating with him as a girl, and laughed her ass off when Michael got to the date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, you've had quite a busy weekend, I'm sorry to say that mine hasn't been nearly as eventful.  The only thing that's been extremely different for me was getting kissed by my husband and him complaining about my stubble much to my embarrassment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael got in a good laugh at the idea although questioned, \"Wait a minute.  How come you are still married to your husband if Josie and I aren't together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany shrugged, \"I can only guess that it's the ring.  Although now that I think about it, outside of a few kisses on the check he hasn't been very affectionate, although I'd just assumed that it had something to do with switching sex lives.  How has that worked for you by the way?  Notice anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say that I do, and considering the fact I'm dating boys at the time I must say I'm extremely thankful for that.  I guess it has to do with the whole marriage thing I guess.  But who knows, maybe if Josie and I were still together it'd still effect us.  You know what, I don't want to think about it, I'll go put on some shorts and a sports bra and we'll go for a jog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was thinking of doing something a bit different.\"  Tiffany said slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well part of being a girl is having a bit of a handicap at certain things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed.\" Michael said looking down at his current chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking that we take advantage of this chance for you and we can try a few different things this week, like maybe some golf, tennis, or even\" Tiffany reached down into her gym bag, \"some basketball.  What do you say?  You want to try it, or are you too much of a girly girl to accept?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind of liking the idea of the challenge \"You're on.  I know I can beat you in basketball, after all I'm carrying two around already\" Michael said while cheekily lift up Tiffany's former boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so going down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Michael got dressed in sports bra, a revealing tank top, and some bike shorts and the two friends left to go to the gym for a game.</span></div></div>",

HORSE?\" Michael asked as he started to stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to work out Michael, do you really think you can get a good work out playing kids games?  We're going full on one on one basketball, first to 21.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that puts me at a distinct disadvantage.\" Michael said adjusting his top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I think it might just even us out, you know I stink at basketball and you were always pretty great.  I figure that the changes will even us out a little bit, you have the skill and I have the body, let's see who wins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you're on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game started and immediately Michael took a jumper but the combined changes in height, proportions, and all around bounciness caught Michael a bit off guard and he made a complete air ball.  Tiffany wasn't doing much better a few shots in, but eventually realized her new height advantage on Michael could get her to the rim much easier than she could before and managed to get layup after layup.  After taking a 5-0 lead Michael seemed to have finally found his stroke and went on a shooting spree of his own.  After a lot of pushing, running, and shooting the game was tied up and Michael had the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a fun game.\" Tiffany said in between deep gasping breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you,\" Michael said with his sweat soaked top clinging to his chest.  It had been a long time since Michael had been this tired playing a game of basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say we make this interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My 'husband' has a big fancy dinner party on Wednesday.  Due to the changes we can't really go together and he wants me to bring a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing where this was going Michael said, \"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know that he's going to bring some little tart from his office and since I can't really nag at him about it, I may as well make him jealous by going with the hottest girl I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop you'll make me blush.\" Michael said in a moch coy way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the deal, I'll step away and I'll give you a free shot at a 3 point shot.  You miss it and you have to go with me as my arm candy.  And I mean dressed to the nines.  Completely made up and dressed up in the sexiest little thing I own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure if I did that I'd be arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at the jab Tiffany said, \"So you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, what happens if I make it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll owe you one, no favor too big or too small.  For example if down the road you want to borrow some body parts for some fun with Josie, there will be no jokes, no questions asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of this Michael had to admit in the back of his mind could be an interesting experience once this initial girly week was over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a little with certain thoughts in his mind he said, \"Fine, you're on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you couldn't resist.\" Tiffany said backing away from Michael to give him the open long shot.  \"It's all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is.\" And Michael took his shot</span></div></div>",

Miranda\u2019s nephew. She told me about this. I guess you\u2019ll have to explain why you\u2019re going out with me.\u201d.

I just do you a favor.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends then got into the changing room and Tiffany got back dressed in what was Michael\u2019s male clothing while Michael got dressed in Tiffany\u2019s female clothing. Then the two drove back to Michael\u2019s home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to Wednesday.\u201d, smiled Tiffany during the drive back. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to go with my actual husband but you\u2019re a good substitute. At least I won\u2019t have to have sex in the bathroom.\u201d.

If I get together with Dexter for real, will he be like your husband normally was? Even though he\u2019s so shy?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany shrugged her shoulders. \u201cNo idea.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Michael worked on dusting the house, his mind kept drifting to what had happened earlier with Tiffany.  Not only did he keep thinking about having to look like a sexy little thing on Tiffany's hairy arm, but he also worried about the implications with his family and Dexter.  Would they all see it how it was, him just doing a friend a favor, or would they see him as two-timing Dexter.  Should he keep the outing a secret and just say he was hanging out with someone else?  And on top of that he kept getting worried about the effects of switching sex-lives with Tiffany.  It was possible that since he wasn't married or serious with anyone in this world that the changes were completely moot and had no effect, or maybe they just had not had the chance to pop up.  A mental image of Tiffany dragging Michael into a bathroom suddenly came to mind and Michael let out an audible shudder to nobody in particular.  <i>I can not wait to change back.</i>  Michael thought to himself as he reached up to dust off a particularly high painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts like these continue to plague Michael throughout the day, and the housework did little to quell them.  At last it came time for Michael to pick up Anna and Cindy from school.  Michael welcomed the distraction.  After taking them home Michael began to prepare supper for them as he was about to go on his second date with Dexter.  Cindy tried to insist that Anna would do the cooking so she could talk to and dress up Michael for the date, but he reminded her he had all the cooking skill in the family in order to keep doing what he was doing.  He was not in the mood to talk about boys and dating with his mom right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Michael had lasagna ready in the oven for Cindy and Anna to take out and eat later and he was up in his room to get ready for his date.  After spending a good chunk of the afternoon worrying about the effect of the change on his sex life, Michael decided to dress down for this date.  Sadly thanks to Tiffany's wardrobe this was more of a challenge than he'd thought.  After rummaging through blouses, skirts, and dresses for what felt like an eternity Michael decided on a nice designer t-shirt and a pair of jeans.  Both of which hugged Michael's chest and ass closely.  And for the first time in a while Michael took notice of his package.  With all the dresses and skirts he had been wearing lately he almost had to remind himself he still had on distinctly male part of him remaining.  \"Well, as long as I have that it won't get too weird right?\" He said to himself before shaking his head and laughing at the absurdity of what he had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael drove to Miranda's and Dexter was already there talking with Miranda on the front porch waiting for him.  As soon as Miranda saw him pull up she quickly rushed back inside as to not intrude on the two.  Dexter got in Michael's car and the two drove off to the movies.  As per their agreement Dexter paid for the ticket's and picked the show while Michael paid for the large popcorn and large diet soda with two straws.  The two sat down in the theater for the blockbuster sci-fi epic.  Michael had been looking forward to seeing this for weeks, but now that his interests had changes he really had a hard time getting into the picture without nitpicking all the costumes and judging the actors and actresses.  Although Michael did notice during the big romance scene with the human and alien princess that Dexter was moving his arm closer and closer to his, but he couldn't seem to muster up the nerve to hold Michael's hands.  Michael did think as to why he was doing this whole dating thing.  It was to help Dexter get more confident, what would it hurt to hold his hand?</span></div></div>",

Although Dexter was getting nervous about possibly holding hands with his date and without noticing bent down to get a drink of soda too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple ended up banging heads and made an audible \"Ouch!\" that got some shushed from the other movie goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Dexter said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Michael said brushing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the 2 hour 50 minute epic, Dexter was pumped up and Michael was bored to tears, but both were hungry so they ended up going to a cozy little burger joint in town for small meal to go with the popcorn.  Sitting down with their burgers they started to have some small talk.  Dexter went on and on and on about the characters and the science and the universe of the movie they had just seen.  More to change the subject more than anything Michael simply said to Dexter, \"So I understand you go to school with my sister and mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do?  Oh, well who are they, I might know them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy and Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter suddenly choked on his burger.  After Michael gave some quick and hard pats on the back Dexter regained his composure.  \"Anna is your <u>sister</u>?\" Dexter said with a panic in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she is, do you know her?\" Michael said kind of freaked out by the way Dexter had reacted to hearing that Anna was his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know her?

His date had just confessed to him that he liked Anna.  After a moment of shock at actually hearing this straight from his mouth Michael felt a sense of relief.  <i>Well, at least I don't think I have to worry about the sex life swap with Tiffany kicking in with Dexter.</i>  Michael thought to himself before finally breaking the awkward silence by saying, \"That's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was obviously not the response Dexter had been expecting.  \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be perfect for my sister!  It seems like every boyfriend she has ever brought home has been a snob, or a jerk, or an all around ass.  You're such a good guy, I think you two would make a cute couple.\" Michael started saying, genuinely happy that his sister could have a boyfriend who he didn't despise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, wait just a second,\" Dexter said trying to put words together, \"I just said that I like your sister.  And you are happy about this?  Your feelings aren't hurt?  You're not mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Michael said suddenly realizing how weird this must be coming off, \"You see I like you, but I don't 'like you' like you.\"  Michael said trying to say something that he thought a girl would say to a guy.  \"And besides,\" Michael said deciding to put the pressure back on Dexter,  \"you just admitted to your date that you like my sister and now I'm going to help set you up with her.  If you'd prefer I can slap you, throw water in your face, and then go cry to my sister and mother about how you hurt my feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok fine, I'm sorry for looking a gift horse in the mouth.\" To which Michael raised his eyebrows, \"Ok maybe not the best expression to use describing a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you realized it, just last week you wouldn't have realized that I could have been offended by that, I'm not by the way.  Here's what I have in mind.  I know that my sister would go out with you, you just have to...\" Michael tried to think of a nice way to put it, \"dress you up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I love my sister and all, but she can be a little superficial when it comes to boys.  And you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are ugly.\" Dexter said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononono absolutely not.\" Michael said, \"There you go with the lack of confidence, that's a huge part of it.  Starting tomorrow after school I am going to everything I can think of to help make you confident so my sister might go out with you.\" Then added after a pause, \"A new wardrobe won't hurt either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his face still red, although more with the red hot excitement he felt as opposed to embarrassment, Dexter said practically bursting at the seams, \"You're on!  Oh but it can't be tomorrow I'm busy, how about Wednesday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm uh busy.\" Michael said thinking of his dinner party with Tiffany, \"Thursday?\" Michael said hopefully knowing he was planning to turn back to a guy on Friday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Dexter said, already looking like he was sitting up a bit straighter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tuesday passed like a blur and before Michael knew it, it was already Wednesday. The day Michael had feared. Tiffany did not help in that matter. She had come over on Tuesday and showed Michael what dress she had in mind he should be wearing. It was not something he was looking forward to wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael already learned that Tiffany\u2019s clothes did not have much cloth so to speak. Some of her skirts could have been called belt. Michael was sure some of her belts were skirts. The dress went into that kind of direction. It was red and did not show the cleavage that much like others of Tiffany\u2019s dresses did because it was an one shoulder strap dress. But it hugged very closely to Michael\u2019s body which emphasized his breasts. Also it made wearing a bra nearly impossible, Tiffany made that clear, which meant he would have to go bra less. The tightness also made it quite obvious that Michael still had a male package. The dress was not very long. It ended at the exact same position the aforementioned \u201cbelts\u201d of Tiffany ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at the dress and sighed. Tiffany had a look in her eyes which made it impossible for him to say \u201cNo.\u201d. He brushed with his manicured fingers over the dress. \u201cWho would buy such a tight and short dress anyway?\u201d, he sighed and looked down where he positioned the 4-inch pumps which were in a matching red. \u201cNow I feel really lucky for having Heather\u2019s interests. It makes me more comfortable to wear such a dress and looking good. Although not comfortable enough.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy then left his room, the knee-length skirt he was wearing swished along his legs. \u201cAnyways.\u201d, he thought. \u201cI should do my chores first, then I have to do my nails and my hair. A girl really has a lot prepare before going to a date.\u201d, he continued and chuckled. It was still strange for him to think of himself as a girl although he was a girl for 5 days now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had prepared some food for his family, cleaned everything that needed to be cleaned and got Anna and his mother back from school he could finally began pampering himself. Luckily, Tiffany had suggested a break from their morning jog because he had to prepare himself. That way he had enough time to do all his chores before getting the girls from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are you going tonight?\u201d, asked Anna curiously. She had noticed that her brother was busy preparing himself and also doing all of his chores as soon as he could. \u201cAnother date?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at her while he stopped the car in front of the house. He was not really sure what to say. He had hoped that nobody would ask. The dress he, or more specifically Tiffany, had picked out, was kept a secret from his family so far. He wanted to get it into the car and then dress at Tiffany\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh you know. The girls and I wanted to go into that new girls flick.\u201d, he lied and hoped that Anna would believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. \u201c, she answered and did not ask any further. His mother was pleased as well. She was happy that her son was going out a lot while keeping the house running. He should have his fun after all he really works hard around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then entered the house and went into his room where he put the dress inside a black bag. That way nobody could see what dress was inside. Also he could tell that it was just one dress Miranda or someone else wanted to borrow or something like that. After finishing that Michael began painting his nails so that they had a matching red. The hair he had to do at Tiffany\u2019s. Otherwise he would mess up his hair when he put the dress on.</span></div></div>",

He noticed Anna looking at him suspiciously in the living room as he made his way for the door, but thankfully she was too bothered by her homework to snoop further than she already had.  With no further events of note Michael made his way to Tiffany's home and rang the door bell which Tiffany promptly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I picked out for you.\" Tiffany said sounding disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've got it here,\" Michael said referring to his bag, \"There was just no way I was leaving my house in <b>that</b> dress.  Mom and Anna wouldn't ever let me out of the house without reading me the riot act.  If you don't mind I'm going to change in the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, you know the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael actually didn't know the way, but luckily enough found the bathroom without any problems.  \"Okay, might as well get this over with.\"  Michael said to himself in the mirror, still trying to get used to seeing an extremely attractive petite girl with the hourglass figure starring back at him.  Michael started to take off his top, but seeing him do so in the mirror was so awkward he had to turn away, although as he stripped down he did get an occasional glance of himself in the mirror and as much as he tried to get the thoughts out of his head, the images he was seeing were incredibly hot.  After removing his bra, leaving him in just a pair of red panties (Tiffany had told him to put on a thong, but there were lines Michael had no desire to cross) Michael picked up the dress and held it in front of him to get a little preview in front of the mirror.  \"I can't believe I'm doing this,\"  Michael said to himself.  Holding it in front of him, the dress looked like there was no way it would cover him up.  Then Michael looked at his crotch region and saw that he was noticeably turning himself on.  Fueled by pure embarrassment and shame Michael switched his attention solely on putting on the dress.  Knowing that he had to pay up on his bet Michael held open the dress and stepped into it.  It took just a minute of shimmying around, but Michael finally managed to pull the dress over his significantly sized bum and chest, although he had to spend another few minutes trying to adjust the fabric so that it covered as much of his private parts as possibly so he wouldn't get arrested in public.  Finally satisfied with his progress, he tried to reach the zipper in the back, however he wasn't able to maneuver around comfortably enough to get to it, and was afraid he'd end up ripping what little dress there was and leave him in a pickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he was going to need some help to zip up this dress Michael unlocked the door and called out, \"Hey, can please zip me up?\"  A few seconds later _______ answered his call.</span></div></div>",

Michael looked into the mirror in front of him and was surprised to see Tiffany's husband enter the bathroom.  Tiffany's (now ex-) husband Rodger was man who had aged well.  He was a 40 year old man with a 6' 2\" frame whose jet black hair was already starting to show shades of grey, although he was lucky enough so that it made him look more distinguished as opposed to old.  Anyone who saw him would say he was a handsome and distinguished gentleman, although one would also then mock him behind his back for looking like he'd over tanned himself so much he could blend in seamlessly with a leather chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know about that sir.\" Michael said not feeling comfortable at all with letting a much old man that he hardly knew help him get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Tiffany just now started getting dressed in his room, but if you'd rather hold your dress up for the next few minutes while he get's dressed then fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think I will wait sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but please stop calling me sir, you've known me for years.  Please, call me Rodger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...Rodger.\" Michael said with his head down, still with his back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodger, rather than taking the hint he wasn't wanted, leaned up against a sink looking Michael up and down, \"So you're going out with Tiffany now right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually I'm just...\" Michael was about to explain that he was just doing this as part of a bet, but then remembered the purpose of the bet was to make Rodger jealous and quickly corrected himself, \"Actually yeah, I guess I am.  At least for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice,\" Rodger said still just standing there.  Michael was wondering if Rodger knew he was creeping him out and just didn't care.  \"So, you just had a birthday right?  You're 18 now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question really got to Michael, but he managed to keep his cool and reply simple, \"17 actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could have fooled me.\"  If he hadn't been afraid of the dress falling down Michael would have slugged him, however he just picked his head up to turn to look at Rodger and said, \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he could see Rodger, Michael could see the inappropriate grin across his face, \"Hey, it's a compliment.  I'm just saying you look like a very very beautiful young woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael could feel his hands curling up into fists, \"Well why don't you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you two doing in here?  Nothing I need to worry about right?\" Tiffany said a little loudly as she entered the bathroom and giving Rodger a playfull punch to his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing at all.\"  Rodger said heading for the door.  \"I'll leave you to help your lady prepare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael let a few seconds pass to make sure Rodger was out of hearing range.  \"How much did you hear?\" Michael asked Tiffany assuming her well timed entrance was more than coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough.\" Tiffany said meekly, \"Look I'm sorry about Rodger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot in the mood to be nice Michael said bluntly, \"Is he always such a horny jackass?\"  But seeing the look on Tiffany's face immediately tried to take it back, \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, after that you do have a right to say that.\" Tiffany said sadly, \"and yes he was.\"  A long moment of silent understanding was shared between the two friends before Tiffany said, \"Here, let me help you with that dress.  And that makeup.  Oh and that hair too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Michael said with a smile turning around to let Tiffany zip him up.</span></div></div>",

I know I\u2019m going to regret this but let\u2019s get there. Otherwise I would have put this on for nothing.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany shrugged with her shoulders. \u201cLike you wish. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d, she explained. Michael looked over to her, she was still looking on the street so they don\u2019t crash. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d, he replied and put one of his feminine hands on her leg. \u201cI\u2019ll survive it. Also I have a strong man to protect me, right?\u201d, he giggled and Tiffany had to smile as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d, she said and drove off to the party. \u201cBut I warned you. I can\u2019t promise that I can protect you the whole evening.\u201d. Michael nodded and looked down himself. He thought that he will swap back in two days. It will be strange to see himself not dressed like this anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry not to think about it.\u201d, he thought and looked out of the car and saw many different houses pass by. \u201cTry to concentrate on this event. You\u2019ll need to be concentrated. Otherwise it\u2019ll be hard to be looked at by everyone. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be the center of attention in this dress.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later the two arrived there. \u201cHere we are.\u201d, said Tiffany and killed the engine. She looked over to her date. \u201cYou sure you want to do this? We can turn back if you want.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shook his head and smiled faintly at Tiffany. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d, he tried to calm her down. \u201cI thought about it the whole drive here. I can do this.\u201d. Tiffany nodded to signalize him that she understood and got out of the car, walked around and opened the door and helped Michael out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d, smiled Michael as he took Tiffany\u2019s hand and got out of the car, his high heeled shoes clicking on the ground with each foot that touched the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked into the big house and where they were lead to a table somewhere in the back of a big hall. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to such an event.\u201d, explained Michael when Tiffany helped him sit on the table like a gentleman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany smiled when she positioned herself in front of Michael. \u201cWell, then you\u2019re lucky you have me.\u201d, she said and looked at Michael. \u201cAt least you get to see something new. Except you\u2019re different life of course.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael agreed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That sounds pretty good to me.\"  Michael said feeling very relieved that he didn't have to go out in public looking like he did.  So for the next thirty minutes the two drove around town while they waited for Rodger to leave for the party.  While they waited Tiffany went ahead and called in a carryout order for a pizza.  As they waited for the pizza they had a ball singing a bunch of pop songs and ballads in the car, Michael and Tiffany were getting a real kick out of Michael trying to sing with his new soprano voice.  Finally the two pulled up to the pizza place and Tiffany pulled out what used to be Michael's wallet and handed Michael a 20 dollar bill.  Michael just stared at the money for a moment before realizing what Tiffany was implying.  \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\"  Tiffany said reaching over to unbuckle Michael's seat belt and practically pushed Michael out of the car.  <i>Should have known she wasn't going to let me out of this so easily.</i>  Michael thought to himself as he laughed at his situation and walked into the pizza place.  It wasn't a big name place, in fact the only people in there was one 19 year old guy at the counter and a family of four at a table.  \"Two medium pizza's for Tiffany,\"  Michael said to the stoner looking employee.  \"Whoa, I mean, yes mam,\" he replied as he stumbled back (eyes still on Michael) tripping over his own feet as he got the pizzas.  \"That'll be $20, would you like to add an order of bread sticks for just 75 cents more?\"  The pizza guy said putting the pizzas down in from of Michael.  \"Um, sure.\"  Michael said as he anxiously started digging in his purse for some change, but in his hurry to get the change and get out of there, he dropped a quarter and it rolled behind him.  \"Shoot,\" Michael muttered as he instinctively just turned around and bent down to grab the quarter and put it back on the counter for the boy.  \"You know what, you can have the bread sticks on the house.\"  Michael heard the worker say.  Confused Michael simply said \"Thanks,\" and looked at the boy and saw the his face was now a deep maroon color.  Realize the show he just gave the boy, Michael nervously tried to pull his dress down a little bit to (not very successfully) cover himself up a little better, grabbed the pizza, and awkwardly said \"Thanks,\" again and left the shop quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany noticed Michael blushing and tried to get him to tell her what happened but Michael decided he didn't want to give her the satisfaction.  So the two drove back to Tiffany's place and sat together on the couch and turned on a Lifetime movie.  Normally the only reason Michael would watch something like this would be ironically to make fun of the writing or acting, but with his new interests he not only found himself enjoying the movie from that perspective but also found himself invested in the story.  It was the typical story of the mousy looking girl who had some close friends who decided to give her a makeover and at the end she gets the guy (the one good guy in the movie, every other man of coarse was an evil abusive pig).  At the end of the movie Tiffany took a bite of pizza and asked Michael, \"Aren't you planning on trying to do something like that with Dexter tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know it sounds silly, but he needs some confidence, I know I'm helping him with that now, but I really think that if I do something to change him just a little bit, there will be a better chance it sticks when I change back to a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll work with that logic, but if I may make a suggestion, don't go too far.  Just maybe go with a few shirts, or some new shoes, or maybe a facial, a mani-pedi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys don't get manicures and pedicures.\"  Michael said mocking the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't knock it til you try it.\"  All of the sudden Tiffany's eyes lit up, \"Hey Michael...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Michael said putting his foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, maybe next time you do a swap with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Michael simply said, \"Whatever.\"  Normally he would be worried about what Tiffany had planned for him in the future, but his mind had gone back to Dexter.  He started to think Tiffany might be right about not changing too much about Dexter.  He really wanted to set Dexter up with Anna and he knew there was no way that Anna would be seen in public the way Dexter was now, at least at until she got to know him.  He needed to do something simple to get Dexter's confidence up tomorrow, but what should that be.</span></div></div>",

Michael put a rush on doing all of his chores and as soon as the school bell rang he was outside of the school waiting on his unsuspecting prey.  As soon as he saw Dexter going for the bike rack, Michael yelled out \"Get in!\" and the confused boy followed orders without question.  Michael drove along to the mall while blasting some 80's bubble gum pop music to pump himself and Dexter up for what they were about to do.  Normally Michael detested this kind of music and the idea of shopping for clothes in general, but Heather's interests had seemed to put a real spark in him, not only was he excited to help Dexter become more self confident, but he really was looking forward to upgrading Dexter's wardrobe (and maybe a thing or two for himself while he was at it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours Michael made Dexter try on what felt like a hundred different outfit combinations trying to find the perfect look.  They went through just about every look imaginable on the nerdy boy's frame including the yuppy, gothic, and jock looks before finally they found something.  \"Perfect.\"  Michael said happily observing his masterpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter had emerged from the dressing room wearing some tight jeans, a t-shirt that was making a video game reference, and a worn looking tan sports coat that went along with his glasses.  \"But I still look like a nerd.  I thought we were here to change my look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No the goal was to upgrade it.  You had a look that worked with you before, it just needed to be fine tuned so that not only you liked it, but others would like it too.  Do you not like it?  I tried to go with something you looked like you might wear in everyday life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Really I do love the look.  It's just...is it really that different from what I normally wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, the whole ensemble works much better that what you had thrown together before, in fact after we're done shopping here, I'm going to raid your closet and we're going to find some good looks to mix and match.  The girls, and hopefully my sister in particular, won't be able to keep their hands off of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds real great.  Let's head back to my place and we'll do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no.  There's still light in the sky, we still have a whole lot more shopping to do.\"  Michael said as he grabbed some more cloths and pushed Dexter into the changing room as Dexter groaned.  <i>Trust me Dexter, it's for your own good.  I swear I'm going to help Anna like you but you've got to let me and as shallow as this may seem, this will help.</i>  Michael thought to himself as he went back to the clothing racks and picked up a few more things.</span></div></div>",

Sitting there while Dexter told him about his day and how he was worried about Anna, Michael zoned out and just admired his own handiwork.  Just a week about there was no way in hell that Dexter would have ever had this casual a conversation with anyone, let alone a (currently) gorgeous girl.  But Michael remembered that this might only be temporary.  When he changed back to his normal male self the next day Michael had no idea if this burst of confidence would stick.  Thinking on the subject and still not really listening to what Dexter was saying Michael straight up said, \"I think it's time you hang out with my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter had unfortunately been taking a gulp of water at the time and did a full on spit take.  \"But wait, no.  I'm not ready!  I can't face Anna like this.  I'll screw everything up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the water off of his face and breasts Michael said, \"I'm sorry but there are no guarantees we'll be able to set it up after tomorrow.  So you are going to come by and play poker with my sister, mother, and maybe a few others.  It's a good introduction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't it be weird if they think I'm dating you and all of the sudden you're trying to set me up with your sister?\"  Dexter said raising what would be a good point if Michael really was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will all be worked out by Saturday.\"  <i>I hope</i>  Michael thought to himself, \"Just trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll call you Saturday morning and give you time to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...and if I don't want to do it?\"  Dexter said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\"  Michael decided it was time to force Dexter's hand, for his own good, \"if you don't go I won't talk to you again.  If you want to try to date Anna you are completely on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter looked shocked at Michael's unusually harsh words, but just hung his head and said, \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael felt really bad about what he had said but he really thought it was going to be the best for Dexter.  The phone call was needed more for Michael than Dexter.  Because after Michael played poker with his mom's friends Friday night and hopefully returned to being male, that phone call would really help Michael find out how things had been affected by this last week for Dexter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  It will all be worth it.\"  Michael said hoping what he was saying turned out to be true.  After all, before he would know it, Friday would be there.</span></div></div>",

A spring that caused his large breasts to bounce up and down a whole lot but Michael didn't care, heck he enjoyed it because after tonight they would be gone and back on Tiffany's chest.  Michael dropped Anna and Cindy off at school today and happened to see Jeremy and Josie greet them.  Days before Michael had just been depressed at this sight, but now it just made him motivated to do the housework as soon as possible so he could go to Miranda's for the poker game so he could get Josie (and a few other parts) back.  Every minute felt like an hour as Michael went about his day.  He kept cleaning the same spots over and over again as if trying to force the day to move quicker.  It felt like an eternity but finally school ended and Michael picked up Anna and Cindy but as they told him about their days Michael just nodded as he kept thinking he was one step closer to having most of his life back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening after Michael made a pasta dish for the family, Heather and the other girls came to Michael's door to pick him up for the get together.  Michael practically sprinted out the door into Heather's new mini-van.  \"Alright, let's head to Miranda's and start up the game,\"  Michael said excitedly rubbing his hands together in anticipation.  Heather simply turned around from the drivers seat and said, \"What's the rush, we have plenty of time to have our usual dinner before the game.  No need to change the routine just because a few things are different.\"  Michael was ready to complain but all of his mom's friends, well his friends really, seemed perfectly content torturing Michael just a little bit longer.  \"Fine.\"  Michael said knowing he was beaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night at a nice hole in the wall Italian joint everyone told each other about what they did over the last week.  Miranda was absolutely raving about how much she enjoyed her new-found muscles and how it helped her out so much at her business.  \"It's nice being both the manager and the grunt work,\"  she'd said.  Amanda talked about how nice it was that she only had to spend a minute washing her hair now and if it wasn't so much of a faux paux she'd chop her hair off in a heartbeat.  Heather meanwhile talked about how much she liked not having to wear makeup for a week and how much she enjoyed being taller than her husband.  Tiffany meanwhile just said that she loved not having to deal with her husband being as grabby as normal, \"And while I miss my clothes, oh so very much.  I must say they look smashing on you Michael.\"  Michael just laughed and drank his wine at this.  Since it was his last night in this form he decided to sort of go out on top and picked out one of Tiffany's shorter dresses that gave a nice view of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subject never went to how Michael's week as Miranda and Tiffany warned Amanda and Heather not to bring it up.  Details weren't given but Amanda and Heather were good enough friends not to pry.  Finally the meal was finished and the five friends went to Miranda's for a game.  They all agreed that they should do it one at a time to make things less confusing so after Michael delt out the cards everyone folded but Amanda and soon she was back to normal.  Next up was Heather and then Miranda.  Finally it was Tiffany's turn.  As she laid down her first hand and switched her gender back she said, \"You know, it's a shame you never got to use my sex life as you would have liked to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\"  Michael said, in the midst of all the things that had gone wrong for him in the last week, as much as it shamed him a little to admit it, he really would have liked to try Tiffany's sex life out with Josie for a while.  \"You know, I don't have to switch that part back, I can give you another week with it, but this time you'd be the right gender and you'd have your girlfriend.  Besides, you deserve a bit of a reward for what you went through this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say I do.\"  Michael said glumbly, but knowing Tiffany he found himself asking, \"But what's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany smiled at Michael and said, </span></div></div>",

No, there is nothing she would gain with this. I should stop being so paranoid. Mom's friends are nothing like my original friends...

Michael couldn't help but notice that he was the central piece of just about every swap the ladies mentioned wanting to either get weight off of their chest, wanted to try being taller or stronger, and a bunch of other things the alcohol had already started to blur from Michael's memory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful not to wake up anyone up Michael carefully opened up his door and slid into his room.  Normally he only opened up the door a few inches, but he had to open the squeaky door much more than he'd have liked to mainly due to having to avoid squashing his breasts in the doorway.  As soon as Michael shut the door he let out a little sigh of relief glad that he wasn't getting in trouble with Anna or his mom for getting drunk again.  But before he could turn around and fall into his bed he felt a pair of hands grab his breasts and start massaging them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie!\"  Michael said as he turned to face his assaulter/girlfriend and was kissed long and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy that he had his girlfriend back, Michael returned the kiss with much fervor, going so far as to lift her up pressing each others considerable chests against each other, and carried her over to his bed.

I know that mom and Anna volunteered to do it today but I'm just in the mood.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael tiptoed out of his room, after throwing a skimpy nightgown and a bathrobe over it, and down to the kitchen. The sun was just beginning to rise when he began making coffee and breakfast. Michael thought about last night at first but over the course of the procedure, he began thinking about other things such as. And he began thinking about the coming night and Dexter. \"I wonder if anything changed or if he just accepted my help in order to get Anna?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when his mom entered the kitchen. \"Oh, you're already awake. You didn't have to do breakfast.\", she said suprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael turned around and smiled at his mother. \"Ah, don't worry. I was just in the mood.\". She nodded to show that she accepted his answer and sat down at the kitchen table and watched him doing his work. \"You know, you really seem to flourish in this job. I really think we should keep this swap.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael stopped for a second and looked at his mother with a stern look. \"Mom!\", he exclaimed. \"We had a deal. We swap back from time to time, so I could go to school and you could go to college next year.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom sighed. \"I know, I know. It's just that you look so happy with you're current job and I feel much better with going back to school and all.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I still don't like it if we stay like this forever.\", said Michael and with that the conversation was at an end. \"Oh, by the way. I invited Dexter, Miranda's nephew, over to play cards with us tonight. I know, I know, I shouldn't tell everyone about the cards BUT he has a crush on Anna.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother looked surprised at him. \"Really? Our Anna?\", she asked surprised. \"But I guess this crush is one-sided and you want to hook him up with her.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded. \"Yeah, he's shy. I don't know if he will even have enough courage to show up tonight. I gave him time to think about it until this morning. I'll call him soon to tell him when we'll play.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\", smiled his mother. \"You know, that's really nice of you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know me.\", replied Michael and resumed his task of making breakfast. When he was finished, there was still only his mom in the kitchen. Michael hurriedly grabbed the phone and called Dexter. He wanted to invite him without Anna finding out about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\", answered a well-known voice from the otherside of the phone. \"Dexter?\", asked Michael. \"It's me, Michael.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Michael. I guess you're phoning because of tonight, right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least, that stayed the same. I guess I still helped him becoming more attractive for my sister.\", thought Michael and then answered the question: \"Yes, that's right. So, how's your answer? You're coming?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought about it all the time and I think that it's not a good idea. I really appreciate that you helped me the last couple of days but I just think I can't do this.\", explained Dexter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shook his head but Dexter obviously could not see it. \"No, Dexter.\", he said stern. \"You have to come. Trust me. All will be fine! Don't be such a coward. Sometimes you have to jump over your own shadow, you know?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few moments of silence and Michael already thought that Dexter had put the phone away. But then suddenly, he heard a sigh and Dexter's voice coming right after it shortly. \"Okay, I'll come... I guess. I just hope it really works out as you say...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Dexter, just trust me.\". With that Michael hang up, just in time. Anna entered the kitchen just when he put the phone down from his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning...\", she said and yawned deeply. \"Michael, I thought we agreed that mom and I make breakfast today.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said that he was just in eht mood.\", explained his mom smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded. \"Since you're already up, make yourself useful and wake Josie and dad up.\", he told Anna who obeyed very easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me or did the last week change her slightly?\", asked Michael his mother who just shrugged her shoulder.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day went by rather uneventful, except that Michael had more sex during this day than he had in months. It seemed as if Josie was in a condition of being permanently horny. Michael had real trouble finishing all of his chores around the house, while Josie was groping his chest every time she could. When ever they had finished he could get up and continue what he had been doing so far and not even five minutes later she was bugging him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already evening when he had finally finished all the housework. \"I needed much longer than usual...\", he thought. Over the course of the week it became natural for him to think of the work his mom usually did as his own and he was proud of it. The house really looked good now and that just in time. Jeremy and Melody were already at the door, eager to play cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Michael.\", smiled Jeremy when he saw his best friend standing there in the door and letting them in. \"I see you really do a good job keeping the house clean.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael grinned. \"Yeah, I do my best. And I see you two want to play very badly.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\", agreed Jeremy while Melody found her way to the living room. \"It was frightening when we played the game first, I mean I lived the life of my own sister for a whole week! But now I came to the conclusion that this can be really exciting. Even though I hated to wear the skirts, I kinda liked going back to middle school.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what you mean.\", mumbled Michael and followed Jeremy to the living room but stopped when he heard the door bell again. \"I guess this must be Philipp...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, his boobs juggling slightly, and went to the door where he found the exact person he had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're here to play?\", asked Michael and tried to sound annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can read me like a book.\", grinned Philipp and entered the house without giving Michael's breast a second glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he does not find me attractive now that I'm back to being a guy.\", Michael concluded in his mind and went back to the living room where his mother and sister were already taking seats beside the other three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good we can start now.\", said Anna and grabbed the cards but Michael stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I er... invited someone to play with us.\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did what?\", replied Anna astonished. \"You didn't invite one of mom's friends, did you? If you invited this flat-chested Tiffany then I'm gonna scream! I mean she would just want to swap my breasts.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there we thought that Anna had become nicer...\", thought Michael and then began to speak to her in order to make her calm down. \"No, don't worry. It's none of mom's friends. I swear.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo proof that he was telling the truth, the doorbell rang and signaled that the eigth player had arrived. Michael quickly got to the door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dexter.\", smiled Michael and shoved him in. \"I'm glad you came.\". Before Dexter could answer something, he was shoved to the living room by Michael. \"Guys, this is the one I invited. I guess you all know Dexter.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael could see the surprise in their eyes but no one dared to speak, so Michael decided to explain something. \"You see, he's Miranda's nephew and I just thought we might befriend with him.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately noticed that Anna was wanting to give him some grunty answer but Michael silenced her with an evil glare. \"So, let's all be nice and have fun.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael positioned Dexter right in front of Anna and then sat down himself. \"I guess you know the rules of poker?\", he asked Dexter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Kind of.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\", smiled Michael. \"This is played normally but when you win you can trade a trait with one of the losers. Only exception is when you win with a joker on your hand. Then you have to trade a trait between two losers. And yes, I know how crazy this sounds but trust me it works.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter simply nodded, too terrified to say something. He was still a shy nerd but maybe this would change.</span></div></div>",

She grinned trimphantly and looked across the people she was playing with. She looked at Dexter for a very short amount of time and made it clear that she did not like him. Something Michael wanted to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna then locked her eyes on Josie. \"You know, I had been thinking about dyeing my hair but since I'm not really interested in something else so far, I guess I'll take your hair colour, Josie. I want to swap hair colours with Josie.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's hair began to change colour, beginning at her head and slowly crawling to the end of her hair, turning her hair red, while Josie's hair did the opposite. Anna grabbed her new red hair and dragged a strand to her eyes so she could admire her hair colour. \"I think this colour suits me.\", she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud noise could be heard. Everyone instantly turned around to where the noise came from. They saw Dexter standing at the table, his chair had fallen down, his eyes were opened wide and his face had changed to a horrified version of itself. \"This... This is impossible!\", he mumbled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I toldya.\", answered Michael. \"It works. Like I said, hard to believe but it's true.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and... It works with everything?\", Dexter asked, his face still displaying the shock he has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, everything. Now sit down.\", grunted Anna in her usual manner. Michael could not help but to think that she disliked Dexter to the fullest. Or maybe there was something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter, slowly claming down, took his chair and put it so he could sit down again. He did not say another word and Michael was worried that he might collapse or something. Maybe it was not a good idea to bring this shy boy to the game night after all. But if he might collapse or something he did not show any signs. Maybe Michael was just too worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and... Won't people notice?\", he asked and looked up to Michael, the only person he was comfortable talking to in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shook his head and began to answer the question. \"Nope, don't worry. Nobody will notice. For everyone and everything who is not playing here with us, everything is normal. For the world, Josie was always blond. If you check any photos, no matter when they were taken, you will see her with blond hair.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, can we continue now?\", asked Philipp unpatiently. After all the time they now knew of the cards, he was still a pevert and still had the same motives that he had when they first played. \"He'll never change.\", thought Josie, brushing a strand of her now blond hair out of his face. She then took the deck and dealt the next hand.</span></div></div>",

Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was refering to the first time they had played. She refused to choose and lost her boyfriend. And Jeremy argued with her which resulted in him swapping lives with his sister. Both occasions were not pleasant for the two and could have been prevented rather easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But...\", continued Dexter stummering. \"I have no idea what to swap! I- I don't want anyone to get angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\", replied Cindy with a warm, motherly smile. \"We all agreed that we would not get angry, no matter the swap.

He tried to come up withe something he would want but although Cindy explained that he should not worry about the others so much but he was still to afraid for any swap no matter how small it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he did not have to worry about it anymore. The time frame had closed and the cards began to choose for Dexter. He felt a tingling sensation and figured he had swapped something physical.

Because Cindy won with a joker on her hand she was not allowed to swap something between her. She had to swap something between someone else and because she did not say anything, the cards decided.

If a swap occured it had to be done between his mother and someone else but not between him and Josie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be?

She feared that it might be impossible to swap back completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you please let me read?\", said Michael slightly annoyed. \"Ah, here it is. It seems that if someone with a joker on his or her hand wins, the person can swap something between other opponents. Well, since mom had a joker and she did not say anything, well not what she was suppossed to say, it chose for her.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that is clear. Now the question is: What had been swapped?\", said Anna. \"I doubt it was something simple as positions. Although if it was the case we have no idea what the cards define by position.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Well... Let's see...\", mumbled Michael and looked around his room. He soon found a clue of what had been swapped. \"Guys, look at this picture. It show Josie with my family.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\", grunted Philipp. \"She's your best friend. You hang out all the time!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What about Jeremy?\", thought Michael but tried to let the others not notice his thoughts. \"Yeah... But without me on the picture? I doubt it.\". Michael rushed over to his purse. He grew fond of it the last days. He got out his ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. It seems that Josie and me have swapped lives.\", explained Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\", exclaimed Josie. \"That can't be! Not now!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at her surprised. \"Why? What's so bad about it. I survived that as well.\". Melody tried to calm Josie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... But... Jeremy just asked me out... This stupid game ruins the romantic night I had in mind for tomorrow!\", explained Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... We can't do anything about that now...\", sighed Michael. \"I guess it's the best if we don't play again now, only to swap Josie's sexual experience back. Who know what cards we get.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed. \"Then... Let's continue with everything we wanted to do...\".</span></div></div>",

In the reality he knew Jeremy and Michael were best friends although the two and Josie had known each other since high school. \u201cIt\u2019s probably like this: Because I am a girl in this reality, I get along with Josie and not Jeremy.  No wonder mom thought I might have a crush on Jeremy.\u201d, thought Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least you\u2019re living the life of a girl. Who knows what might have happened if you would have swapped with me or Philipp.\u201d, continued Jeremy. Michael agreed hesitantly. \u201cYeah\u2026 That would have been strange.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway\u2026\u201d, Jeremy did most of the talking, Michael was taken away by the sudden swap he had made. This swap made swapping back to the normal, male Michael rather complicated. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope Tiffany or the others won\u2019t talk to Josie about it. If they even know that they played with her? I guess so\u2026 Man this is complicated.\u201d, thought Michael as he and Jeremy arrived Josie\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Here we are.\u201d, mumbled Jeremy. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best if I\u2019ll let you alone now.\u201d. Jeremy just wanted to go when he stopped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d, he whispered and kissed Michael on the lips. Michael\u2019s eyes went wide and he was too shocked to say anything or push Jeremy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy then went away as quickly as possible. Michael was confused why Jeremy had kissed him. Just then the door opened. Michael turned around and saw Josie\u2019s younger brother and her older sister standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, he really loves you.\u201d, grinned her little brother, Jake. He was 11 years old, 4\u201d8\u2019 tall and had curly orange hair. Her sister Mary was 5\u201d8\u2019, 19 years old and had long brown hair. \u201cYeah, he does.\u201d, she grinned. \u201cCome in, Michael. You\u2019ve got to tell me everything!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you already?\u201d, wondered Michael. Josie probably told her everything, she was together with Jeremy for two days now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you haven\u2019t. I was away over the weekend. You must be really confused because of love.\u201d, explained Mary and dragged Michael inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Michael knew what had happened he was sitting on the couch and was questioned by Mary. He tried to answer the questions like Josie would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when will you two do\u2026 you know what?\u201d, asked Mary whispering so that Jake would not hear it. Michael was not sure what to answer but was luckily rescued by the door which opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie\u2019s mother, now Michael\u2019s, had come home. She was 5\u201d7\u2019 tall and long, shoulder-length hair, in the same colour Josie\u2019s hair is. \u201cAh, Michael. Back so soon?\u201d, she asked surprised. \u201cI thought now that you have a boyfriend you\u2019d have been away longer.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael remembered that she and Josie\u2019s father were divorced, so she was a single mother. \u201cYeah\u2026 I just thought that I shouldn\u2019t be away for too long\u2026 Tomorrow is school.\u201d, explained Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael\u2019s new mother smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s nice to hear, dear.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I think I\u2019ll go to bed now. Need my beauty sleep.\u201d, said Michael and rushed upstairs to Josie\u2019s room. He did not want to tell Josie\u2019s sister any more things.</span></div></div>",

Slowing Michael opens his eyes and sees the alarm clock reads 6 in the morning.  Michael grumbles something about \"Not now mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael!  Get up.  Now!\"  Michael hear Anna command, but his splitting headache motivated him to just roll over and bury his head into his pillow.  He just tried to keep the rest of the world out until he felt a familiar pair of breasts press against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Michael, get up.  We've got a surprise for you.\"  Josie says, now this was a voice he could get up for so he sluggishly turned around and tried to give his girlfriend a kiss.  Rather than lean in and return the kiss like he'd been expecting, Josie actually pushed herself away and laughed, \"Looks like somebody's still a bit tipsy from her night out with the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you and Micheal were staring in one of her lesbian fantasies.\"  Anna said in a mocking voice to Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop teasing your sister Anna, you know she isn't a lesbian.\"  Cindy said trying to reign in Anna a little before she went too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not?\"  Michael says confused trying to take in all the facts while trying to stop the room from spinning due to hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly no.\"  Josie says, \"Although it would be nice if me and my best friend could just settle down in some small town together.  This one just loves her boyfriend way too much to do that.\"  Josie says obviously referencing Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-B-Boyfriend?!\"  Michael says suddenly snapping awake.  This was not something he'd anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See how she starts paying attention at the mere mention of a boy, she could never fall for you Josie no matter how hard you tried.\"  Cindy says with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That leans us to your surprise Michael.  We told your boy toy that you weren't feeling too great after last night and rushed over to bring you breakfast in bed.

Now don't do anything I wouldn't do.\"  Josie says with a wink as she opens the door and Michael's 'boyfriend' enters with a breakfast tray.  Before he looked to see who it was, the only thing that was running through Michael's head was, <i>Please don't be Philip please don't be Philip Oh dear God don't let it be Philip!</i></span></div></div>",

I can do it no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't have to do anything for me Jeremy.  You've already done more than enough.

I'll get out of your hair.\"  Jeremy says and he actually gives Michael a quick kiss on the lips that left Michael stunned before he left.  \"I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later.\"  Michael said as he wiped his lips.  \"Well, that wasn't exactly a pleasant surprise, but it could have been worse.\"  Michael suddenly had a mental picture of Philip pop up in his head and shuddered, \"A whole lot worse.\"  Michael said as he got back to eating as he pondered what he should do today.</span></div></div>",

As soon as I got up this I got a call from some girl from my yoga class wanting to go out sometime.  She's pretty cute so I might consider it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're married!\"  Michael said a little stunned, Tiffany simply laughed and said, \"Not this week I'm not.  It's not like I'm going to be falling in love with this chick, I'm just going to have some fun.  It's a once in a lifetime experience to try this out.  You should do it to.  Go out and have fun with this Jeremy boy.  See what life is like on the other side for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't feel comfortable about that, besides the fact that I'm straight I kind of already have a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then think about it as a scouting trip.  You go out with Jeremy and take notes on things you liked him doing and things you didn't like.  Just be his girlfriend.  It'll make you a better boyfriend to Josie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael just stared at his phone for a second, \"So you be a good boyfriend, first I need to be a good girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever consider writing for a bad fortune cookie company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyday, see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael figured that what Tiffany was saying was kind of interesting but was just silly, so he called up his other new friends from the poker game and was really surprised by the responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather thought the idea was \"Cute\" and it could be a real \"learning experience.\"<br>\r\nAmanda said it was a chance that was \"Kinky\" and \"too good to pass up.\" much to Michael's horror<br>\r\nWhile Miranda said the always comforting phrase, \"What's the worst that could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael figured that he could just avoid Jeremy for the week but with all of his friends seemingly really behind the idea, Michael figured that it might actually potentially be a good thing to do in the long run.  So after doing his chores for the day while all the time dwelling on the idea of going out with his pal Jeremy, Michael nervously got out his cell phone and texted Jeremy \"Want 2 go out?\"  to which he almost immediately responded \"sure, pick you up at 6\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope I don't regret this.</i>  Michael said as he went to his room to get himself ready for the date.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Michael received the date acceptance text from Jeremy, Michael went straight to his closet to find the perfect outfit.  Ever since the clothing swap with Tiffany and her very anything but conservative wardrobe Michael hadn't really gotten a chance to really get a good look at what he was in for.  Going into the closet Michael was thinking about how he could try to put himself together so that he didn't look like a prude but he certainly didn't want to give Jeremy the wrong impression about his intentions for the evening.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) Tiffany's wardrobe didn't give Michael a chance to go for the prudish look.  After pushing what seemed like the thousandth mini skirt to the side Michael lamented to himself, \"Does that woman own a stitch of clothing that goes below the knees?\"  But finally after putting together and trying on multiple outfits Michael finally decided on a black skirt that went a few inches above the knee and a red top that really complemented his chest.  Although, as Michael would notice, every single top really featured his sizable breasts.  <i>I could wear the baggiest sweatshirt I used to own and these things would probably still show through.</i>  Michael thought as he looked at himself in the mirror sizing himself up.  \"Something's missing.\"  Michael pondered out loud, and as he thought about it he noticed a makeup kit on the dress.  \"Oh yeah, that.  Well, here goes nothing.\"  Michael said immersing himself into putting the paints and powders on his face until he looked just right, in no small part due to the interest he had swapped with Heather that was leading him on almost instinctual.  \"Not half bad.\"  Michael said admiring his handwork.  But he only had a few moments to admire his looks before Anna barges in and blurts out, \"Your boy toy is here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already?!\"  Michael said not even bothering to combat the boy toy line.  Michael looked at the clock and was stunned he's spent over two hours getting ready for this date.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Want me to tell him you'll be ready in fifteen more minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Michael said taking a deep breath to steady himself, \"I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael went into the living room where Jeremy was waiting there in a nice t-shirt and jeans.  Michael panicked a little and had a conversation with himself. <i>Great, now I feel overdressed.  Should I run back and find something else?  What the hell am I thinking?  I hate it when girls do that.  I'll just suck it up and deal with it.  No biggie.</i>  \"Hi Jeremy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Michael.  You're looking great as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  Michael said, he couldn't help but blush.  It was nice for him to hear the look being complemented after spending so much time on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where will you be taking my little girl this evening.\"  Michael's father said with a too big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just dinner and a movie.  No big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so nice.\"  Michael's mom said trying to cut off your dad from interfering more.  Anna took the hint from your mom and also added, \"We'll see you two later.  I'll stay up late waiting for you.\"  Michael's dad seemed to like this from Anna, but as soon as Michael's parents backs were turned Anna whispered to Michael, \"No I won't have as much fun as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis.\"  Michael said not really grateful for the 'help'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks Anna.  Let's head out Michael.\"  Jeremy said grabbing Michael's arm and leading him out the door.</span></div></div>",

He was so worried about what could happen and how could he weasel his way out of too romantic a situation that he didn't even notice where Jeremy was taking him.  \"Okay, we're here.\"  Jeremy said getting out of the car.  Michael followed suit and it wasn't til he got out that he noticed something odd.  \"But we aren't at a movie theater or a restaurant.  This is the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy just smiled and said, \"I know.\"  And with that he went to the back of his car and opened it up to reveal a picnic basket, tablecloth, and a bottle of wine.  \"Where did you get that?\"  Michael asked.  \"I got it from my parents.  I told them that it was our 1 year anniversary and they were perfectly fine with me taking a bottle, so long as I don't return it completely empty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One year anniversary?\"  Michael said with a gulp.  He didn't like the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you forgot?  Oh well, it helps the surprise.  If you would follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Michael followed Jeremy to the top of a hill in the park where even Michael had to take a moment to admire how amazing (and romantic) the view of the setting sun over the town was.  \"So beautiful.\"  He was so busy looking at the beautiful colors Michael didn't notice that Jeremy had put his hands around his waist.  \"I know you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael almost gagged at how cheesy that line was, and then he remembered that he would say that sort of thing to Josie a lot.  <i>Note to self, maybe cut down on the overly cheesy romantic lines.  They aren't as sexy as you think they are.</i>  Ready to get out of Jeremy's arms Michael turned and said, \"So what did you bring to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little taken aback by the change of subject Jeremy went to the basket and said, \"I made a couple of high quality sandwiches just like you like.\"  And took out a pair of subs that looked to have been made from a nice sub shop.  Michael eagerly took the sandwich and groaned internally noticing the mayo on it.  <i>Well, maybe girl me likes mayo.  Weirder things have surely happened.</i>  And after taking a big bite Michael decided <i>Nope, most defiantly don't like mayo.  Another note to self: Nothing kills the mood quite like fixing your girlfriend the wrong meal.  I really need to start paying attention to what Josie eats.</i>  But seeing how all the effort Jeremy was putting into this Michael decided not to reveal this.  And so he ate his mayo filled sandwich all the while making mental notes like, <i>Maybe this is why girls don't tell guys everything.  She's afraid it'll kill the mood or hurt my feelings or something</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the 'couple' finished the meal, but as Jeremy made his way to scootch over, Michael stood up and said anxiously, \"So how about that movie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Jeremy seemed a little disheartened but tried not to let it show and drove the two over to not the movie theater, but his house.  \"My parents are out and Melody is spending the night with a friend so I thought we'd watch something on the big screen in the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great.\"  Michael said as he prayed Jeremy's parents or sister would come home unexpectedly.  Jeremy insisted the two settled down on the love seat and as soon as Michael sat down Jeremy started playing a mushy romance flick that Michael knew from his time of being Jeremy's friend that he actually hated watching.  But even though he didn't like Jeremy's possible intentions, he did appreciate what he was putting himself through all for the sake of his girlfriend.  Michael was planning on just trying to stay as far from Jeremy as possible but Heather's interests took over as the movie got more and more sappy and romantic.  Michael didn't even wipe away the tears as they started to form at the sadder scenes.  In fact he was so into the movie that he didn't even notice that by the end he was actually lying down on Jeremy's lap with him running his fingers through Michael's hair.  Michael considered for a moment freaking out but why should he?  Jeremy was only doing what Michael himself would do and it wasn't like he was crossing any boundaries.  In fact it actually felt nice to actually be in a position where he was the one being comforted as opposed to be the comforter as he often was with Josie.  Michael was so relaxed he was even starting to drift off to sleep where he would stay until Jeremy woke him.</span></div></div>",

Many questions ran through his head. Was the whole \"Jeremy-is-my-boyfriend\"-thing just a dream? Was he back together with Josie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael slowly opened his eyes to see that his questions had been answered. He was being kissed by Jeremy and he had to admit that he kind of liked it. Was it that Heather's interest even went so far that he now inherited the way she prefered to be kissed which would be from a boy? Or was Jeremy just such a good kisser that he could turn around even a straight man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy broke the kiss and looked right into Michael's eyes. \"Good\", he smiled. \"You're awake. I did not want to wake you up but I think I know something that we might enjoy together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\", was the first thought that ran through his head. Before Michael could react, he was still kind of sleepy and therefore slow, Jeremy had one of his hands on one of Michael's breast. The other one was just as fast and reached down under Michael's mini skirt and began carrassing his vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet moan escaped Michael's lips. Michael wanted to say something, tell him to stop him, but Jeremy kissed him again, killing every word before it could even be formed and the longer he was massaging Michael's breasts and carrassing his vagina, the more Michael got turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want this!\", he thought. \"I don't want to have sex with my best friend... But... But it feels so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Michael gave in to his feelings. The horniness he felt was getting too strong. He kissed Jeremy back with passion and before Michael even really realised what was going on, both were undressed and Jeremy was bowed above him. For a short moment Michael thought that he could stop now, that he could tell Jeremy that he is just not in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he could not. He was a slave to his feelings. He wanted to Jeremy be inside of him. He needed it right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy noticed the signals that Michael was unconsciously sending and inserted his penis into Michael's borrowed vagina. A loud moan now escaped Michael's lips and it got even louder whenever Jeremy was thrusting his penis back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael enjoyed these feeling that he had never thought possible. Soon both came. Michael was breathing heavy and he was sweating. He suddenly felt dirty. Moments ago it felt like it was the only reasonable and the only right thing to do but now he noticed how wrong all of it was. He was just being fucked by his best friend! No matter if it felt good, it was just not right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then...</span></div></div>",

After the two were done and Michael was walking up to the door he had a lot of confusing and conflicting thoughts running through his head.  He knew he was a heterosexual male who was in love with his girlfriend Josie, and he thought he was just going to pretend to be a girl for a while so he could pick up dating tips from a female perspective with his best friend Jeremy after some swapping card magic, but now he felt like Jeremy was the one he wanted, but that couldn't be right.  Could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael opened his front door and saw his sister standing there with her arms cross.  Ever since she'd swapped authority roles with their mom, she'd taken the job to heart.  \"So, where have you been.\"  Anna said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, you know, hanging out with Jeremy.\"  Michael said just hoping to make it to his room so he could go to sleep and not think about stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how many times did you 'hang out' before the quickie in his car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael winced, so she knew, \"It' just...no big deal.  And none of your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is too my business, you're my sister.  Besides, it's no secret that the two of you have been going at it like rabbits since you started dating.  I've never seen two people with sex drives like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that it hit Michael like a ton of bricks what was happening.  At the card game with his mother's friends he'd swapped sex lives with Tiffany who said she and her husband did it at least a couple times a day, and he'd swapped interests with Heather meaning he might find Jeremy attractive now and explained why he wasn't able to stop (and didn't really want to stop) when he was with Jeremy.  \"What have I gotten myself into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what you've gotten yourself into, you're grounded, I don't want you staying out late for a week.\"  Anna said ending the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael didn't feel like arguing.  He'd just realized how much he'd screwed himself over with the swaps he'd made.  When he got to his room he fell forward onto the bed, and after squashing his boobs he flipped over on his back and said, \"Well, I said I'm doing all this insanity so I can be a better boyfriend for Josie, and I'm certainly learning a few things women like.\"  Michael said with a smile this as he thought of Jeremy and the fun they'd had tonight.  \"Although I could probably learn a few things by just being a girl friend with Josie.  That'd probably be a good learning experience as well.\"  Michael said as he went to sleep dreaming of Josie and Jeremy and his weird and crazy life.</span></div></div>",

He told himself he was doing it so he could continue his research into being a better boyfriend to Josie, but a part of him acknowledged that he was just more interested in being with Jeremy right now.  Although after the previous night's scolding from Anna, Michael knew he'd have to be a little more careful and discreet.  So he'd only go out with Jeremy when he was sure nobody was looking.  A day during the school week at lunch time Jeremy would go to Michael's place, and Michael would be waiting to satisfy his hunger, food and otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just the sex life he'd swapped with Tiffany or the interests he'd gotten from Heather that kept him going out with Jeremy.  Michael really liked Jeremy because he was a good guy.  Michael had always known Jeremy was a good guy, it was one of the reasons the two had been friends all these years.  But now that Michael was essentially a woman and Jeremy's girlfriend, he realized that being a genuinely good and kind person meant so much, and was really a turn on.  You kind of figured that must be one of the reasons why Josie went out with you and why nobody would touch Phillip with a 10 foot pole even though he was an attractive guy.  <i>If...I mean, when I got back to being a guy I knew what I need to emphasize and work on for Josie.</i>  Michael thought to himself as he got himself made up for another date with Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a week passed and before he knew it, it was time for the poker game with his family and friends, and just before dealing the cards a scary and kind of exciting thought came to mind.  He'd been planning on swapping everything back except for his friends with his mom because he needed her friends in order to go back to being a guy again...but what if he didn't do that.  What if he just went and swapped everything back to normal with his friends and kept the pasted together female body he'd had built for him.  He could just live out his life as a woman.  It wouldn't be that bad, women aren't too different from men he'd found, and then there was the main selling point of this idea, he could be with Jeremy full time.  Michael started to shake the idea off telling himself that it was just Heather's female interests taking over, <i>But really would giving into those be such a bad thing?</i>  Michael thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

Michael had decided that while being a guy was great and he loved it and Josie, at this time, for this moment he feels like he loves Jeremy more.  So Michael broke the news to his mom that he wanted to swap friends back with her, and she accepted.  The plan was still in place for her to continue her schooling in Michael's place, but she'd go back to having her old friends, plus she'd make new ones at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they group played the game and the swaps to (relative) normality were made, Jeremy kiss his girlfriend and held her close and said, \"Looks like everything is back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is just the way I like it.\"  Michael replied giving her boyfriend another big kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few months everything went back to a normal.  Michael had put the cards away saying that a weekly game was just to much and the cards from now on will only be used for very very special occasions (much to the dismay of Philip).  But they were Michael's cards so they played by his laws.  Speaking of laws, since Michael now completely thought of herself as a girl, she went ahead and got her name legally changed to Michelle.  She told her family and friends that it was something she'd wanted to do, and her parents admitted they had no idea why they gave their oldest daughter such a male sounding name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle did feel a pang of guilt for essentially making it so that he'd stole parts and aspects from his mom's friends lives.  But over the next few weeks he arranged so he 'conveniently' ran into them, and they all seemed happy and all seemed to not notice that anything was different in their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd most importantly to Michelle, she had her man.  Whenever she wasn't doing housework or Jeremy wasn't at school the two were inseparable.  One day Jeremy said to Michelle as they sat on the couch with a sappy romance movie playing in the background as the two lovers looked into each others eyes, \"I'm the luckiest guy on the face of the Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\"  Michelle said giving her boyfriend a kiss, \"Well...you know what I mean.\"</span></div></div>",

As much as she loved taking care of her family, it was time to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle left home and moved in with Jeremy when he went to college.  Jeremy was a smart guy so he had enough scholarships to mostly get him through, but Michelle wanted to help.  So when she wasn't taking care of the couple's new home, she was doing part time modeling work for a small agency.  Nothing major, just a newspaper spot here, an internet ad there, a local commercial every now and then.  It wasn't much but it did help the couple out.  A few years into Jeremy's schooling Michelle got the dream she'd been waiting for.  Jeremy proposed and Michelle was all over him with her acceptance.  It was time for the two to finally become a real family.  6 months later the couple was wed in front of family and friends and 9 months later baby Michael was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy eventually graduated and got a big job as an executive at a marketing firm.

He knew he could be a pervert, but Michael never thought Philip would be so...forward.  \"Come on hot lips.  I know what will make you feel better, how about the love doctor give you some of that good loving.\"  Philip says as his other hand now reaches into Michael's panties.  Then all of the sudden it hit Michael.  Not only was Philip his normal perverted self, but last night's poker game Michael had swapped sex lives with Tiffany who said something about having sex maybe three times a day.  The second Michael realized this he had a guttural reaction and threw up the breakfast he'd just eaten all over Philip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN!\"  Philip said, \"I guess the whole sick thing wasn't just a reason to get me over here and into your panties.  Damn I need to get cleaned up.  You call me later if you feel better so that we can catch up.\"  And with that Philip made a line for the door and left.

It was a long time before he Josie was satiated and they both started getting ready for the day. Michael automatically started get ready, much in the same way as Heather would have since he had her interest and her makeup, so he instinctively carried out her routine to look perfectly made-up. The world looked so different thanks to Heather\u2019s height too, but it was oddly comforting to be so short. His hair took much longer to wash, dry, and style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection in the mirror was possibly the most surreal part of the affair, as long as he didn\u2019t think about it, the changes felt natural for the most part. It was almost like he\u2019d always been the person he was now, but looking into the mirror was a powerful reminder of the contrast with his former self. The woman in the mirror was absolutely beautiful, with a million-watt smile, perfect makeup and hair, flawless skin, and a body that could easily stop traffic. As he looked through his closet he couldn\u2019t help but smile at what used to be Tiffany\u2019s clothes. Tiffany always straddled the line between sexy and slutty and from where Michael was standing she crossed the line quite often to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was happy with his look Michael \u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked up to who he was but it felt hard to him to see the person clearly in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso the drunken state he was now in made it quite hard for him to identify anyone. He was lucky that his head was clear enough to even find his bed tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael.\", whispered a feminine and very familiar voice. \"I hope you're not sleeping, 'cause I want to have some fun.\". Michael identified the voice very quickly as the voice of his girlfriend Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now...\", he mumbled rather sleepy but it did not stop Josie from coming over to his bed and slide under the bed sheet. \"Good, you're awake.\", grinned Josie and began groping Michael's silicon filled breasts through his pink, satin nightgown top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie...\", gasped Michael surprised and suddenly remembered that he had swapped sex lives with Tiffany, so Josie was now more aggressive when it came down to sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it when you're like this.\", whispered Josie into Michael's ear and then moved one hand away from his breasts, over his stomach which was now hairless, down to his feminine crotch which she immediately began caressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael gasped again and could feel a strange feeling he had not felt before. He was getting aroused but as someone with female anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie then proceeded to kiss Michael's neck but soon finished. \"Enough of this foreplay.\", she said and tossed Michael around on his back. \"Now it's time for the real fun.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulled down Michael's pants and his panties. It was then that Michael realised that Josie was already naked. \"She's very eager now...\", thought Michael. Josie then pulled up Michael's leg and shoved herself against him so that her vagina was pressed against Michael's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael moaned. These new feelings were amazing. He looked up to Josie, the smell of alcohol coming out of his mouth whenever he opened it to moan. He could see Josie's breasts moving wildly while she moved forward and backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Josie! This is amazing!\", he moaned loudly and made Josie smile. She liked it when she could get him like this. Normally it seemed like he was not very interested in sex, not that she cared that much, she had her own desires, but sometimes it seemed as if he was enjoying it very much. These times were the best for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie continued moving but got more rapidly. She now could not prevent herself from moaning now. Both kept moaning even louder until Josie climaxed. She then laid herself right next to Michael and fell asleep. This all happened so fast that Michael did not realise it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\", he thought. \"I've not gotten the chance to climax myself and she doesn't care... She really has changed!\". Michael was still aroused and moved his hand down to his genitals and ended what Josie had started, before falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

Michael remembered last night and nearly wanted to wake her up, he knew how horny she now should be, but refused to do so. \u201cI have to make breakfast\u201d, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid a pink robe over his very feminine body and went downstairs to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. He was the first one in the house to get up.  \u201cMom really enjoys having my job\u2026 She can sleep long\u2026\u201d, he thought as he gathered all ingredients necessary for making pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person to get down was Anna. \u201cAh, Michael\u201d, she smiled. \u201cI see you\u2019re really living up to being a housewife. Michael turned around and looked at his sister. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d, he responded. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda\u2026 nice\u2026 Although I\u2019m quite surprised that I\u2019m able to get up this early.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna laughed. \u201cYeah, was quite a surprise for me, too\u201d, she said. \u201cBut you look quite damaged. How long were you gone and what did you do last night?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael scratched his smooth chin. \u201cYeah\u2026 Well, I drank quite a lot yesterday. We played some games and talked\u201d, he explained. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m having a bit of a headache. Quite a headache. I shouldn\u2019t have drunken so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should have stayed in bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shook his head. \u201cNo way. Nobody of you is able to make any decent breakfast besides me. I can\u2019t let you starve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna laughed again. \u201cIt\u2019s like you swapped responsibilities with mom as well.\u201d. Michael nodded in agreement. \u201cYeah it seems that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that about swapping responsibilities?\u201d, asked a deep, male voice from the entrance of the kitchen. Both siblings turned around and saw their dad standing in his pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, nothing, dad\u201d, Anna told him. \u201cWe were just thinking that it would be awesome if mom was as responsible as Michael is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam smiled at his daughter. She was so mature for her age. \u201cYeah but you know you\u2019re mom. At least you two are so responsible and everything. I wouldn\u2019t know what we would do without you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam then took a seat on the kitchen table and opened the newspaper. Michael grabbed a pot of coffee and gave it to his dad. Michael then continued making breakfast. After a while he was finished and the rest sat down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that everyone has gathered here, I have a suggestion for you all to make.  It\u2019s weekend and I thought you all might need a day off. So why don\u2019t we go on a trip to the beach?\u201d, suggested William to his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna thought about it for a while. \u201cYeah, why not? We drive there, rent an hotel room and come back tomorrow.\u201d. With that it was actually decided. Now that Anna had Cindy\u2019s authority, Michael and Cindy had not much to decide what the family does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked like horrified. The thought of going to the beach in his current female state was not very appealing. But he had no choice, especially when he looked over to Josie. Although she did not belong to the family directly, it was clear for everybody that she would come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the thought of seeing Michael in a bikini seemed to be something she liked very much. \u201cShe would talk me into going anyway\u2026 So it\u2019s best to go along.\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, it\u2019s decided.\u201d, said William. \u201cThen let\u2019s have breakfast, then gather our things and we can go by noon.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After all we can't go to the beach naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's an idea I can get behind.\" Josie said continuing her kissing assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie.\" Michael said with as much authority he could muster in his position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine party pooper.\" Josie said with a pout, \"But as soon as we get to the hotel, you are all mine, I've already talked to your dad and Anna about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"  Michael said not really sure how he felt about this whole thing as he entered his room to pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since the change, Michael was able to get a good look around his room.  Considering the number of massive changes to his life, the room seemed relatively in tact, although he did notice he no longer had sports stuff on his walls and shelves and instead found some romance novels that he assumed had belonged to Heather.  He also noticed he now had a corner of the room dedicated to makeup, including what looked like an overnight makeup bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better get started.\" Michael said to himself grabbing the overnight makeup bag and going into his closet for a small suitcase since he knew they were going to be spending the night in a hotel.  He was a bit surprised when he saw that he no longer had a navy blue suitcase, but rather a magenta one.  But that small shock went away as soon as he started looking for a swimsuit.  \"I wasn't expecting Tiffany to own a one piece or anything, but damn.\" Michael said to himself as he pulled what just seemed to Michael to be stringy thing and flimsy cloth pieces.  In horror Michael just held up a black little thing that would barley cover himself up.  When suddenly he heard a shout on the other side of his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Michael!\" Anna's voice came through, \"Go ahead and put on your bikini and keep your towel out, we're heading to the beach first thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\" Michael shouted back.  Michael held up the black string bikini up to his generous frame, \"What have I gotten myself into?\"</span></div></div>",

It was like she was undressing him with her eyes. \u201cNow I know how some women feel.\u201d, he thought and tried to ignore his girlfriend\u2019s look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the beach Michael got undressed just like the others. He could still feel Josie\u2019s eyes on him, watching every movement he did. The more he felt her gaze, the more uncomfortable he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael felt naked in the skimpy, black bikini he had put on just before the family headed off to the beach. He also caught a jealous glance from Anna who was dressed in a purple one-piece swimsuit. It was obvious that she was jealous of Michael because he could dress in such a bikini and the fact that he could still wear one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, now with the respect of her mother, was unable to wear something. She was a role model now.  Her mother on the hand was dressing in a bikini, one Anna would have normally worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here we are.\u201d, smiled Michael\u2019s dad and looked at his family (and Josie). \u201cAnna and me will look for a nice place, you can go and swim.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna grumbled slightly. The respect she had swapped had some side-effects. She had to do some things her mother usually did, for example looking for a place where they could put their towel down. At least she could sun herself a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie, Cindy and Michael went to the water while the other two were looking for a nice place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d, said Josie. \u201cWe have to put on sunscreen or else we\u2019ll get sunburned.\u201d. She had a bottle of sunscreen in her hand and grinned at Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d, she said and got some of the cream out of the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll apply it to you.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sighed. He knew that Josie would use this chance to grope his breasts or something like that. He did not want to hurt her feelings, so he agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have so wonderful breasts.\u201d, whispered Josie into Michael\u2019s ear as she began applying it to his breasts. \u201cYou\u2019re dad really did a wonderful job there.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shrugged at the idea that his dad had enhanced his breasts. \u201cJosie\u2026\u201d, he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure that my breasts, especially the area around my nipples, won\u2019t get a sunburn.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpoil sport.\u201d, she whispered and began applying the sunscreen correctly, but she did use the chance to massage Michael\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had sunscreen on their body they got into the water to cool themselves down. Cindy had brought a water ball along with which they played.</span></div></div>",

He decided to go over to Anna and sunbath a bit as well. He got over to her and got beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sis.\u201d, smiled Michael and looked over to Josie who was kind of pissed that she could not see Michael\u2019s breasts bounce anymore. \u201cHow\u2019s the sunbathing going?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty well.\u201d, grinned Anna and looked up to her brother. \u201cAnd how do you feel? Being the housewife and having Cindy\u2019s friends.\u201d. It has gotten really hard for Anna to refer to her mom as mom rather than Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh you know.\u201d, began Michael. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda nice. Like going on a vacation, you know? It also helps a lot that I have mom\u2019s skills. Just imagine, if I still had my cooking skills. The family would starve!\u201d, laughed Michael. Anna joined him. \u201cYeah, that would be pretty bad. I guess it\u2019s also nice for you to stay away from Josie a bit. It must be horrible to be dragged by Josie into some quiet room every lunch break at school.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael agreed although he had no memories of such an event ever happening. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s kinda nice\u2026 Although she now tries to get into my panties all the time she sees me.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna laughed. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the Josie we all know and love.\u201d. Anna then laid back and closed her eyes. \u201cThe cards really made life interesting. Just imagine what we could do! Maybe we should let dad play with us next time.\u201d. Anna grinned at Michael who shrugged at the thought what could all happen to his dad. \u201cIf we\u2019re lucky my dad would become my mom or my sister\u2026\u201d, he thought but could not say it out loud to Anna. He simply agreed with her and laid back as well to tan himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Josie joined the sunbathing siblings. Much to Michael\u2019s discomfort she snuggled rather closely to Michael and began to caress his breasts from time to time. At first Michael pushed her hand away and told her to stop but when she continued after the tenth time, he simply let her do what she wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea.\u201d, whispered Josie into Michael\u2019s ear so that Anna could not hear it. \u201cYou brought the cards along, right?\u201d. Michael nodded slowly. He HAD to bring the cards along. Not to imagine what would happen if the cards got stolen or anything like that. It was the best to keep them near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d, grinned Josie, still whispering. \u201cI have thought about it. These cards open many interesting opportunities for us. Just think about it. We could be anyone! So how about we look for some people at the hotel later. People who have become tired of their lives and want a change.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael turned his head to Josie. \u201cAnd then? We play with them? But how about swapping back. We\u2019re not here anymore in 48 hours.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie grinned. \u201cSo what? It\u2019s not like anyone besides us will notice. It doesn\u2019t matter if we can swap back. Also: Imagine if I get a penis. Then I could satisfy you even more.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was not sure. He already changed a lot with his mom\u2019s friends who were now his friends. He wasn\u2019t a boy with a near female body and with a girlfriend who had the sex drive of some man Michael had never met before. On the other hand, she was right. Nobody noticed anything. Was the status quo really better? Maybe this would improve his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Michael could answer, he heard Anna\u2019s voice. \u201cHey, I have an idea guys.\u201d, she said smiling. \u201cMichael, I guess you brought the cards with you, right?\u201d. Again he was asked if he had brought the cards. \u201cIt\u2019s like that\u2019s the only thing they can think of.\u201d, thought Michael and nodded to symbolize Anna he had brought them along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d, grinned Anna. \u201cWhen I said we should include dad, that gave me an idea. How about we play tonight with him? We can swap anything again today and we just tell the other\u2019s they\u2019re going to live with what they have for a bit longer.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna saw in Josie\u2019s face which did not look so happy about Anna\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI guess you\u2019re against it?\u201d, asked Anna Josie. Josie shook her head. \u201cNot completely. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d, she stammered. She could not tell Anna about her plan she had told Michael just moments ago. Anna would not allow it. \u201cI just er\u2026 do whatever Michael wants to do.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were now on Michael who felt even more unconfident because of the fact that he was wearing a very skimpy, black bikini. \u201cSo it\u2019s up to you, Michael.\u201d, said Anna. \u201cMom will certainly want to play and dad has no choice.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael thought about it. \u201cIf I say no to Anna, Josie will assume I want to follow her plan. She would convince me to follow her plan. I know Josie, no matter how hard I try to resists, she\u2019d win in the end.\u201d, thought Michael. \u201cOn the other hand, I don\u2019t want to involve my dad in this game. What should I do?\u201d.</span></div></div>",

He had to admit that he enjoyed dressing feminine but he was sure this was only because of Heather\u2019s interest which he possessed. In the elevator, Michael tried to talk Josie out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosie\u2026 I don\u2019t think this is really a good idea\u2026 I mean, we can\u2019t swap back\u2026\u201d, he began and looked at her with a puppy dog look but with no success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a spoil sport, Michael.\u201d, she said and looked stern at him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we can swap back or not. I mean, nobody except us will know how the world is supposed to be. And think about it, is the reality were you\u2019re still at school really that much better than the one we\u2019re currently in? I mean you were never interested in anything the other boys at school were. You seem to fit more into the life of a housewife.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had nearly forgotten that Josie did not know the reality where he was a normal boy anymore. But he had to admit that Josie had a point. He enjoyed the current reality, not all of it but mostly it was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d, he sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll join your plan\u2026 Under one condition.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked at him and grinned. \u201cAnd that would be?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop groping my breasts!\u201d, he said and pushed Josie\u2019s hands away from his cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine.\u201d, sighed Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do you think we\u2019ll find persons who want to play with us? People will think we\u2019re crazy if we ask everyone in the hotel lobby, the bar or the restaurant if they want to play a magical poker game which lets you swap everything you can think of.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie grinned and had an answer right away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re going to look for people who seem to be unhappy with their lives, bodies or whatever. You just have to trust me, you know I can look through people.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, let\u2019s go look for those people and ask them. They\u2019ll think we\u2019re crazy as well.\u201d, said Michael and rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d, she said again. \u201cEverything is going to be fine.\u201d.</span></div></div>",

Too young to marry but unfortunately Amy got pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir families were very religious and were forced to marry each other. An abortion was out of question just like adoption. Amy was 3 months pregnant now. The couple hardly spoke to each other and went on this holiday hoping everything could change but it did not work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were sitting in the hotel lobby on a sofa and did not speak with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n James bowed forward and supported his arms on his legs. He was quite tall, standing 6\u201d4\u2019, had short black hair and had an average built. He was no jock neither was he too thin or too fat. Average was the term which described him pretty well. He was wearing some bermuda shorts and a baggy orange t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy did not show any since of her pregnancy for now. She was shorter than her husband, no wonder, she was 5\u201d5\u2019. She had her dirty blond hair in a bob haircut. She had B-Cups and wide hips. She was not very athletic and her hands sported a French-tip manicure.  She wore a sleevless beige blouse and denim shorts that stopped at her knees. On her feet were flip-flops which showed her pedicure at its best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie and Michael stepped out of the elevator and Josie immediately pointed towards the two of them. Michael looked at Josie and wanted to know why she thought that the two would be a perfect fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie grinned. \u201cWell, first look at their fingers.\u201d, she pointed towards them. \u201cWedding bands but they\u2019re not talking to each other. The man looks like he\u2019s lost in his thoughts and not in happy ones.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael rolled his eyes. \u201cAnd what tells you that they would want to play with us? They look to me like a normal unhappy couple.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy. Just think about it: You\u2019re trapped in an unpleasant marriage. Then you\u2019d try to act happy, try to rebuild your marriage but these two look like they have already given up before they got here. But they\u2019re still married so there has to be a reason, no idea what, but they\u2019re trapped and want to get out.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you can see that all by looking at them?\u201d, he asked his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and grinned. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m good I know.\u201d. She waited a few seconds. \u201cAlso I heard them talk when we checked in.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had to laugh. \u201cOkay. Then let\u2019s ask them.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth went over and suggested the couple their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiiight. You two aren\u2019t doing drugs, right\u201d, asked James. \u201cYou have to. There is no way that something like that is possible.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, I know. But think about it. What do you have to lose? If it really works, you could change something in your life. If not you can at least have fun, playing poker. Your choice. If you two decide to join us, we\u2019re meeting at 9pm at the pool.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael and Josie went on to look for more players and left James and Amy with the decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next person Michael and Josie would ask to play with them was a french maid working at the hotel. Her name was Claire and she had just finished her shift. Like every saturday she went to the hotel bar and drank something to forget of her miserable life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lived in a small apartment not far from the hotel. There was barely enough room for her, bringing someone along was completely out of question. Her whole life consisted of working, trying to look good so her macho boss would not fire her and the occasional weekend drink she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told herself that some day she would get out of this hell, some day some shining prince would come and take her away. But he did not come. The hope that he might come was the only thing that kept her working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike every saturday evening, Claire was sitting at the bar and was talking to Jimmy, the bar keeper and her glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Harrington gets worse and worse every week. I think it's only a matter of time until he rapes me and the other girls.\", she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor thing.\", said Jimmy and took her hand. \"You're really amazing. I can't think I'd endure what you have to endure.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire did not know it but Jimmy had a crush on her. He was saving his money so he could get away from here together with Claire. He did not tell her anything so far because he was afraid she did not return her feeling. Also it had to be a surprise. It was not long now, soon the two could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Jimmy.\", smiled Clarie faintly. \"You're always so kind.\". She looked in his eyes, it was a magic moment but it was soon interrupted by two person who wanted to talk to Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust moments before Michael and Josie discussed wether she should ask the maid on the bar or not. Michael agreed with Josie although her reason \"feminine intuition\" was not enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\", smiled Josie at Claire. \"We'd like to talk to you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked at the two. They looked nice, although the boy looked troubled. \"What is it?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd like to make you an offer you might be interested in. If we could talk in privacy for a moment?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was not sure what they wanted but she sensed that they would offer her something she might be interested in. \"Okay.\", she said and got up. She stood wobbly on her heeled feet. Not because she was not used in wearing them but because she was slightly drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey three got to a quiet place in the bar and Josie talked about business right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, from you look and everything, I get you're a french maid and unhappy with your life.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair still wore her skimpy uniform which looked more like a fetish item than an approriate uniform. Claire nodded. \"Yeah, you're right. With both things.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie grinned. \"I told you.\", she said to Michael and then turned back to Claire. \"We'd like to ask you if you want to join us in a poker game. No typical poker. A magic poker game.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked like the couple the two asked before did. \"Magic?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, magic.\", continued Josie. \"I know it's hard to believe. You can swap anything with anyone we'll get to play with us. I know you're probably thinking we're mad or influenced by drugs. But think about it: If we're telling the truth, you could change your life, body or whatever is bothering you. If not, you can play some poker with us. What do you have to lose?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alcohol in Claire's bloodstream influenced her decision. Also she wanted to believe her.\"Okay, I believe you. So where do we meet?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie smiled. Looking for people was easier than she had thought.  \"9pm, at the pool. Don't be late.\". Josie got up and Michael followed her like a pet dog. \"See you there.\". The two left Claire alone and continued \"recruiting\" players.</span></div></div>",

He wore a blue button-down shirt and matching pants. On his feet were black shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, he looked fairly normal and his life was not that bad. He worked as a teacher in a school in the same town but different part of town than Michael\u2019s former school was. He had a lovely wife who looked not very attractive and was slightly overweight herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was nothing that qualified to be on Josie\u2019s radar for people she could get to play with. But there was something about him that made him sad. He tried to fight the urge to dress like a woman for years now and it was eating him away from the inside. He was too afraid to talk with his wife about this. She might leave him but he loved her so much, he did not want to risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat alone in the same bar Michael and Josie had \u201crecruited\u201d Claire and was alone, nipping on a glass of beer. He was surprised when a nice looking girl and her boyfriend sat down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re unhappy about something, right?\u201d, grinned the red-haired girl at him. It was no mischievous grin; it was nicer than the word grin implicated. It was like she knew something deep inside of him. He had no idea why but he felt like she almost knew of his urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if it was that way?\u201d, he asked unsure how to handle the situation and took another sip of his beer. \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d, began the boy while he positioned his breasts in this skimpy sundress he wore. Harold really could not understand why the younger generation had to dress so provocatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a magic card deck. We\u2019d like you to play with us.\u201d, continued the boy. He seemed unsure, careful. Harold could sense that the boy knew how crazy that sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA magic card deck? Great for you. Does it grant you three wishes, or what?\u201d, joked Harold and though that the two were playing a prank on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shook her head. Her face had not changed since she first talked to him. \u201cNo, it allows the winner of a hand to swap one trait, no matter what it is, to swap with one of the losers.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold shook his head. These kids were really trying to play a prank on him. \u201cListen, kids. You seem really nice but stop bothering me. If you want to play a prank, look for someone else.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no no.\u201d, replied the girl. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to play a trick on you. We want to invite you. You have nothing to lose if you play with us, right? Think about it. We meet at 9pm at the pool.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Harold could say anything, the girl and who he assumed was her boyfriend, got up and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPf. Magic cards.\u201d, he grumbled. \u201cAs if something like that exists\u2026\u201d. He swallowed the rest of the beer which was in his glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, what the hell. What have I to lose?\u201d, he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael and Josie did not hear that, they were already out of range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think he\u2019ll come?\u201d, asked Michael. \u201cI mean, everyone. They didn\u2019t seem to believe us.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked at him and point one of her manicured fingers at Michael\u2019s big breasts, pressing at one of his nipples. \u201cYou worry too much. Don\u2019t piss your panties. They\u2019ll come. Even if they don\u2019t believe us, they\u2019ll be curious. They want a change and now they have hope they could get one.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay okay.\u201d, said Michael and pushed Josie\u2019s finger away. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find someone else.\u201d.</span></div></div>",

He was a musician the hotel had hired to do a nice jazz style music in the lounge who worked for tips while the hotel provided food and a room for him.  He sat down in the same bar where Josie and Michael were recruiting after he had finished his last set of the evening.  Simon sighed to himself as he sipped on a whiskey, at the age of 35 this was not where he had pictured his life going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up Simon had been an extremely talented and innovative songwriter/singer.  Unfortunately talent and innovation are not things that are as smiled on as they should be in the music industry.  For years Simon did a lot of mixing and writing behind the scenes and working with some IT guys he managed to create a whole new music processing program that would create music that people had never heard before.  Sadly as he was working for a big time record company his creations belonged to them.  Then 3 years ago, after years of toiling behind the scenes he'd felt that he had come up with a great gimmick and song list for himself.  When he went to the record producers to pitch his idea they turned him down saying he was 'too old' to make it big now a days, and took his gimmick and songs and gave them to some auto tuned punk who is now at the top of the charts.  Simon quit on the spot and tried to produce his own music.  But that cost money that he didn't have.  Simon wasn't too good at anything besides his passion of music and tried to find jobs to work around that skill, usually as a DJ in small clubs but those didn't last since he kept quitting the 1,000th time he heard songs he wrote being requested.  For a while he even did sound editing and mixing for a porn company.  He'd even done a few 'staring roles' himself when they were short handed.  But as nice as that was for him, he wanted to concentrate on the music.  As hopeless as it seemed at his age, he HAD to become a musician full time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now he was hear.  Granted he was living his dream, granted on a very small scale, but he couldn't help but wonder what might have been.  He kept telling himself that if only he was younger or a few things about him were different, he knew he could make it big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's where Josie and her seemingly masterful touch of finding people who want to change their lives come in.  She and Michael approached the man and once again they told the unbelievable tale of magical life changing cards.  Telling him what should have been an absolutely absurd tale, but looking at the girl and especially her boyfriend (Simon couldn't put his finger on it but something felt a tiny bit weird about him) he decided that maybe he'd humor the two and meet them at the pool for the game at 9pm at the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking away from Simon, Michael said to Josie, \"Ok so it looks like we have 4 guys and 3 girls.  I that should be more than enough to have a good game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie thought for a second before kissing Michael's neck and whispering into his ear,</span></div></div>",

Soon she pointed her finger towards an Asian woman. \u201cThat one\u2019s good.\u201d, she told Michael and moved over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl Josie pointed at was named Naoko Nakagawa. She was 32 years old and lived quite a life. She was a famous designer and created different styles which made it into many season collections. It was nothing someone would be unhappy about. She earned much money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the petite Asian woman was unhappy with her life. She had a slender figure, B-Cups, straight black hair and was currently wearing a stylish black and white dress and had shiny, black pumps on her feet. Still nothing someone would be unhappy about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, although Naoko lead a wonderful life she was just plainly unhappy with it. Nothing she had achieved was satisfying her. She did not know what it was but there was something missing. She needed a change but was too afraid to change anything drastically in her life. That\u2019s why she was at the hotel right now. Having holidays, hoping she would be happy again. Unfortunately it did not help. She was still unhappy and did not know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d, smiled Josie when she reached Naoko. The Asian woman looked up at Josie\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d, she greeted back confused. Why was the girl talking to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re unhappy with your life, right? Anyways, if you believe it or not, we can fix that. You see, we have these magical cards which allow us to swap anything you can imagine between other players. I know, I know. It\u2019s hard to believe and no we\u2019re not doing drugs.\u201d, explained Josie and sounded like she had done this speech several times now, which was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko raised an eyebrow but did not say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if you\u2019re curious, meet us at the pool at 9pm.\u201d. With these words the girl vanished as fast as she appeared and left Naoko wondering. Did she tell the truth?</span></div></div>",

I mean, what if one of them is a criminal?\u201d, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid someone look like a criminal?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 But some criminal don\u2019t look like this. They look like you and me.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael\u2026 Don\u2019t piss your panties, okay? This is all going to work and will be fun and exciting.\u201d, she told him and before Michael could reply anything, the \u201cguests\u201d arrived. It was incredible how all came at the same time at exactly 9pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know why I\u2019m even here\u2026\u201d, said James, the unhappy husband. \u201cI mean these two are just crazy.\u201d. His girlfriend had another opinion. \u201cThey\u2019re not. This is going to help us. Trust me.\u201d. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d. She grinned at him. \u201cFeminine intuition.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d, smiled Josie who overheard their discussion. \u201cIt seems everyone is here. Good. Take a seat.\u201d. She pointed over to the table where Michael was already sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone was seated Josie got out the cards and began mixing. \u201cBefore I explain the game, we should all get to know each other. So, I\u2019m Josie Mason, 17 years young, I go to high school. This is handsome fellow over there is my boyfriend Michael Ferguson, same age, he is a homemaker. We\u2019re here to offer you the chance to change something in your life\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d, mumbled James. \u201cI\u2019m James Bennett and this is my wife Amy. I\u2019m 20 and she\u2019s 19. We\u2019re married for two months now. I work as a shop clerk in the mall not far from here.\u201d He purposely avoided telling them about their marriage problems. It was nothing of their matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was the next one. \u201cI\u2019m Claire Tennyson. I\u2019m 23 years old and I work here as a French maid.\u201d. She did leave out the part of her horrible employer and her miserable life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Harold Madison. I\u2019m 36. Married. Teacher.\u201d, he told everyone in short sentences. He was not really sure why he was even here. Something told him he could get a chance to satisfy his cross dressing urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon Thomas.\u201d, introduced the Simon himself.\u201d35 years old and musician. I was hired to play here.\u201d. Like all the others he did not tell anyone about his problems of getting a decent job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least Naoko introduced herself. \u201cI\u2019m Naoko Nakagawa. 32 years old and I\u2019m a designer. I\u2019m here for holidays.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you all.\u201d, smiled Josie and stopped mixing the cards. \u201cSo, here\u2019s the deal. We play poker. I guess everyone knows the rules? Yeah? Good. So, the person who wins the hand gets to choose something from the losers. Simply say \u2018I want to swap X with Y\u2019 and it will happen. You can swap anything you can think of. Any questions? Except if I\u2019m mad or on drugs? None? Good.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie then began dealing the cards. \u201cOh, right. I almost forgot. There are 4 joker cards in the game. If anyone wins with at least one joker card in his/her hand then she can choose what other person on the table swap. Then you just have to say \u2018I want that X swaps Y with Z\u2019.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the game began and the person who came out on top was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Authors note: This time I allow one line chapters but only for the start so every character gets the chance to win first. After that initial choices I'll keep deleting one line chapters<br>\r\nAlso for everyone who is too lazy to look back, here is the list of what has been swapped with Michael so far:<br>\r\nPerson - trait<br>\r\nTiffany- Clothes<br>\r\nTiffany- Breasts<br>\r\nHeather- Height<br>\r\nTiffany- Underwear<br>\r\nHeather- Interests<br>\r\nAmanda- Hair<br>\r\nMiranda- Muscle Tone<br>\r\nTiffany- Sex Lives<br>\r\nAmanda- Butts<br>\r\nTiffany- Body Hair<br>\r\nMiranda- Teeth/Mouth shape<br>\r\nHeather- Voice<br>\r\nHeather- Makeup<br>\r\nAmanda- Genitals</b></span></div></div>",

Josie put the cards down and looked at the men on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry guys, but one of you is going to lose his favorite thing.\u201d, she smiled. She was thinking of swapping with James. He was built very well. Harold was a no go. He was fat and did not look like he was sexually active. Simon was interesting for her. It was said that black men had big penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I think a colour change would be too much for me now.\u201d, she thought. She then looked over to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to swap genitals with James.\u201d, she said and soon a bulge formed in her bikini panties. She began rubbing it. \u201cIt is quite big.\u201d, she said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames on the other hand was shocked when he noticed that his member was gone and was replaced by a teenage pussy. \u201cOh my god!\u201d, he squealed surprised. \u201cShe really did tell the truth!\u201d, he continued screaming when he jumped up and ran his hands over his crotch which showed the other players very well that he was missing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was too shocked to say something and put her hands at her mouth, her eyes wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others had similar expressions. Harold was the first to say something. \u201cSo you really DID tell the truth. Unbelievable. This works with anything I can think of?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael answered for Josie who was too busy checking out her package. \u201cYes, indeed. You could swap hobbies or clothes or anything else with one of us. The sky is the limit so to say.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was now thrilled to continue playing.

Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Josie said still enamored with her previous acquisition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?  I think that I'd notice something as painfully obvious as girl with a dick and guy with a vagina running around.\"  Said Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised.\" Said Michael all too knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this assurance in mind Harold was quickly going over the choices in his head.  Josie would be a good choice considering his cloths would probably help out with her wardrobe, but then he reminded himself she was just wearing a bikini right now and he didn't want to be responsible for a teenage girl having to go around topless.  Then he looked at Clair, and tossed that out.  As much as he desired to dress as a woman, he wasn't really into the french maid theme.  Amy would be nice, but since her large and intimidating husband was already on edge from losing his manhood, Harold didn't want to risk making him angry by wearing his wife's cloths.  That left him one choice, but he decided to do it in a way to have as few people judging him as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So even if I did something way out there like say that I want to swap wardrobes with Naoko...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was instant.  Suddenly Harold was wearing a very stylishly patterned black and white dress and glossy, black pumps and Naoko was wearing a pair of swimming trunks and a t-shirt purchased from the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I didn't mean it!\" Harold lied as he felt the cloths which felt so good against his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You liar!\" Said and outraged Naoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down lady.\"  Said James, \"Big deal you lose some cloths, I lost my manhood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those cloths were my life!\"  Said Naoko angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If those cloths were your life than why did you come here to change something.\" Said Michael to calm the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael's right, just accept the change.

She quickly looked over the table and thought about all the possibilites this had. Sure, she was still angry for losing her exquisite clothes but she could buy some new ones later, right? First of all she should concentrate on making her life better. No, to make herself happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth to say something, to tell what she wanted for winning but then she noticed: She did not know! She had no idea what was missing in her life that made her so unhappy. She unconsciously straightened her t-shirt which was kind of tight against her B-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Naoko?\", asked Michael. \"You should hurry or else the cards will choose for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\", she replied faintly. \"I... I... I just don't know what I want. My life is unsatisfying for a while now. Sure, I love my life. I'm happy to be a designer. I'm... well, was happy to have all these exquisite clothes but still... There was something missing. I just don't know what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... We most surely can't help you with the decision\", said Josie, looking concerened. \"Maybe you SHOULD let the cards choose for you. But you have to remind yourself: You could lose something important to you. It's one thing if you lose it because you lost the hand. It's another thing that you lose it because you did nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko nodded. Josie was right. She had to choose something or else she would lose something important. But then again, what was important to her. Maybe she was not unhappy because she missed something. Maybe she was unhappy because she had something. Also, you only notice how important something is when you do not have it anymore. There was no way she could tell now, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and waited for the remaining twenty seconds. She should fate make the decision for her. She already lost something that was very important to her: Her clothes. But the more she thought about it, the more trivial these things get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time was then up and she swapped something with...</span></div></div>",

It sure looks like that. I doubt that the cards make a simple swap like swapping seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no, NO!\", exclaimed James. \"You can't let me swap lives with an asian chick, no offense, right after I lost my genitals! Okay that sounded wrong. You can't let me swap lives with her ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, check your ID\", proposed Josie. Naoko had already noticed that she did not have her purse anymore. Luckily, Harold had his ID in his swimming trunks and now she had too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it looks bad, James...\", she sighed and showed her ID to everyone. There was her picture, first name and heighth but the rest of the information belonged to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great!\", he sighed. \"I'm now some asian chick. At least I'm not married anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\", frowned Amy. It then dawned to her that she was now married to Naoko. So far there was no way to tell if this would be benefitial or not. She was not into women but at least they had probably more in common than James and her. And she would probably be a better father than James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\", apologized Naoko to Amy. \"And there is no way to swap back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shook his head. \"At least not for the next 48 hours.

This was the moment she'd waited for, she could finally get out of her miserable job, she was nervous and excited at the same time.  Her only regret was that sadly her freedom had to come at the cost of someone else, but that was just a part of the game.  Claire knew that she wanted to just have a life with as little stress as possible and looked at her choices.  The ones the left the possibility for a wide open job opportunities were Amy, Josie, and Michael.  After narrowing it down she decided the best tie breaker would be whose life would she be screwing up less.  She immediately decided against Amy, her husband did not look like if he would be happy when his wife becomes a french maid. The Josie girl was a good choice, but Claire wasn't sure she was ready to go back to school, especially a school she knew nothing about.  Which left her with poor homemaker Michael.  <i>Well, it might not be too different for him, he'll be doing similar things to what he's doing now, it'll just be at the hotel with this stupid uniform.  At least it will fit him nicely.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to rush you, but you're running out of time.\" Said Naoko hoping not to annoy her since she had all the power for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Michael dead in the eyes, Michael was suddenly filled with anxiousness as Claire said, \"I'm sorry, but I want to swap occupations with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael not happy to hear this closed his eyes and opened them to what he thought was going to be the same french maid outfit that Claire wore, but when he opened his eyes he saw he was still wearing his skimpy black bikini.  \"What the?  Did you run out of time?\" Michael said turning to Claire, but to his surprise she wasn't wearing the french maid outfit either.  She now was wearing her own white bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why aren't you wearing the hotel maid uniform?\" Claire asked curiously, \"If we swapped jobs than you should be wearing the uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's just done with his shift.\" James suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be, even when off duty maids have to wear the uniform on the hotel premises.  A very inconvenient rule.\"  Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's his day off.\" Amy suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, if he's here he'd still have to be in uniform, even on days off.  Not that I'd ever spend days off here.

I'm pretty sure he's a maid and you're now a homemaker, but if I had to guess, I'd guess you both still have the same employer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're saying I still work cleaning this damn hotel, only now I just have a different job title and no uniform?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also paychecks.\" Michael said looking at the checkbook in his purse.  \"Apparently I'm now employed by my father and by Josie to do work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, I do love a man in uniform.  I already know what we'll be 'playing' tonight.\" Josie said while squeezing Michael's tush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk about it in private.\" Michael said blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was incensed, \"So I basically have to put up with all the rude customers, the crappy hours, and the walking sexual harassment known as my boss, all for free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least now you have no reason at all to stay.\" Said Amy trying to help Claire look on the bright side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it, I probably have to live here like Simon in order to not be homeless.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember you've got friends to help you through this.\" Said Simon in a comforting tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Simon, I appreciate that, but you're just about the only friend I've got.\" Said Claire getting close to tears at her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that boy at the bar who was making those puppy dog eyes at you\" Asked Josie \"He seemed interested in helping you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in a while Claire smiled to herself, \"Yeah, I guess I do.\" <i>Maybe this won't be as bad as I thought it'd be</i> Claire thought to herself before dealing the next hand.</span></div></div>",

I know.\u201d, she replied to him. \u201cJust let me think about this.\u201d. Her eyes went over the various persons she had gathered tonight.

Quickly, Michael looked over to James and Amy who now were missing the rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it worked like I intended.\u201d, smiled Josie and looked at her ring. \u201cToo bad we didn\u2019t have the wedding night, right Michael?\u201d. Again she grabbed Michael\u2019s ass which made him blush and too embarrassed to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked just as happy as Josie. \u201cSo, we\u2019re not married anymore?\u201d. He looked over to Amy whose face showed a mixture of joy and horror. \u201cThat\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?\u201d, he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly moved her head towards him and began whispering with him. She still did not want to tell these strangers that she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about the baby?\u201d, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll support you and your baby but we don\u2019t have to be together anymore. We can live separate lives now.\u201d, he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you two lovebirds could come back.

I don't want to be a single mother.</i>  So much self doubt and questions about her life were running through her mind at the moment she thought her head would explode.  Sadly the cards do not wait for emotional crisis to pass before the two minute clock starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Amy.  What are you thinking?\"  Asked her no longer husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Said Amy, with her head still focused on nothing but the baby inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think about something that you might want to change about yourself and go for it.\"  Said Josie.  <i>Josie and Michael make such a good couple.  Maybe they should be having a baby.  They've been married just a few minutes and already they look happier than James and I ever did.

Michael could understand why they did this although he knew that it would not help the child.

He wanted to see a future with endless possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked shortly over to Simon but then continued her explanation. \"And some day, I found out I was pregnant. It could have been a happy moment but we were already not happy anymore. Unfortunately our parents are very religious. They forced us to marry and to keep the child.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did you do this to me?\", asked James who had looked over his body to find a sign that things worked but he could not find one. \"I now have a fucking vagina and I\u2019m pregnant!

How? I have no idea, you\u2019d have to ask someone not playing.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked over at James, took his hand and caressed it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll help you out.

Rubbing her hands together she looked over at Harold ready to get back at him for swapping cloths with her.  It was then that she suddenly realized, she wasn't really mad at him anymore.  Sure for the initial minutes after the swap she was outraged that she had lost her cloths, a huge part of her life, to this slob.  But then she thought about why she was here, she wasn't happy with her life, she didn't know why this was, but she knew she needed a change.  Maybe she just needed to try to simplify things a bit, she was already wearing some pretty average to below average cloths and as much as she disliked them initially, she now found the lack of complexity in her cloths was nice.  Although she did not like the fact that Harold, it seemed, now had all of her brassieres, her chest was starting to feel a bit heavy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of this she asked Josie and Michael, \"Question.  If just went out, purchased, and wore a bra right now, would people find it weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They probably would, as weird as it seems, you'd probably be considered a crossdresser if you wore one.\"  Michael replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The opposite goes for you Harold,\" said Josie with a smile, \"If you went down to the beach in some swimming trunks you'd probably be arrested for indecent exposure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, wait, that's not fair.  I have to wear women's clothing the rest of my life?\" Harold said thinking he may have bitten off more than he could chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" Said Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind thinking about these ideas, Naoko realized what she wanted to swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case I think I know what I'd like to swap, and my lower back will thank me for it.  I want to swap breasts with Harold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko put her hands to her chest immediately and felt her now flat chest.  Well relatively flat, she still had a pair of 'man boobs' but she knew with some work she could get those off.  \"I hope you like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold on the other side of the table said half listening, \"Yeah,\" and kept looking down at his chest with a mixture of sadness and interest as the cards for the next hand were passed out.</span></div></div>",

Simon even started shaking he was so trouble by his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon, are you ok?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Said Simon looking up at Claire.  <i>Poor Claire</i> Simon thought <i>she's had such a crummy life since she started working at this hotel with all the sexual harassment.

I know it's crazy but if this swap works the way I hope it does, then both of our lives will be better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you may have somehow screwed us both.\" Said Claire not really sure how she felt about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it was a gamble, but the ways thing are now, neither of us are happy and we came here to take risks.  This was a risk I was willing to take and I hope you're ok with it.\" Simon said extending his hand, \"What do you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I\" Claire still wasn't sure about the way things were, but she knew Simon's heart was in the right place. \"Ok, we'll go for it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michael was with Josie in the elevator and could see that she was enjoying the swap she had made with James. There was a huge bulge in her tight bikini panties. Michael gulped slightly at the thought that she would stick that thing right into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s a small price to pay to make her happy. At least nothing serious was swapped with either of us.\u201d, he thought. \u201cNot to think what would have happened if Amy swapped pregnancy between me or Josie.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie, who was really enjoying her new member, could not keep herself away from Michael anymore and began snuggling against him and her hand were on his breasts before Michael became even aware that she was near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m soooo horny.\u201d, she whispered into Michael\u2019s ear and began rubbing her penis. \u201cHere.\u201d, she continued and took Michael\u2019s hand which had long, red painted fingernails. \u201cFeel it.\u201d. She brought the hand to her crotch and let Michael rub over it. \u201cFeels good, right?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosie\u2026 I\u2026\u201d, he began but she immediately put her finger on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo talking.\u201d, she commanded. \u201cJust do it. You know you want it, husband.\u201d. She pronounced the word \u201chusband\u201d as exaggerated as possible just to remind Michael that he was now married. Still uncomfortable with playing with a penis, even if it was now his girlfriend\u2019s, his hand slowly made its way into Josie\u2019s panties. Just before he wanted to touch it, they arrived at they\u2019re designated floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaved. For now.\u201d, he thought and both got out. Josie still pressed herself against Michael and began whispering dirty things into his ear. This did not stop until they were in their room. Michael\u2019s dad had rented three rooms, one for him and his wife, one for Michael and Josie and one for Anna. That way everyone was undisturbed. Michael was not sure if that was a good idea in hindsight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie grinned broadly as soon as the door of their room was closed. She pushed Michael on the bed. \u201cHere we are alone. Just me and my husband.\u201d, she giggled and ripped off his bikini top and panties, exposing Michael\u2019s silicon filled breasts and his neatly shaven vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie\u2019s panties got lost somewhere in between, she was quick, Michael could swear there were more than two hands undressing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie, still wearing a bikini top but with her exposed penis, leaned over Michael who was lying on the bed. She began groping his breasts, kissing his neck and brushing her penis over his vagina. Moans escaped Michael\u2019s lips. Softly and more feminine than he wanted them to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie\u2019s member was hard in a few seconds and she pushed it inside Michael as soon as she could not bear it anymore which was just a second after it was hard. Michael moaned out loudly and clawed his fingernails in the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis feels amazing.\u201d, groaned Josie as she continued pushing in and out of Michael. Her now husband had to agree. He could have never imagined that it would feel this good to have sex as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael moaned louder when Josie became more vigorous. The bed rocked heavily and Michael was sure the people in the next room, his parents, would certainly hear what the two were doing but Michael did not care right now. The feeling he had was too amazing. It was hard for him to have a clear thought. He kept moaning louder and louder and began pushing his waist against Josie which resulted in even more loud moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josie began to climax and shot her hot semen right into Michael. She calmed down. Sweating heavily and gasping for more air, she retreated from Michael and laid herself beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was disappointed. He was still not finished and craved for more. He turned his head and wanted to tell her that she should continue but she already fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a clich\u00e9.\u201d, he sighed and moved his hand to his crotch. He began doing it for himself but had to find out that it did not feel as good as having Josie inside of him. \u201cNow I know how women feel\u2026\u201d, he thought when he was finished. Exhausted he stayed where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were lucky\u2026\u201d, he thought. \u201cIt could have been worse. Who knows? I could have been trapped in Claire\u2019s life or something like that. I wonder what the others are doing.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the wedding band on his finger. \u201cGotta get used to this thing. I wonder if mom and dad were against our marriage.\u201d. Michael then began giggling femininely. \u201cAnd I wonder if Josie and me both wore white wedding dresses.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael imagined what their wedding was like. Something he would never have done but since he had Heather\u2019s interest he found himself thinking about things he had never thought about before. After a while he fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

As weird as last night was, he certainly wouldn't call it a bad experience.  He even quite enjoyed himself, and definitely would be up for doing it again, but not right now.  Not at 7 AM.  Michael gave a look at Josie's appendage and finally decided to give his wife a little treat.  Smiling Michael said, \"All right, but first close your eyes.\"  Josie did as she was told and Michael, with all the force he could muster, pushed Josie onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like where this is going.\" Josie said excitedly.  With her new manhood standing at attention, Michael gave a long look at it.  Was this the way they were going to be the rest of their lives?  Was she always going to want to keep it?  The rushing thoughts came to Michael, but then he caught a glimpse of the cards out of the corner of his eyes and laughed.  There was no need to get freaked out about the circumstances of his love making with Josie, so long as it was with Josie.  Tomorrow the situations could be reversed for all he knew.  He might was well try to enjoy it, or at least make sure Josie gets the most out of it.  With that thought in mind, Michael took his fingernail polished hand and wrapped it around Josie's manhood and sent her on a trip she would greatly enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks a million babe.\" Josie said sounding a little tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Michael said kissing Josie before getting up to wash his hands.  After he was finished he heard the phone ring.  \"I've got it!\" Josie said and answered the phone.  Michael decided to use the time to get himself a little made up for the day.  Who knew what the day could bring, another trip to the beach, some time at the resort, maybe they could take in a show and go dancing.  After about 15 minutes of getting his face ready, Michael emerged from the bathroom to see his wife hang up the phone.  Josie looked at Michael and said, \"That was your mom, she said\"</span></div></div>",

Michael was wearing enough for the two of them on his face right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael took a blue blouse and a black skirt out of one of his many suitcases. He was really becoming very girly. He had a hard time to choose what clothes he should take with him, so he brought almost half his wardrobe with him.

You weren't happy with the way your life was going and that's why you played in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Amy said embracing James, \"this isn't a punishment, you <i>get</i> to give birth to our child.

Thankfully all of their fears were settled when Cindy looked at the two and immediately started welling up with tears of joy.  \"There's my new big sister.\"  Anna said proudly and gave Josie a hug.  While the girls started to chatter away, Michael's father William came up to him and gave him a manly pat on the back.  \"Are you two newlyweds enjoying the getaway weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We certainly are having a once in a lifetime experience.\" Michael said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to here that,\"  William said, \"Just you wait, the best part is coming soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked confused at his dad, \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam grinned slyly, \"You'll see.\"  Michael wanted to pursue the topic further but his growling stomach had other plans.  He and Josie got in line for breakfast.  After their long night, Michael started piling up the sausage, biscuits, and gravy and was considering getting something from the omelet station when Josie came up to him.  \"Wow, somebody is hungry.  I guess I'll have to have an extra long work out tonight so that you can still fit in your new uniform when we get back.\"  Michael had never really thought about worrying about his weight and watching what he ate before, but he realized that now with him stuck as a maid with the intentionally sexy uniform, he probably needed to make sure he fit it properly.  A little regretful in having to do so, he got a new plate and just got some bowls for some fruit and oatmeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down with their family, Michael and Josie could tell they were anxious to say something.  Seemingly not being able to contain it anymore Cindy said, \"You know how we said we were putting off on getting you two your wedding gift until we had everything lined up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of coarse we do, and we were perfectly fine with it, in fact just having you guys as a second family is gift enough.\" Josie said smiling.

The two had decided that they definitely wanted to live in the house Michael's parents had made available for them, it was too good an opportunity to pass up.  The challenge came with finding work for Michael, finding a school for Josie, and the actual move itself.  In the town they would be moving to the only university of quality in the area was a very high class school steeped in tradition and cost an arm and a leg to get in.  And while Josie was by no means a bad student, she had to spend the last few months of school rather than goofing off and having fun, studying to get her GPA up to a 4.0 as that was what it would take to get into the school.  This put even more of a load on Michael as he was now 100% in charge of the move as Josie was not available to help at all.  With his tiny physique this was no small task.  Even packing up the smaller boxes Michael noticed he was struggling more than he would have liked.  He considered getting a little friendly poker game together with Jeremy and Phillip to see if he could get them to lend him a hand (or some strength) but his pride would not let him.  Despite being a petite, big bosomed, all around gorgeous looking woman on the outside, he was still the proverbial man of the house and wanted to take care of Josie and the move as much on his own merit as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while Josie slaved night and day over piles of books and scholarship applications, Michael spent virtually all his time packing and commuting from his home with his parents and his home that was hours and hours away.  As Michael made what was planned to be his last trip back to his parents just a few days before Josie's graduation and the final big move he thought back to how grateful he was to his and Josie's parents for their support and the paid time off they had given him the last few weeks.  Michael said his usual greetings to his parents and Anna and went into his room to receive a huge overpowering embrace and kiss from his wife.  After holding the position for a full minute Josie finally came up for air and said excitedly, \"My grades are good enough, I'm in the University!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fantastic!\"  Michael said glad to here the news that Josie wouldn't have to take some online school or go to a community college for her education, she was going to get the best education money could buy.  All of the sudden Michael's face fell a little at that thought.  With all of the work being put into the move he had done no effort in finding a job for himself once he got their to support them.  Josie seemed to have noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Michael, I've gotten enough scholarships to pay for a good chunk of the first semester I think, and our families will lend us the rest.  You'll find a few high paying clients and I'll find a part time job on the campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you won't.\"  Michael said putting his foot down, \"So long as I'm not going to school and you are, I will be the one supporting you.  I'll get as many jobs as it takes, you need to focus on school.  You can lighten the work load on me afterwards.  Until then, it's all on me.  Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, yes sir.\"  Josie said obviously turned on by her man's words.  \"You know we don't have to pack up the bed for a couple of hours, why don't you let me take care of you for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael didn't even wait for an answer as he pushed Josie down with all his frame could muster (although with all the heavy lifting he'd done for the move he found he was actually able to do that fairly easily) and crawled on top of Josie and began to kiss her.  Although Michael would prefer to have the penis in the relationship, he got over it by knowing he was still making love to the girl of his dreams.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHard to think the just a mere 12 hours after this exchange, the husband and wife tandem were hauling a uhaul across the state for the final move into their new home.  They pulled up into the two car garage, single story, 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house where they would live out the next part of their life together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Life was not easy for the newlyweds.  Whenever Josie wasn't at school she was studying for classes, she wasn't even able to find time a make love to her husband on a nightly basis anymore (something Michael had to admit he was okay with).  Michael on the other hand spent 3 months job searching before he was able to find enough clients who were willing to pay enough for the fairly eccentric position of French maid.  Michael didn't have many clients but the few he had paid very well and Michael made sure he did his job diligently.  Even with all of the unusual changes the two had gone through, they settled into a routine of schoolwork and housework.  The grind of everyday life was by no means fun but it was a good life for the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cards didn't come into play for the two for a long time.  Michael had decided early on after the move that they didn't want to swap things around with others until they were in a more stable position.  Josie did complain about this being 'boring' but she ultimately agreed with her husband's decision.  So the cards for the most part stayed locked away in a special cabinet in the attic.  That is until one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a year after the move Michael was busy cleaning at one of his more eccentric clients summer homes.  His name was Reggie Vega, a computer genius who was a retired billionaire by age 28.  Reggie was Michael's favorite client for many reasons, not only because he paid very well, but also because when Michael cleaned the house Reggie would stick around the house and help him out and make conversation with him.  The first time this happened Michael was a bit confused, but eventually just grew to accept it and look forward to his work with Reggie.  The two struck up a good friendship, although it did get weird when one day Reggie said, \"You're so lucky Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I lucky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie put down a cleaning rag and took a deep breath and just said, \"I mean you have a great job.  I must admit I'm a bit jealous of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Michael was really confused, \"I don't get it?  What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying that I'm jealous of your work.  You get to go to peoples houses and do real work, heck you even get to wear a costume and nobody bats and eyelash.  I've always just sat in front of a computer all my life.  And now that I'm retired the only time I actually do...anything is when you come over and you let me help clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at Reggie with sad eyes.  Over the year he'd known that Reggie was a bit of a lonely soul but never wanted to get into it as he thought it was too personal for an employee/employer relationship.  Suddenly Michael got an idea that was just crazy and weird enough to work, \"What if I gave you my job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie laughed at the question, \"Well, I must admit I'd have a fun time but I've still the face of my company and if I went around cleaning houses in that outfit I'd not only be the laughing stock of the nation, I'd probably cost alot of people jobs.  So thanks but no thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I could promise a way so that everyone thought it was normal?\"  Michael said with an excited grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie smiled but the look on Michael's face interested him, \"I'd say that can't happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael dropped the duster he'd been carrying and said, \"I'll be back in an hour!\"  and quickly rushed off to his house and went to the attic where under a thin layer of dust he grabbed the cards and went back to Reggie's.  Michael dealt out a hand and explained the rules, Reggie listened but didn't believe a word.  So when he folded and Michael said \"I want to swap eye color with Reggie,\" he didn't think too much of it until Michael pulled a compact mirror out of his purse.  Reggie couldn't believe it!  Micahel was telling the truth about the cards, \"So if what you're saying is true, then we could swap jobs and nobody would think it weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\"  Michael said smiling, \"But once we do this, there's no going back...at least for two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie didn't even hesitate, \"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two swapped occupations, Michael was now a retired computer programer who was getting million dollar paychecks still and Reggie was a French maid who just happened to have already had a billion dollars in his band account from before.  The two friends couldn't be happier for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael took the cards and went back home to where his lovely wife had just gotten home from school.  She was none the wiser about Michael's sudden change in occupation, and Michael was okay with that as with his new found life on easy street tackled his wife to the ground and began their journey towards happily ever after.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie and Michael would occasionally play poker with each other, usually just little things for kicks and giggles although Josie did enjoy letting Michael have the one penis once in a while even though she would always insist she keep it was a 'default' form.  The loving couple would go onto have 3 kids (the 2 girls birthed by Michael, and one boy by Josie).    They did eventually bring other friends of theirs and eventually their kids into the fold, but that's a story for another time.</span></div></div>",

You'll understand soon enough... but if you'd like a trial run, you're welcome to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Tiff, you spent so much money on yours, why give them up so easily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, Bill spent the money. And second, people look at me and see the big boobed sex bunny... no one thinks I could be smart, or clever, or that I have my own degree. And the fake boobs make them think I'm a bit of a gold digger or trophy... or worse. I'd like to be all natural again. I was about your size before the silicone, and it would be fun to drop back down for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather,\" Michael said, interrupting. \"Time limit's almost up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, then... I just say what I want to swap with who right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, that's it. Thirty seconds,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... um, then... I want to swap breasts with Amber,\" Heather finished with a burst, still not entirely convinced of the magic and feeling a bit of a fool. That feeling quickly fled as she felt her chest begin to expand, swelling with each breath in, and diminishing not an inch when she breathed out. It took nearly a minute for Amber's full DDs to settle on Heather's slender frame, and when they did, they looked even bigger on her than they did on Amber. \"Oh my... they... they go almost all the way to my belly!\" She said, rubbing her pregnancy swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Amber said, feeling how perky and firm Heather's breasts were and relishing in a feeling of lightness she hadn't had in years. \"When I was getting close to delivering my second, I swear I could rest them on my stomach. If you need to borrow some bras for those, you can, you'll be wanting the support.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't need to,\" Michael said as he passed the deck to Tiffany to shuffle. \"Her bras will be the right size, because those are now <i>her</i> breasts. Same for yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... just size, or will we swap bras?\" Amanda asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure it's just size so that things fit,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god... that's too funny!\" Tiffany laughed. \"I'm sorry Heather, but remember when we went shopping last week and I helped you pick out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Padded push up bras... guaranteed to make me look like I was 1-2 cup sizes bigger,\" Heather finished. \"You know, I knew it would be interesting, I guess it will be really interesting. Are we ready for another round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Tiffany said, dealing out the cards. The evening was looking interesting indeed. </span></div></div>",

She is mostly at work as a secretary in a big company. She still looks quite good for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was the oldest daughter of Gwendolyn with the age of 19. She works at as a shop clerk at a clothing store. Mary was 5\u201d8\u2019 tall, has smaller breasts than her little sister, only C-Cups, which makes her jealous sometimes. She has long brown hair. She usually babysits her younger brother when her mother is not at home. She was currently single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake, Josie\u2019s younger brother, was 11 years old and 4\u201d8\u2019 tall. He had curly, orange hair. He gets along with his sisters very well, although he normally annoys Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood you\u2019re here.\u201d, smiled Josie and let the three inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry that we had to bring Jake along to this girl\u2019s night but we couldn\u2019t find a babysitter.\u201d, apologized Gwendolyn. \u201cYou could have let me alone at home, mommy.\u201d, said Jake annoyed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be at this stupid girl\u2019s night!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d, smiled Anna. \u201cHe can play along. We wanted to play some poker.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three entered the living room where Cindy and Josie were sitting and already mixing the cards. \u201cWe have a special card deck.\u201d, explained Josie. \u201cThe winner can swap something between himself and one of the losers. I know it\u2019s hard to believe but it\u2019s true.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked skeptically at her sister. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s really hard to believe. But I doubt that you three want to play a prank on us.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no thing as magic!\u201d, said Jake and sat down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Don\u2019t believe us. Let\u2019s just play and we\u2019ll see if you still don\u2019t believe us after our first win.\u201d, said Josie and stuck her tongue out. \u201cOh, by the way.\u201d, she continued. \u201cWhile I exchanged the cards I found 4 new cards with a note. If someone wins and has one joker on his hand, she\u2026\u201d. Josie looked over to Jake. \u201cOr he, can swap something between two of the losers. He just has to say \u2018I want that X swaps Y with Z.\u2019. Oh, and if you win normally you have to say \u2018I want to swap X with Y\u2019.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d, said Mary, still not believing what her sister just said. \u201cWe can swap anything we can think of?\u201d. Josie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d, said Anna, grabbed the card and dealt them. \u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cards were played and everyone put down their hands. \u201cDid I win?\u201d, asked Jake. He never had played poker before in his life and had no real idea of when he\u2019d win and when not. Mary shook her head and smiled at him. \u201cNo, I won.\u201d, she said. Jake crossed his arms and leaned back. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this stupid game!\u201d, he whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled, got up and got over to him and tried to explain the rules to him, while Mary could make her swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what now?\u201d, asked Mary. \u201cNot like it would really work but I\u2019m kinda curious.\u201d. Josie smiled at her older sister. \u201cWell, it\u2019s very simple. You just say \u2018I want to swap X with Y\u2019, like I said before. But be careful. You may not believe it but just think about it if I may tell the truth. The swaps can\u2019t be reversed for 48 hours.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary nodded but still did not believe her. She had no idea what reason Josie would have had to lie to her but it was just too hard to believe. \u201cOh, right. I almost forgot.\u201d, said Josie. \u201cYou should hurry, you only have two minutes to choose or else the cards will.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 I doubt this is gonna work.\u201d, mumbled Mary. \u201cLet\u2019s see. I want to swap breasts with Josie.\u201d. She was so certain that her sister would now see that it would not work but suddenly her chest felt heavier and got heavier. She looked down to see her breast began to grow until they reached what Mary assumed were D-Cups. She then looked over to Josie whose breasts had become C-Cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d, exclaimed both Mary and Jake, who had looked up while Cindy was still explaining the game to him. \u201cMagic really exists!\u201d, gasped Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie grinned. \u201cI told you guys. What reason would I have to lie to you?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about people? Won\u2019t they ask questions why your breasts have gotten smaller, Josie?\u201d, intervened Gwendolyn. Josie shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry mom. Everybody who is not participating right now, will not notice a thing. For everybody else it will be that I had smaller breasts than Mary.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwendolyn nodded. \u201cI see\u2026\u201d. She began thinking of what might get possible with these cards. \u201cAnd you say in 48 hours we can swap back? By playing again or will it change back automatically?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t swap back something which belonged to you during some point in the game. After 48 hours you\u2019re allowed to swap this trait back. So for example, you could swap breasts with me now. Then you\u2019d have Mary\u2019s breasts and I had yours. Mary could not swap breasts with you since she already had these in the last 48 hours. But she may now swap breasts with me again, because she did not have yours in the time frame.\u201d, explained Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is quite complicated.\u201d, laughed Gwendolyn. \u201cBut okay, I think I got it now.\u201d. Now that she knew how it worked she thought about what she could change in her life. At least for a limited amount of time. \u201cSince they\u2019re good-for-nothing father had left me with the kids 8 years ago I had no real time for myself. And even before that I was mostly there for the family but not for me.\u201d, she thought. \u201cMaybe I can change something now. To get some holiday of my life.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said that we can swap everything we can imagine, right?\u201d, asked Josie\u2019s mother, just to make sure she could do something to get some change in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Anna explained her how it works. \u201cYes, Mrs. Mason. Everything you could think of. You could even swap ages, lives or work. The sky is the limit.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary, still astonished that she finally had bigger breasts than her little sister, something she could not say of herself for two years, looked down at her cleavage, then back at the cards. She still could not believe any of this. \u201cThis is really too much for me.\u201d, she said slowly. \u201cFive minutes ago I thought magic was just something little kids believed in, and some weirdos, and now I find out that it truly exists!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie smiled at her sister to comfort her a bit. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe. I couldn\u2019t believe it at first as well, although I think it wasn\u2019t so hard to accept it for me than for you.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think I got it now. Let\u2019s play! I\u2019ll win!\u201d, yelled Jake thrilled when Cindy was finally done with explaining the normal poker rules as well as the specific rules this card deck had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others laughed at Jake\u2019s reaction and quickly began mixing and dealing the cards. They did not want to let the only \u201cman\u201d at the table wait.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll win later.\u201d, smiled Gwen at her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have now two minutes to choose, right?\u201d, asked Gwen just to be absolutely sure. Josie nodded. \u201cGood. But before I say it out loud I have to ask you, if you agree with it Josie. I don\u2019t want to you to feel bad.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, mom?\u201d, asked Josie. She had no idea what it would be, her mother never mentioned anything towards any of kids regarding if she was unhappy. She did not want to let her children feel bad or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see. You and Michael you seem quite happy together\u2026 And well\u2026\u201d, she began to stammer. Gwen knew this was a hell of a question to ask her daughter. \u201cIt reminds me of Doug and me when we were young. But that changed a long time ago. I just thought\u2026 I mean this is temporary, right? So\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to swap boyfriends with me?\u201d, asked Josie although she already knew the answer and she got her response right away. \u201cYes. I know it\u2019s a very big request and I could understand if you say no. It\u2019s just that I want to experience these feelings again. Just once.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie had to think about this quick. She knew the time was ticking and who knew what would happen if the cards chose. She wanted her mom to be happy but although it was only temporary it felt strange to think that her boyfriend could be her mom\u2019s boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie finally answered: \u201c\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now let\u2019s see how we can examine if it really worked. Josie? Does Michael have a photo of you and him in his room?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie nodded. \u201cYup, he has. Right on his desk so he can see me every time he enters the room.\u201d, she said smiling romantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then. Let\u2019s go upstairs and check out.\u201d, suggested Anna and got up, followed by Gwen, Mary and Josie. Jake, still mad like a 6 year old, wanted to stay downstairs and Cindy decided to stay there as well and watch over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they entered the room they could see that the swap had worked right away. On aforementioned desk was a picture which usually showed Michael with his arm around Josie\u2019s shoulder and Josie leaning her head on his shoulder.

You can swap something else.\u201d, smiled Mary. \u201cJust think of what you want.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you should hurry. You only have two minutes to choose. Well, 45 seconds now.\u201d, said Josie but not as friendly as Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know.\u201d, he continued whining. \u201cThis game is stupid.\u201d. Jake crossed his arms and leaned back again, putting on a sulking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie shook her head and sighed. \u201cFine, let the cards choose. It seems you\u2019re fine with whatever you get.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the two minutes were over and Jake swapped something. But what and with whom?</span></div></div>",

I want that Mary swaps her face with Jake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's and Mary's faces began to morph and change to resemble each other's face.

She looked shyly at Michael, not completely sure if he really was her boyfriend now. She waited for him to make the first move. And he did.

We didn\u2019t swap anything, did we?\u201d. She could not come up with a possible solution. The friends had not found out about the two minutes limit so far. \u201cMaybe I should talk to Jeremy about this. Perhaps he found out something while being at home.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody really enjoyed being outside alone at this time. Her parents would have never allowed it but suddenly it seemed as if everything was fine with that. \u201cI could get used to this.\u201d, she smiled and soon arrived her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the house with the key she had in her purse. \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d, she called out while taking off her shoes. Her mother came out of the kitchen to greet her. \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d, she smiled. \u201cDid you have fun?\u201d. Melody nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it was real fun. Too bad it\u2019s already over.\u201d, she admitted and went over to the stairs. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m upstairs.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody then headed upstairs. Normally she would have chatted with her mother more but right now she was too interested to see if Jeremy had found anything out. Melody was surprised to see her brother sitting on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Jeremy. What are you doing in my room?\u201d, she asked him and received a big sigh from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your room anymore.\u201d, he explained. \u201cIt seems as if I have taken over your life or something. Michael\u2019s dad was treating me like some little girl. The same goes for mom and dad. They think I\u2019m their daughter. At first I couldn\u2019t believe it but then I inspected what should be your room. It looks mostly the same but look closer.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody did what her brother told her to do and looked around her room. Everything looked normal. There were still the pink walls, her bed with the pink bed sheets and fluffy pillows, also her stuffed animals were where they belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see any difference.\u201d, she told her brother while looking at the poster of various boy bands on her wall. Everything was like it was this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook closer.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody continued. She went over to her wardrobe and stopped there. She normally left one door slightly open, so she can access it faster. Now the door was closed. Curious she opened it and was astonished about what she found in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of her normal clothes there were now Jeremy\u2019s clothes in there. Except for the school uniform which was still the girl\u2019s uniform of her school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou exchanged everything to play a prank on me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d, she asked disbelievingly and looked into her brother\u2019s face. She knew that he did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy shook his head. \u201cNo. Sadly I did not. Go over to your desk and look at your homework.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody went slowly over there. She looked at aforementioned homework and gasped. While the text was still the same, the handwriting had changed. She recognized it as Jeremy\u2019s. Also the name on it had changed to Jeremy\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnbelievable!\u201d, she gasped. \u201cSo, everyone really thinks you\u2019re me. I had suspected it but couldn\u2019t believe it. But how? We hadn\u2019t swapped anything.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I\u2019ve been thinking about it for quite a while.\u201d, he said and stroke absentmindedly across his now smooth feminine legs. \u201cMaybe there really is a catch. I mean, it\u2019s quite strange that the cards allow you to swap but don\u2019t force you. Maybe we have to swap.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we didn\u2019t.\u201d, replied Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d, nodded Jeremy. \u201cBut remember when I wanted to swap attitude with Anna but nothing had happened? Maybe, just maybe, there is a time limit. I mean why else should nothing had happened. I mean look at our situation right now!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody nodded. Everything her brother told her made sense. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. So\u2026 Until we can swap back, I\u2019m stuck with being you.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d, sighed Jeremy. \u201cAnd I\u2019m you. At least our first names stayed the same but still. Let\u2019s just hope the following days won\u2019t be too awkward.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes me think\u2026\u201d. Melody crossed her arms and cocked her head to one side. \u201cIf we HAVE to swap\u2026 Anna neglected to swap, right? So what had been swapped then?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy shrugged his shoulders. \u201cNo idea. But I guess it was nothing physical and probably had nothing to do with us. I mean if we were in for the swap, we would have noticed by now, right?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeremy. It\u2019s time for bed!\u201d, called out a familiar voice, the two recognized as their mothers. Jeremy sighed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sucks. Now I have to go to bed soon. My own mom tells me again when I have to go to bed. I mean, I\u2019m 13 years old now and she still tells me when to go to bed.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. Also you know how mom is.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right.\u201d, he sighed and got up from his girly bed. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll brush my teeth then.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody left her former room together with her brother and then headed over to what was now her room. She smiled when she looked around. The room did not look as nice as her own but it was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the trophies Jeremy had gathered over the course of his life and at the sport posters in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will be weird but I think I\u2019ll have fun.\u201d, smiled Melody and threw herself on the bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy woke up the next morning by the sound of an alarm clock which did not sound like his own but sounded familiar. At first he was confused why he was lying in a bed with pink bed sheets and why the walls of his room were painted pink but he regained all the memories of last night very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d, he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m my sister now\u2026 Something I was really looking forward to\u2026\u201d. He then deactivated the clock and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least, I\u2019m still wearing my original clothes.\u201d, he said and rubbed over his pajama pants and felt the smooth, feminine legs beneath it. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t have everything.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got up from the bed and walked groggily outside the room to the bathroom. On his way there he met Melody who got out of her room just before him. \u201cMorning, s-\u2026 brother.\u201d, he said and had to remind himself that everyone would see her as a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody smiled at her \u201csister\u201d. \u201cMorning.\u201d, she said and entered the bathroom first. Normally Jeremy would have gone mad and screamed at her that he was going in first but today he was simply not in the mood. Therefore he leaned against the wall beside the bathroom door and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to going to school as you.\u201d, said Jeremy but Melody could not hear him, she had just entered the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess she\u2019ll enjoy it. I mean after all she gets to keep my friends. School will be very boring if I can\u2019t joke around with Cindy. Oh, well. I\u2019ll endure it.\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was waiting for Melody to finish, his mother came by. \u201cMorning, honey.\u201d, she smiled at Jeremy. \u201cI hope you slept well.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy nodded but stayed silent. He was not in the mood to talk to his mother right now. Luckily she left and began preparing breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can in.\u201d. Finally Melody came out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her body. Jeremy then entered without exchanging any word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jeremy had showered and dried himself, he went down where his mother, father and \u201cbrother\u201d were having breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father looked up from his newspaper. \u201cMorning, princess.\u201d, he smiled and reminded Jeremy once again that he was still considered a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning\u2026\u201d, replied Jeremy and sat down. The breakfast was luckily quiet. Nobody had to say something. Jeremy did not want to talk about anything right now, would be too awkward to try to pretend to be his parent\u2019s daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, I have to pretend to be Melody all day\u2026 Some peace now is very useful.\u201d, he thought and began eating his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was broken by his mother when everyone had finished eating. \u201cOkay, kids. Now get up and get dressed or else you\u2019ll be too late for school.\u201d, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, mom.\u201d, replied Melody and Jeremy in unison and went back to their respective rooms. Now was the moment Jeremy had feared since he had inspected the room yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough I got to keep my own clothes, I\u2019m still considered a girl\u2026 Which means I have to wear the girl\u2019s uniform of my sister\u2019s school.\u201d, he sighed and got the uniform out of the wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he put on the light blue blouse, and then he put the dark blue pullover over it. This was fairly normal so far. The worst part was still to come. He looked horrified at the pullover matching skirt and slipped it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly he put on the white, knee-high socks and the brown shoes. He looked into the mirror and immediately ridiculous. Although he had to admit that his legs looked really good in the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. You can do it.\u201d, he thought and got out of his room and ran right into Melody, dressed in his former school uniform. She began laughing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d, sighed Jeremy. \u201cThis really helps me a lot.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, bro- er sis.\u201d, she apologized. \u201cYou\u2019re just looking so ridiculous.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026 Anyway, let\u2019s go\u2026\u201d. Both left the house but not before Jeremy got a kiss on his forehead from his mom. He had not received one for years. He was too old for this but not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing what 4 years difference can make. Mom treats me like some completely different person.\u201d, said Jeremy when they had left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are a different person.\u201d.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy made it to Melody\u2019s school without running into anyone he or Melody knew. \u201cHere we are.\u201d, he thought when he looked at the big building. \u201cBeen a while since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked through the entrance, feeling embarrassed because he was wearing a skirt. He looked around, his face had turned red, but nobody seemed to notice. Everybody saw him as Melody, a girl. Jeremy breathed a sigh of relief. The cards magic did well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy entered the school with more confidence although it was still not enough to make him not feel ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Jeremy noticed one problem right away: He had no idea where Melody\u2019s locker was or what her combination was. \u201cGreat. She could have told me\u2026 Okay, she probably didn\u2019t think of it, just like me.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy went through the hallways, trying to think of a moment when Melody told him where her locker was but he could not remember one. He looked at the lockers, hoping he would find a trace which would lead to the deduction that this was Melody\u2019s locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, all looked the same. No name on it or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d, he thought. \u201cI\u2019m wandering around school, looking for a locker and even if I\u2019d find it, I have no idea what the combination was. Please god, send someone to help me!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Melody!\u201d, came a voice from behind Jeremy. Jeremy immediately turned around and saw a girl around Melody\u2019s age. Her name was Gina or Jean or something like that. Jeremy was not sure. He was not interested in what his sister did or who her friends were. What brother would be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled warmly at Jeremy. She had wavy brown hair which framed her face rather nicely. She was wearing the same uniform Jeremy was currently wearing. She had her hands behind her back and bowed slightly forward when she did not get any answer from who she thought was her friend Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s alright, Melody? Did Greg break up with you or why are you spaced out right now?\u201d, asked the girl, her face had changed from a warm smile to a worried and confused face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg?\u201d, thought Jeremy confused. \u201cWho\u2019s Greg? Does Melody have a boyfriend? Can\u2019t be, she would have bragged about this.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked at the girl and tried to answer something before she thought he was brain dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026  No. No. Everything\u2019s alright. I\u2019m just\u2026 er\u2026 sleepy.\u201d, he stuttered and hoped she would believe him. Jeremy never was good at lying or acting in that matter. Today and tomorrow would be a real challenge for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at him, raising an eyebrow. Jeremy\u2019s heart beat faster. \u201cShe looked through it.\u201d, he thought. \u201cShe know I\u2019m just a boy in a girl\u2019s uniform. She simply has to know. It\u2019s so obvious.\u201d. But then the girl\u2019s face returned to a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d, she smiled at him. \u201cI guess you\u2019ve been thinking about Greg all night.\u201d. Again. Who was this Greg? Jeremy had never met some Greg before. \u201cEr\u2026 yeah. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sleepy\u2026 And a bit jazzed. I\u2026 er\u2026 have forgotten where my locker is. Silly me, I know. I guess you can\u2019t show me where it is?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl suddenly laughed. \u201cOh man, you really are in love. Your brain can\u2019t have any other thought than Greg, huh? Come on, girl. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy, still wondering who the girl was talking about, followed her. At least this one problem was solved, he could get to \u201chis\u201d locker. Maybe she knew the combination and he could get her to tell him that. Jeremy felt like he could do it. \u201cShe didn\u2019t notice. Let\u2019s hope I can keep up this act.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived at the locker. \u201cErm\u2026 I kinda have forgotten my\u2026 combination.\u201d, he said embarrassed. The girl shook her head. \u201cLove really makes you stupid. It\u2019s 7, 25. The day you got together with Greg, remember?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes. Right. Thanks. I\u2019m really not me today.\u201d, he thanked her truthfully and opened his locker. Inside he saw some books and on the locker door was a photo which showed Jeremy in the girl\u2019s uniform and some guy he had never met before in his life. \u201cI suppose this is Greg.\u201d, he thought. Luckily there was also a timetable. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t have to ask her what subjects I have.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked at it and saw that he had maths as the first lesson. Jeremy never was good at maths but he was sure that what they went through in Melody\u2019s class would a piece of cake for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you at lunch.\u201d, smiled the girl and went away. \u201cThanks for helping the silly me.\u201d, replied Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy was relieved that he was alone now. Although she helped him, it was easier being Melody when nobody was around. He did not had to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy grabbed the maths book and went over to Ms. Anderson. He remembered her from the time he went to this school. She was unpopular among the students and loved to do surprise tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing had changed since then. Jeremy was not properly seated when she already got out the sheets of paper of the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d, he thought. \u201cI didn\u2019t study. Well, I guess I don\u2019t need to. I might not be good at this subject but this is stuff I already learned\u2026 kinda.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does he do in the test?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy felt completely ridiculed in his sisters school uniform. It did not help that nobody thought anything strange about it. It was the opposite, it made the situation even worse. The next thing was the math test he had to do. Normally it was no problem with him to solve the questions. He already did this class once. But it was different this time. Everytime he looked at an equation he immediately knew the answer but when he wanted to write it down it simply vanished from his mind. Math was not Melody's strong subject and he was only able to answer questions he was sure Melody would be able to answer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just great...\", he sighed in his mind and put the pen down frustrated. \"I know all the answers but somehow the magic that caused all this made it impossible to improve my sister's marks. I wonder if she has the opposite 'problem'. Oh, well. I try my best to do this.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy took the pen into his hand again and continued trying to do his best in this test but it was still annoying to know all the answers but not able to write them down. Still slightly frustrated, he rubbed his shapely, femine legs against each other. A strange feeling he began to like. \"Maybe I should ask Anna if I can keep them.\", he thought. \"But I doubt she will agree... What am I thinking? I don't want to keep them. I want my own legs back... right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy shook his head and tried to ignore the thought he had and instead do this class test. He had to concentrate on this and not his doubt. His missing knowledge he was needing for the class test was not really helping him in distracting him from these thoughts. Everytime he tried to solve it he was demotivated even more and more and began thinking about his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, or unluckily if you consider the class test, the time was over and the test was collected. He did not even answer half of the question. He felt guilty that he might have ruined his sister's mark. \"No... I tried my best and the cards seem to have made it impossible for me to write down answers Melody could not know or could not guess. It's not my fault.\", he tried to tell him but he still felt the guilt. \"Stop thinking about it.\", he thought and looked at his time table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great.\", he sighed. \"Last lesson is PE... Just great. I have to go through the humiliation in classes and then I have to do PE... As my sister...\". Jeremy slowly went to his locker which he luckily now knew. \"You can do it.\", he thought. \"It's just today and tomorrow.Tomorrow evening we can swap back... I guess... I'm not really sure... I mean, we did not swap on purpose. Maybe this is a side effect and we have to stay like this forever. No! You have to stop thinking so pessimistic. Everything is going to be fine!\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the school day was rather unspectacular. Jeremy cheated himself through the day by trying to blend in with the enviroment and being as quiet as possible. A gift a normal 13 year old did not have. Most of them were going through puberty and were therefore rather agitated to do something they have fun with and not to be in school. The boys were showing signs of interest in the girls, luckily for Jeremy, Melody was not attractive enough for the boys, yet. \"Or it has something to do with this Greg.\", he concluded but did not care. Whatever the reasin was why most of the boys did not even gave him a second glance (some did not even gae im a first one), he was happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also satisfied that he got through lunch without anybody noticing that he was not really Melody. He had problems telling the names of Melody's friends and got through with it by looking at them when talking. Not that he talkd much with them. He tried to avoid any social contact. It was not his intention to ruin Melody's lie and who knew what he could do? At least nobody asked him why he was so quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the subjet he had feared all day was about to start: PE. It was not the subject itself that he was afraid of. It was the thing before th actual subject that made him shiver with fear. He had to dress himself in the girl's lockerroom. He was afraid that anybody would notice that he was actually a boy. It was also not very exciting to be in a room with a bunch of girls who just hit puberty. If he could have been in the girl's lockerrom in his own school that would have ben a different thing. Something he would have looked forward to. But here? Not really something someone who is not having pervert fantasies of kids would look forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy stood in front of the room and sighed. \"Well...\", he mumbled to himself. \"I guess here we go...\". He gently pushed the door open and entered the room. He assumed he was the last one, he had stood for quite a while out there. All the \"other\" girls were already undressed. Jeremy saw a girl he had been having lunch before and went over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\", he forced himself to smile. He had no idea what her name was. She was about 4\"8' tall and had long brown hair. She was only dressed in a pink trainingsbra and panties. She seemed to be developing breasts rather late. The other girls already had at least something you could girl breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back at him and began dressing herself into her sports outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far so good.\", thought Jeremy and opened the locker beside the one of the girl. Luckily it had the same combination as \"his\" other locker. In there he found his gym clothes. \"Thank god I don't have to wear a sportsbra or something like that. Just my plain, old gym clothes.\", he thought happily and began undressing himself, still feeling akward to be naked around such young girls. \"Under normal circumstances I would have been thrown into prison by now for sure.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy noticed that his shorts had transformed to a more girly cut to show off his feminine, shapely legs even better. \"I shouldn't have said anything about my clothes.\", he sighed and looked down at his legs. He really had to admit, if these were not his own legs right now and if they would not belong to this annoying Anna, he would probably be all over the girl who has so great legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy left the lockerroom as the last one and got out into the gym. The boys and girls had gathered at a bench and were talking to each other. Jeremy sat down beside the girl he met in the lockerroom. The coach then began explaining what they would do now. It was:</span></div></div>",

I'm going to teach you how to dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single boy in the gym groaned at hearing this news from the girl's PE teacher.  An outcry of prepubescent boy's voices cried out, things like \"But we don't WANT to do that?\" and \"What about dodge ball?\"  While the girls on the other hand seemed to have the complete opposite reaction.  Most of the girls started to chatter amongst themselves at hearing the news eying and pointing at the boys.  Jeremy even noticed the shy girl next to him blushing and smiling at the news.  Jeremy on the other could not be more disappointed.  As crummy as this day was, and as mortifying he knew PE in particular would be, he at least was looking forward to letting out some of those frustrations playing dodge ball.  He couldn't exactly let those frustrations out learning how to foxtrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy's thought and all of the chatter was put to a rest when the boy's PE blew his whistle, \"Now boys I know you are disappointed that there won't be dodge ball this week.  But trust me, years from now you will look back and be glad we did this for you.  Little things like dancing are going to stick with you and help you out later in life.  Now everybody pair up before I have to pick your partners myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all most of the girls needed to here as most of them practically sprinted towards a boy, most of them straight up asked if they wanted to dance although most wanted to play coy and wait for the boy to ask.  Jeremy was in no such rush and just sat against the wall hoping nobody would notice.  Sadly for him the girl's coach did see him and went to Jeremy to talk.  \"Melody, you'd better hurry up, or else all the boys will be taken.  You don't want that now do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy seriously considered giving the coach an honest answer, but knew that could be disastrous for Melody's reputation.  \"No mam.\" Jeremy said as he reluctantly got up to find a dance partner.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy went over to the boys and let out a big sigh. He really was not ready for dancing with a boy only half his size. Okay, they went to his shoulders but still. \u201cWait\u2026\u201d, thought Jeremy shocked. \u201cDid I just think that I wasn\u2019t ready for dancing with a boy smaller than me but had not thought a minute that I should never dance with a boy?! I guess the cards will keep me Melody mentally\u2026 Let\u2019s hope not too much.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he arrived at the group of boys which was mixed with girls, it looked like almost every boy was taken, a shy boy came over to Melody. He stopped before him and looked to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great. Some shy boy seems to ask me to dance.\u201d, thought Jeremy but was slightly happy that he was not the one who would have to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-melody.\u201d, the boy said and was red like a tomato in one second. He looked to the ground, had his arms behind his back and one of his feet was circling on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a clich\u00c3\u00a9\u2026\u201d, thought Jeremy. \u201cI\u2019d never have thought I\u2019d say a shy boy like this outside of cartoons. Well, you never know what you might encounter until you encounter it, right?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-w-would y-you like t-to d-d-d-d-dance with\u2026 m-me\u2026\u201d, the boy stuttered and Jeremy felt bad if he would give him a no. \u201cPoor little boy\u2026\u201d, thought Jeremy and looked at him. \u201cIf I say no, his heart will be crushed into the ground. I don\u2019t have a choice here, do I? Also\u2026 I don\u2019t really want to ask anyone else\u2026 Sorry Melody, even if you don\u2019t want to dance with a shy guy, I don\u2019t want to dance with anyone.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d, smiled Jeremy and tried to do his best and warm smile at the boy. Maybe this would give him a little more self-esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cReally?\u201d, he asked disbelievingly and earned a nod from Jeremy. A big smile formed on the boy\u2019s face and the two went back to the benches to sit down and wait for the teacher to start the dancing class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay it seems that everybody has found a partner.  Now all come over and position yourself in front of your partner.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy and the boy did as they were told just like the rest of the class. When they were in position, Jeremy looked at the boy who could not look at Jeremy. \u201cHe\u2019s really shy\u2026 Extremely shy\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class then got some instructions on dance moves and had to copy them. Easier said than done, especially if the leading boy was too shy and was more looking at his feet than his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he has a crush on Melody. I don\u2019t believe that he reacts like this with anybody.\u201d, concluded Jeremy just seconds before the boy stepped on one of Jeremy\u2019s feet. A real tough challenge considering that the boy was almost only looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch.\u201d, groaned Jeremy instantly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d, cried the boy out right away and loud enough so that everybody in the gym could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLess shouting, more concentrating, Mr. Porter!\u201d, grunted the boy\u2019s coach at the boy. Jeremy remembered that the boy\u2019s coach normally only referred to the boy\u2019s with their last name. Only if a boy did something very good, then he would use the first name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d, mumbled the boy and looked back down at the ground.</span></div></div>",

I mean, look at it this way: We can change everything we want about us and the others and no one will notice it. How exciting is this?\", she justified her decision of swapping enthusiasticly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was astonished. He had not believed that his own girlfriend would like the whole idea. Sure, it was pretty exciting but terrifying as well. Who knew what consequences one little swap had? \"Then choose...\", Michael said hasitently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. Let's see...\", Josie responded thinking about all the possibilities she had. \"Maybe a swap with Michael would be funny. Giving him my hair? My breasts? I hate choices, especially when it is uncertain that I get this choice again.\", she thought while glaring at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\", grunted Anna, her arms crossed across her chest. \"We don't have all night!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I'm thinking.\". Josie glared at Anna. She would have loved it to swap her legs just to get back on her but these legs were already on Jeremy and she did not really want the legs anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay. I want to swap pants with Michael.\", she said. Looking down she saw that her woolen, knee-length skirt turned into Michaels Jeans. On the other hand Michael was now clad in her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked suprised at her. \"Why did you swap that?! I mean look at me.\", he asked her. \"We~ll, I just thought you would look good in my skirt.\", she grinned at him, \"And later you will have to show my how all my pants and skirt fit you.\", she added still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shook his head and noticed that he now discovered a side on his girlfriend he did not know. She was always a cute, modest girl. Nothing that would let her stand out and now he found out that she had some dark side which enjoyed watching him in skirts. Who knows what else he will find out about her. He was certain that he would not like what he will find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Melody was suprised that her cell phone rang. \"Who could that be?\", she asked herself looking insecure at it and then answered it. \"Hello?\", she asks uncofidently and then her eyes grew wide. \"What? No...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others looked at her interested. Even Anna who was gazing the whole time was now looking at Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of stummeling words, Melody hang up and looked at Anna, her face deathly pale. \"Who was it?\", asked Jeremy curiously. None of his sisters friends could have called her that was for sure, because otherwise she would not be so pale and would not have reacted so strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg...\", she slowly said. Jeremy looks at his little sister even more confused. \"Who's Greg?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody swallowed and than pointed her finger at Melody. \"I think he is your boyfriend... but apparently now he is mine.\", she said slowly still shocked because of the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's eyes grew as wide as possible. \"What?! How can this be?! You don't even know him and he surely wouldn't want to be with a little girl!\", she shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if you two had swapped?\", asked Michael trying to figure out what happened. He quickly grabbed the manual and after a short search he found the passage he overread ten minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\", he slowly began with ashamed smile. \"It seems I overread one very important passage. According to the manual you really have to swap somehting. If you don't you will get something swapped after two minutes.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I get to know that now?!\", Anna was raging. \"If I had known this before I would have swapped something stupid! Now I lost my boyfriend to this brat because of you!\", she shouted at Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-calm down, sis...\", Michael stumbled. \"I'm sorry I overread the passage but mistakes happen, okay? You can try to get him back in two days. And I'm sure Melody isn't very happy either, right Melody?\". The still very pale Melody nodded. \"I don't even know this guy who now claims to be my boyfriend.\", she whispered with a faint voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna crossed her arms again. This time because of anger instead of boredom. \"Fine! Let's continue! If I have lost everything what meant something to me in life I have nothing to lose!\". She glared at Michael with a gaze which could kill someone. \"And hope that I won't win again. I'll get you for what you've done to me. You'll pay!\", she threatened her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael gulped. \"Fine...\". The group continued playing another hand. This one was won by...</span></div></div>",

Then I should swap something else... Maybe your penis? No. I'm sure you would enjoy it.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna knew that she could tease him the best when she was doing this. The tension created by not knowing what his punishment was, was the most terrible act she could do. Luckily she only had two minutes to tease him after that anything could happen and that was something she did not really want to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we swap genders? I look ridiculous anyway and you being a girl would be fun.\", again she shook her head. Michael was amazed that Anna could keep up this evil grin the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I think I know what I should swap.\". Then came a few seconds of silence. For Michael these seconds felt like hours. \"I want to swap sexual preferences with Michael.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", Michael blinked surprised. \"Did it work?\", asked Josie, who was as shocked as Michael was. \"I-i don't know...\", he stuttered looking at his girlfriend. He looked at her and was confirmed that it worked. There was nothing he was attracted to on her. He found her beautiful but not in a sexual way. Then he looked at her boob in particular. Nothing. He could not remember why he would think they were something arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear Josie, it worked.\", Anna said with a cold voice. Her evil grin grew tired and was now only faint but noticable. \"When I look at your breasts I get aroused and by the reaction of my dear brother I think he's not getting aroused by them.

With her eyes still locked on Michael and giving him a look which let him know that he will not like what was coming. \"Okay, Mikey.\", she said slowly, enjoying this moment to it's fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already have my underwear. You like it, don't you?\", she smirked. Michael shook his head and glared at her but did not say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, you will have much fun, especially with my sexual preferences. Who knows? Maybe you're attracted by your own reflection?\", she laughed. \"And you certainly look good in Josie's skirt, don't you?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocked her head from one side to another. \"And now... Yeah, I think this will be interesting.\", she paused for a moment, just to make it more difficult for Michael. \"I want to swap gender with Michael.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked shocked at her and then slowly down at himself. Nothing had changed. He still looked like himself, even though he was wearing Josie's skirt and had a slight bump created by his sister's skirt, he was still male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Anna had grabbed her purse and took out her ID. She was confused like Michael when nothing happened but the glance on her ID explained everything. She threw the card on the table and grinned sheepishly at Michael. \"It seems you're my sister now, Mikey.\", she said, pointing at the gender section of the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael gulped as he read it. According to her ID Anna was now male even though she looked clearly female and had a clearly female name. This would mean he was now female. Anna's sister. With horror he looked over to Josie. She was shocked as well, who would not be? Moments ago she had a boyfriend and suddenly she had a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made my boyfriend a girl!\", Josie screamed at Anna and jumped up from her seat. The game was certainly out of control. What began as a peaceful poker game between frined was now a war between two of them. Michael grabbed Josie's arm in order to prevent her from attacking his so called brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be a fun game.\", Jeremy said looking at the two fighting girls. \"We shoudl stop playing or someone gets hurt.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already got hurt by this bitch!\", screamed Josie. \"Not physically but mentally!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boohoo, poor baby. It's the fault of your boyfriend... sorry I mean your girlfriend of course.\", Anna responed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your fault! You did all of this to him! This should be a fun game and not some punishment for him!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy grabbed the cards and put them into his pocket. \"That's enough!\", he said. \"I take these cards and you won't get your hands on them within the next two days. This should be fun and if you can't stop fighting we'll stop playing.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the bitch has to pay!\", Josie grunted to Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? That's the problem! I take the cards and hide them.\". Jeremy looked at Michael. \"I'm sorry for you. See you tomorrow at school.\", he said to his best friend and really felt sorry for him. Jeremy stood up feeling strange to stand with his new hairless and shapely legs, property of Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked at Melody. \"Come on, little sis.\", he said, \"Let's go home.\". he took Melody by his hand  in order to get her out of the chair and left the garden and went home. Philipp followed the two of them, unhappy that he had not won one game and could not get Josie's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining three looked at eac h other. \"I'm going to my room.\", Anna bristled with anger, standing up and walking into the house with Jeremy's former legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at Josie who sat down and leaned back in the chair. He still held her arm because he wanted to make sure she does not attack Anna the moment he let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... We should clean up...\", Michael said. \"And then we should get upstairs. My mom said you can sleep-over. It's my birthday.\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything is cleaned up the two went up and entered Michael's room. It still looked normal except the walls were now pink. Probably because he was now considered a girl. It was still untidy and there were bras, panties, skirts and other clothing articles all over the place. His posters had changed as well. Instead of posters of bands or movies he liked there were posters of handsome looking guys and even a poster with Robert Pattinson. Looking at them Michael felt strangely aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... looks like I'm really a girl now...\". Michael looked at Josie. \"The only thing I don't understand. If I'm attracted at guys and I'm a girl... why am I in a relationship with you?\". Josie shrugged her shoulders. \"Maybe you're a straight girl and try to look like a lesbian? I never heard of such a case but why shouldn't it be possible?\". Michael nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... let's get to sleep. Tomorrow's monday and we have school.\", Michael mumbled.</span></div></div>",

The best part of the morning should have been waking up with Josie snuggled up in bed next to him, but that felt more like having a best friend over than anything else. He woke up sporting fairly usual morning wood, but was disturbed at the fact he'd been dreaming of Jeremy most of the night, in between tossing and turning and fretting about school today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he'd faced the horror of his closets. He knew that Josie owned pants, but when she had traded her skirt for his pants, it seemed like it had traded <i>all</i> of his pants for <i>all</i> of her skirts. He didn't own a single pair of pants anymore! And his underwear was completely gone, replaced by Anna's frilly panties and lacy bras. At least he still had his comfortable shoes, but the rest was a nightmare. After picking out a pair of panties and a bra in basic white that didn't make him feel too girly he tackled the challenge of a skirt but couldn't find one that went below his knees by more than an inch or two, and he certainly didn't want to wear any of the short mini skirts that had belonged to Josie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I don't think I can do this,\" he said in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd agree with that. You can't do that skirt with the shirt you're holding, and you really should shave your legs first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he said stunned. \"Shave my legs? Won't the deck make it seem normal for me to be like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... the deck will make everyone think your a girl. And it's normal for a girl to wear a skirt... and shave her legs for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I usually am, and that's why you love me so much,\" she chirped with a smile and a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, that and your amazing modesty. Okay, I need to hurry if I have to shower and shave that much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your self a favor,\" she said, grabbing an electric beard trimmer. \"Buzz off the bulk of that coat of fur on your legs or you'll clog the razor every two inches and it will take forever. Then hustle back so I can help you with make up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" he said, taking the trimmer. \"It's going to be a long day.\"</span></div></div>",

This does not exclude non school-related items like make-up. Michael protested putting it in there but Josie insisted that he needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the school Michael felt ridiculed. He constantly try to pull his skirt down.

Everyone can see my boxers, erm panties.\", he whined and recieved just a glare from Josie. \"No, they won't! It's long enough no one will see anything as long as you don't take it off, so stop it.\". Michael nodded slowly and took his hands off of the skirt. His newly shaven legs felt strange, rubbing against each other with nearly no resistance of hair. The white bra which previously belonged to Anna felt strange und his shirt and it began itching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael opened his locker and saw that he had photos of some male model's in it. \"Just great...\", he mumbled. \"First the horrible posters in my room and now that.

First the girl's locker room and I had nothing in mind looking at girl's undressing around me. I have to not think about all the times I was in the boy's locker room prior to the game...\", he cut off and blushed. Thinking back about his \"natural state of being\" he was turned on by the thought of all the boys undressing around him. It was just like it should have been when he entered the girl's locker room today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Michael. Are you still with us?\", Josie asked, waving her hand in front of his face. Michael blinked lost in thoughts but soon shook his head. \"Er yeah... Were was I?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were talking about the guys you wanted to sleep with.\", she picked on him. It was fun to her to annoy him this way but it still hurt. She knew it was not permanent but it really hurt that her boyfriend looked at her as if she was just a friend. She knew it was not his fault, not directly, but still it was very painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny...\", Michael mumbled. \"Well anyways. It was strange wearing your shorts and my sisters sports-bra. And the boys in their shorts and their tight T-shirts were really distracting me. Is it really so hard for a girl to be not attracted? It seems as if most of you are thinking about other things.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think there are two reasons for this. First: You're not used to having this feelings. Normally you look after every ass. Yes, I notice that, don't try to deny that. So I think this is your normal sex drive just on the other gender. Second: You swapped with your sister and she is... How can I put that friendly? A bitch. Maybe that effects you as well.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded, thinking about what she said. It made sense. Even though he really loved Josie, even does now, even though he is not attracted by her anymore, he often looked after girls. He can at least look, he would not cheat on Josie! never! Well, maybe now because he was not sure how far this sexual preference swap would affect him if some very handsome guy stands before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyways, I have to go to may classes. Let's meet after school and go to the mall. We could go get some new skirts for you.\", she grinned and went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael simplay nodded and went to his next clas which was biology. He hated this subject and he surely would not like it now.</span></div></div>",

Michael did not know why they did this right now but he had no choice than to obey the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if it could not have been any worse: He had to work together with a boy. Even more worse: Greg Masterson. He was the quarterback and a macho and would normally pick on Michael but apparently not today. Today, Greg looked at him with a look he normally looked at girls. Girls, he would be sleeping with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\", Greg grinned at Michael, who was grossed out by this. He did not thought that being a girl would change everything so drastically. Well, technically he was no girl even though he was physical male and only wore a skirt and well, a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\", Michael replied, looking away and onto the frog. He wanted to avoid eye contact with Greg. Michael was not sure how his new hormones would let him act infront of Greg and he surely did not want to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry.\", Greg tried to cheer him up because he thought that Michael's reaction was because of cutting up a frog. \"I'll do the dissection and you just watch.\". Greg looked at Michael with a big grin which would normally melt a girl's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Michael was not looking, his eyes still fixed on the frog which was lying on the table in front of him. But Michael was not sure if he could avoid any looks at Greg. \"Er... Thanks...\", Michael mumbled. \"That's er... sweet of you...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange that he doesn't know that I'm in a relationship with Josie... Maybe he does know and tries to convert a lesbian back to hetero.\", Michael thought, his eyes still locked on the frog. \"If I have to look at it the whole time I really have to puke. I don't like frogs and certainly don't like looking at them.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg then took the scalpel and began cutting open the frog. Michael looked disgusted away. Looking at a frog was bad enough for Michael but looking at one being cut open was something completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky you have me, right?\", Greg grinned cutting the frog even even wider open. \"Y-yeah...\", Michael stummered and looked away from the frog and right at Greg. Michael swallowed heavily. He did not noticed it before but Greg really looked handsome. Michael knew this was certainly because of his new sexual preferences but still he could not fight this feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst of all, his skirt began tenting up looking at the handsome quarterback. His panties did the best to contain his hard-one. \"I have to look away... But I can't... He looks too good. I can't keep my eyes away.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look you can see everything that's inside of it now.\", Greg said and looked at Michael now. Their eyes met and Michael got lost in them. Greg smiled broadly with his best smile. \"How about we go see a movie after school?\", Greg suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael slowly got back from his eyes and answered...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy's morning was not as strange as Michael's but still different than the usual mornings he had. From the beach pictures he had on his desk he discovered that it was normal for him to shave his legs. No wonder considering he now had Anna's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second shaver in the bathroom his sister and he shared made that obvious as well. Therefore it was quite a morning for Jeremy when he tried to shave his legs after his shower. Anna would go on rage if she would see her legs now with some minor cuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven stranger was the conversation his mother had with his sister while the two were eating breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack really is no good association for you.\", Jeremy's mom began while dropping your breakfast infront of you. \"He's 4 years older and all he thinks about is fooling around. You should break up.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy had to smile by the thought of it. Yesterday Melody was the innocent, lovely daughter without a boyfriend and now she had one older than herself who is, according to his mother, a good for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mommy, I er love him.\", Melody tried to play along. She did not really know who her boyfriend was, neither did she met him but apparently her mother did not like him. On one hand, Melody was excited because her life was now a bit different, in the interesting way. On the other hand she was afraid of how her boyfriend was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even know what love is! You're too young!\", their mother continued, stemming her hands at her hips and looking serious at Melody. \"When I was your age I didn't even thought about dating guys!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy who had enough of this conversation, grabbed his toast and stood up. \"Come on Melody, we have to hurry.\". Melody nodded thankfully. \"Okay, have fun at school kids. But don't think this conversation is over, young lady!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Melody looked thankfully at Jeremy. \"Thanks big brother. This conversation is kind of... disturbing...\", she said looking down exhausted. \"I'm really afraid of coming home...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little sis. I'll try to help you if I can. Maybe having a boyfriend isn't so bad for you.\", he said trying to cheer her up. She nodded hesitantely. \"Maybe...\", she began but was cut off by a honk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuprised the two looked at where the noise came from. On the street was a car and the window was down. Inside the car was a maybe 17 year old boy with short black hair. \"Hey babe. Shall I give you a lift?\", he asked looking at Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's your new boyfriend.\", Jeremy whispered in his sisters ear. She looked at Jeremy, unsure what to do. \"Let him give you a ride.\", Jeremy continued whispering to her. \"I don't think he'll do something to you and you should try to act as if this is normal.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody nodded and looked at the boy in the car. She nodded nervously. \"Yeah... thanks... er... honey?\", she said softly, slowly walking towards the car. She entered it on the passengers side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at Melody and bend over planting a kiss on her lips. \"Slept well, babe?\", he asked her. Melody nodded slowly. She was too surprised. She just got her first kiss from some guy she had not met until a few moments ago. \"Good.\", he smiled cocky and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy meanwhile, looked the car drive away. \"Well, I should continue.\", he mumbled rubbing the cuts on his legs which he hid under his pants. They still hurt a bit but lucky enough nothing too serious he could not bear. After all they were just minor cuts. Slowly, like all his sister did this morning, he walked to school.</span></div></div>",

The strangest part came when he ran into Anna in the locker room before gym class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jeremy,\" Anna said, sitting down on the bench next to him and pulling off her shirt. It was weird to see her breasts just out in the open like that, and no one else reacting to it. As far as the rest of the room was concerned, Anna was just another one of the guys, and being topless was no big deal for guys. And if she happened to have a set of man-boobs, well, that was something you didn't tease another guy about unless you were being really mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anna,\" Jeremy said, trying to cover how awkward the whole thing felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I've forgotten about the fact that you have my legs. Tomorrow, we're going to play a game again so that I can get those back, before you cut them up any worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Anna,\" Jeremy said, running a hand over his smooth pale thigh. \"I won't mind at all. But then can we put Michael back to right? He didn't deserve everything you did to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, probably not... and yeah, I'll put her back to right tomorrow. But I'm enjoying being 'one of the guys' for now. I almost wish I had swapped genitals with Michael, just so I could do the whole 'pee standing up' thing. But it's still cool. And I seriously got myself off last night just looking in the mirror! It was awesome. And it looks like when we swapped preferences and genders, I got Michael's porn stash too. Now that I know why guys like big boobs so much, I might have to see if I can win Josie's tomorrow. Anyway, we're going to be late, I'll see you on the track.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Anna,\" Jeremy said, tying his shoe laces and taking one last look at the smooth sexy legs coming out of his gym shorts. \"Well,\" he said to himself. \"At least none of the real guys have said anything about the legs...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy got home just in time to see Greg's car leaving the house. \"Huh, he can't have stayed long. Mom must still be bent out of shape about him being Melody's boyfriend.\"  Getting all the way up to the house though, the reason that Greg couldn't have stayed long became obvious. Parked next to his mother's SUV was a cherry red mustang, car of his dreams and property of his mom's kid sister Helen. \"Score, Aunt Helen is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the house, Jeremy smiled when his Aunt Helen stood up and came over to hug him. While his mom had just turned forty last year, Aunt Helen was only twenty five, and worked as a swimsuit model most of the year. She couldn't visit often because she traveled so much, but when she came, she always had gifts to give and stories to tell. Plus, she was just really cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy, it's good to see you!\" She said with a huge smile. \"You still studying hard to get into engineering school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just glad that finals are over for last term. My calculus teacher is brutal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, some times I wish I'd gotten the brains in the family... it'd be nice to have a normal desk job that didn't involve spending so much time on planes and living out of hotels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be cool to spend so much time on planes,\" Melody piped in, flopping down onto one of the living room couches. \"You always tell the neatest stories about the places you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I go neat places,\" Aunt Helen said with a smile as she settled her 5'11 frame down onto another couch and stretched out. \"But it makes it hard to do things like.... oh,have a steady boyfriend. Was that this Greg fellow your mom has been telling me about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Melody said blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks cute, you should hang on to him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now none of that sis,\" Jeremy's mom said as she came into the room. \"Maybe when she's twenty and he's twenty four I'll think differently about it. At that age, four years isn't that much. But he's seventeen and she's thirteen and that's not a difference I'm comfortable with. I don't want him pressuring her for sex before she's old enough, and you know how boys are at that age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right mom,\" Jeremy said, teasing. \"That's all we do... think about sex all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I meant,\" she said, adjusting her skirt over her wide hips as she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Beth,\" Helen said, raising an elegantly manicured hand in a gesture of 'I give up.' \"They're your kids and I'll stay out of it. And you're right about one thing,\" she said turning to Melody. \"You're too young for sex, so if that's all he wants, dump his ass. If he's worth it, then it's worth waiting for. You don't have to be married, but at least be old enough to make the choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Aunt Helen,\" Melody said blushing and thinking about the ten minutes she'd spent making out with Greg in his car before he'd driven her home. \"I don't think I've known him long enough to even think about sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" her mother said. \"Now, I was thinking that we should have a family fun night, since we're all here together. So, I've ordered up a few pizzas... and yes Helen, I got you a veggie, no cheese, extra thin crust... and I found this deck of cards while I was cleaning that sounds really interesting. It says that whoever wins each hand gets to swap something with the loser. I thought it would be fun to play a round of Hearts with it tonight, and then in two days, when Helen has to get back on a plane, we can play again to swap things back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that sounds like lots of fun,\" Helen said, grabbing the desk and starting to shuffle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy and Melody just looked at each other, uncertain if they should play or not. Finally, Jeremy shrugged and said \"Sure, why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen dealt the cards out as everyone hunkered down to the serious business of the first trick... and the winner was: </span></div></div>",

Since you've always had such stunning legs, I want to swap legs with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh no, not again</i>,' Jeremy thought as he felt the changes begin. Years ago, he assumed his mother had a figure much like Helen's, long sexy legs and a perky but full chest. She'd probably been quite the looker. But now, two kids and nearly twenty years later, she'd let herself go a bit. Now, Jeremy watched as his pants changed sizes, growing as his mother's thunder thighs filled his pants legs and his ankles thickened to cankles. They weren't horribly fat or obese legs, but they had the faint ripples of cellulite and the trace here and there of spider veins that you would expect of a woman entering her forties with two teenage children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Elizabeth on the other hand, the experience was wonderful as she saw her own legs melting into Anna's shapely legs. Gone were the spider veins and cellulite, leaving in their place only smooth teenage perfection, marred slightly by the collection of razor nicks that Jeremy had left behind. \"You know,\" she said as she looked over her new legs. \"Remind me to teach you to shave properly while you have those legs son... My legs are a little rougher to take care of than yours and if you're nicking yourself this badly then we need to go over proper shaving again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure mom,\" Jeremy said, looking over his hand and getting ready for the next trick. \"Melody, it's your turn to lead...\"</span></div></div>",

Her sister nodded. \"Yeah, in two days we play again just before you go and change everything back to normal, so don't worry. Just choose anything you like. It's just to make life a bit more interesting.\", Elizabeth smiled at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish it would have worked out like that yesterday.\", Jeremy thought looking down at his bigger and older legs. \"Although I now have something I really don't like. At least I don't freak out like Anna did.\". Jeremy rubbed his new legs thinking about how different they felt from his own legs and how different they felt from Anna's legs. Elizabeth looked at Jeremy and saw how he looked at his legs. \"Don't worry, sweety. You'll get your legs back. Just see it as an interesting new experience.\". Jeremy simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. If it's just for fun and just for a while. I want to swap lives with Melody.\", Helen said smiling at her 13-year old niece. Both suddenly were on the others chair but nothing else had changed. \"Didn't it work?\", Helen asked. \"It should have.\", Melody mumbled. Elizabeth looked at the family photo taken half a year ago. \"It did work.\", she said pointing at the photo. \"You were away for some shoot, Helen, even though I'd loved to have you on the picture. Look now. You're in there and Melody is absent.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the picture the family was dressed in their best attire, Elizabeth showing of her well shaped teenage legs in her black dress, Jeremy and his father both in a black suit and in the position Melody was before was now Helen dressed in a frilly pink dress. \"So I'm my niece now for real?\", she asked disbelieving. \"But nothing has changed. I still wear what I wore before. I still look like myself.\". \"I think,\", Jeremy began. \"Life swap only includes the actual life but not appearance, clothing or something like that.\". Jeremy pointed at the photo. \"This is definately not a dress Melody would wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen nodded. \"Makes sense. But am I still named Helen?\". Jeremy shrugged his shoulders. \"Just one way to find out. Look at you ID.\", he said. \"Good idea, Jeremy.\", she smiled, grabbed her purse and got out her ID. \"It's true. My birth date changed. And I'm now Helen Parker and not Helen Walker. Feels like I've married.\", she laughed and looked at her sister. \"Well, it seems I'm now your daughter.\". Melody looked rather happy about the change. \"And I'm now mommy's sister.\", she giggled and then looked at Jeremy. \"And you have to call me Aunt Melody now.\". She giggled even wilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this certainly is interesting. May I ask why you swapped with my daughter?\", asked Elizabeth curious about her sister's motivation. \"You know, because of my job I just don't have time for having a boyfriend and now that Melody has one I thought I should check on him. Just to see if he's nice and all. Also I think it's a nice disctraction from work if I go back to school again. I might as well learn something in 8th grade.\", she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And I assume you didn't swap with me because you don't like ending up as a housewife and with Steven?\", Elizabeth asked and her former sister nodded. \"Well, okay then. Let's continue.\". After an exciting showdown ... won.</span></div></div>",

He refrained from swapping her yesterday and was not really in the mood to swap with her now. He then looked at his aunt who was now considered his sister. It would be interesting to swap her breasts. They were really good looking and well shaped but he was not a pevert like Philipp. On the other hand it was really hard for him to decide on something which would not let him look like a pevert. He was playing with his mother, sister and aunt after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I know.\", he said and looked at his mother who currently believed she possessed her son's legs while they were really Anna's legs. \"I want to swap jobs with mom.\", he said.

He found it strange to call his mother by her first name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as his mom's first name was spoken out loud his student card suddenly vanished. \"I think now it works.\", he said smiling at the thought that he could now stay home while his mother had to go to school. \"I think this will be interesting.\", Elizabeth said smiling just like Jeremy did. \"I can go to school and enjoy my stay there.\". Jeremy laughed at his mother. \"Enjoy? School is horrible! I'll enjoy staying here.\". \"We'll see son, we'll see.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen giggled. \"Funny. My sister... er... my mother. It feels strange to call you like that.\", she smiled at Elizabeth. \"Anyway, we're going back to school while the kids will stay at home. I really hadn't thought such a thing would happen when I arrived today.\". Elizabeth nodded. \"Yeah, it'll sure be a unique experience. Now then, we should continue. I think it'll be even more interesting if we swap more.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy leaned back in his chair, making planes of what he should do tomorrow. He had all morning to play videogames or watch movies. He really did not know why his mother said staying at home would be that bad. Melody had meanwhile grabbed her purse, looking at her new driving license. She even found some photos from a shooting \"she\" had recently attended to. \"I look sexy.\", she though looking at herself in a skimpy bikini and posing in different sexy poses. \"But I'm underdeveloped...

Jeremy shuddered at the thought of having his mom's sagging breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then smiled at him. \"Don't worry, I don't want to burden you on anything. Even though it would be quite a relief for me. They can really be a nuisance.\". She played with the thought for a short while but then decided against it. \"Maybe I should swap ages with you.

It did not occur to her that her mom intended to swap everything back in two days so she would not be able to enjoy the photo shootings and the traveling. Helen had gotten out her cellphone which had a cam and therefore many pictures in it. She looked especially at all the photos with her and her new boyfriend. \"He's really cute.\", she thought smiling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I know.\", Elizabeth smiled. \"I want to swap pants with Helen.\", she said and soon her long skirt turned into Helen's tight, black miniskirt. \"I knew that Jeremy's legs really looked good in a skirt. Too bad you're a boy.\", she said and Jeremy had to refrain from chuckling at the thought that \"his\" legs were really legs which belonged to Anna, a girl obviously. \"Yeah mom. My legs really don't fit the rest of my body.\", he said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, too bad the skirt does not really match any of my clothes.\", Helen said. \"But I think for two days this will be okay.\". Jeremy looked at his former aunt and now sister. \"Well, everyone will think it's normal for you to wear skirts like that. It would be strange if you wear matching ones.\", he explained. \"Well I guess you're right... brother.\", she grinned as she spoke the last word. This games will surely make the following days unforgettable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, we're not finished yet, are we?\", Elizabeth asked and grabbing the cards.</span></div></div>",

This is so cool, I'm having so much fun,\" Melody said grinning. \"And I already know what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's that my new sister?\" Elizabeth asked her former daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap heights with Helen,\" she cried out excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow,\" Helen gasped as she began to shrink. Already she had taken on the barely budding breasts of the thirteen year old, saying good bye to her DDs, but now she was shrinking until she reached Melody's former height of five foot - nothing. It had been so long since she had been this short as a child that she hardly knew what it felt like anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Melody, it was one more part of her niece Helen that she got to take on. She was completely taking on Helen's life, and as much of her physical aspects as she could. It would be so fun, just for a few days, to be the sexy model that everyone wanted. Now it would be her breasts bouncing while she jogged that made traffic slow to pass her, and she wouldn't have to get up on a stool in the kitchen to get a glass any more. She didn't have it all yet, but she was sure that if she played her cards well and won a few more hand she'd be super model gorgeous in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth on the other hand was thinking about what it would be like to go to Jeremy's school tomorrow. She'd been a stay at home mom since she married Steven, and that had been right after college. With a husband that had graduated from med school and gone directly to work in his father's own practice, they'd never found the need to have her work. So for the past almost twenty years, she'd been a stay at home mom. But now Jeremy was the stay at home... mom? How would the cards make that work?  Maybe a few more swaps were in order to make it all make more sense. </span></div></div>",

That's why I'm thinking of swapping something with you.\", she explained and kept her smile. \"I want to swap skills with Jeremy.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked at his mother, then at himself. \"I've got your skills now?\", he asked. \"Like cooking?\". Elizabeth nodded. \"Yes, if the cards didn't understand it in anotherway than I do, then you should now have all my skills. Cooking, cleaning and other things I've learned over the years should now be able to do without any effort.\". She grinned at him. \"I think you might even be able to dance now. I really loved to dance when I was younger.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy simply nodded. \"Okay... And you should now be able to play video games, right?\", he asked in order to make sure that he completley understood the swap. His mother nodded. \"That's right. I think this will make the next two days easier for us. After all it's you who's going to cook and I really don't want to starve.\", she laughed. Jeremy had to agree with her. He really did not have any idea of cooking. His mother really had thought it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we please continue?\", Melody asked eagerly. It was obvious she wanted to keep going in order to swap more of her aunt's, now her niece's, traits. \"In a minute, sweety.\", her mother said, still finding it strange that her daughter was now her sister. \"I've got to talk with Jeremy.\". She looked back at her son. \"I know you want to make your own swaps, but I'd suggest we both should swap with each other from now on. We should try to make the fact that you're now the 'housewife' more realistic. Well, as realistic as possible.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy did not like the fact to swap more with his own mother, but she was certainly right. He did not want to think about how he could be the housewife. It made no sense right now or it has a very complicated explanation. But how could they change that? He was not quite sure but he had time to think about it. They had to play a round anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next winner is:</span></div></div>",

How delightful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table, Helen breathed a sigh of relief. She was already getting twitchy about being so short... she'd thought it would be fun to have Melody's life, but she'd planned on doing it with her own body... now that she was looking more like Melody, she wasn't so sure she wanted to go back to middle school. It would still be really fun to spend time with her boyfriend, but she'd really been looking forward to being the hottest girl in school. She'd been a bit of a late bloomer and no one had taken much notice of her until her senior year of high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody on the other hand was getting frustrated. She'd thought she had this round won until her mom... er... sister trumped her. \"Come on Sis,\" she said, elbowing Elizabeth in the ribs a little. \"When are you going to let someone else have a taste of victory here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute,\" she said, looking over at Jeremy. \"You know, since you're the housewife here, and I'm going to school tomorrow, I think it would be weird for a forty year old woman to be in high school. I want to swap ages with Jeremy,\" she said with a smile. A minute went by, then two and Elizabeth looked around in confusion. \"You know, I'd have thought that I would feel... different... younger... I expected to see some grey hair on you Jeremy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check your ID,\" Jeremy said, looking at his own and seeing that the birth date had been changed from August 12, 1995 to Febuary 14, 1971. \"But I think it worked. My ID says I'm forty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Melody said with a big grin, \"look at the bright side. You and I can buy alcohol, and they can't. Since you're the house wife here, how about you and I have a bottle of wine with dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now,\" Elizabeth said, trying to reign them in a bit. \"No getting drunk here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mom,\" Jeremy said grinning. \"I thought the point was to try something new. Besides, I don't think your old enough to be telling me what to do right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, I'm still your mother, and I say no wine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that...\" Jeremy said reaching for the cards. </span></div></div>",

He looked at her with a sly grin. He really wanted to get the full experience of being an adult and a house\"wife\". Elizabeth anticipated something bad would happen. It was not that she wanted to tell hom what him what he could do and what not. She was just not comfortable with him drinking wine. He was 16 after all, regardless what his ID now said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\", he grinned. \"I want to swap family relationships with Elizabeth.\", he said. \"So now I'm your mother.\", he grinned at her. \"Even though I'm still a guy. Strange thought.\", he added in his mind. Elizabeth looked at him slightly shocked. She really had not anticipated something like that. Sure she knew he really wanted to drink and she might have probably allowed him to drink at least one glass. But that? She was not sure anymore if the game really was the best idea she had. On the other hand, it will be a great experience for sure. It was not like it was forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her hand and was surprised that her wedding band was gone. She then looked over to Jeremy's hand and had to smile. \"Well, apparently you're now married to your own dad.\". She pointed at the wedding band at his fingers. \"It seems that you're wish backfired, MOM.\". Jeremy looked at the ring in shock. That was not the thing he had intended to swap. \"Well, at least I can drink now...\", he thought with a sigh. \"This is going to be some very weird two days...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jeremy is now my sister and mom is my nephew?\", Melody asked looking at the two of them. Elizabeth nodded. \"It should be like that. We don't know for sure that the female titles like \"mother\" or \"sister\" apply to him but he is your sibling and my and Helen's parent for sure.\". Melody had to grin. \"So he's practically you now?\". Elizabeth smiled at her new aunt. \"Yes, except for the gender, body and clothes he's me. He's now the son or daughter of his grandma, my former mom.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\", Jeremy sighed. \"This really backfired. But oh well, I'll survive this. It shall be a unique experience for us, right?\", he asked and everyone else nodded their heads in union. Helen wanted to end this game but on the other hand it was quite a fun. She really looked forward to dinner and meet \"her\" dad.</span></div></div>",

You wanted to swap family relationships with me, but if you are going to be the mother then you need to be properly equipped.  Your husband wouldn\u2019t be to happy to find his wife with male anatomy.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen looked at her incredulously, \u201cLiz are you sure you want to do that?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he started by wishing he had my life.   I think it only fair that if he wants to be the homemaker and mother, he should be able to have given birth,\u201d Elizabeth answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I give,\u201d Jeremy said squirming in his seat, \u201cyou can have your family role back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth shook her head, \u201cToo late \u2018Mom\u2019.   I want to swap physical attributes and gender that make me a wife and mother with Jeremy.\u201d     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody watched the whole scene unfolding.   She was surprised as she watched her brother\u2019s chest begin to change.  Slowly his shirt began to press outward as his mother\u2019s breasts took shape.   At the same time her mother was experiencing the reverse.     \u201cHoly crap, Jeremy, or maybe I SHOULD call you sis now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy watched horrified as the two large breasts appeared.   He reached up and felt them, not sure what to think; oddly he felt nothing sexual about fondling them.  Suddenly he realized the rest of the wish.   His hand dropped to his crotch and he groped around no longer feeling the familiar bulge.   \u201cOh my god, I am a woman!\u201d  He looked over at his mother.  She no longer had her feminine curves, she was now flat chested and as he watched her hair started to shorten and the makeup on her face disappeared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was just as astounded as the others.  \u201cJeremy? Holy cow, you......you look like a woman.   You have breasts, long hair and there\u2019s makeup on your face.   I guess that you really are my mother now,\u201d she said laughing at the bizarreness of it all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, great,\u201d he said somewhat dejected.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth grabbed her purse and pulled her wallet and ID out again and she choked when she saw it.   \u201cUh hmm, I don\u2019t think this is mine anymore,\u201d she said handing it over to her son.   Jeremy grabbed it and looked at what she had seen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, is this interesting?\u201d he replied.   Helen curious grabbed the wallet and looked for her self.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeremy this is your picture on your mother\u2019s drivers license, but the name and date of birth are still hers\u2019.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d he said, pulling out his own ID and seeing it had changed to his mother\u2019s picture with his information.   \u201cI guess I really am the parent now.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody was extremely eager to play another hand.   Having seen all that could happen she wanted to have some more modification of her own.     She grabbed the deck, shuffled and started dealing.  \u201cLets go again.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon the gorgeus, blond hair of Helen sat on Melody's 13-year old looking head. She twirled a strand around her finger, admiring the soft feeling of her new hair and smiled. \"You really have great hair.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen meanhwile grabbed her new pigtail and felt her hair. While you could not call Melody's hair dull or strawy it was nothing against Helen's long, healthy and luxurious hair. Helen sighed. Her plan of going to school as a sexy woman really backfired, just like Jeremy's did. \"Oh well, I still have her boyfriend and it'll be a completely unique experience, just like my sister said.\", she thought. Melody was still occupied playing with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's continue.\", Elizabeth smiled and began mixing the cards when suddenly she heard the door opening. \"Oh, we have to quit, I think.\", she said putting the cards down. \"Steven erm I mean dad is home.\", she said. \"We don't want to involve him in this, don't we?\". Everyone except Jeremy nodded. Helen was relieved that they had stopped. She did not want to swap anything more with Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Steven entered the room. \"I'm home.\", he greeted the family. \"Ah, Melody, nice to see you again. How long will you stay.\". Melody looked at her father a bit perplex but then caught herself and smiled at him. \"For two days.\". It was really odd for her that her own father saw her as his wife's sister. If reality had not changed for everyone except the players, Steven would have seen a very strange family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife now sported short hair, missed make-up, breasts, vagina and had young girls legs but possesed no feminine curves. Her ID also claimed that she was now 16 years old, called Jeremy and his son. His daughter looked not that odd but still had changed since the last time he saw her. Instead of her own hair she now had luxurious, gorgeuos hair, big breasts and was 5\"11' tall instead of 5\" like she used to. Also she was now his sister-in-law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis actual sister-in-law was now 5\" tall and had not so great blond hair in a pigtail. Also her breasts were just an A-cup and as long as he and the world was concerned, she was his daughter. The strangest look by far was his son. He now had long hair, breasts, make-up, a vagina, old woman's leg and was according to his ID a 40 year old woman called Elizabeth and his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of this was noticed by Steven, he just walked over to his former son and planted a kiss on his painted lips. Jeremy was grossed out but resisted to push his dad away, he did not want to make a scene especially not when his dad thought he was his wife. \"How... was your day...?\", Jeremy asked his dad, forcing a smile. \"Great.\", he smiled, grabbed a chair and sat down just beside Jeremy. \"We played cards for a while.\", explained Helen trying to sound like a cheerful 13-year old girl. \"And I can assume you already ate Pizza.\", he said pointing at the empty pizza boxes. \"And have nothing left for me.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth wanted to say that she will make him something to eat but then remembered that she was now considered his son and was not able to cook now as well. She looked at Jeremy with her usual stern look she always had if she was angry at him. Jeremy looked at his mother and was not sure what she wanted but then he understood. He looked at his father- no he had to stop thinking of him like that, at least for the next two days. He was now his husband! He looked at his husband. \"I'll make you something if you want.\", he offered him. \"Thanks, darling.\", he smiled and took his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy gulped and stood up. \"Okay then, I'll start.\", he said and went over to the kitchen so he could prepare a meal for his fath--husband. Fortunately his mother had transfered skills to him so it was possible for him to prepare something edible that also tasted well. His \"husband\" had meanwhile taken his place in front of the TV, relaxing a bit and waiting for his wife to make him food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is fun, isn't it?\", grinned Elizabeth, leaning against the kitchen table and looking at Jeremy with his deformed and not so male body. Jeremy did not look up and was engrossed in his activity. \"Well, better than going to school tomorrow, I suppose.\", he said. \"Also I can drink wine tonight with my sister.\", he grinned and finally looked at her. She giggled at the look of her son's face adorned with her make-up. \"Well, I'll go upstairs and play some videogames.\", she grinned and left the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Helen and her \"aunt\" Melody went upstairs to Melody's room. \"So this is your... erm... my room.\", Helen said as she entered the room looking around. Melody nodded. \"Yes. It'll be strange to sleep in the guest room.\", she said and gropped her breasts a bit. \"But it's just for two days.\". Helen nodded looking at a picture on her new bed table. \"And this is my boyfriend.\", she pointed at the picture showing Greg and herself. Melody nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen looked at Melody with a smile and sat down on the bed. \"So tell me about him.\", she smiled. \"How is he? How did you met? Is he a great kisser?\". Melody was overwhelmed by all this questsions of her former aunt. She was not sure how she should answer all these questions especially since she knew him just since today herself. She just came up with some things she had wished how it would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen nodded and listened to everything Melody told her about him. He seemed nice and sweet if you could believe in everything Melody had told her. \"Well, I'm really looking forward to meeting him.\", Helen smiled at Melody. \"And what will you do with your newly gained freedom?\", she asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody cocked her head from one sight to the other, thinking about what she would do. She had the greatest idea of what she could do now. She was a sexy 25 year old bikini model after all! But now that Helen had asked her directly she was not quite sure what she would do. \"Well, I don't know, yet. I think I'll join my 'sister' when she's finished with making food for my brother-in-law and maybe we drink a glass of wine or something like that.\", she explained and then shrugged her shoulders. \"Apart from that, I don't have the slightest idea.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen grinned. \"Well, you'll surely enjoy the following days especially since you don't have to go to school.\". Melody nodded. \"Yeah, that's the best part.\", she giggled. \"Well then, I'll go downstairs and have a ladies night with my sister.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun.\", smiled Helen and stood up as well. \"I'll see what my 'brother' is up to.\", she grinned and left her new room with her new aunt.</span></div></div>",

He turned off the TV. \"I'll eat in the kitchen.\". Jeremy smiled, this time not forced. \"Thanks... honey.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy sat down on the sofa and Melody just besides him. \"Well, how do you like your new body, sis?\", grinned Melody at her former brother. \"I suppose you're looking forward to spend some time with 'your husband' in bed tonight.\", she teased him by accenting the words \"your husband\". She loved to tease him and now it was no difference. \"Very funny.\", he sighed and leaned back, his breasts pushing out his shirt. \"At least I'm allowed and able to drive and I can drink wine if I want to.\". Melody grinned. \"Just like me.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy grimaced. \"I think you shouldn't drive. Not that you're too young but you don't have the skill.\", he explained. \"But I'm allowed to!\", she insisted. \"Yeah but do you have the slightest idea of how to handle a car.\". She looked at her \"sister\" and then sighed. \"Fine, I think you're right. I really should have swapped skills with aunt Helen.\", she playing a bit with her hair. \"Now just Helen.\", he corrected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right.\". She then looked down at her ample breasts. \"Hey, how about you get us two glasses and we drink a little bit of wine? Just for fun, you know.\", Melody suggested and Jeremy agreed. \"Yeah, why not?\". He stood up and went to get the things they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later they both had a glass of wine in their hands and were sitting on the couch. \"Well, it's the first time for both of us. Mom didn't allowed any of us even slightest amount.\", Jeremy said excited looking at the glass. They both began drinking. \"Mh, now I understand why people like it.\", Melody smiled. \"Yeah, i really could get used to it.\", Jeremy smiled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Steven came into the living room. \"Ah, I see you both are having fun.\", he said smiling at Jeremy. \"I hope you don't mind if I stay.\". Both shook their heads. \"No. Just sight down.\", they answered in unison. \"What were you talking about?\", he asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This and that. Nothing important.\", Jeremy said smiling at his husband. He found it easier to smile at him and think of him as his husband. \"And we were thinking of going shopping tomorrow, weren't we, sis?\", Melody grinned and looked at Jeremy. He thought about it and then nodded. \"Yeah, we were.\". Steven nodded smiling. \"Well, you two can't see each other very often. Have fun tomorrow.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", smiled Melody taking another sip. The more the evening continued, the more drunken the two got and the more Jeremy leaned against Steven. After a while the two weren't quite themselves and Steven brought Melody to the guest room and Jeremy to their shared bedroom. Jeremy in his drunken state was beginning to feel up his father. \"I see there's someone randy.\", he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Jeremy was naked and laid under his father. He guided his father's penis into his own vagina. As soon as he entered, a moan escaped his lips and he grabbed his father's ass. He looked at him with lust in his eyes. \"Take me.\", Jeremy whispered and Steven could smell alcohol in his breath. Steven did not stop because of that, it was not like they had never had sex before, at least for him. For Jeremy it was the first time having sex as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven began groping his wife's breats and continued pumping, Jeremy's moans got louder and louder. Soon both climaxed and both fell asleep exhaustedly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy awake next morning by the sound of the alarm clock going on. For him it was as if someone used an air hammer right on his head. He sat up in the bed groggily. \"My head hurts...\", he mumbled. He heard a laugh which drilled just into his head from the next room. He looked over there and realised he was in his parent's bed room and the laughter came from his \"husband\" who was in the bathroom right now. The door was open. \"No wonder.\", he said. \"You and Melody really overdid it yesterday. I assume you don't remember anything.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\", Jeremy answered, holding his head. His long hair fall into his face but he did not mind, after all the bright light was darkened for a bit this way. \"What did I do?\", he asked. \"Oh nothing you'd regret. Your sister and you behaved very well considering how much you had drunken. After I put Melody to bed and brought you here we had sex. I couldn't keep you away from me.\". Your father had entered the room, his toothbrush in his mouth, grinning broadly at Jeremy. Jeremy tried to remember but he could not get more than a few non-connected pictures in his mind but shrugged when he remembered some parts of the sex he had with his father. \"Husband...\", he corrected himself, still holding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suggest you get up, get yourself an aspirin and make breakfast.\", his dad suggested handing him one tablet. Jeremy looked at his father standing there just clad in his boxers, nodded and took it. He really had seen enough naked skin of his dad for now. Jeremy got up groggily and walked out of the room, still holding his head. He passed his former bedroom now inhibited by his mother, his sister's former bedroom now inhibited by his aunt and the guest room were his sister was sleeping right now. Now that he was the mom he had to get up really early. He went down to the kitchen finding it odd to be the first one to arrive there. He grabbed a glass of water and took the aspirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...\", he mumbled still groggily. \"Breakfast... breakfast...\". It was really hard for him to think with his slightly decreasing headache. He grabbed a pan. \"I'll make pancakes...\". He started cooking. His headache was nearly over when his husband came down. \"Smells nice.\", he said, getting behind Jeremy and kissed him on the neck. \"I love you.\", he whispered into Jeremy's ear. Jeremy shruddered but tried to keep cool. \"I er... love you, too.\", he said. His father then went to the front door, got the newspaper and then sat down at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one to come down was his mom, now son. She was already dressed and still looked really odd with her boyish figure and short hair. \"Morning mom, dad.\", she greeted the two of them. Steven looked up from his newspaper in disbelieve. \"Morning, son.\", he greeted him. \"You're ill? You normally don't get up this early in the morning.\". Elizabeth smiled at her former husband. \"I just woke up this early.\", he explained. \"No particular reason.\". Steven just shrugged his shoulders and continued reading his newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after Elizabeth came down, Helen followed. \"Good morning.\", she cheerfully greeted everyone in the kitchen. \"Morning, princess. I hope you slept well.\", Steven smiled at who he thought was his daugher. Helen nodded. \"Yeah, great, thanks daddy.\". Helen was really looking forward to meet Melody's boyfriend and have some time with him. She knew she could not have sex with him because if she did now, Melody would have had sex with him afterwards but still it was exciting for her. Also she really was excited at going back to school. She would have never thought she would say this when she was Melody's age but she really missed school. She sat down at the table finding it hard to look at everything in the kitchen. \"I'm really too short now...\", she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy had finished the pancakes and put them on table. \"Thanks, mom.\", Elizabeth smiled and got something to eat just like the other two did. Jeremy looked at them and then left the kitchen. \"I'll see what Melody's up to.\", he said and went upstairs into the guest room. Inside he found Melody still sleeping in bed, her suitcases and their content laid all over the place. The content now where Melody's normal clothes as well as some frilly bikini's she has gotten from the photo shooting she never were at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose she feels just like I did...\", he mumbled and went to one bedside. He shook Melody's sleeping body and she woke up slowly. \"My head...\", she mumbled and looked at him. \"Is that what you call a hangover?\", she asked and sat up, holding her head just like you did this morning. \"Yes, dear sister.\", Jeremy said. \"I think we have drunken too much last night.\", he said sitting down on the bed, his breasts bouncing up and down slightly. \"This is the bad thing about drinking.\", he explaind, brushing one of his hair strands behind his ear. \"I'll get you a glass of water and an aspirin, okay?\", he said and did as he told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", she said and took the medicine. \"Now let's get down, little sister.\", he said in an unsual motherly tone. \"We'll eat breakfast and then hit the stores at the mall. Melody nodded and got up. Both headed downstairs were the rest of the family was already eating. \"Morning.\", the three said in unision. Jeremy and Melody sat down and began eating as well. Soon Helen and Elizabeth were finished and had to go to school. \"Bye.\", they both said smiling. \"Bye.\", said Jeremy and gave each one of them a kiss on their forehead which both found annoying. Jeremy had to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll got to go, too.\", Steven said grabbing his briefcase. \"Have fun you two.\", he smiled, kissed his wife on the lips and left home. \"I really can't get used to him kissing me.\", Jeremy mumbled and got back on the chair. \"Well, sis. You have to. At least until tomorrow.\", Melody smiled at him. \"Yeah, I know.\", Jeremy sighed and looked at her. \"Well, it's still early. And from the note mom gave me before leaving I think I should do some of my new chores.\", he said which resulted in Melody grimacing. \"But I want to go now.\", she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose...</span></div></div>",

At least he had kept his height, but every time he moved, he felt like there was a lot more of him than there had been before, especially his backside and chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower itself he had intended to keep brief, but the more he thought about shopping, the more he wanted to make sure that he shaved his legs before trying anything on. And since he was shaving there, it just felt natural to trim up elsewhere. Before he knew it, he'd spent an hour in the bathroom, getting clean, shaved, styling his hair and putting on his makeup. \"Wow... so this is what mom goes through every time she goes out... I wonder if Melody will take as long to get ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the bathroom at last, Jeremy heard the sound of his cell phone ringing from his purse. Grabbing it on the third ring he was surprised to see the caller ID. \"Anna?\" he asked, picking up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mrs. P,\" Anna said casually. \"I wanted to see if you would be okay hosting our game at your house tonight. I really want to play you to get my legs back, and I want to get my boyfriend back from your daughter Helen tonight too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Okay, I think I can manage that... My sister Melody is in town though, and I think we should have her join us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hot sister the swimsuit model? That would be awesome. Okay, I'll let everyone else know to come over tonight. Is your husband going to be cool with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jeremy said, still a little freaked out at how much had changed... and that Anna didn't know about any of it, even though she had played in the first game. She thought he still had her legs, even though her legs were now with his mother Elizabeth... and more than that, she thought it was Helen that they'd all played with before because she now had Melody's entire life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I've got to run to school, see you tonight,\" Anna said before the phone clicked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, things are going to get complicated fast,\" Jeremy said heading downstairs to get started on the dishes. \"It's your turn for hot water sis,\" he called on his way down. \"Oh, and Anna called, she thinks that I still have her legs... and she wants to play tonight to get her boyfriend back from Helen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Melody asked, getting up from the couch and stretching her tall, sexy figure. \"Well, that's tonight. You took forever up there. I'll be right back down... when we go, you can drive my car, it'll be more fun than the mini-van.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning at last, Jeremy started running water in the sink and scrubbing pancake syrup off of dishes. \"Deal, you  enjoy your shower, I'm going to get these dishes done and then we can be off.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I only have swapped family relationships with mom, right?\", he asked her. Melody nodded and was not quite sure what he wanted to say. \"Anna called me just now... So this would mean I'm still Michael's best friend and mom, even thought she's more me than I even wanted, was not on Michael's birthday party but her \"mother\" was.\". Melody nodded hesitantly. It was very confusing for her to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cards really make life very strange...\", Jeremy mumbled and let his sister get upstairs. Jeremy looked down at his sagging breasts and went into the kitchen, using his mom's chubby legs, in order to get the dishes done. \"Even though I'll go shopping and everyone thinks I'm a forty year old woman and at lest the figure for it, I still have my own clothes. This will really be a drawback for shopping.\", he thought and started washing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later Jeremy was finished and his sister came downstairs. Her clothes remained the same as usual even though her skirt seemed a bit shorter than normal and she showed a bit more cleavage probably because of her bigger boobs but nothing else had really changed. She now wore a pink short-sleeved t-shirt which empaphises her bigger breasts very well, a matching skirt that ended a few inches above her knees. On her feet she wore pink high-heeled sandals. Over her shoulder was a small, pink purse slung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady in pink, eh?\", Jeremy asked her. \"Do I see right? You're not wearing a bra?\". Melody nodded grinningly. \"Yeah, if you've got it, flaunt it, right?\", she said still grinning. Jeremy just shook his head. \"Whatever. If you really think you should go out like that. I'm not mom.\". She grinned at him. \"Well, technically you ARE mom.\". \"You know what I mean.\". He looked at her. \"Can we go now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and handed him the keys of her aunts, now her, car. \"The best thing the game did for me.\", Jeremy grinned and took the keys. \"I'd love to drive it myself.\", Melody sighed. \"Well, if we play tonight you might get the chance to swap driving skills with someone. Even thought it would seem rather strange that a grown-up woman with a car needs to swap that.\", Jeremy explained and got into the car. He let his hands run over the steering-wheel. \"It's like a dream come true.\", he mumbled. \"Yeah, yeah, just drive, okay?\", grunted Melody annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the best 15 minute drive Jeremy had in his life the two \"sisters\" arrived at the mall. \"Here we are.\". Jeremy looked at Melody. \"Well, were to go first? It's not like I need any clothes or something like that. I still have my own waderobe.\". Melody thought about this for a while. \"Well, I think we should go buy me some bikinis.\", she suggested. \"I really want to see man starring at me.\". She smiled. She really was just average looking when she was herself but now she was hot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking down the halls at Jeremy's high school, Elizabeth was really regretting her first two swaps from last night. She now had a boyish figure, but still had Jeremy's stunning legs (actually Anna's, but she didn't know that,) and her sister Helen's fabulous collection of skirts and short shorts. She'd tried to find something in her wardrobe that made her feel less girly, but the best she'd been able to come up with was a pair of designer shorts that hit her legs several inches above her finger tips. Had it been a skirt, and had she been  a girl, without doubt some school official would have come down on her for how scandalous it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse than the length, though, was the tight fit. She'd thought her new equipment had fit safely out of the way when she had put on the shorts, but as the day went on, she found several occasions where her eyes would be drawn to the lush chests of the teenage female population, or their equally shapely legs and backsides as they walked away. The resultant stiffening in her shorts made it obvious to all that she was interested. \"When I traded gender roles with Jeremy, it must have traded out our sexual orientation,\" she muttered walking down the hall. \"It's okay... we'll trade it all back tomorrow,\" she said as she stepped into math class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class,\" the teacher began. \"I know you've all been looking forward to today's exam, just a reminder, this exam counts for 25% of your grade so I strongly suggest you use the full two hours to check your work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" Elizabeth groaned as the test was handed back to her. She hadn't taken a math class since high school, and Jeremy was taking advanced calculus... she'd never gone beyond algebra. But as the test landed in front of her, she began to smile. It looked so simple... but of course, it should after she had traded skills with Jeremy.<i> 'So this is what it's like to be the smart one in class...' </i>she thought. '<i>I could get used to this...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Helen, the day started off like a dream. Greg picked her up at the house and kissed her as soon as she got into his car. Eagerly, she leaned into the kiss, reaching up to run a hand through his hair and drawing him in closer. A minute went by, then two as she traced the edge of his jaw and felt the firm muscles of his arms, all while keeping her tongue thrust deep into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally breaking for air, Greg looked at Helen with a slightly dazed look of joy. \"Damn girl, when did you learn to kiss like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you know... my Aunt Melody is in town, and we were up talking last night... girl talk,\" Helen said, trying to cover the fact that while she had never had a steady boyfriend she was far more experienced with men than Melody could hope to be. \"She gave me some pointers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your Aunt the swimsuit model eh? Well babe, if you grow up to be half as pretty as her, then I'm a lucky man. Come on, let's get you to school on time. Your mom would kill me if I got you there late because we were too busy making out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... but don't think you get off the hook that easy... there's time after school!\"</span></div></div>",

He looked at his \"son\". \"I've got to tell you something.\", he began and looked very serious. \"You see, the cards you found belonged to me. We played it on Michael's birthday. Michael and Anna had a fight and I grabbed the cards in order to prevent any further fights.\", he explained. \"And, I'm sure you won't believe me anyway, but the legs you've swapped with me originally belonged to Anna, just like Melody's boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked at her \"mom\" and could not believe what she just told her. \"It would make sense but I can't believe it.\". Jeremy nodded. \"Yeah, I think that are the cards. They don't let you accept any swaps. Anyway, today we want to play again. Anna just called me this morning and I agreed to let us play here tonight. It seems Michael and I are still best friends and apparently you were, even though your a teenager now, not there.\". He looked at Elizabeth. \"But I think it'll be fine if you play with us.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth nodded. \"I see. But it'll be hard for us to swap back.\", she said now feeling slightly insecure about the situation. \"Well, it was impossible to begin with.\". Jeremy looked very serious at her. \"We have to swap something.  If we want to or not and we have to play so it's impossible to determine who wins. I think we just should try to not let something very important be swapped away and try to swap everything as possible back tomorrow.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen nodded. \"Yeah... But say... They think I was there yesterday, right?\". Jeremy nodded. \"Yeah, I told them my sister Melody, the supermodel would also play.\". Melody had to giggle at the fact that everyone saw her as supermodel. \"Okay then. It's not like it'll hurt us.\", said Helen with a slightly insecure tone. She was just like her \"brother\" not sure if they should play it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. They should be here any minute now.\", he said and began preparing the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later the door bell rang and Jeremy opened it. Michael, Josie, Anna and Philipp stood there in the doorway. \"Hey Elizabeth.\", Michael greeted Jeremy like usual with their \"cool hand shake\". Anna looked at Jeremy's legs, clad in some boyish trousers, with an envy look. She wanted to get her legs back, oblivious that the legs she wanted were Elizabeth's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, come in.\", Jeremy let them all in and guided them to the table. \"Hi, Melody. Long time no see.\", smiled Josie at Melody. \"How's your job doing?\". Melody giggled. \"Ah, you know. Like always.\". Josie nodded and took place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy put the cards on the table. \"Everyone know the rules, right?\". The group nodded in unsion. \"Okay then let's play.\". Jeremy dealt the cards and the first winner was:</span></div></div>",

Sure, other people might wonder why she didn't go for Jeremy's legs (actually her own), but these were hers... and if she had a bit of cellulite there, so what. A woman was supposed to have curves. And at least they weren't overly muscled hairy things like Mrs. Parker's legs. \"Mmm... I missed you,\" Anna purred to her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Josie said, eager to get things rolling.

Aunt Melody is in town so she tends to relax more. <br>\r\nGreg: Cool, where do you want to go?<br>\r\nHelen: We could take your car and go down to the lake<br>\r\nGreg: It'll be getting dark by the time we get there<br>\r\nHelen: Isn't that the point?<br>\r\nGreg: :) I love you :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen!\" Anna snapped. \"Put the phone down for a second and show us your hand so we can see who won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" she said, tucking the phone away and flipping over the two cards she'd drawn... the 6 and 8 of spades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Anna exclaimed, smacking her hand on the table. \"I thought I had these losers. Damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, please no swearing in my house,\" Jeremy said sternly, enjoying being able to chastise Anna a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Mrs. Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to swap sis?\" Elizabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, however, was more thinking about snuggling up next to Greg in his car, maybe she'd let him get a handful of her breasts... he'd like that.... Then she remembered that Melody had her breasts, and she couldn't get them back until tomorrow. \"Um... I want to swap breasts with Josie,\" she said, hoping she got it in before the time limit expired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, her shirt began to expand, even as Josie's lush chest deflated. Josie's D-cups weren't as big as Helen's own DDs, but they were quite a bit better than the bee stings she'd gotten from Melody last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie on the other hand only sighed. It was going to be another one of those nights... at least her breasts had gone to another girl though, she didn't know what she'd do if Philip had won them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael picked up the deck and dealt the next hand with everyone hunkering down for a more serious round. </span></div></div>",

I'm truly sorry, I told you so the last days. Don't you want to get your boyfriend back?\", Michael tried to suggest his sister in swapping with Helen and not himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"Nah, I'm really looking forward to torture you even more. Also, it seems the goddess of fortune is on my side again. I can swap back later.\", she explained. \"I hope she's not right with her luck.\", thought Michael having a bad feeling about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was looking at Michael, who grew more used to Anna's underwear and Josie's skirt, thinking about what she was could swap in order to make him feel even more miserable. She already got his gender, his sexual preferences and underwear. But what could she get as well? His age? Would he feel uncomfortable with being her age?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that would not be the result she hoped to get. She wanted to make him pay even more. \"I know what I want to swap. I want to swap genitals with Michael.\", she said and in an instant her vagina was transformed into her brother's penis. \"I didn't thought yours was so... big...\", grinned Anna looking down at her new averaged sized penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just wants to tease me...\", he thought looking down at his new vagina which felt more natural to him. At least he would not be attracted by his own penis anymore. He looked at Josie who was more angered by this than he was. She crunched her teeths and tried not to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy sighed. The two days had not changed anything between the two of them. There was no way to ease the situation between them, right? \"Hm... Maybe if I swap attitudes with Anna, she would be more calm and would stop torturing the poor Michael.\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen did not notice anything of this. She was still engrossed in the conversation with Greg. He was the one thing she would miss if she swapped back. Maybe she should keep him if possible? Melody would whine about it, but he was such a great guy. Little did Helen know that he was actually Anna's boyfriend. But the cards did not allow her to accept the fact. No matter what they told him, for her Greg was Melody's boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then... We continue...\", mumbled Jeremy and dealt the cards. He hoped to win this hand and ease the fight.</span></div></div>",

I really have to do something about that but if things continue like that I have as much luck as Michael.\", thought Jeremy and looked at his best friend.

You'd have a part of me with you always, and just think about what it would feel like to have me sucking on these nipples... I know them better than anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna,\" Michael said objecting. \"Come on, she's still my girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore Michael,\" Josie said, staring into Anna's eyes with a mix of adoration, love and a little bit of pure lust. \"I want to swap breasts with my boyfriend Anna!\" she said, smiling with pleasure as her chest ballooned out to Anna's firm and bouncy proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um guys,\" Melody said from the door way. \"I hate to dash like this... I really do. But that was my agent, and the photo shoot I was supposed to have in two days got bumped up to tomorrow, I need to get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Aunt Melody,\" Helen said, tearing herself away from her texting with Greg. \"I thought that photo shoot was in the Bahamas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\" Melody said, looking very torn. \"There's a storm rolling in, and I need to get on the next flight down there before they shut down the flights. The storm won't actually hit where I'm going to be, but it will mean I have to be down there for at least a week, if not two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Melody,\" Elizabeth said. \"We were going to play another family game tomorrow... it's kind of important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Melody said, looking very torn. \"And I want to but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go,\" Helen said, putting her phone away. \"It's what I would do anyway,\" she added with a wink. \"We can play again when you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks everyone for the game, it's been a great evening,\" she said, stopping to give Jeremy a sisterly hug and peck on the cheek, along with the same for Elizabeth and Melody. \"Okay guys, see everyone in a week or two,\" she said as she turned and walked for the door, hips swaying and drawing not only Philips's eyes but Anna's as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Philip said with a sigh. \"And I was hoping to win something from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now,\" Elizabeth said, a little shocked at Philip's statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man,\" Philip said, looking only a little sheepish. \"But your Aunt is seriously hot. So are we going to keep playing or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if it's okay mom,\" Helen said, looking to Jeremy. \"I'd like to leave too. I've been chatting with Greg and we'd like to go out for a walk in the park for a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Jeremy, the part he'd gotten from his mother, really wanted to say no. That she was too young to be out with a boy that much older, much less in the park at dark. But the rest of him remembered that it was really his Aunt Helen... not his daughter, and that she was old enough to make good decisions. \"Okay honey, but you be back by eleven,\" he finished sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom,\" she said, giving him a huge hug, enjoying the feeling of Josie's breasts on her chest. They might not have been hers, but they were firmer and younger than hers were, and they were a lot more than she'd had when she was Melody's age. \"Bye everyone,\" she said bolting for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are we playing more now?\" Philip asked, pestering even more now that the other set of awesome boobs was leaving. There were still Mrs.. Parker's breasts after all... she'd probably be grateful to take a load off.</span></div></div>",

A week? Two?\", Michael said aghasted. Jeremy sighed. \"I know it'll be hard for you but think about it that way: You couldn't swap back for the next 48 hours and when we play again then what? We can't swap everything back anyway because Melody is missing. So try to live with it, okay?\". Michael sighed and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna grinned and slung her arm around Josie. \"Well, we go then. It was very nice Mrs. P.\", said Anna and left the house together with Josie.

I don't know if I can endure this for a week.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy nodded. \"Yeah...

We could get rid of that problem.\", she said and pointed at the cards. \"Just the two of us, I fold immediately and you can make him attractive.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Jeremy wanted to shout out \"No\" but then he began thinking about this. It was not a bad idea. Last night he had sex with his own dad and luckily he could only remember bits of it because he was drunk. \"I can't get drunk everytime he wants sex, can I?\", he thought. On the other hand the thought of actually being attracted to his own dad made him almost puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you say?\", Elizabeth asked and tapped on the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-er...\", stummered Jeremy.</span></div></div>",

Then there was a moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it worked?\", asked Elizabeth. \"You tell me.\", he said and handed a photo of his dad to Elizabeth. \"Anything attractive on it?\", he asked and Elizabeth shook her head. \"No. Nothing.\".

The word husband referring to his father came now way easier over his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he finished a lovely dinner for his hard working husband, the person for whom he made the dinner arrived. \"Hey, handsome.\", smiled Jeremy and kissed him on the lips. \"I made you dinner. How was your day?\", he asked him and guided him to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is really a heart-warming greeting especially when you get it from such a beautiful lady.\", he smiled at Jeremy. \"I think we should go out this saturday.\", he suggested as he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to.\", Jeremy said and the thought of spending a wonderful, romantic night with this man made his crotch wet. \"Can't wait for it.\". He sat down in front of Richard. \"Did something exciting happen today?\", Richard asked. Jeremy shook his head. \"No, nothing. Just went shopping with my sis. Unfortunately she had to get away for a shoot already.\". Richard laughed. \"Yeah, that sounds like her.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other than that I only cleaned the house, played poker with my friends and my sister and then made dinner for my good-looking husband.\". Jeremy now felt more comfortable with the role of a mother and wife. Also it became hard for him to even think of him as his dad. Sure he knew that he indeed was his dad although according to this reality he was not but in the inside Jeremy began thinking of him as the man he fell in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard smiled at who he thought was his wife. \"How about we go to bed early?\", he asked. \"We can have some fun time and this time you're not drunken.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Jeremy would be grossed out by this offer but thanks to the last swap made, he actually found it appaling. \"I see there's someone randy.\", grinned Jeremy and carressed Richard's hand. \"Eat up, I'll wait upstairs for you.\", he said and walked into what was his own and Richard's room for the next week or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside he undressed. Unfortunately Jeremy did not have his mom's clothes although most of her physiques, so wearing some sexy underwear was out of question. So he decided to just wear nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later Richard came through the door and saw Jeremy laying on the bed, naked. \"Mh. I like what I see.\", he said and smiled. \"Get your clothes off, I want to see something as well.\", Jeremy replied and Richard did as he was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Seriously the best view you could ever have.\", Jeremy said and his husband came over and began kissing him. Jeremy slang his arms around Richard's neck. Their tongues twisted inside each other's mouthes. Richard began groping Jeremy's breasts. Jeremy had to moan slightly while kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me.\", whispered Jeremy into Richard's ear and he did not have to be asked twice. Soon he guided his penis into Jeremy's pouring wet vagina. Jeremy moaned out loud. \"This feels amazing.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard then began thrusting his penis in and out. \"Yeah, yeah. That's amazing.\", moaned Jeremy, closed his eyes and just enjoyed the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes which were the best minutes in Jeremy's life, both climaxed. Breathing heavy, Richard laid next to Jeremy. Jeremy smiled and stroke across his hairy chest. \"You were amazing.\", he whispered. \"As were you.\", Richard replied. Jeremy then huddled against Richard. \"You're up to another round?\", grinned Jeremy.</span></div></div>",

The two were sitting in his car at the lake and were making out on the back seat. Greg was pressing Helen's body against his own with one arm, the other one was busy bringing his hand in postion in order to fondle her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen meanwhile ran her one hand across Greg's body, while the other held his head and pressed him against her own. Soon clothes were falling off. First Helen's top fell off so that Greg now had nearly full access to her D-cups. The only thing between his hand and the real thing was the red bra Helen wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing that fell off was Greg's shirt. Helen's mouth watered as she took a look at his upper body. She ran her manicured hands over his chest, then broke the kiss and began kissing it. Greg moaned delightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's hand then went down to Greg's pants. She reached inside and carressed his penis. \"You like that?\", she asked and he nodded. Even though he did not want to bring that topic up but he wanted to stay on good terms with her mother. \"We should stop...\", he said. \"Your mother wouldn't like this.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen grinned. \"He's so nice.\", she thought. \"I have to ask Melody if I can keep him.\". She smiled at him seductivley. \"Well, I don't see her. Don't worry about that. She'll never find out, right?\". He wanted to say something but she pressed her index finger on his lips. \"Shhh. Just do what you wanted to do all the time.\", she whisper in a very seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and began kissing her on the neck. She laid her head back and enjoyed the kisses. Her hands began massaging his penis after a while. He began moaning in between the kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen then pushed her boyfriend away from her neck and got rid of his pants. \"Now.\", she smiled. \"Just enjoy this.\". Her head lowered to his now free penis and began sucking on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg leaned his body back and pressed his penis against her face. Helen continued sucking, her tongue played around it from time to time. Greg's moaning grew louder and louder and soon he came right into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen swallowed everything and looked at him. \"You liked that, mh?\", she grinned and received a nod. \"Good. Mom said we can't have sex but she did not say anything about a blowjob.\". She then pushed her skirt up and got rid of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's your turn.\", she pointed at her vagina. Greg lowered his head and pushed his tongue inside her. Helen began to moan. \"Mh, so good.\", she moaned and stroke through his hair. \"Keep going.\", she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued and became even wilder. Eventually Helen moaned out lout and climaxed. She looked at him. \"You're good at it.\", she smiled and carressed his cheek.</span></div></div>",

I hope you don't mind that you had to leave your family too soon but this shooting is very important.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know... er...\", she had to think hard about this guys name. She knew her aunt mentioned it before... \"John.\", she finally finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\", he smiled. \"Now come on, our plane's departing soon.\".

She had always dreamt to be like her aunt and now she was her aunt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and looked at all the different people running around or sitting on the benches while waiting for their plane. Her family rarely went into holiday by plane. Of all her 13 year old life, she flew with a plane just once and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was her second time and she was just as excited like last time. John guided her to the gate and there they were taken to first class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody smiled broadly as she sat down. \"Aunt Helen really must be a big supermodel if she can fly first class.\", she thought smiling. \"I could get used to this.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring flight, the stewardess offered her wine. At first she wanted to refuse but then again she was now an adult supermodel and so she could drink. She just had to pay attention about how much she drinks. She did not want to let it end like last night, well more like this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole flight was quiet and Melody could enjoy every bit of the first class. Yes, this was something she definetely would keep if she has the chance to.</span></div></div>",

It was probably just some teen drama or a fight between siblings. \"I have to concentrate on what I should swap.\", she said. She was mostly her own son with age, name, job and most of his life. She took a look at Philipp. She could swap pants with him and get something to wear for tomorrow at school. It was not very pleasureable to walk around in a skirt as a boy even though no one noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, should she not take the opportunity? Swapping something interesting? The problem was that it would be hard to swap everything back. If everyone agreed to fold it would be easy but the problem was that her sister would leave tomorrow. Anything swapped with her now could not be erased. She had to be careful to not swap anything that belonged originally to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. I want to swap hair with Josie.\", she said and soon red youtful strands were cascading down her shoulders. She liked the red colour of Josie's hair. Josie meanwhile had acquired Jeremy's short boyish hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth twirled a strand of her new hair around her finger. \"Great.\", she smiled. Josie, who was shocked that her wonderful long hair was now rather short and brown. Josie looked at Anna. \"I'm looking like a freak...\", she said. Anna hugged her, enjoying touching her, and stroke her head. \"No. You look beautiful.\". Anna did not know why but she had the urge to be nice and protective towards Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael crunched his teeth together when he saw Anna and Josie cuddling together. He was not attracted at Josie anymore but this did not mean that it did not affect him in any way. Anna sure knew how to tease and torture him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, everybody... Shall we continue?\", asked Helen who forced herself look up while she was awaiting a message from Greg. She really looked forward to meet him afterwards and therefore wanted to end this game as soon as possible. She grabbed the cards and dealt.</span></div></div>",

You are nothing but a pathetic little girl who gets sadistic pleasure out of torturing her brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Parker has a point.\" Phillip said, \"What you are doing is really fucked up even by my standards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you guys. I'm gonna do what I damn well please to Michael. I want to swap...\" Anna started but before she could even finish. Michael dove across the table at her because his slowly building rage at her had finally bubbled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop fucking with my life you sick bitch!!\" Micheal screamed at his sister as he started violently shaking her after she had been knocked to the ground, slamming her head once on the floor and knocking her unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micheal what the fuck did you do?!\" Josie screamed at him since she now was in love with Anna instead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you Josie!

From now on we will be focused on reversing everything we have done, and I mean everything. We need to change everything back to how it was both physically and mentally. And that means two things. One, people will have to fold and/or quit at the correct times to fix everything. And two, no one leaves this room until everything is reversed. Any questions?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone just stared at Jeremy in disbelief at his rant.

We also need to tape her mouth  shut so she can't quit either. Then we need to figure out what was swapped after Anna's turn was justly interrupted. After we do that. We need to systematically fold, swap, and quit until everything is right again. It will take a few days but thank god its Saturday tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, everyone got to work wit reversing the mess that had been created, mostly by Anna. They work through the night, constantly ignoring Anna's squeaking protests from behind the duct tape covering her mouth and making sure  everything was put back to normal as well as waiting for the 48 hours to wind down for some of the swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few days, but soon enough everything was back to normal. Everyone had their traits back in order and remembered everything correctly. They even figured out that the last swap had been between Anna and Phillip's taste in food. They figured that one out because Phillip refused to eat any of the junk food snacks on the table while Anna had been staring longingly at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that takes care of that.\" Jeremy said as he looked around the room at his family and friends who were all back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job Phillip for taking charge.\" said Micheal, \"Without you we would all be in a big pile of shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No swearing in my house Micheal\" said Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mrs. Parker.\" Micheal said to her, \"As I was saying, Jeremy, without you my life would be ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem man. What are friends for?\" said Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't believe I was ever attracted to that bitch, even for a few days.\" said Josie who's arms had been around her boyfriend since her feelings for him had been restored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess all that's left to do is burn this deck.\" said Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" said Micheal. \"That was the worst birthday present ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww.\" said Phillip, \"Can't we keep it but only use it for fun and just never let Anna within a 1 foot radius of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Phillip.\" said Jeremy, \"It sounds tempting but we can't risk it. Alright lets burn this thing. Micheal I'll let you do the honnors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed the deck to Micheal who then led everyone out to the backyard where Elizabeth handed him a lighter to set the deck on fire. Micheal lit it up and then dropped it into a metal bucket to burn. Everyone then went back inside where they realized Anna was still tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we should untie  her now.\" said Jeremy. Micheal then walked up to his evil sister and ripped the duct tape off her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you all.\" was the first thing to come out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we all hate you too.\" Micheal teased.

I wasn't able to win last time.\"  She beamed as she looked around the table like a cat looking for a morsel of food.  She could feel her heart rate increase with the anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you going to pick Squirt?\"  Jeremy asked as he leaned back and took a bite out of his pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice to your sister Jeremy.\"  Elizabeth said to him in a exasperated tone.  \"Because your the oldest doesn't mean that you can pick on her.\"  She sighed thinking back to when she and Helen were younger and her own parents said that to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'll never know if she will be more successful that you later on in life.  Right Lizzie?\"  Helen replied with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better hurry up Mel.\"  Jeremy said to his sister.  \"You only have another minute before it picks for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\"  Melody said as she pushed the comment aside.  She didn't need to have that brought to her attention, since it was this reason that she now had a boyfriend several years older than herself.  She took several seconds to look around the table and finally her eyes set on her Aunt.  With her being a swimsuit model, she always looked beautiful with her shoots.  \"I know what I want now.  I want to swap chests with Aunt Helen.\"  She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen couldn't help but chuckle at that.  \"Sure maybe in a couple more yea...\"  She stopped mid sentence when she felt her own chest starting to shrink down until it was the same size that she had when she was Melody's age.  \"Holy shit, I didn't think it was going to be for real.\"  She exclaimed as she opened up the top of her blouse to get a better look at the changes.  Oddly enough her Victoria Secret Demi Bra seemed to be in a smaller size too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets keep going.\"  Melody announced in a much chipper tone as she handed the cards to her Mom to deal out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure dear.\"  Elizabeth said apprehensively as she took the cards.  \"Umm...

I think we'll be going to Okinawa for a couple days and then I will be having a 2 week break.\"  She picked up the cards that she was given and started to look at them.  \"Then I think I will be going to Milan for fashion week and then Paris after that.\"  She replied in a humdrum tone, she would give anything for a break.</span></div></div>",

If she would have thought better, they were thinking that she was certainly seeing somebody on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it was fun the first several years, but now its the same stuff over and over again.  Sure, the designers pay us really well and we're able to get some gift bags, but its always the same.

All four of them stopped the idle chit chat and focused on the game.  After several minutes, they all found out that Jeremy was the winner this round and got to pick something from the losers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you going to pick?\"  Melody asked wondering what her brother was going to pick from the 3 of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Helen?\"  Jeremy said as he turned towards his aunt.  \"Are you really not wanting to travel later on this week?\"  He was kind of timid about asking straight out and wanted to make sure that it would be okay if he took what he wanted.  \"I mean, you sounded like you would rather not do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy, are you wanting to go on my trip for me?\"  Helen asked with a coy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, if you and I swap lives, then you can stay here and I will go to Okinawa for you.\"  Jeremy pointed out to her, trying to seem like it was not a big deal.  Deep down inside, Jeremy wanted to go to Japan and check out the culture there and perhaps even take a trip up to Tokyo and see the legendary Akihabara district and get some of his favorite Manga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think that would be the best thing for me and with those legs of yours, I think you'll go far.\"  Helen replied as she looked down at Jeremy's legs that he got from Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where he got them from, but it certainly wasn't from me.\"  Elizabeth chuckled.  The comment caused both Jeremy and Melody to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap lives with Helen.\"  Jeremy said with an authoritative tone, trying to take their attention off of his legs.  Within the blink of an eye, the two of them swapped seats.  \"Wow that was odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\"  Helen asked as she looked down at her own body and found nothing out of place except that they were in each other's seats.  She looked for her purse to find her phone, but didn't seem to find it near her.  She remembered that she had it hanging on the back of her chair.  \"How about you look through my, err... I mean your purse and find the phone.  You should have some emails from the agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy nodded and grabbed the purse and looked through it to find his Aunt's phone which was now his phones to see that it was now notifying him that he had numerous unread emails.  \"Who is Hector, Ames, Hershey, &amp; Allen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen chuckled.  \"It looks like it worked, they're my modeling agency.  <i>HAHA</i> mainly started with comedians, but ventured into modeling after Mr. Allen's daughter wanted to become one.  So it looks like I will be in High School again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly looks like it.\"  Elizabeth replied as she started to gather up the cards and deal out the next hand.\"</span></div></div>",

She then turned the phone around to see what she was looking at and it made his jaw drop to the floor. \"I'm, or rather, you're still a swimsuit model.\" The picture was of the latest photo shoot, showing Jeremy wearing a bikini and posing in the ocean. The bottoms looked to be too crowded with his penis strained in the enclosed fabric and the top looked out of place on his flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is too funny.\" Melody guffawed as she saw the photo. \"At least your legs look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I win this round.\" Elizabeth said as she placed the final card down showing that she had won the most tricks that game. \"Jeremy, I think I could help you with some of your problems, but also Melody too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Melody and Jeremy said at the same time, they both didn't want the help of their own Mom and didn't want to see what it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I will help.\" She said with a finger in the corner of her mouth thinking. \"Melody first.\" Melody's face grew more and more into despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you don't need to help...\" Melody started to say, but was soon cut off by Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense.\" She said with a smile. \"Now, I know you've been having trouble with Allison Dewberry, so I want to swap jobs with Melody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Helen wondered as she looked at her former sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it means, what I think it means, I will take her spot as a student.\" Elizabeth said with a triumphant smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ruined.\" Melody said with a grim look as she brought her hands up to her face. \"I will never recover from this.  I will be a loser for the rest of High School.\"</span></div></div>",

It was still weird to have a boyfriend that she didn't even know, and Greg was sixteen with a car and everything. Part of her thought it was cool to have such a mature boyfriend but the bigger part of her was intimidated by it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta choose quickly squirt,\" her older brother Jeremy teased, reaching over to mess up her hair. \"Remember the timer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brat,\" she said, sticking her tongue out at him. \"Maybe I should take your height so you can be the short one, how would that feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now,\" Josie said, trying to keep things from blowing up. \"This should be fun, keep it friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! There's just a lot I could do and I don't want to waste it. I barely ever win when I play with so many people that are older than me. Wait... that's it,\" she said, her eyes lighting up as the idea struck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Jeremy said, shrinking back from his little sister. \"What are you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap ages with Josie!\" Melody cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the table people gasped, then watched Melody and Josie for changes. A minute went by, then another, and nothing seemed to change about either girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" Josie said. \"Maybe it didn't happen in the time limit, and some other random swap happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Michael said, scratching his head. \"Josie, check your driver's license, see what it says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Josie muttered as she started digging in her purse. \"Wait a minute... half my stuff is missing. My car keys are gone... my license... oh my god, I've got a school ID for Thurston Middle School! It says I'm in Eighth Grade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Melody said, a little stunned. Looking in her own purse, she found a set of car keys along with a driver's license that said she was seventeen. It had even moved her birthday from May 21st to September 4th. \"Hey Josie, what month were you born in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"September, I'm a Virgo,\" Josie said without thinking much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not any more you're not. It looks like you get to be a Gemini now. This is so weird. I thought I'd grow up and she'd get younger, but it just changed everything else about our ages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think I mind too much,\" Josie said, looking to Michael with a teasing wink. \"Can you handle dating a younger woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can manage that, as long as you can handle dating a guy who wears your skirts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Anna butted in. \"Now that that's settled, will someone deal the next hand?

At first she was shocked by all the changes which happened to her because of the game but now she really enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up, brat.\", Anna grunted still being angry at Michael for letting her play this game and letting her lose her boyfriend. \"We don't have all night.\".

Now she thought about swapping something precious to Anna. Her only problem was that she did not know Anna and therefore did not know what she could swap with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should hurry little- er big sis. The time you have is nearly up.\", Jeremy informed his sister, finding it strange that she is now older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah erm...\". Melody quickly began thinking about what she could swap. She decided that swapping with Anna, even though she was mean, was a bad idea because it was nearly impossible for her to anticipate what would anger her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap heigths with Jeremy.\". That said, Melody suddenly grew 1\"4' within a second, here clothes instantly altering to fit her. On the other hand, Jeremy shrank to 5\" and his clothes altered just like hers did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\", she gasped astonished. \"Everything seems so tiny.\", she giggled.

Then...he looked devilishly as Josie...who just gulped. \"There are other people in the room you know you perv\" she told him, dreading what he wanted to take from her. She needn't have worried through, because Jeremy quickly leapt out of his chair...propelling himself forward using his sexier (and shorter) legs (courtesy of Anna). And Jeremy put his hand over Phillip's mouth so that he couldn't say anything, much to Josie's relief, and everybody else's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure this isn't in the rules of the game\" Anna sighed, but even she had to smile as she watched Phillip struggle to remove Jeremy's large hand from over his mouth. Phillip did try saying what he wanted to swap with Josie...but all that came out was a muffled noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy kept his hand pressed on Philipp's mouth as hard as he could. He only had one problem: If it was unnecessary to swap something how long should he keep Philipp's mouth shut? Philipp was meanwhile struggling to get a swap done. But all in vein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you promise not to make a horrible swap with Josie?\", Jeremy asked him after a while, hoping that he could stop Philipp. Philipp nodded slightly and Jeremy let go off Philipp's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap chests with Josie!\", the freed Philipp blurted out. Josie looked shocked down at himself but nothing had happened. Philipp was as surprised as Josie was. \"What happened?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your game is broken.\", grinned Anna. \"Can't be.\", Michael said confused. \"It worked perfectly fine with Jeremy's and your swap...\". Michael grabbed the manual and read through it. \"Oops...\". Michael smiled embarrassed. \"It seems there is a time limit. I er... overread the passage. You have to swap something within two minutes.\", he explained. \"Otherwise the card choose something.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly, Phillip's face contorted into a frown. \"Hey guys...I have a sudden urge to go shoe shopping!\" he told his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want to play computer games!\" Anna suddenly said, glaring at Phillip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael just laughed at his sister. \"Could have been worse\" he told her, as it became clear to everyone that the main 'hobbies' Phillip and Anna had been swapped. \"You can have a go on Call of Duty Black Ops with me later on\" he then joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, funny...NOT!\" a hairy-legged Anna mumbled sarcastically. \"Wait a second.\". She glared at Michael. \"What was swapped when I won?\". Michael shrugged his shoulders. \"Don't know. But it's not something physical. You would have noticed.\". Anna began looking for any changes in her behaviour, clothes or on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And DON'T do that again!\" Phillip said to Jeremy, still pissed that he had covered his mouth. \"Well then, stop obsessing about Josie and maybe I won't\" Jeremy responded. \"Yeah...freak!

He had something else in mind. \"I want to swap shoes with Anna.\", he said, instantly looking down on his feet which were now clad in Anna's wedge heeled sandals. His feet were still dressed in his white tennis socks which looked very unsightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna shrugged her shoulders. \"I don't care anyway. It's hard for me to imagine I liked shoes that much.\", she explained. Anna took her cellphone out due to boredom. \"What the? Where did Greg's number go?\", she yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you delete it?\", Melody asked impatiently. She really wanted to win at least once. \"Why would I do that?!\", Anna shouted angrily and pressed nearly every button of her phone but with no success. \"Wait a minute...\", she stopped and looked rather shocked. \"Could it be? No... No... NO!\". She looked furiously at Michael. \"There's only one reason the number is gone! I swapped my boyfriend with someone of you!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would make sense...\", Michael mumbled. \"But with who?\". \"All of you! Look up in your fucking phones if you have his number!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked up there phones if the number was saved in there. Only Melody who did not like to be yelled at found an unfamiliar number in her phone. \"Is it this number?\", she asked Anna, showing her the phone. \"It is... YOU!\", she looked angrily at Melody which intimidated the 13 year old girl. \"YOU STOLE MY BOYFRIEND!\", she shouted at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, sis.\", Michael tried to calm her down. \"You can't do anything about it now.\". Anna crossed her arms angrily. This seriously was a bad night for her. She lost her legs, her boyfriend and her main hobby. It could not get any worse, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...

Josie appeared a little concerned, whereas Anna was still fuming over the loss of her boyfriend...among several other things she treasured, including her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked little smirk directed at Anna told everyone what Melody had in mind. \"You dare!\" Anna spat at the young girl, \"Haven't you taken enough off me right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" a seemingly uncaring Melody replied. \"Right...I want to swap chests with Anna!\" the 13-year old then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Anna shouted in shock...instantly feeling a familiar tingling sensation across her chest as her breasts started shrinking. Reaching up to her chest in shock she rested her hands on what were now a pair of A-Cup boobs, Melody's to be precise. \"You little bitch!\" Anna cursed at Melody, as she looked up to see her groping her perky new C-Cups. \"Oh yeah...these feel amazing\" the girl squealed in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could say the same!\" Anna grumbled. If she hadn't hated the game enough before, she certainly did now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have swapped chest with Josie instead\" Jeremy said to his little sister, \"You'd have been even bigger then\" Melody just glanced at her brother and grinned. \"Yeah I could have, but this is more fun\" she told him. \"Besides, they're too big for me\" she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sis...try and keep calm okay, its probably not permanent\" Michael tried assuring Anna, who just sat back in her chair and folded her arms.

The silence was nearly killing everybody. Nobody dared to even breath out. Nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at his watch after a while. \"It's at least 4 minutes after you won.

Let's continue.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat nobody knows, Jeremy swapped reflections with Melody. Whenever he sees a reflection of himself, he'll see the reflection of his little sister, dressed in clothes equivalent to her what she would be wearing. Nobody would think that the reflection is strange or that it is dressed unappropriate if what Jeremy wears is appropriate (especially when he's naked upwards).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Authors Note: Since male and female clothing is not completely equivalent, there is some freedom. For example when Jeremy puts on his boxers, his reflection would wear panties and bra or just panties. In last case, he would have to wear an undershirt so that the reflection wears a bra. There is also some context sensitivity. If Jeremy wears light, summer clothes, the reflection would wear a summer dress if Melody would wear one at that day.</b></span></div></div>",

He looked at Michael or Josie. \"It's not too bad if we try to see the swaps as something intersting to experience. Just see it as a vacation from carrying the heavy boobs, Josie.\". He then looked at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's come back to my idea. I think we all should make a list. We write down three things we don't want to get swapped. If someone wins we try to not swap that.\". Jeremy looked over to Anna. \"Sorry for swapping your legs. I didn't mean to anger you.\", he apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna listened to Jeremy's idea and apology and sighed. \"Forget it. You're right. If we just swap something the other does not want to be swapped we'll only get angry.\". Jeremy was astonished by Anna's reasonable answer. Normally she was not friendly to him. She was rarely friendly to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the rest?\", Jeremy asked and looked at the group. \"Do you agree with me?\". Everyone nodded even though it seemed if Philipp just nodded because someone said something and not because he agreed. The pervert was completely engrossed playing with his new toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Wait till I got a sheet of paper.\", said Michael and went off to get one. Just as the time limit was over. Unfortunately it was not something physical that was swapped so no one noticed and still no one knows about the limit. Also no one knows that Jeremy swapped boyfriends/girlfriends with Josie which resulted that Jeremy was now in the boyfriend of his best friend. Josie was now single because Jeremy just broke up with his last girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill this swap remains hidden from the players who were busy writing down what they want to keep. The first to write something down was Anna. \"I want to keep my boyfriend, my clothes...\". Michael stopped her. \"I think that would be your things.\". Anna looked annoyed at her brother. \"But we agreed we write down three things.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that we did.\", explained Michael. \"But if I understand the manual correctly it's impossible to swap a very big amount of things like clothes completely. At lest with one swap.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna snuffled. \"Fine.\". She then handed the pen and paper over to Josie. \"I want to keep my boyfriend as well. Also I want to keep my hair and my family. Sadly I can't keep my breasts anymore.\", she added with a sigh and handed pen and paper to her boyfriend. \"Mh... Okay... I want to keep my girlfriend, obvious. Also I want to keep my penis. Last thing... Mh... I want to keep my chest.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then handed everything to Jeremy. Both did not know that they were a couple right now. \"Okay. Mh. I want to keep age, my intellegence and my gender.\". Jeremy was fine with any physical swaps that would take place but he certainly did not want to be younger, less intelligent or seen as a girl. He was quite sure that he would still be considered a man even though everything else was female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody was the next one to write something down. \"Mh... I want to keep my friends, my name and my family.\", she said and wrote it down quickly. The last one was Philipp. He just pushed the paper away. \"Don't need something to write down.\", he said. \"I've got everything I want and I'm fine with every swap.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked at him. \"You really sure? Don't complain afterwards.\". Philipp just nodded and continued his exploration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy shrugged his shoulders and took the paper. \"Okay then... I read it out loud so that everyone can see if everything is correct.\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna:<br>\r\n-Boyfriend<br>\r\n-Clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie:<br>\r\n-Boyfriend<br>\r\n-Hair<br>\r\n-Family<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael:<br>\r\n-Girlfriend<br>\r\n-Penis<br>\r\n-Chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy:<br>\r\n-Age<br>\r\n-Intelligence<br>\r\n-Gender<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody:<br>\r\n-Friends<br>\r\n-Name<br>\r\n-Family<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp:<br>\r\n/<br>\r\n\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked up. \"Everyone fine with the list?\", he asked and received simple nodding from the others. \"Okay, then let us continue playing. The winner can get swap everything he wants without fearing that anybody gets angry, okay? This game is meant to make our lives interesting.\".

Annoying. The only one left who would have some decent female friends would be you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not allowed to swap my friends away.\", corrected Melody Anna and pointed at the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie nodded. \"I see.

The red haired girl then looked to Melody. \"May I ask why you choose that?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody smiled innocently. \"We can swap anything and experience something interesting, right?

After a few seconds, they reappear in opposite positions. Josie is in Melody's chair, and Melody is snuggled up with Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it really happen?\" Jeremy asks in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it definitely did,\" Anna adds with a smirk about this turn of events on Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. Why did you do this?\" Josie snaps still a bit in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody feels like a little girl being accused, and she begins to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I thought you said ... said we could, should switch, and, and I, I, I just ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, Melody,\" Michael consoles giving her a hug with the arm that is already around her when she popped up in Josie's place. \"It's just a game,\" he said using his eyes to plead with Josie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Of course,\" Josie answers and forces a smile. \"It was just such a surprise. I'm sure we can get through this for two days. It might be fun,\" she adds seeing Michael's urging expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there's a knock on the door, and Michael's mom comes in and looks directly at Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, your and Jeremy's mom just called. She wants you two to start heading home, so finish whatever you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, mom,\" Michael whines. \"It's my birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be your birthday,\" she says looking at Michael before turning back to Josie. \"But it's not Melody's. You're still just thirteen. Besides it's Thursday, and you all have school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few more minutes. OK?\" Michael pleads with his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a stern motherly look and a pause, she relents. \"OK, dear, since it is your birthday. But then, Melody,\" she looks back at Josie, \"you have to go home.\" She turns and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird,\" Jeremy states. \"She looked at Josie when she was talking to Melody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess only we can see the real person but others probably just see Melody when they look at Josie and vice versa,\" Anna explains. \"They definitely have to live each others lives, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody is awe struck and really happy that she will be living Michael's girlfriend's life. However, Michael has pulled his arm and gently eases her away before he picks up the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. One more game,\" Michael announces and deals the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly they play with the winner being ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was upset at first, but I'm in the spirit now,\" she chirps merrily while dealing the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.

Melody's eyes go wide as she jerks her head to stare at Anna in surprise. Anna whispers some more, and Melody relaxes, nodding her head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap breasts with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Michael's shirt goes back to normal as Josie's breasts shrink down to Melody's tiny A-cups. At the same time, Melody's blouse blossoms out as Josie's D-cups fill and expand Melody's bra underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, what? Why'd you do that?\" Josie offers what everyone's wondering and gives Anna a suspicious stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looks over at Anna who smiles and nods before Melody speaks turning to Michael. \"Michael's been so nice that he shouldn't have to put up with these, and mine are, were ...\" She blushes very red as she looks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Melody,\" he says kindly pulling her into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time Melody felt what it was like to have real breasts when being hugged. The familiar chest against Michael was very comfortable and felt right. As he let go, Melody rolled her shoulders and tried to adjust them better in her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were getting a bit uncomfortable. I hope they won't be for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. I'm sure I can handle them.\" She blushes again and looks away before adding, \"Besides it will help remind me to be in character.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna tries to hide her smirk. She knew that Michael was just as fascinated with Josie's boobs as Phillip, just not as perverted. She was sure that Michael would find it very difficult to keep his hands off Melody now that she had them. Hopefully, that would lead to something that Josie would not accept, and Anna would be rid of Josie once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Anna, I guess I have to say you were helpful,\" Josie admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone helped <i>her</i>, but I'm the one in pain,\" Phillip mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody. Jeremy. Time to go,\" comes Michael's mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, <i>Anna</i>. I'll help you. Let's go get you those pills and some tampons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tampons?\" Phillip almost screams in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear.\" Anna baby-talks to him and pats him on the head. \"My little girl needs to learn about what she so desperately is interested in.\" As the two of them then head off, Anna looks back with a mischievous grin on her face obviously thinking of some way to make this even worse for Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, <i>Sis</i>,\" Jeremy tells Josie. \"You know if we don't get home right now, Dad will ground us both all weekend, and we won't be back Saturday to play again and switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, strangely, I do know that,\" she admits. \"Thanks, Michael,\" she purrs running over and giving him a big kiss on the lips. It breaks just before Mrs. Ferguson walks in and would have seen Melody kissing her son. \"See you in two days,\" she calls and scurries after Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Melody, Mrs. Ferguson smiles and tells her, \"Josie, you're welcome to stay as long as your parents agree. Now why don't you two find something to do while I clean up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can clean up, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael Ferguson! You will do no such thing on your birthday. Now scoot! And you two go have some fun.\" With a wink, she pushes them out of the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josie and Jeremy went home, Anna and Phillip went to the bathroom to, well, help him with his new problem, and Melody and Michael found themselves alone. \"So, um, what do you want to do?\"  Melody wondered as she started fidgeting with her new endowments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Micheal wondered as he started to look and feel his new chest.  He then glanced up to see Melody starting to rub her won shoulders as if she was trying to alleviate some pain.  \"I know they can be heavy, I mean, I had them for about 5 minutes and my back was starting to get sore.\"  Michael said with a small grin on his face as he started to pat on his bed.  \"Come over and I will help you out a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody gave a nervous giggle as she slowly mad her way over to the bed where Michael was sitting. \"Wha... What should I do?\"  she stammered as she sat down next to him.

As she sat down she turned so that her back was facing him and asked,  \"Like this?\"  She didn't know what she was supposed to do, all of the massages that she has seen were mostly on television and they were mostly naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, you can do it like that or you can take your shirt off.  It doesn't really matter, but for it to be more effective, your shirt should be off.\"  He replied back as he started to take his shirt off too.  He mainly did it so that he could be more persuasive and also so that he could examine his new chest in greater detail. 'Well, I want to see what I got myself into and plus I can ask her some question since this is her chest.'  He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you say so,\" Melody said as she started to take her shirt off too.  After it was off, she glanced over to a shirtless Michael and noticed her old chest.  It honestly looked like he had man boobs going on, but with more feminine nipples.  She couldn't really do anything but giggle at this sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you laughing?\" Michael wondered as he started to blush himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing really.  I think my chest suits you well, honestly.\"  Melody said with a grin.  \"You know, instead of a massage, I can show you some of the finer points of having a girly chest.\"  She offered as she went over to caress he left nipple.  As she did, she couldn't help but notice him shudder with ecstasy.  'It's almost like Anna said.  Switch chests with him and show him what it's like, then he will be putty in my hands.'  She thought as she began to ask, \"So what do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

Josie's D-cup breasts looked ridiculously large on Melody's adolescent body. She quickly pulled off her t-shirt and threw it on the floor.  Underneath was the training bra that she started wearing just last month. It was now altered to hold the large breasts that she now had. \"Almost there.\" She grinned as she pulled off her training bra. Melody's jaw hit the floor as she stared at her new breasts that hung from her chest. \"This is so awesome!\" She jumped up and down making them jiggle.

She had nearly forgotten about the last switch that she made. \"I should probably check out Philip's penis too.\" Melody smiled as she unbuttoned her pants. \"Holy--\" She said has Philip's hardening dick flopped out of her tight jeans. This was the first penis Melody had ever seen and here it was attached to her own body. \"Oh yeah...this feels so right.\" She moaned as she turned to her reflection.</span></div></div>",

Luckily her bra adjustet to the new big breasts she now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm nearly flat...\", Josie sighed as her breasts now shrank down to Melody's A-Cups.

She looked in her purse for her drivers license, but couldn't find it.  \"Hey, my driver's license is gone.  Wait, what's this?\" she asked as she pulled out an unfamiliar id.  Her heart sank as she looked at it - it was a school id for the middle school Melody attended.  \"Oh great.  Now I'm back in the eighth grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody was much happier with her discovery.  \"Woohoo!  I'm seventeen now!  I can drive!  I get to go to high school with all you guys!

Let's take a five minute break,\" said Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody got up to head to the bathroom, but realized she didn't know where it was.  Anna noticed her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here, I'll show you where the bathroom is.\"  Anna led Melody upstairs.  Michael looked on in confusion, his sister never volunteered to be helpful.  He wondered if she had some ulterior motive for going upstairs, but he knew better than to try to anticipate her behavior.  He looked at a gloomy Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we're just having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say.  You haven't lost your best attributes and been sent back to middle school,\" Josie pouted.  Michael leaned over and gave her a kiss, then held onto her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no matter what you look like or where you go to school, I still love you.  Cheer up and help me get some snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie brightened up with the affection from Michael.  She decided to try to not dwell on the changes for now.  If Michael could still kiss her like he meant it with her almost flat chest and hairy legs, then things were still going to be alright.  She helped Michael fill up bowls with chips and trail mix, and get a few sodas out of the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, upstairs Anna showed Melody the bathroom, but when Melody went to close the door, Anna stopped her with an arm on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, I've been thinking.  You've always liked my brother right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody nodded.  \"Yeah, he's much nicer than my brother.  I wish he was my brother instead of Jeremy.  Oh wow!  If I win again, I can swap them!\"  Melody smiled a big smile.  Anna looked at her thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could do that.  But now that you're 17, it might be different to have him as a twin than as an older brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" said Melody dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But cheer up.  Now that you're his age, you could have him as a boyfriend,\" Anna said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  I've never had a boyfriend before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the perfect way to start.  You know Michael, you've seen how nice he is to Josie, just think how great it would be to have a boyfriend that is that nice to you.  Besides, I've seen you over here before, the way you look at him.  You think he's cute don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody blushed.  \"Well, yeah, he is pretty cute.  But wouldn't that be mean to Josie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna shook her head.  \"Don't worry about it, it's only temporary.  Besides, they can't exactly date if he's 17 and she's 13, do you know of any juniors in highschool who are allowed to date middle schoolers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right!  I guess it's not so mean then, since they can't be together for two days anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.  Tell you what, I'll even try to help you make it happen if I win.  You just agree not to swap anything bad with me, or help me if I need it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!  Thanks so much Anna!  You're really nice!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna smiled and let Melody use the bathroom.  This was perfect.  Anna had never gotten along with Josie.  She always resented the way her mother treated her like a family member even though she wasn't, and worse, as a more mature one than she treated her own daughter!  Plus, Josie was always such a goody two-shoes, Anna wanted to see her taken down a peg or two.  Melody had already made a great start, but Anna wanted to see more.  Now she might have her chance, and best of all, if it looked like Melody's idea, no one would blame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Melody was done, the two girls walked back down stairs.  Michael and Josie returned with the snacks, and everyone in the group sat back down in their seats.  Michael gave Josie's hand a re-affirming squeeze.  \"Okay guys, let's get back to it.\"</span></div></div>",

This was her chance, but she was a little nervous.  She didn't really want to be mean to Josie.  But Anna told her it was okay, it was all in fun and it was only temporary.  So with a surprising seriousness to her voice, she said \"I want to swap how Michael feels about me with Josie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked surprised.  \"Sis, what are you doing?\" Jeremy asked, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody!\" Josie yelled, \"What do you think you're doing?!  This isn't funny anymore!\"  Josie slammed her fist down on the table.  Then she turned toward Michael.  \"Michael, are you still my boyfriend?\" she asked with trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, of course I am,\" said Michael.  Michael, for his part, was confused.  He remembered dating Josie for the past year and a half, but now that he thought about it, he really couldn't think of why he went out with her in the first place.  He felt like she was a cute kid, but too young for him to see as anyone but a little sister.  She wasn't attractive like Jeremy's sister Melody.  In fact, Michael realized that he was not only attracted to Melody, he was in love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Josie, reaching out for his hand and squeezing it.  Michael let his hand be held, but he didn't squeeze back.  Josie couldn't help but notice, and it took all her strength to fight back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn, I guess it didn't work,\" said Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  That will teach you for doing something so mean,\" said Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, meanwhile, had a smirk on her face.  At first, she had been disappointed that nothing had happened.  But she was watching Micheal and Josie carefully, and she had been around them together enough to know how they acted.  No one else may have noticed, but Anna could see that Michael was already pulling away from Josie and treating her differently, as well as sneaking glances at Melody when he thought she wasn't looking.  It looks like her plan was working, it just needed one more push.  Maybe Melody would win again.  She grabbed the cards and started shuffling.  \"Let's see if we can have a more fun round this time,\" she said, dealing the cards.</span></div></div>",

Jeremy just looked at him with a 'what is your problem' look on his face, but said nothing.  Josie was jealous of the way Michael was sticking up for Melody and tried to slide her chair closer to Michael, but ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two are done, I'd like to see what being tall is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, don't you take my height,\" Jeremy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, like I want to be some freakish giant Amazon woman.  No, I want to swap height with Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at the siblings, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again.  Is this going to be another stupid change like age where it only changes on our ids?\" Anna asked dejectedly.  She and Michael looked at their drivers licenses, but their heights were still the same as before.  No one knew what was going on.  Jeremy grabbed the rulebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha.  If you win with a joker, you don't swap between yourself and someone else, you make a swap between to others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a weird rule,\" said Phillip.  He sighed.  He was getting tired of not winning.  Ever since they started, he was hoping for a chance at Josie's, now Melody's, breasts.  The things he wanted to do to those...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I can't swap, I guess I'll have to help out someone else.  Brother, I don't want to be the sister of the creepy older guy who is dating a 13 year old.  I want to swap Melody's relationship to Michael with Josie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" squealed Melody, clapping her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie stared dumbstruck.  \"Can she do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously she can.  When you're older, you'll better understand how this game works,\" Michael said, treating Josie as he would a friend's little sister.  Michael stood up.  \"Hey Jeremy, mind if we switch places?  I'd like to sit next to my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, she's my sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so?  I'm dating her, not you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy grumbled to himself, but got up and took Michael's seat next to Josie.  Michael sat down next to Melody and kissed her.  Melody was floored by her first kiss.  She stared dreamily into Michael's eyes.  Josie watched the display of PDA and couldn't hold back anymore.  She started to sob quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you for this, you bitch\" she said to Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't blame me, you were the one who wanted to see what this game could do.  Besides, Melody was the one who did the damage, I just cleaned it up so Michael wouldn't be accused of dating a child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie seethed in anger, glaring daggers at Anna.  Jeremy patted her on the shoulder.  \"Come on Josie, this will be okay.  Remember, in 48 hours this will be back to normal.\"  Josie wasn't sure she could last that long, but her anger at Anna might sustain her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillip grabbed the deck of cards.  While he had to admit, seeing the escalating war between Melody and Anna versus Josie was entertaining, he really wanted to win.  He quickly shuffled the cards and started dealing.  \"Come on guys, let's play again.  I need a turn to win!\"</span></div></div>",

Not only because his best friend was with his sister, but also because he felt bad for poor Josie having to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you two not do that so much?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry pal.

Plus, realistically, I didn't know how the cards were going to keep you around.  As a 13 year old not related to anyone here, it might be pretty weird for you to be here.

They all knew what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but who to choose?\"  Phillip turned toward Anna.  \"Michael's lovely sister?\"  Then he turned toward Melody.  \"Or his girlfriend?  Oh like there's a choice.  I want to swap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Phillip could finish, Mrs. Ferguson walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you kids doing in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine mom,\" Michael replied, \"we're just playing a game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope it's been fun, but it is a school night, so I think it's time to call it quits.  And sorry Melody, even though you're Michael's girlfriend, I'm not quite comfortable with you spending the night on a school night.\"  Melody's eyes widened.  She hadn't even considered that possibility.  She just had her first kiss a few moments ago.  Would Michael really expect her to do other things?  Luckily, it looked like she wouldn't have to worry about that, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for letting us come over for dinner Mrs. Ferguson,\" Jeremy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was my pleasure.  You and your sister Josie are welcome over anytime, you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie blushed.  She had had many conversations with Michael's mom in the past, and really felt like she was respected and well-liked.  Now she felt childish being referred to as nothing more than Jeremy's little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom, we'll clean up and then everyone will go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Have a good night everyone,\" Mrs. Ferguson said, leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she left, Phillip burst out \"I want to swap chests with Melody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched with disgust, waiting to see what Phillip would do with Josie's former chest.  But to the group's surprise, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!  I finally win and it doesn't work?!  This game sucks!\" Phillip ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it,\" said Michael, \"we know that kind of swap works, since Melody did it earlier.  Maybe the same part can't be swapped twice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe your mom interrupted the game, and it didn't count Phillip's win?\" said Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a conspiracy, I tell you...\" muttered Phillip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat no one realized is because Phillip didn't make his choice before the time ran out, the game made a random swap for him.  Unfortunately for him, that random swap was to swap his sexual preference with Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I guess that's it for tonight.  Jeremy, do you mind dropping Melody off at her place on your way home?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy laughed at the idea of taking his sister to another house.  \"You bet.\"  Josie wasn't so thrilled to be around Melody, since she had stolen her boyfriend, but she wasn't spiteful enough to make her walk home, so she said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you at school tomorrow honey\" Michael said to Melody, leaning in and giving her a passionate goodnight kiss.  Melody returned the kiss as best she could, but she obviously lacked experience.  Michael didn't seem to mind, he smiled at her and hugged her goodbye, then went to help Anna clean up the table.  Phillip just muttered to himself and walked out.  Jeremy came over to Melody and put his arm around her shoulder.  \"Well, I hope you're happy.  Because of what you did, you get to go home to Josie's house tonight.  Now let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy led the two girls to his car.  Melody took her usual seat in the front, leaving Josie to sit in the back.  Once inside, Jeremy turned to Melody.  \"Melody, I want you to apologize to Josie right now.  I know you were just playing the game, but what you did really hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody felt bad.  She hadn't meant to be mean to Josie, she just got so caught up in the moment that she didn't care about her feelings.  \"I'm sorry Josie.  I just wanted to feel older so bad I got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked at Melody.  It was still weird to see the physically younger girl with her red hair and well-developed chest.  \"Well, I'm not going to say I'm not angry with you, but I can understand how it could happen.  Just promise me you'll swap back with me once the 48 hours are up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, and I mean this, NO. SEX. WITH. MY. BOYFRIEND!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked shocked.  \"Josie, calm down!  I'm sure Melody hadn't even thought of that.  Right Melody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looked as contrite as she could.  \"Right.  Hadn't crossed my mind...\"  In reality, it was all she was thinking about right now.  Could she even do it if she wanted to?  Did she want to?  She didn't know, but she wanted to figure it out for herself.  But there was no point in telling Jeremy and Josie that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was settled, Jeremy dropped Melody off at Josie's former house, then took Josie and himself back to his house.  They parked and walked inside.  \"Welcome to la casa de Parker.  Hope you enjoy the experience!\"</span></div></div>",

If you choose not to swap within two minutes then you get randomly swapped something with the other participants.\", he explained to the others. \"Ok.

Did I swap with you?\", she asked the now sweating guy. \"Shut up!\", he said angry, \"It's all your fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now?

Just choose something.\", Philipp added still annoyed that he was now gay. Looking at his friend was really strange now. Because of Josie and her late decision he now found him very attractive. Also having Josie's breasts was now completely useless for him! He did not like breasts like he used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\", Michael grumbled. \"Just be quite until I choose something.\". He looked at Josie who was now considered a lesbian. \"Well, I think I know a way to make her more happy.\", he thought. \"I want to swap genitals with Josie.\", he said smiling at his girlfriend. She looked at him curious, while a penis was forming inside her panties. \"Why do you want to swap that?\", she asked him, looking rather male with the small A-cups and ovious bulge she now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because of the last swap you're attracted to woman, right?\", he began explaining. \"Well, I figured you'd like it if I had a vagina. That's what you're interested in right now, aren't you?\". She smiled, stood up and hugged him. \"Thanks.\", she whispered. \"But you don't really have to do this. It's okay if you stay like you are. I really appreciate it, it will make peeing for me much easier. Who knows what might happen in the bathroom while I'm interested in my own crotch.\". She then sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my brother wants to be a girl. How funny.\", Anna teased Michael. She looked at him with her usual evil grin.

Michael grinned. \"As if I had ever listened to her.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two lovebirds could please stop making out.

I want to swap legs with Jeremy.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" said Jeremy, glad to have hairy legs again, \"Having those things was weirding me out.\"<br>\r\n\"My point has been proven.\" Anna said, \"You played right into my scheme like I said.\"<br>\r\n\"Just give it a rest already would you?\" said Josie.<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wins next?</span></div></div>",

He just sat there looking frozen at his cards and then looked to his friends who were also starting to look a little nervous.  \"Come on big bro, just pick something.\" Melody said jealous that her brother had won.  \"Yeah, come on, hurry up and swap or else the cards will pick for you.\"  Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Okay.\"  Jeremy said trying to think but his mind just kept coming up blank, \"I want to swap legs back with Anna.\"  He said but nothing happened.  \"Looks like the whole no swap back thing was just confirmed.\"  Josie said as Anna looked a little sour at the non swap.  Anna was obviously mad that the swap didn't work, \"Just hurry up and pick something or else the cards will pick for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you\"  Jeremy said finishing Anna's sentence.  Atleast that's what it appeared as Jeremy all of the sudden looked very confused, as did Anna.  The two then quickly looked at each other and screamed.  Michael and Josie managed to shush the two down before they attracted unwanted attention from Michael and Anna's parents, Michael asked, \"What the hell is wrong with you two?  What happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's me and and I'm her!\"  Anna's body said pointing at Jeremy's body.  Suddenly the rest of the room quickly figured out what must have happened.  \"Are you saying the cards switched both of your entire bodies?\"  Josie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure did.  Damn.\"  Jeremy's body said sounding more angry than his body probably ever had.  Suddenly Anna's anger turned to her old body, \"This is your fault!  You should have just swapped something small.  This is probably some weird card karma for trying to swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not his fault Jer-Anna.\"  Josie said coming to Jeremy's defense who looked like he was about to cry.  \"You just need to follow the card's rules.  Remember, none of this is permanent.  We're just having fun and we'll all be back to normal soon.  Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, guess you're right.  But that doesn't mean I have to like it.\"  Anna said crossing her arms in a very unmanly pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there, it's going to be all right.\"  Philipp said wrapping an arm around Anna's waist which Anna slapped away, \"Back off Philipp, doesn't matter who's body I'm in or what gender you're into, I don't want you hitting on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're loss.\"  Philipp said shrugging the rejection off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that we've all cooled off, let's play the next hand.\"  Josie said dealing out the cards.</span></div></div>",

I win and I know exactly what I want.\"  Philipp said excitedly with a grin on his face that made everyone playing a little nervous.  \"It won't exactly be like I'd hoped it would be, but I can still get what I want.  I want to swap relationship status regarding Josie with Michael.\"  Philipp said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie was mortified, she didn't want to have Philipp for a boyfriend, even for a week.  She closed her eyes getting ready for the worst as she anticipated some sort of mental change that would make her fall head over heels for Philipp, but as she opened her eyes and looked at Philipp she felt the same disgust she'd always felt.  \"Good, I don't think it worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?  I did the switching thing in time.\"  Philipp said suddenly looking bummed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the cards won't swap something that trivial.\"  Anna said.  Josie turned to her and said with anger, \"Our relationship is not trivial!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, it wasn't trivial.\"  Said Michael looking at his smartphone, \"We aren't seeing each other anymore, you and Philipp are facebook official.\"  He said as he showed the group the relationship status that had Michael single and Josie and Philipp in a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  Philipp said victorious as Josie looked crest fallen.  She grabbed the phone and started looking through some pictures.  \"Well, atleast I don't look happy.  But this one will be easily fixed, I'll just 'break up' with Philipp and start seeing Michael again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna suddenly stepped in, \"No no no.  What happened to 'following the card's rules,' and 'this is all just fun'?  Not so fun when something not fun happens to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's different, this is something that can be changed easily.\"  Josie said meekishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, do that.  Cheat the game, but I bet these magic cards wouldn't like it.  For all we know you might have something bad happen to you if you don't just suck it up and go through with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Philipp added punctuating the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy suddenly spoke up for the first time in a while and quietly said, \"These cards are fun, but serious business.  You should just do what they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Josie, it won't be that bad,\" Michael said comforting his now former girlfriend, but as she was becoming comforted he took it one sentence too far, \"Besides, it could be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?\"  Josie said as if she couldn't believe Michael had just said that, \"You know this is Philipp we're talking about right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying it's not the end of the world.\"  Michael said backtracking, \"And if I could take the bullet for you I would, but the way that swap was worded I don't think I can help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Anna got a downright devious idea, \"But you could suffer with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  Michael said a little afraid of what his sister's devious mind had come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, that since it's just a week of hell for Josie, you should also suffer a little.  I say that since you're basically a girl right now, you should go out with a guy this week.\"  Anna said smuggly, \"And kiss him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no.  Don't have to so I won't.\"  Michael said ready to laugh, but Anna wasn't joking.  \"I mean it, you should go out with a guy this week.  Are you afraid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really I just don't want to go out with a guy, nothing complex about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't even do it for Josie as a show that you'll go through hell if she has to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I would, but Josie doesn't want me to, right Josie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut rather than the enthusiastic 'right honey!' Michael had hoped for, Josie said, \"Well, you wouldn't have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it'll be a dumb little thing we can laugh about a few weeks from now.  We're playing with the cards for different experiences, even if the experience may suck.\"  Josie gave a look to Philipp with that last line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Michael, how about I also do your chores for 2 weeks if you do it.\"  <i>It'd be more than worth it to see the uncomfortable look on his face.</i>  Anna thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\"  Michael said, he certainly wasn't keen on the idea of going out with a dude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do this with me then I'll...\"  Josie said as she leaned in and whispered something into Michael's ear that only he could hear.  Michael's eyes opened up wide and said, \"You've got a deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"  Anna said with an evil look on Jeremy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough with your stupid deals and stuff, I want to play.\"  Melody said taking and dealing the cards.</span></div></div>",

Average guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Anna Ferguson, 15 years old, Michael's sister. Attends to her brother's birthday but would rather be at the mall with her friends. 5\"4', C-Cups, long blond hair. Dresses provocatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Jeremy Parker, 16 years old. Michael's best friend. Knows Michael since elementary school. 6\"4', curly brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Josie Mason, 17 years old. Michael's girlfriend. Is older than Michael. 5\"6', D-Cups, shoulder length red hair, dresses conservative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Philipp Jenkins, 16 years old. Knows Michael and Jeremy since High School. He is some kind of pervert. 5\"10', black hair, wears glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Melody Parker, 13 years old. Jeremy's little sister. No friend of Michael in the common sense. Invited herself to the party. 5\". A- Cups, Long brown hair, usually in a pigtail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Deck of Cards:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe participants play a normal poker hand but without betting. The one who wins the hand can swap anything he wants from the other players simply by saying the words \"I want to swap ... with ... \". What you swap can be anything but it is not allowed to swap everything at once. For example you can swap heads with someone but you cannot swap the whole body in one hand.<br>\r\nWhen a swap took place nobody except the ones playing at the moment will notice anything strange, reality will alter so that it was always that way.<br>\r\nThe words for a swap have to be spoken within a time frame of two minutes. If not, a random swap between the winner and one of the losers takes place.<br>\r\nA swap which took place cannot be reverted by the person's who participated in the swap within 48 hours. For example if Michael swaps hair with Anna neither Michale nor Anna can swap their rightful hair back before 48 hours have passed but it is possible for someone other to swap hair with the two of them.<br>\r\nIt is also not possible to swap something back you had before within 48 hours. For example: Michael now has Anna's hair, Anna has Michael's. Josie wins the hand and swaps hair with Michael so she gets Anna's hair. Michael now has Josie's hair. It would be possible for Anna to swap hair with Michael so she would get Josie's hair but it is not possible for her to swap hair with Josie in order to get her own hair back.<br>\r\nClothes adjust when someone swaps clothing or if some other physical aspect is swapped which would not fit with the clothes currently worn. For example if someone swaps height with some his clothes adjust to his sight so they fit just like the clothes before fit.<br>\r\nThe swaps are not limited to physical appearance. It is possible to swap lives or personal information. If someone decides to swap lives he exchanges places with the person he swaps but keeps his body, clothes and first name. Family, friends and gender get swapped. It is possible as well to swap tastes, personality, connections to persons (e.g. Michael could swap being the son of Jeremy's mother. He would still live his own life, in his own house with his parents and sisters but he would be the son of Jeremy's mother).<br>\r\nIf someone quits playing the game while the others continue, the person will only notice the swaps prior quitting the game. Every swap which takes place afterwards will be completely unnoticed by the person. Also it is impossible to tell someone who not participated what has been swapped, because every information regarding a swap cannot be heard by someone who did not participate. For example: Michael tells his mother that he swapped hair with his sister. For Michaels mother he will have not said anything. Not even his lips moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Addition: (thanks to Jason for the idea)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the box Michael found are 4 cards hidden. 4 Joker cards. If used those for the game a special rule applies. If someone wins with one of them as his hand, he can choose what to swap between other people. (e.g. Michael wins with at least one Joker on his hand. He then can swap \"I want that Josie and Jeremy chests with each other\").<br>\r\nPlease only use these cards when they are discovered within the path and don't let them win with these cards that often<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can add more characters if you wish but don't create millions of siblings.<br>\r\nDon't suddenly end the story<br>\r\nDon't create chapters with just the two options (e.g. Does he swap something with her?)<br>\r\nAt least five sentences per chapter.<br>\r\nMinimum of 6 swaps and a maximum of 15 per poker evening.<br>\r\nNo killing<br>\r\nExplore how the characters life is with the swap instead of just jumping from one evening of playing poker to an other.<br>\r\nHave Fun.</td>",
