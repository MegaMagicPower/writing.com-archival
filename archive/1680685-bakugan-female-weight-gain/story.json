You've got to cook like this more often.\" Runo was thoroughly impressed with her mother and hoped to eat like this more often. Mrs. Misaki felt a mixture of pride and concern.

She put off this dilemma for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should lie down for a bit, Runo. You look a little sick.\" Runo slowly walked to her room, all the while showing a satisfied grin on her face, still rubbing her belly. Mrs. Misaki then concluded that Runo didn't seem to mind if she got fatter. Runo thought the same thing; if her mother's cooking was that good, it was worth getting fat for it, especially since she felt she was too thin, anyway.</span></div></div>",

It was a large part of her new 170 pound body. It also sometimes got her stuck in her seat, but Runo had gotten used to prying herself out. She waddled upstairs after clearing her place and looked at her growth. Not only had her belly grown, her face resembled a stuffed chipmunk. Her arms and legs grew to sausage-like proportions and had torn her gloves and socks when she tried putting them on. She no longer wore her belt, either; it just wouldn't fit around her. Runo was happy, however; she finally felt right with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled back downstairs after hearing the doorbell and found that it was Julie, Alice and Chan Lee, having dropped by for a visit, but they were shocked to see how much Runo had grown.

The three girls had a great feast. Runo certainly felt full and was used to the effects of it thanks to her bulging stomach that hung over her skirt. Just then Runo said \"Hey you guys, you know a perfect place to catch up on old times\" the girls listened while still recovering from the effects from the enormous feast \"The cafe\". To Julie and Alice that word meant pain in the stomach at the moment. Julie rubbed her stomach to ease the psyhological pain she felt. Alice however, didn't really get set off in pain as much as Julie did. Runo then continued \"So its settled then, we go to the cafe tomorow\". Julie and Alice had to agree. They didn't see their friend in a long time. It seemed like the right thing to do. \"Yeah...fine Runo\" Julie said as best as she could while slouching over on her chair. Her belly was pushing against her belt. She wanted so badly to loosen it up but she couldn't as she didn't want to be rude, so her belly tightened against her waistband with great force as she kept it on. She felt like the belt was going to pop off. \"So you guys ready for desert\" asked Runo. Julie could barely move and that word sent an even bigger strike of mentally fueled pain to her midsection. Alice also felt a bit rattled as she didn't really want to eat anymore.  At that moment, as if on que, Runo's mom walked in with a gigantic plate of Giant sized chocolate chip cookies and a jug of milk. Julie couldn't bear it anymore and said calmly as she could \"No thanks Runo I'm really full, but thanks for the offer\" Julie said this kindly. Runo's mom however said \"Oh you don't want any cookies dear?\" \"Julie kindly responded \"No thank you\". Runo's mom however replied \"Well I'm sorry to hear that dear\". \"Why \" Julie asked. \"Well in this house we make sure that every peice of food on the table is chewed and stuffed into our stomachs, even if it means that we have to force it down. I make sure that I make 2x as much food for guests so that they can eat and eat until its all stuffed down your throat, so sorry dear but we can't let you go home tonight until you finish every single last cookie here, have a good night's sleep and then eat a big breakfast in the morning\". Julie sat dumbfounded and shocked by what she had just heard. She couldn't eat anymore, let alone move. \"No way, please, I'm full\" she said. \"Well I suppose you can take a break, but its feeding time for you two later\" said Runo's mom as she left for them to finish the desert. \"Well you heard my mom\" Runo said. \"Get ready to eat\".</span></div></div>",

Just then Runo appeared. She was wearing an apron over her stretched, body hugging yellow pajamas. There were food stains on the shirt, especially on the chest area, which had grown as much as Runo's stomach.

I don't want anybody that visits this house thats my friend to miss breakfast. I want to see her fill her stomach with the food that I made\". Runo said this in a very sneaky tone, as though she was planning something(which she was). Alice then asked Runo \"Why do you and your mom want us to eat so badly\"? \"Because in this house when a skinny guest like you and Julie come over we make sure that you both get filled up and get as much nourishment as you can by stuffing your faces with loads and loads of food. We want to see it go down your throats with great gutso until your stomachs are filled to the max and all the plates are empty. That is our policy\". Alice responded to Runo's answer with a shocked face. She had never heard Runo talk like that before. Of coure, she had also never seen her like the way she is now, her rounded out cherubic face that made her cheeks look like they had swollen over both sides of her mouth. Her chubby arms and plump fingers along with her belly that stuck out over her waistband and jiggled slightly when she moved, and her thick sausage legs that always seem to stick together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Runo and Alice waited for Julie, Julie was in the bathroom examing herself. She looked down and saw her slightly chubby potbelly that bulged out a little bit over her skirt. She poked it gently and her finger seemed to have sunk in a bit. When she took her finger out the flab returned to its normal position and looked like she never even touched it. \"Oh no. It must've beem those cookies yesterday, now I have this potbelly\". The newly curved belly wasn't her only new feature. She then put both hands on her thighs and squeezed them, showing how much fat had accumulated on her and filling her out. She could tell that they were fatter because of how they spread when she clenched her fingers into them. I've got to get out of here before I get any fatter. She saw the bathroom window, but she wanted to take the direct aprroach and go past Runo and her mom through the front door. What does he do</span></div></div>",

I made it especially for you guys!\" Runo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm getting fat, and I don't want to be any bigger!\" Julie replied, \"If it's a problem, I'm sorry, but that's just how I feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuno was saddened, so much so that she looked like she might cry, that's when Runo's mom had had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it Julie! I don't care how you feel about your figure, no one comes in here and makes my precious child cry, friend or no friend! I challenge you to a Bakugan brawl, and if I win you have to stay and eat as long as we want you to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? You have a Bakugan?\" Julie cried in surprise...Runo looked shocked too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Mrs. Misaki said, before producing a Haos, pig like Bakugan. \"Meet Haos Porcina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, nice to meet you, puhi!\" The bakugan replied. Julie was intrigued and suprised...Runo's mom was probably an amateur that Gorem could squash in two minutes flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, let's brawl!\" Julie exclaimed.</span></div></div>",

A harsh light flowed from the two cards and bith Julie and Runos mom were transported to a void in Bakuspace. Runo's mom made the first move and set the gate-card, to Julie's surprise. She didn't think that she could move that fast. But Julie soon followed throwing her gate-card as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brawl began as Julie threw Gorem into the field. \"Alright Gorem, lets win this\" shouted Julie. Suddenly she was distracted by a sudden tightness located on her waist area. She looked down to see that her new chunky belly was tightening against her shorts. \"Ugh, I hate this thing. I wish this flab would just go away\" thought Julie as she tried to press her belly into herself, only to find that it wouldn't move an inch. Each time she pressed into it her hands just squished into it as it spread its jelly like flab across Julie's waistband. \"Hey its time to Brawl you unaprecciative little brat\" said Runo's mom. Julie simply removed her hands from her flab, watching for a brief moment as it just hung about 1/4 of an inch over her waistband and focused on the brawl. Runo's mom was holding Haos Porcina. \"Its my turn kid\" she said as she threw Porcina onto the field. The Bakugan looked like a pig with a smiley face and the body of a warrior with a curly tail. \"I bet shes not even good\" Julie said in a show of underestimating her opponent. Julie then looked up to Porcina's eyes that locked onto hers. Julie then heard her stomach growl. \"Woah, w-why do I feel a bit hungry\" she asked as she held her flabby stomach. \"That's right kid, look into Porcina's eyes, you'll have food stuffed down your throat in no time\" Runo's mom thought to herself as she observed Julie falling for Porcina's hypnotic suggestion. \"Julie, Julie\" a voice called to Julie who then looked up. It was Gorem calling out to her to wake up. \"Aren't we going to Brawl\". \"Yeah, don't worry\" said Julie. \"I activate my ability car-\" suddenly Julie was cut off by Runo's mom. \"I activate Porcina's ability. It can make an opponent's monster attack and prevent its owner from using ability cards to help it. Also, no gate cards. Julie couldn't believe it she had lost before the first turn was done. As she stood there shocked, Gorem was being hypnotically drawn into attacking. He had 550 gs while Porcina had 600gs and Porcina defeated him. \"No...I can't lose\" mumbled Julie as she stood completely dazed as Gorem transformed back into a ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like I win.\" The field dissapeared and Julie and Runo's mom returned to the room they were in before. Runo looked in surprise. \"Mom, what happened\" asked the chubby blue haired girl. \"Oh I just taught Julie a lesson in appreciation, right Julie\"? Julie merely lowered her head in defeat. Alice was sitting and eating when she turned to see Julie return, but seeing as her mind was fixed on the food she shrugged and once again picked up her fork and continued eating big bites. \"I can't believe I lost\" said Julie. \"Now come on Julie, let me show you what we have to eat\" said Runo' mom as she led Julie to the kitchen.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Porcina didn't seem to be any regular Bakugan, something about her was strange...Especially her stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the gray haired girl was thinking about her defeat, she saw Runo's mom come in with ten plates, one piled high with thick, greasy bacon, another with warm pancakes, slathered with fresh butter and syrup, accompanied by gargantuan plates of eggs, sausages, french toast, rolls, some grapes, bananas, grits, and apple slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that's left after Runo and Alice ate?!\" Julie questioned incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I told Runo that you wanted some extra food by way of saying thanks, so right now she's making more...Alice fell asleep after we explained, such kindness on her part letting you have this wonderful meal. Now eat up Julie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Julie was going to futily resist eating the staggering amount of victuals, but when she saw it all in front of her, something in her mind clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, she was tearing into the food more and more, forgoing the utensils and stuffing food in her mouth, chewing fast and sparingly, uttering an occasional, involuntary grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuno's mom would've admonished her for lack of manners, but she was taken by the girl's enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad to see you enjoying your meal Julie, just keep eating until your full.\" Mrs. Misaki said, smiling at both her and Porcina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours later, Julie was in severe pain, lying on her back and moaning while rubbing her engorged tummy, while Runo and Alice watched in concern.

Runo was an all-over growth, without a particularly oversized area. Again, she weighed 170 lbs. Julie was only 165 lbs., the lightest of the group, but still quite fat. Her chest was just a bit bigger, making the buttons on her purple shirt pop. The belt on her shorts had long been discarded, while its button had popped, too. Chan Lee grew to 180 lbs. and it showed a bit more on her rear. The lower part of her red dress could still cover it; this was a good thing, since she no longer wore her pants. The upper part was strained and had torn in the middle, letting her belly flow. Alice, surprisingly, was the biggest, growing to 200 lbs. Her outfit was totally different from before, now a pink t-shirt and a pink skirt reaching just above her knees. Her hair was tied in a ponytail. Her belly was the biggest part, too big to contain in her old shirt or in a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were then wondering what to do next after comparing each other's sizes.</span></div></div>",
