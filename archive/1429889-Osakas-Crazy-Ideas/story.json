She tried to recall the details of the dream but only comes up with \"Something I ate last night gave me powers of some sort\", which is very far from what had actually happened, at least as far as the \"something I ate\" part goes. Not that Osaka can actually remember what she did last night, mainly because she's Osaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, Osaka gets herself ready for class while wondering what kind of powers she had received. It's just as she finishes getting dressed that something crosses her mind. \"Ah...that's no good. I forgot to get groceries...I guess that means no breakfast today.\" she says to herself. Then, her usual problem solving skills kick in. \"Ah...it's a sunny day...maybe if I was a berry girl or something...\" says Osaka as she starts to see herself as a blueberry girl. She doesn't even notice that she's starting to turn blue as she heads out with the thought still in her head. It's only when she starts to feel pressure build up that she notices something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...I think it might start out feeling something like that.\" Osaka says, not realizing that her waistline is actually swelling out until a few moments later. \"Wait...what?\" Looking down at the source of the pressure. \"Ah...could turning into a berry girl in the sunlight be my power?\" she says as she continues to bloat up until she's as wide as she is tall. \"I wonder why a blueberry, though...that was the last thing I was thinking about...\" she says, as her true power dawns on her. \"Ah! I can change myself just by thinking about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsaka presses against herself and notes that she genuinely feels like a berry. \"Ah...it's not an illusion either. I've really become a blueberry girl...looks like I'll be having breakfast after all.\" she says as she soaks up the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Osaka is walking along after returning herself to normal. \"Now I wonder...does this work on other people as well? Hehe...let's see if it'll work on my friends.\"</span></div></div>",

She figures that Chiyo of all people would be the most willing to go along with being altered by Osaka's powers. It's not too much trouble to get Chiyo alone with her since they walk to school together every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, good morning, Osaka. You seem to be in a good mood today. Is something happening today?\" asks Chiyo when the meet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsaka nods. \"You could say that, Chiyo-chan. But would you rather I tell you, or show you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it would probably be quicker if you showed me, so go ahead.\" replies Chiyo. Expecting Osaka to actually give her something, she's pretty shocked to see her friend turn blue and bloat up before her very eyes. \"W...was that supposed to happen?\" Chiyo finally manages to say, still fairly bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I woke up with the power to do stuff like this to myself just by thinking about it. I guess I just like making myself into a blueberry. I think I could do anything I wanted to do to myself, though.\" Osaka explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting over her bewilderment, Chiyo walks up to Osaka and presses a hand against her. \"How strange...it's practically a complete transformation. You certainly feel like a blueberry, anyway.\" She says. Just then, she sees her arm turn blue before her eyes. \"Uhm...Osaka...\" Chiyo says. Osaka looks over at her and immediately stops thinking of Chiyo as a blueberry girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, are you ok, Chiyo-chan?\" asks Osaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiyo nods. \"Ah, yeah, I'm fine.\" she says.</span></div></div>",

But what she doesn't mention is that she's actually thinking of Chiyo as a blueberry that's five times bigger than she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloating up for the first time, Chiyo starts to rub her surface \"Mmmmm, being squishy like this feels wonderful...\" she comments as her hands are pressed a few inches into her bloating midsection. Osaka nods in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready wider than she is tall once she gets to the same size as Osaka, Chiyo is a little surprised to find herself continuing to grow. \"Ah, Osaka-san, I'm still bloating up.\" Chiyo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you are, Chiyo-chan. Since you're so small I think you should be a bigger berry than everyone.\" Osaka explains. \"Surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiyo smiles. \"Alright, but would you mind at least being as big as me?\" Chiyo asks. \"I could really use the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything, Osaka starts to bloat up until her size has matched up with Chiyo's. \"We are best friends, so ok, let's be big blueberries together!\" exclaims Osaka, which makes Chiyo giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how big are we talking about?\" asks Chiyo, not really caring how big they get at the moment.</span></div></div>",

Being as fat as I am now helps, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsaka giggles, and nods. \"Oh yes, we could just get bigger and bigger and bigger...\" Osaka says, which causes them to fill for a few moments before Osaka catches herself. \"But yeah...how about a huge cake?\" As Osaka says this, there's suddenly a huge cake the same size as Yomi right next to her. \"And your body will make every bite of it into fat once it's inside you, so you'll grow bigger while you eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...it looks delicious...and it's all for me?\" Yomi asks, as she looks it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsaka smiles. \"Mmmhum, and don't even worry about getting too full, because I made it so we can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis announcement causes Yomi to blink a bit, still looking over the cake. \"Ah...but I already feel full as is...though not so full I can't eat.\" she says, preparing to eat the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it wouldn't be any fun if we didn't feel like we were becoming more full...but you'll only feel comfortably full.\" Osaka explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi smiles a little. \"Wow...that sounds, well, really nice. Alright, I think I'll get started, then.\" Yomi says, as she starts eating the cake. Indeed, she does feel herself getting more full with each bite. Yomi is being careful not to fall into the cake, which is causing her to grow larger at a slow but steady rate, which is starting to grate on Tomo's patience. Besides, Tomo wants to do more than just watch...</span></div></div>",

Tomo's body quickly receded back to it's original shape strangely enough her cloths returned as well without being stretched or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo clenched her fists in joy looking ready to shout, but decided better, turned to face Osaka put a finger to her mouth then ran off behind Yomi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi who by now had increased her size slightly notice she wasn't rubbing against Tomo anymore and that she had become strangely quiet. Yomi stopped and looked to the gap where Tomo had once been only seeing Osaka on the other side <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did Tomo go?\" Asked Yomi. Osaka not sure what to say turned her head to look in the direction Tomo ran in. Soon though it wouldn't matter because Tomo could be heard dashing back towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TOOOREEE-YAAAA!\" Tomo shouted  followed by a loud *SMACK* as she ran head first into Yomi's backside, bounced off and landed on the ground, barely moving Yomi forward even an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it you could hurt someone!\" shouted Yomi although it seemed unlikely with their enormous padding. Not one to give up Tomo quickly stood up and started pushing up on Yomi's large body rolling her forward slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Tomo STO-\" Yomi shouted as she went head first into the delicious cake her faced pressed down into it and Yomi took this chance to inhale as much cake as she could but had to stop soon as her face became the lowest thing on her body, but it was only for a short time as soon she could see an upside down Tomo looking slightly worried and standing away as Yomi's moved back upright and then back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TO---MO---YOU-----BA-----KA!\" Yomi yelled as she rolled out of control covered in icing and cake until she ran into a wall and bounced back slightly leaving a noticeable dent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo and Osaka, both concerned, rushed over to the dazed Yomi. Osaka forgetting she was still a ball quickly returned to normal without noticing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you ok?\" asked Osaka slightly frantic Yomi's head still spinning replied \"I'll~ Smash ~ ya ~ flat.\"  Seeing Yomi fine relieved the two and allowed Tomo to return to taunting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze Yomi I knew ya wanted that cake but ya sure made a huge mess, there's so much icing and cake on you You're practically a cake yourself!\" with that Tomo took some icing off with her finger and licked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmm Those are both good ideals but which is better?\" Osaka asked none in particular looking far off and nowhere at the same time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They also notice that the area around their midsections are starting to bloat out and down. \"Oh...oh god...this isn't happening...\" Yomi says, as she looks around to find a possible source of this phenomena, her fluid-filled midsection sloshing with each movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Tomo, she's poking herself a bit. \"Oooh...I look like I'm turning into a water balloon!\" she exclaims, and indeed, as they continue to fill up, their bodies start to press down towards their feet. They can also feel their legs start to expand along with the lower part of their bodies. Once that part of their body is rounded out down to their feet, the fluid they're filling up with starts to spread upwards. By this point, they find they are unable to move due to the water weighting them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wah, how can you be so cheerful about this, Tomo? I mean, why is this even happening?\" asks Yomi, who physically isn't as far as long as Tomo due to being the taller of the two. The two are starting to look less like people and more like large water beds with a human head attached to the middle, as the water forces their bodies to appear shorter to the ground, practically cutting their height in half. This, however, means that they're at least around 8 feet wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo has a wide grin on her face. \"Awesome! I've become my own bed! And I'm a water bed, to boot!\" she says. \"A lot better than just a water balloon, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it doesn't worry you how it happened all of a sudden!?\" snaps Yomi, not quite seeing the appeal yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Osaka walks up to them. \"Hi, it was me.\" says Osaka, as if this was completely normal. \"Now what to do next...\"</span></div></div>",

How did you do that?!\" Tomo cried. \"I don't know...\" Yomi uttered as she pulled her finger away allowing Tomo's body to return to normal.

Tomo stood in shock as she saw her body squish together in Yomi's hands as though she was nothing more than modeling clay. Her seemingly boneless mid-torso was easily compressed to a two-inch diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Yomi gasped as she let go of Tomo's torso, \"We've become living putty!\" \"B-b-but h-how?\" Tomo stuttered.

Tomo and Yomi watch on as Osaka's form becomes less humanoid and more dome-like. The upper parts of her body stretch and spread out as they touch the dome-like portion of her body, losing definition as they do and eventually forming into a even, solid mass. Eventually, there is no way to even tell that Osaka was ever a human, as she is simply a large mass of spreading putty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi finds herself without words, while Tomo curiously pokes the mass of putty, hardly able to believe that it was still Osaka. As if to confirm, Osaka wobbles a little, and then giggles. After a few more moments, Osaka reforms herself, starting with the top of her head and going down. \"Hehe, now all three of us are putty girls!\" exclaims Osaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo grins, as her mind finally adjusts to her new form. \"Ooh, we could have a LOT of fun like this!\" she exclaims, as she wonders what to do first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yomi just sweatdrops, not really wanting to have any part of this. At the same time, though, she doesn't really want to be left out. So after a few tries, both she and her form start to relax. It's at this point that Yomi notices that there is something oddly relaxing about melting into a puddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how...but this is pretty comfortable...\" she says, relaxed to the point where it doesn't take too long for her to join the puddle that Osaka and Tomo have formed, just a few moments after Osaka's form has completely relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there's more fun that could be had with this...</span></div></div>",

Sakaki, however, is too occupied with seeing the results of being ran over by a steamroller, and by now, the sound of Sakaki slowly being pressed flat can be hear as the steamroller starts flattening her cartoonishly large feet. \"Ah, it's working...and wow, since when were my feet that big...\" she says, looking herself over and realizing she has the proportions of a cartoon character. \"Ah, nice...\" she says non-sarcastically, thinking her current form is more cute than the way she normally is. \"I wonder why, though...\" she asks, as Osaka steps forward to claim responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, is being flattened working out for you, Sakaki-san?\" Osaka asks as if things like this are normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakaki blinks, and notices the steamroller's gotten to her waist by now. \"Ah, it seems so...do you have any idea what is going on, anyway?\" she asks, to which Osaka nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made everything like a cartoon.

Sure enough, this causes Sakaki to begin swelling back up to her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she realizes she can do anything with minimal harm, Sakaki really feels like experimenting now. \"Ah, I'm not sure where to start, but I want to do something else now...\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, the moment she comes across a small group of them, they all seem to tense up in fear of her. Being Sakaki, she tries to slowly approach them, only to have them run off soon after. \"Ah! Don't run!\" she exclaims, though the sound of a human coming from a much larger cat doesn't help matters at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...no good...\" Sakaki says, as she lays down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She might be a big cat, but she's still Sakaki on the inside.' Osaka thinks as Sakaki sulks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sakaki's ears perk up, as she can hear someone approaching.

She imagines Sakaki with puffed feet, puffed hands, a round body...but she seems more amused when she imagines Sakaki's head being no bigger than it usually is. Of course, now that Osaka has a mental picture of it, it's only a matter of moments before Sakaki's body will begin to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sakaki is completely unaware of what is about to happen to her. Her first sign that something isn't quite right is the sudden sensation of pressure in her hands, feet, and mid-section. \"Ah...this feels odd...\" Sakaki says, as she first looks down to see her feet and mid-section are swelling up, and looks to her hands to find the same thing is happening to them. She looks rather surprised, but that's about all. \"Oh, what...what's happening to me?\" she says, as she continues to swell up. She can feel the pressure in her midsection spreading out to her torso and waist, and then her arms and legs. Sakaki blushes, as this is causing her to stand out a lot more than she normally does. Though she does notice that this doesn't seem to be hurting her at all or causing discomfort, especially once her feet burst out of her shoes and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Sakaki's body was finished swelling, it had a rather cartoon-ish appearance. Her body was swollen as wide as she was tall, and her puffed feet added quite a bit to her height. Her feet look as if they're a pair of small beds attached to her body by her ankles, and her hands look like the kind of gloved hand a cartoon character would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Osaka shows herself. \"What do you think, Sakaki? I thought this look would make you look really cute.\" says Osaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little surprised that Osaka somehow caused this to happen, Sakaki blinks for a bit, then blushes. \"Oh...you...really think so? I mean...I thought so too, but to hear someone else say it...\" she manages to say, blushing a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsaka gives a quick nod. \"Mmmhum, wouldn't have done it to you if I didn't think it would help.\" she says. \"I'm glad you like it, Sakaki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakaki blushes again, realizing that while she never outright said she liked it, it does seem rather enjoyable. \"Oh, yes...it's really different...but it does feel really nice...\" she says, wiggling her puffy toes just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsaka smiles. \"So, do you want to be bigger, then?\"</span></div></div>",
