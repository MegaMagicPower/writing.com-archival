Each creek and groan in the weathered wood flooring brought back fond memories of long weekends and endless vacations that he shared with her. Homemade cookies, walks to nearby shore, brownies every evening after dinner, the swing set in the backyard, the box of chocolates she would always keep on the coffee table.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many fond memories were made here, he smiled knowing that his stay was for an entire year, plenty of time to reminisce and make some new memories. He smiled knowing that he hadn't outgrow the childhood comfort of vacation at Grandma's house<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiped his shoes on the new welcome mat and renewed his smile, he could already smell something tasty on the inside of the door...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's nervous to not be big enough for his family and excited because he'll know his hard work to get fatter has paid off big time.

With eyes closed again he is awaken after ten minutes by grandma knocking on the doors and opening them. \"Good morning Doug! I'm bringing homemade breakfast for you. Because it is the first morning in here, I take it for you to bed, to cheer you up in your first holiday day.\u201c Grandma is smiling at Doug and carries in her hands heavy tray loaded with enough food for three people. There are french toasts, large stack of greasy pancakes drenched with syrup, big bowl of fried eggs with strips of crispy bacon, large plate of rolls with butter, glass of orange juice and pitcher of whole milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug sits down upright, grandma is putting the tray on his lap and then Doug say with some hesitation. \"Grandma, this looks like breakfast for king, haha! ... Um mm, I usually don't eat much at morning.\u201c<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, here in the countryside on fresh air you will find better appetite soon and then you will be eating heartily all your meals. I'll take care of it, you can bet. You are so skinny beside of others family members, maybe because you are not used to eat properly from the beginning of the day. So eat up my boy and don't be ashamed to eat a lot here with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug starts eating with gusto, he is quite hungry after he looks at tray and smells wonderful aroma coming from all warm caloric meals. Maybe grandma is right about change of air and therefore better taste for food. During the meal Doug talks with grandma. She asks him about his eating habits, what he wants to eat for breakfasts, which sort of meals he likes for lunches and dinners, then she is interested in his favorite snacks and finally about wide variety of sweet foods Doug love to nibble on. She even writes some notes and nods with smile \"Yeah, I remember some of the foods and goodies from your past visits in here, you always had tastes for sugary foods and desserts and I really appreciate to have someone in house who will eat my baking from now. I will cook for you and with time I will help you to improve your appetite, you will see soon.\u201c and pat him after his head.<br>\r\nDoug finally slows his eating effort, he is really full. On the tray is still more then one third left of the whole breakfast feast. \" I'm sorry grandma, I'm totally stuffed, really. It was all tasty, but I can't eat another morsel of your fantastic food. You cooked too much for me.\u201c<br>\r\nGrandma smiles and says it is nothing, but in her eyes Doug see sort of condemnation.<br>\r\n \"Now sleep and digest your big meal. You can get up when you want, you are on holiday. And don't bother too much with clothing  around home, just casually. Shirt and sweatpants are OK.\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets up from the bedside with tray in hands and goes away from room and close doors behind her. Stuffed Doug lies down with head on soft pillow and glimpse on the alarm clock. It is just half past seven. Grandma brought me the food here quite early, I must have eaten for at least three quarters of hour, he is musing. He soon fall asleep with hands resting on his distended and full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug will wake up at almost ten o'clock and goes to bathroom for a shower. He still feels little full from morning meal and when he is soaping his bloated middle under warm water, he likes the feeling of full and round belly under touches of his fingers. After he slowly dries his body, he went to dress his underwear and then go for his bags to unpack all clothes to the wardrobe. He take his most casual shirt on him, then he founds on top of the other bag a pair of his old sweatpants and put them on also. Under them are few pairs of new sweatpants, which he haven't seen at home before. It is strange, he thinks, maybe my mother bought them for me to wear them for holiday in here. When he raises one pair at his hands up, he see they are quite large sweats, many sizes bigger then his current waist size, with elastic around the waist and strings. I can't wear such big clothes, it must be some mistake done during shopping, he sighs. Then he put all clothes to wardrobe without closer inspection of the items and close the door of cabinet. With expectation of new day he headed for the kitchen to see grandma.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she see him in the door, she says cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"Doug, looks like you are well rested, aren't you?\u201c she smiles at Doug. \u201eSit down here. I have prepared mid-morning snack for you, lunch will not be ready for almost two hours.\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places in front of him bowl with assortment of fruits. Doug eats it quickly and then grandma brings large plate with four slices of bread, thickly smeared with lard and with small pieces of vegetables in front of him and urge him to eat. Doug don't want to disappoint grandma like he did at morning, so he slowly eats all slices, even when he gets over the point of having comfortably full stomach. Grandma brings him big teapot of sweet tea to drink after his meal and then she tell him go to lie and rest on the comfortable sofa in the corner of kitchen, before the lunch is ready. Doug is now again tired from digesting all greasy food and is soon half asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is almost noon. Doug is awaken by the grandma standing behind the table and preparing plates and cutlery. Lunch will be in a moment, she tells him. Doug goes to bathroom and is surprised that he is hungry again. This must be some herbs in the tea to ease digestion, he thinks. He returns to kitchen where on the table is awaiting him serving of soup. He eats it quickly. Grandma is ladle out him another full plate of thick soup with saying approvingly. \"The soup tastes you, I see.\"<br>\r\n\"This is really good soup grandma. You are best cook.\"<br>\r\n\"You are good flatterer, my darling. Keep some space for main course, we have meatballs with pasta and sauce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma brings on table heaping bowls of enticing meatballs, pasta and creamy sauce. She loads to Doug big plate of the dish. Doug starts eating without restraints and first plate of rich food disappears in him in short time.<br>\r\n  \"Can you add more, right?\"  asked grandma and without waiting for answer she loads him his plate with same amount of food. Doug eats this helping slower, so with last morsels he tells grandma that it is enough for him.<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you sure manage yet a little\" grandma answers and loads him third plate, just a little less full then before.<br>\r\nDoug eats this plate really slowly, but he can polish it off, although fork with last morsels he puts into mouth with visible labor. After this large meal he sits for few moments with swollen belly, he can't move without pains in stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma says with satisfied voice. \"You showed me how you like my cooking Doug. If you keep improving your appetite and will be good eater for longer time, you can be like your cousins and your daddy.\" Grandma brings to table glass of root beer for Doug to wash down massive lunch. After short rest Doug gets up and slowly goes to rest on sofa. He is half asleep, so he just half perceives like grandma is finishing baked dessert before he falls asleep with stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stands up and feels that a heaviness of his stomach is still noticeable. Doug puts both hands on the sides of small bulge of his belly and looks down on it. \"Great,\" he thinks, \"All I do on my vacation is sleeping or stuffing myself with food and so over and over. I need to find some other activity for me.\" Then he looks at table. There is a pan of lemon pie awaiting him. After a moment all his thoughts about wasting his time are gone. \"I didn't have any sweets today, so the pie looks very tempting.\", he thinks. He has an appetite for a dessert like if hasn't eaten heavy lunch before. He sits at the table, cut the pie into large pieces, put one on a plate and dug in the sweet dessert. It is delicious! After Doug eats four pieces of pie he notices small sheet of paper behind the pan with \"For Doug\u201c written on top with grandma handwriting. He reads it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to stop by at neighbors and then I'm going to supermarket to purchase stocks in the afternoon. Please eat a lemon pie, it is all for you. You have drinks in the fridge. Gran.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug doesn't need more urging to continue eating and cuts off other large piece of pie and puts it on his plate. Before he starts he goes to fridge and brings a two liter bottle of cola and a glass to the table. He is enjoying the pie a lot but after a while he starts to slow his eating and drinks more of soda. When remains two pieces of pie on the pan, Doug is again engorged of dessert and decide not to finish the cake. He just sits there and rests with slightly swollen and full belly from sweets and carbonated drink. Doug feels stuffed, but wonderfully at the same time and has satisfied smile of culinary experience on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while he hears a honk of car from the outside of house. He stands up and through window he sees a grandma car stops in a driveway. He goes out and see her exiting her car. \"Doug, you just go here. Could you help me unload the groceries, please?\u201c she requests him. When grandma open a trunk lid, he sees it is full of large boxes and bags of food. \"It seems grandma like to cooks vast quantities of food and also shops her groceries in bulk.\", he thinks amused. Grandma says \"First help me bring frozen items to freezer in the back of house.\u201c Doug put several heavy boxes into armful and follow grandma who carries few lighter bags. Then Doug helps to bring other bags to pantry and kitchen. Doug observe, that grandma bought mainly caloric and fattening foods and stocks for her cooking.<br>\r\nWhen grandma sees Doug lets the rest of the cake on pan, she urges him. \"Sit down and finish this little remnants as your afternoon snack Doug, after that I have something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug sighs, but obey and very slowly eats two pieces of cake. He doesn't want to tell grandma, that he has eaten just few moments before her return and he is still full. When he finishes last chunk of cake, grandma have in her hands spoon and regular size, 1 lb fresh-packed ice cream from Baskin-Robbins. \"I brought you one of your favorite, Mint chocolate chip ice cream. When you have eaten your big lunch, you reward it.\u201c<br>\r\nDoug is happy, he likes ice cream a lot and says with enthusiasm. \"Thanks grandma, you are thinking about all my tastes and favorite goodies.\" <br>\r\nGrandma smile at him and stroke his head with warm, motherly gesture. \"Doug, you are my sweet boy, go to rest on sofa in corner and savour your ice cream. I will start preparation of a dinner, only I have to put myself into home clothes.\u201c And she leaves into her room. Doug lies down on the couch and lazily starts to lick ice cream from spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes grandma returns to kitchen and they start to chat. While Doug slowly graze on ice cream, grandma starts the dinner preparation. She informs Doug. \"I went to few close neighbors which I chat with and pay them visit often. I had to show them off that I have visitor at house for longer time and must look after you now. So I can't drop in they for few weeks.\u201c She looks at him with smile and says. \"I need to work on improving your appetite, Doug. It is long term task. And for me an important one!\u201c<br>\r\nDoug slightly blush when he hear it and answer. \"You are the best grandma. I really enjoy everything in here.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two and half hours of peaceful afternoon is here an evening and grandma has her dinner finished. She call Doug to a table. \u201eI fried steaks and also made a potato salad with mayonnaise. You told me you like it that way. Before that I have an appetizer for you.\u201c She put in front of Doug plate with onion rings. \"Eat up, Doug.\" she urges him. Doug is sort of hungry again and after onion rings he put away two servings of big steaks with mounds of potato salad and is stuffed again in that day. Grandma is satisfied how much he has eaten today and pat him on his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner grandma sends Doug to living room to rest in a comfy chair and watch documentary channel on TV. After she wash up, she brings him a plate full of sweets and watch with him. Doug nibble on rich sweets like chocolates, Oreos and other creamy confectionery and washes down it with soda. Before they go to sleep he eats two plates of sweets. They both go to bathroom and then to their respective bedrooms at 10:30 PM. This is the end of first day for Doug on his vacation. He fall asleep a moment after he lies on bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He slowly stretches under blanket and recalls in his thoughts what happened yesterday. \"Hm, it was lot of delicious foods and sweets I tasted, I can't believe how much I ate. Hmm, I wonder what is for breakfast today.\" he thinks. When Doug wash his body under shower a moment later, his belly is flat again, or maybe almost flat. After Doug returns from bathroom, he quickly dress into similar things like yesterday and heads down to the kitchen. From behind the doors he feels wonderful smells and moment later he is greeted by grandma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Doug, have you slept well? Your breakfast is warm and ready, sit down.\" When he sits down to the table, he is looking forward to breakfast so much, his stomach growl from anticipation of a feast. Grandma is smiling, \"You must be really hungry, my boy. It looks like countryside air is already thriving to your appetite. I hope you will eat all I prepared for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug just nod, and starts eating quickly. Grandma cooked for him slightly different dishes and visibly less then yesterday. Beside tall stack of pancakes he has big plate of toast with butter and jam and links of sausages, to drink orange juice and whole milk. He eats last two pancakes with visible effort, but he manages to finish all food. After meal he is totally stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma happily sees Doug was able to finish all prepared food. She is proud of him and says \"That's how I want you to be, polish off all your servings I put in front of you. You behave like my true grandson!\" After that she goes to pantry a brings back paper box. \"For later snack I have few doughnuts, freshly delivered from a bakery. I stopped there yesterday and made same order to have freshly made pastries delivered to home at morning. At beginning I ordered it for three times per week, I'll see if it will be enough for you. Do you want few now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug looks unhappy to grandma and answers. \"Not now, thanks for this care with pastry gran, I ate too much for breakfast. I will taste it for snack. \" He goes to lie on sofa and talks with grandma about her youth and the he asks about father childhood, while grandma is doing housework. Two hours later Doug eats 8 doughnuts for mid-morning snack, half with cream and half with jelly. After that grandma ask him if he would like fruits. He nods and she bring him bowl of strawberries with a thick layer of whipped cream and spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rich snack Doug sleeps on sofa up to lunch. For lunch Doug eats two plates of thick soup as yesterday and as main course grandma prepared another of his favorites, buffalo wings with french fries. He is able to demolish 3 full serving of food and is absolutely engorged. As we suppose, then he is sleeping for long time. For sunny afternoon Doug goes outside of the house to read on book on bench in to the shadow in the garden. Grandma brings him repeatedly cookies and pieces of chocolate and he washes it down with iced tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvening and dinner are similar as in previous day and at night Doug goes to sleep into his bed after day fulfilled mainly with overeating on caloric nourishment, to the great satisfaction of his grandma.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight following days go by the same spirit and Doug can easily become habituated to the slow country life on his long vacation.

After last night, when grandma baked two different pies and pushed him to eat most of them, his belly is still swollen from big gorging continued late to the night. He need to wear bigger of his shirts and his older sweats are starting to be uncomfortably tight for him at the waistline. \"Maybe I will need to switch to those new sweats mom bought for me soon.\" he thinks. But for today Doug lets himself wearing the old ones and goes down. With his mind occupied with wanting for breakfast all thoughts about his newly round belly vanish immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor breakfast he has caloric feast, as usual. Grandma tries to rotate and change her cooking that Doug always anticipate, which goodies she will put in front of him on the table. Today she cooked for him waffles with cream and jam, bagels, French toasts, homemade biscuits served with gravy and fried eggs with bacon, to drink she prepared tea and chocolate milk. Doug is now able to eat all food what is served for him at breakfasts, partly because his stomach is stretched from daily stuffing and mainly because he doesn't want to see any smirk of disappointment on grandmother's face when he let remains of food on plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnack and elaborate lunch are like usual for Doug, he is satisfyingly engorged after lunch and when he rise from the table, he just lazily moves to sleep on sofa. After an hour Grandma informs him that dessert will be after a while and she goes next to the living room. She doesn't close the door behind her, in the door remains small cranny. Grandma sits in armchair and rests in a hot July day, when suddenly rings a phone on table next to her. She reach for telephone, it is a call from Doug's mother Anette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug is little sleepy, but when he hears phone, he is little attentive and start to listen even more, when he hears mentioned the name of his mother and then his own. He starts to listen snatches of Grandma's conversation from his place in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Anette, nice to hear you! You both already returned from holiday in Mexico?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you and Doug senior enjoyed holiday and safely returned afterward, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doug is sleeping now, after he has eaten very good lunch. And very big also, ha ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little Doug is fine, he is so nice grandson, I'm glad you send him to me for longer period. It was brilliant idea from you and Doug senior to fill his spare time this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doug stays with me at home all the time. He mainly eats and sleeps. He's so obedient boy. I love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he has close to zero physical activities, really nothing. I oversee him to be the most passive and sedentary, believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he eats really well, as we both planned. It works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can bet I'm showing him my best cooking skills and I really enjoy how much little Doug eats. Only\" sigh,  \"... Sometimes I'm afraid if I don't push too much on the poor boy with all my caloric cuisine, ha ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, all this must slower his young metabolism, finally he could become hefty like other men in family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is hard to say, he was so skinny when he arrived in here. You should start to feed him properly years earlier, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know and you don't need to explain it for me again. You simply don't know how to properly cook and feed your family, That's the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if he gained already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy Anette! I simply can't ask him directly to weigh himself and tell me how much he weighs! You really amused me, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", sigh,  \"if you insist, I can try it, but what if he will get mad at poor old me then. Everything could go wrong way with that, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell my greetings and hold for me Doug senior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll tell you the greetings to Doug. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Anette, bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Grandma ends her phone call, and stays siting in the living room. She for whole time of the phone conversation wasn't aware Doug could maybe could hear her through door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug is suddenly absolutely horrified from what he just listen.

His mind is running flow of all sorts of thoughts about his vacation, what solutions are from the situation he got into and how to find the best way out, but he does not know what to do. Grandma returns to the kitchen, she finishes baking of a dessert for Doug. She call him to the table to eat it, he obeys as usual and he eats full plate of brownies with ice cream quite rapidly. Then Doug rises from the table and goes outside to lie in a garden chair, it is beautiful afternoon, he wants to be alone for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour Grandma comes outside from the house to Doug and brings him another fully loaded plate of brownies and glass of iced tea. She tells him with smile.<br>\r\n\"Doug, you almost didn't touch the dessert after your nap, here's another serving for you. When you rested after lunch, your Mother called, but I didn't want to awake you to talk to her. She and dad returned safely from their holiday and mom greets you and sends you her kisses.\"<br>\r\n\"That's okay you didn't wake me, I really slept after lunch, I was seriously full from the lunch. I can call home later.\" Doug answers false about his sleep and he starts to eat brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the afternoon and during dinner Doug speaks with Grandma as usual and eats apparently smaller portions of food, he does not show much enthusiasm for delicacies when he is eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the night he excuses himself earlier then in other evenings. He says he is little tired and goes to sleep. He even have not eaten much of sweets before during the evening. Grandma does not pushed food to him, she thinks that he is maybe sick from staying too long on direct sun in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug is lying in the dark in his bed with open eyes for a slowly passing time and he still can not sleep. He is thinking about his difficult situation he got maneuvered into by intrigue of his Mom and Grandma. How they could do it to him?, he thinks with bitterness. Do they want him to get fat? And now major question is WHY they prepared such a manipulation for him? He thinks his father, uncle and cousins are all fat if not even obese, and they don't feel bad about it or have problems with self confidence. But Mom and Grandma even want to feed him to become the same? Isn't it crazy? He was torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all questions unanswered in his head he finally drifts to the sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis last thought is ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He starts thinking about what happened yesterday again. He recalls in his last thought before falling asleep, that he would eventually get fat anyway. He has it in his family genes and his youth activities in athletics like the swimming could just delay it for few years. Maybe. He decides to imitate what it would feel like if he would have got big round belly on himself. He puts large and soft pillow under blanket over his belly and puts his hands on top of blanket and pushes it to form from the pillow large shape like of like round belly. It really excites him, when he fools with it! He is breathing heavily. It is strange, but Doug likes it. Then he sits on the bedside. Doug feels really hungry, he hasn't eaten enough in the evening. So he feels urge to go to eat now and stuff his belly in real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug carefully and quietly goes down and in the kitchen he opens a fridge. Doug founds there some foods good for late snack, so he takes half full pitcher of chocolate milk, toast bread and large container of peanut butter. He fix himself ten big toasts and drinks all milk with it. After that he remembers down in the fridge is paper box of sweets which he left almost untouched in the evening. So he put them on the table and starts to eat them and drinks soda with it. After almost one hour of his late binge he eats all sweets and sits without moving. Doug after a while puts his hands on the orb of his overstuffed belly, massage it slowly and feels really excited. With smile he says to himself, \"This night bingeing is really fun.\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug then rises slowly from the chair, his stomach is heavy with load of food and he quietly returns to his room. His thought before he satisfied drift to the sleep is he must do this night bingeing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt morning ....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he has to get fat on his vacation, so be it, he is not no way to prevent it and see how the situation develops after some months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is getting late at 7:30 AM. He must hurry not to miss his breakfast. When Doug goes to shower, he caress arch of his belly under warm water, it is little bigger after my midnight snack, he thinks contentedly. There is also surprisingly layer of fat around his middle which was not there before. Doug is again little excited from the first signs of his weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he dries himself, he remembers to try one a pair of his new sweats today. \"I wonder, if they will be too big or fit me with my swollen belly.\" He thinks. When Doug goes into the sweats, they are still little bigger in waist, but very comfy. With tying strings on the sweats he looks well in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Doug heads down from his room to the kitchen for breakfast. Surprisingly, his belly groans in hunger, although he was snacking in the middle of night. He even feels hungrier, then in previous days. Maybe it is from my all night thinking about getting fat, he smiles with the prospect of his upcoming meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gets to the kitchen, Grandma is there and the morning food is in pots and containers on the stove, not served on his place on the table like usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Doug, have you slept well?\" Grandma says like usual and looks at him with smile. When she recognize he wears bigger sweats, she almost beams and continues with flatter. \"Those new sweats looks so good on you. You look more mature in them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mature and also fatter\", thinks Doug for himself, but says nothing and just smile to Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Grandma says. \"Your breakfast is warm and will be ready in a moment. I just need one thing from you before you start eating. Errm ...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma is suddenly uneasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to weigh you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doug please, I have to do it at the request of your mother from her yesterday call, don't be mad at me. And the best will be you do it now, on an empty stomach. \" Grandma says with concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Grandma, there is nothing odd on such request and when Mom insist on it, I will weigh myself.\" Doug answers without hesitation in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is a scale?\" says Doug, and thinks for himself amusedly. \"It's exactly like you planned, now you want to see, how many pounds I already gained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me to a bathroom downstairs.\" says Grandma and Doug follows her through the corridor. She opens a small cabinet at ground and put out a old fashioned looking personal scale on the floor tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can step on it, Doug.\" Says Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see.\" Says Doug with the sign of thrill in his voice and steps on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen needle on the top of the scale stops moving, both Doug and Grandma looks as it says ....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only for me it is process in the opposite direction, from skinny to fat, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Doug steps down from the scale on the tiles and says. \"I gained almost ten pounds. ... It's not ... bad.\" Doug exaggerates his weight gain about two pounds, he said it to test Grandma's reaction from big number. He knows, that part of his added weight is food from his late night binge which is still inside his body. He wants to show in front of Grandma, that he is gaining weight quickly and waits to her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy for you Doug.\", she finally says and pat his little softer midsection. Then she quickly adds. \"And now let's go to breakfast until it cools. You must be hungry, my boy. It's later than you usually eat your breakfast. We can call news to Mom later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns to the kitchen to put heated pots and all prepared morning caloric feast on the table for her grandson. Doug follows her and sits behind the table, anticipating his morning meal. Doug starts eating slowly and during his meal casually talks with Grandma. He wants to know, when she will want him to call his mother his new weight, but finally decides not to ask Grandma directly and wait. Then he focuses on his food, he wants to impress Grandma with eating as much as possible, to stuff his stomach beyond point of pleasantly full. \"If Grandma with Mom wants me bigger, I will try my best!\", he excitedly thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Doug behaves as really good eater and demolish all food prepared for him, pancakes, fried eggs with bacon, muffins, french toasts, links of sausages. He drinks lot of chocolate milk and orange juice with solid food. He is overwhelmed from the amount he is able to polish off now. Then Doug for a moment just sits in stuffed stupor, his stomach suddenly feels painfully full but at the same moment he feels so good. After ten minutes he slowly moves to lie on the sofa and sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug is suddenly awaken by Grandma, it is two hours later. \"Doug, I didn't want to wake you, you look so sweet when you sleep. Could you get up and help me to bring something?\" She leads him to unused room in the back of the house, there is mostly stored various odds and ends, old articles of furniture and paper boxes. She shows her hand to small table situated on tall box. \"Take this table down and put it here on floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug does as he was asked and Grandma then wipes table surface from layer of dust and then thoroughly wipe away. \"Well, it doesn't look so bad and old. Doug, could you bring it to kitchen, please?\"<br>\r\nShe goes in front of Doug and tells him to put it next to the sofa to the wall. She watch happily, how it stays there and then looks to Doug and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doug, I got an idea of how you prepare for greater convenience when you have something to taste to put it on small low table for you when you rest. So you don't have to afraid you overturn some bowl with snacks or crumble into the sofa. And of course, I can put more snacks on table. Do you like it?\" and smiles on Doug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug says with excitement \"This is great improvement, Grandma! You never stop to think about my comfort. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it would be useful for you.\" Grandma replies contentedly \"So now you can lie down again, I will bring your mid morning snack I prepared for you, while you slept after breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to have some snack.\" Doug replies and is happy with this convenience. From now he can just reach out his hand and grab some goodies served on little table for him, all the time. Life is so good, he thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\nLater that day, when Doug wakes up after his afternoon nap and starts lazily moves on the sofa, Grandma looks back on him and asks.<br>\r\n\"Doug, you already rested well? I think now is good time for you to call your mom, you remember what we did this morning. Anette wants to hear, ...you know, your weight. She could return home now, what do you think?\" and sweetly smiles on Doug.<br>\r\nWhen Doug hears mention of a call to Mom, he is suddenly in full attention and realize, that his Mother wants to know how fat he is getting on his vacation.<br>\r\nHe tries to casually reply. \"Well, Mom could be at home at this time. I will try to call her.\"<br>\r\nDoug stands up and goes to the living room, where is a phone, sits down to the armchair. He is little insecure and doesn't know how the conversation on theme \"how I am starting to get fat\" with his mother might unfold. He sighs an slowly dials number to his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several rings someone picks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Anette speaking, who is it?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She cooks and bakes all goodies I like. But it is really fun for me, believe me, everything tastes so great. Just I am a little sorry I haven't been here for my summer holidays before, ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doug, how are you doing on the appetite? I mean, at home you almost not eaten at breakfasts at all and also you refused to eat at snack times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must tell you, grandma helped me to improve my appetite. I can eat at meals now more than I have eaten at home. And at breakfasts she cooks so good meals, I even start to enjoy breakfast as soon as I wake up in the morning.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that Doug. And what about amount of food you eat, I hope you all eat up and don't leave scraps of food. Grandma could be upset, you know. You must obey her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can finish all Grandma serves for me now. Even if I always must overeat a lot, would you believe it? But I got used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Doug, I wanted to ask you one more thing. Yesterday I asked your grandmother to request you to make you have weighed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was little odd for me, I mean you never asked me to do such things, but I weighed myself. I weigh 158 pounds now. I had gained nearly ten pounds since I came here. Why do you want to know it? Are you afraid I could gain too much with all my eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are still growing boy and that is expected on such vacation, with Grandma cooking habits, you know. I just wanted to hear how are you doing, that's all sweetie. Don't worry about anything and do what Grandma want from you, please.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I will mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of yourself, Doug. Bye.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug hangs up the phone and starts to think about his finished call. \"It was not as I expected. Mom is little too much curious. Perhaps she just want to know what I do here. She never given a clear indication that she want from me to get fat. Maybe I don't have to worry and just eat what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Doug hears Grandma calls him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doug, you finished you call with mom? Everything is okay, I suppose. Come here to kitchen, I prepared your after lunch dessert. I hope you are hungry, there is plenty of goodies for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug just sighs and slowly stands up. \" I'm little hungry gran, I'm coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug again overeats on big cheesecake, ice cream and other sweet treats.

Doug is now quite accustomed to large portions of food and lots of sweets. Everything his Grandma gives him on the table to eat he manages to polish off without any problems and enjoys it. He is often not even feeling stuffed nowadays. He is also settled  to see his body slowly growing, mainly around waistline, where new layers of fat starts to find its new home. Today at morning during shower Doug soaped and washed his rounder stomach which is visibly jutting outward even when it is empty and not fully stuffed with rich food. After he dried himself, he tries on his underwear but it was not comfortable for him. His underpants started to be small to contain his belly and he has tried to pull it down under belly after big meal. When he thinks about it, he have done this after all meals recently and he feels snug in his underpants all the time. Doug sighs, finish his getting dressed and goes down to breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finishes his usually big first meal of the day he says to Grandma. \"I would like to go with you to shopping in town today. You told me yesterday you want to pick something in shopping center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma nods and says. \"Yes, I really need to go there. So, we can change our plans for today and both drive there shortly after breakfast. What do you want to buy?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug feels little uneasy and answers hesitantly. \"I need to buy new or... bigger underwear. My underpants are too constricting to my waist now, you know ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma smiles with understanding. \"That's perfectly natural,when are you now growing, especially in the waist and also on buttocks, I would say. Young men should be proud to outgrow their clothes.\" Grandma looks at him and then gets up from the table and goes for something in the next room, she returns with measuring tape in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we need your measurements to find proper size which will fit you. Take off your pants, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug obeys and is standing in the kitchen with just underpants and T-shirt pulled up over his round belly still full from his morning meal. \"Now I will see in number how much fatter my belly is.\" He thinks for himself amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma carefully measured him around the belly and then around the hips and buttocks. \"It is good to measure you when you have just eaten big meal\", and winks to him.   \"So, waist is ... \" for increased tension she makes a pause before telling the numbers \" it is nice 36 inches and over hips you have 37,5 inches.You're beginning to finally have figure as man, not as a child. \" She smiles at him and Doug feels little awkward at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I just need to put the dishes into the dishwasher, dress up and we can go then.\" Grandma says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes they are sitting in car leaving driveway of house. While driving they talk about only shopping center in town and surrounding of it and how to spend their time best today there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grandma finds vacant place in parking lot near side entrance, she parks and they both enter the shopping center. After short walking grandmother finds a clothing store for men and sends Doug there. She needs to go somewhere else on other side of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug enters aisles full of articles of clothing and hesitates which size of underpants to choose for himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then forgot about it as they talked during journey to town. Doug reaches into his pocket and reads on it is handwritten \u2019Guide for shopping\u2019, he then opens the paper. It says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2019Doug, buy for yourself new items of underwear in progressive larger sizes, not in the size of waist 36\u2019 you measured today, choose more things in size 40 and bigger. You will use it, believe me.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug just wanted to pick few pairs in the size he has got today when he suddenly recalls what were his own thoughts after that body measuring at this morning. In near future he will definitely outgrow his current size of underwear and then he would be in same situation again with clothes uncomfortably pinching into his softer belly despite the spandex in the waistband. Doug thinks for a moment that his weight gain and substantial growth of his waistline and other body parts is inevitable and will continue on his long vacation. Grandma is right, he is musing, I need to pick bigger clothes for myself and not to buy too much of clothing from now on, I could outgrow them soon with my new found appetite. This could be waste of money if my new clothes would shrink too soon. Doug with some concern suddenly realizes that his new big and progressive larger sweatpants which his mom equipped him with before he arrived to Grandma were well - considered step. And all those baggy T-shirts in large size which he got with them are not a coincidence also. O. K., let's buy bigger and more comfortable things for my expanding figure and with smile while he walks in deserted alleys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter moment of wandering through the large shop Doug finally sees hanging sign over underwear clothes section. He heads for there and find out they have his usual style of boxers and shorts. He picks one pair of shorts in size 36 from the shelf and with look on them thinks those are going to be small soon. Then he reaches to the lower shelf for two different pairs of cotton stretch underpants in size 40. He heads for the dressing cabin to try them on on himself.  When he is in the cabin and almost naked stands just in his old small underpants he can see imprints of tight hem on skin around his waist. Those new one's will be much more comfortable for me, he thinks and wind up the big shorts in size 40. They are too big and he can easily put both hands under lap of shorts and they still feel roomy around his belly and backside and spandex in the waistband is not constricting him at all, shorts almost want to slip down. Those are really big, he thinks, but only temporarily. I can overfeed myself into them, he muses and pats his soft middle. Then he quickly dresses back into his clothes and puts new pairs of underwear into the shopping basket. Doug returns to the shelf with underwear and add to the basket two pairs of shorts in the same size he just tried. Then he moves to next shelf with selection of underpants in size 42 and take four pairs of them. After some hesitation he adds even three pairs in size 44. He looks on them and they look really big for him, but one never knows when it will come in handy. Then he walks to the shelf with T-shirts and picked two of them in size XL and three in size XXL. They could be more comfortable also after expansion of my upper body, he is musing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Doug thinks he purchased what he wanted and slowly walks with basket of clothes to the register. Doug is standing second behind an elder man who is slowly paying and is normally waiting his turn. Now he suddenly realizes what cashier will think that he is buying clothes obviously for himself and they are in different sizes? Could she make some grimaces or even remarks about him getting fat? When he finally moves in front of register young cashier smile at him and takes his basket. She starts to scan individual items and looks on the display between each one. When all is scanned she asks Doug if he wants something else and tells him total is $ 57.40, folds clothes and puts them into a plastic bag. Doug gives her his credit card and he thinks she glimpsed to his belly when he reached for card in his wallet. She finally returns his card with receipt and thanks him for his purchase with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug then leaves the shop and strolls away through the mall. When he sees enormous electronics store he enters it to look for all new electronics he wants to see and try. He soon forgets how time flies and when he looks on his watches he realizes it is high time to get back into the parking lot to their car where they agreed meeting place with Grandma at 11:30 AM. He has ten minutes left so he finds right exit in the not familiar shopping center for him and walks to the car. He doesn't want to Grandma wait for him. He comes first to the car and Grandma comes just a moment later. With smile she asks him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doug, you bought all you wanted?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did. I also followed your advice.\" answers Doug.<br>\r\n\"Good boy. \" answers Grandma. While she opens a trunk for Doug to put there his bag with purchase, she asks.<br>\r\n\"Where do you want to go to eat? It's almost your usual lunch time and you had no meal since breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug suddenly feels hungry, for all the time he didn't think about eating, not even eaten some snack. It must be from the excitement from visiting foreign environment, he thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel hungry, I could eat some really big lunch now.\", he answers and waits for Grandma suggestion where is good place to eat.<br>\r\n\"I have two choices for our lunch now. \" says Grandma, \" First is go to pizzeria nearby, we should walk there from here. Second good place is a buffet three blocks down the main street fro here. What do you want to eat Doug?\"<br>\r\nDoug is briefly pondering and answers ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You will be satisfied with their variety of meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both sits into the car and Grandma starts to maneuver from parking lot to the street exit. During journey Doug asks Grandma what she bought in the mall, because a moment before he saw big white cardboard box stored in the trunk. <br>\r\n\"I purchased bigger deep fryer to my kitchen. My old one was too small, outdated and not good for using it often. I want to prepare more deep fried meals for you Doug. You told me you would like to often eat french fries.\u201d Grandma explains her purchase.<br>\r\nDoug is really happy that he could eat more fries from now. Fries were only one of the fast foods he occasionally indulged when he was practicing swimming in high school.<br>\r\nHe says enthusiastically \"Thanks Grandma, I'm really looking forward to your fries, it will be delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug is suddenly even more hungry after mention of the food. He starts to feel more excited about his upcoming gorging on rich meals in the all you can eat buffet. Fortunately, they are in traffic slowly coming to a packed parking lot at a restaurant. <br>\r\nWhen they exits the car Grandma says while walking to entry, \"Doug, I expect you show in here how you have improved your appetite over the summer with me.\" and winks to him.<br>\r\n\"I would say that I can consume a lot of food, you can bet on it if the meals tastes good here!\" Doug answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey enter busy buffet and pay a fee. Doug smells the enticing scents of warm meals and almost starts to salivate. When they pass over to the food counter, Grandma comes with the proposal. \"Let's make the lunch more enjoyable for both of us. I will choose one meal for you and you can choose your next course, right? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug just nods and then Grandma comes to the counter where is pasta with sausage-meatball spaghetti sauce. She loaded two large plates for both of them and they come to sit to the vacant table. Doug digs into the food with gusto and quickly finishes the meal. Grandma sees he likes it and before he can say something she gets up and goes for another plate of the same meal for Doug. Doug meanwhile looks around to other diners. Buffet is pretty crowded with workers at the lunch break. Doug then observes that most of diners are overweight and quite a number of them are even obese, both men and women. They look busy with dining from their plates of hearty portions of food. Suddenly in some distance from him passes one young man which catch his attention. He is weighing over 250 lbs with jiggling hefty midsection. Doug is looking at him stealthily and suddenly feels certain envy to a sizable gut on this young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grandma returns to the table, Doug just sighs and starts to eat quickly again. Grandma asks him. \"What do you want for a drink?\"<br>\r\n\"I would like some iced tea please.\" Doug says with mouth half full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma gets up and goes to the place with drinks, and before Doug finishes eating his second plate, she brings him two large glasses of the drink. As third course Doug chooses for him hamburger with fries. He loads for him two big burgers and large pile of fries on another plat. He starts to eat it as fast as at the beginning of his lunch, but after he finishes he needs to rest for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext course chooses Grandma and brings a portion smoked salmon with couscous and mushrooms for Doug. Doug tastes it and says her it is delicious. He want to savor it and eats the meal slower. <br>\r\nThen Doug wants to try chicken nuggets with mashed potatoes, but feels too tired from previous eating to brings it himself. Grandma offers she can bring the meal for him and with satisfied smile she returns to the table with overflowing plate of caloric food. She coached him \"I hope you can eat all of this.\"<br>\r\n\"That's quite a lot of food.\" Doug comments when he see large portion for him. He starts to feel really full after a few bites.<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you can eat little more.\" Grandma encourages him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug finishes his meal really slowly with a short pauses for breathing between eating few morsels. When he lays a fork on his empty plate, he feels totally stuffed. Even before the lunch he wanted to gorge as much as possible, he knows he reached his capacity now. With stomach painfully swollen Doug for a while just pants and says nothing. Food was great, but he has had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grandma sees he looks and feels better, she says. \"You managed to eat a lot, now we can go.\" Doug just nods, finished drinking iced tea and with burping carefully rises to his feet. They slowly leave to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn employee at the gate is saying goodbye to Doug with Grandma and asks them, \"I hope you were satisfied with our restaurant and we look forward to your visit next time.\" She smiles to Doug. <br>\r\n\"Your meals were great, good bye.\" Grandma answers with satisfied tone. Then they walk outside of the buffet on the way to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma unlocks the car and Doug is slowly lowering himself with painful grimace on his face in the seat. When he sits in with grunts, he loosens the string on his shorts to find some comfort for his aching abdomen. Grandma comments it \"Make yourself comfortable Doug. You've really had enough to eat and made me proud of your progress so far. I'm pretty sure when we will come here next time, you can eat even more.\"  After a pause she adds with a mischievous grin. \"And you'll have to taste their desserts afterwards.\"<br>\r\n\"Grandma, you are really terrible in stuffing me, you know? I've really eaten more than ever before.\" answers Doug amusedly and burps. Grandma then starts the car engine and they are exiting on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile driving, Grandma comes up with a proposal, \"When we are here in town today I want to stop somewhere else. We still have enough time for the way back home.\" She glances to Doug and says:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One week of quality cooking in ridiculous quantity has added a bit of a belly to Doug. Not that he minds.  As his belly stretches out he finds himself more hungry more often.  He doesn't mind that so much either.  Food is never far away at Grandma's and his larger appetite enables him to eat even more of her great deserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug spends most of his time wearing sweats.  He's gained a little weight already - maybe five pounds.  He spends most of his time on a stool in the kitchen sampling snacks and pinching food off any plates that come near him, even the ones not meant for him (His mom hates that but his Grandma only winks at him with a grin).  The rest of his time is spent at the table (for the actual meals) and on the couch (when he's too bloated even to snack). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug's mom initially attempted to remind him of manners, but eventually gave up.  Grandma, Doug's new partner in crime, kept snacks and seconds coming at a pace his belly approved of - at first.  Although he was still quite trim, is appetite had nearly doubled from over stuffing and his capacity was continuing to grow.  After that first week he was eating more like a hefty NFL lineman than a slim swimmer.  At this pace his appearance will soon catch up with he's belly's unreal demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, seven days after his arrival, he lies awake in bed.  Dinner was intense. Doug gorged so much so fast he burst out into a sweat!  To his annoyance, his belly rumble him awake at midnight.  Dinner was big, but hours ago.  He had skipped desert because he had filled up so much on the other dishes that he feared he might puke.  Now he knew his belly wouldn't have allowed that as it rumbled to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he's irritated by his stomach's insistence.  But then he recalls the intoxication that follows a huge gorging and smiles at the opportunity for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he have a midnight snack (or two)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should Grandma come to the rescue later and even more food be made for hungry Doug from then on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should Doug sneak out for fast food and add even more calories to his diet?</span></div></div>",

About 3/4 into the box he feels stuffed to his limit but forces the rest down to, just to prove to himself that he can.<br>\r\nAfter the huge snack Doug walks slowly up the stairs to his room, his full belly hurting. He lies down and gently knead his belly to release tome pressure. He notices that despite being full his belly has a soft touch to it, from the fat covering it now. for a few moments he thinks about weight and health and such, but decides not to worry. He's young and naturally strong, fit and full of stamina. Not to mention a great metabolism. How fat could he possibly get in just one year?</span></div></div>",

While grandma cleans up, he heads out to the backyard to relax by the pool. He finds a nice spot in the shade beneath a tree. It's warm, so he takes off his shirt, his full belly is pushing painfully at his waistband so he ditches the shorts as well. As he lays there in his boxers he slowly drifts away into a half-awake slumber while absentmindedly rubbing his belly.<br>\r\nWhen he wakes up grandma has placed a pitcher of ice tea and some big, fresh, cinnamon buns next to him.

He downs almost the entire pitcher at once, the heat had made him thirsty even in the shade.<br>\r\nDoug slips into the pool to cool off, letting his boxers double as swimwear. The cool water envelops him and he floats around on his back peacefully. He suddenly becomes aware that his belly is poking up from the water. Doug has always been skinny as a nail, but there's definitely a little bulge around his belly button, poking up over the water surface. Doug brushes it off as just being bloated, he did just eat cinnamon buns and drink a pitcher of ice tea.<br>\r\nHe closes his eyes and gets back into his soaked relaxing.<br>\r\nHe's not sure how long he's been floating around when a voice breaks the silence: \"Hey Doug, remember me?

I know you are tired but I couldn't reist making so special brownies for Grandma's special Grandson.\" She says as she puts a brownie up to Dougs mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be rude and he was strangely hungry so he began to eat and boy oh boy did Grandma out do herself. They were so yummy you could chew fast enough to take another bite. Finally after 20 minutes of non stop eating the brownies were gone along with a full 30 oz glass of chocolate milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug moans and says, \"Oh boy! Grandma you are an awesome cook. I could stay here forever with food like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma says....</span></div></div>",

Plus I had short hair like yours, somewhat different in that era.\" she replied, patting Doug's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ok,\" he said, looking down at his belly. It stretched the blouse out a bit, but the blouse still was pretty loose on him, which he liked. He liked the fact that most of the clothes his Grandma gave him had room for growth, and not skin tight like the clothes he had. He checked himself out again in the mirror, noticing how round his butt was in the stretch pants, and how plump his thighs and arms had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dear, I am sure you are starting to get hungry again, and I have a nice cake cooking for you in the oven, so I better go and check on it,\" she said, waddling off the kitchen. Doug could smell the cake as the door was opened on the oven. His hunger really kicked in big time. He grabbed the rest of his Grandma's old clothes, dumped them in his bedroom, and walked out to the kitchen. Greeting him on the table was a large triple layer chocolate cake, still warm and fresh from the oven. \"Eat up dear, I got to go out and get some more supplies from the local store,\" said Grandma as she waddled out of the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug's belly gurgled as he licked his lips. The cake looked delicious. He grabbed a large carving knife and cut off a large slice of the cake. He ate it quickly, but still tasted all the chocolates, sugar and icing in his mouth. The first slice got him addicted to it, he had to eat it all, and eat it now. He cut off another big slice, and gobbled it down quickly. His belly groaned as it swelled out, but he ignored any protests from it as he cut off more slices and ate them. His belly was filling out the blouse, buttons barely holding it together as his belly peeked out between the buttons. He eventually, after some effort, finished the cake. The blouse by now had become skin tight across his massive belly. He slowly got up from the table, trying his best not to burst out of the blouse. However as soon as he stood up, he felt really thirsty. He walked over to the fridge and grabbed a carton of milk out of it. He poured it down his throat, but he could notice his belly was getting really tight in the blouse. As soon as he looked down, one button popped off, and soon after that two others. He felt relief as his belly was given a bit more room to grow, so he emptied the milk carton. Soon as he was finished, another button burst open, letting his bare swollen ball belly to stick out. He gave it a loving rub, and slowly walked back to his bedroom to rest.</span></div></div>",

He gets up and goes to brush his teeth and get properly dressed. His belly is so stuffed it looks inflated and it hurts to breath. By the time he's done it's a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks over to yellow house. A hefty man is sitting at the porch smoking. When he sees Doug he gets up and comes towards him.<br>\r\n\"Hi. You must be Doug right. Been looking foreward to meet you.\" He grabs Dougs hand and gives it a squeeze, there is definatly a lot of muscle under his flabby appearence.<br>\r\n\"I'm.

Doug is here.<br>\r\nAdam hears some heavy footsteps comming closer and then the first of his cousins appears. He is not sure wich one. He is about the same height, maybe an inch smaller, but apart from that he is bigger. The boy has a huge flabby belly under a tight t-shirt that looks rather new. He can see a pale rol of flab hanging out under the shirt, covering his groin and a little more.<br>\r\n\"Hi, I am Carl,\" Says Carl extending a flabby arm. Doug shakes it and presents himself.<br>\r\n\"Where is Adam?\" asked Orwald.<br>\r\n\"He's comming soon.\" said Carl, \"There he is now.\"<br>\r\nAdam appeared at the top of the stairs, he is a little taller than Doug and...</span></div></div>",

However it amused him and at times would subconsciously play with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" he said in a deep voice and Doug was intimidated.

Trying to be polite, he wiggles his hand free and watched as Adam shrugged.

Small and average size does not exist in this family! But don't worry, you'll pork up eventually. I'm afraid it's rather destiny in this family.\"<br>\r\n\"It won't happen to me,\" Doug declared bravely. Orwald shook his head but kept quiet.

Doug can see he's struggeling, not only from being unfit but because is girth blocks both view and mobility. When Adam is down he's almost exhausted and sits down on a chair placed next to the stair. When Adam regains his breath they greet each other properly. Doug is very curious about Adams body. How did he get so big? How big is he, and why doesn't his father seem to care? The three of them, Doug, Adam and Carl, head into the living room. Adam drops into the sofa while Carl finds a cushion chair. Doug sits down in the sofa next to Adam.

I'm really looking forward to staying here for a full year.\" Doug replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud, lumbering footsteps were heard coming from the kitchen, as the hefty Orwald rounded the corner into the living room, holding a giant bowl of chips and a tray of brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go boys,\" He said, setting the chips and brownies at the far corner of the table between you and Carl. \"You two can snack on these while you all chat and catch up with each other.\" Indicating just you and Carl with his finger as he turned on his heel and headed back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Dad,\" Carl called after him, as he grabbed a huge brownie and stuffed most of it into his mouth while rubbing the pale roll of his partially exposed flabby gut. \"Dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug wondered why Orwald only indicated Carl and himself for the huge snack he laid out.  He chanced a glance to his left at Adam, not wanting to stare. Adam certainly didn't look like he needed any snacks, his huge belly had bunched up into a giant mound of flab now that he was sitting, the fabric of his shirt stretched so tightly that each fold and roll on his body was accentuated by it.  The mound reached all the way down to his knees, which were spread wide allowing it to droop towards the floor.  While Doug's 150 pound behind took up only half a couch cushion, his wide rear was covering the entirety of two as it spread thickly from his seat next to him.  His face was red, most likely from the 'long' trek downstairs, his breathing was getting better, but he was still huffing and puffing just bearing his immense weight.  He was rubbing what he could reach of his massive belly as Doug heard the familiar footsteps of Orwald enter the room again, holding another plate of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Adam,\" He said, stepping by you in front of his massive son. \"This one is for you if you want to reach your goal weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrwald set the plate on Adam's fat chest, between his swollen man-boobs, it was then you saw that the plate was filled with...</span></div></div>",

By the look of those wilted salad greens, it was obviously not fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Orwald conceded, slapping Adam's enormous belly a hearty slap. The rippling of the fat was long, drawn out over the span of his belly. \"We'll put the diet on hold 'til tomorrow. These puny greens wouldn't satisfy a mouse, let alone a growing boy like you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrwald placed the small, pathetic salad back in the fridge; he took out a couple cans of soda, along with a two-liter Pepsi bottle. Ambling back into the living room, he handed Carl and Doug a can each. The giant bottle looked small in Adam's pudgy hands, as he quickly began to chug the soda. He was halfway finished with it by the time his large platter of chips and brownies was set on his massuve chest. Adam's eyes gleamed with hunger, and he began to dig into his food.

Conversation would have to wait until after snack for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by the looks of it, that wouldn't be very long at all. Doug, still relatively full from breakfast, was taking meager bites of his brownie. Carl was happily munching away with decent bites, occasionally flicking and jostling his hefty roll of exposed fat, very hefty for a 15 year old boy. Adam on the other hand had no reservations about glutting himself to sate his hunger. Still not wanting to stare, Doug chanced quick glances towards Adam to see him shovel a whole brownie into his mouth, followed by another almost immediately. Adam's cheeks bloated with food as he made obnoxious chewing sounds, the occasional grunt and an audible 'gulp' sound every handful of seconds. Carl was only picking up his second brownie when Adam had forced brownies four and five past his lips, truly giving him the appearance of a chipmunk now, an extremely obese chipmunk whose double chin wobbled to and fro with each gulp and labored intake of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug took another bite of his brownie, but instead pushed the moist cake into his chin. Carl chuckled out loud, Doug had been staring at Adam for a bit now in a trance of... something. As his face flushed red from embarrassment, he couldn't really figure out what he felt. Was it disgust, admiration, shame, or excitement? He didn't have time to dwell on it before heavy footsteps reentered the living room. Orwald was carrying an extra large pizza before him, it was no deep dish, but damn it was loaded with a ridiculous amount of meat and cheese, there looked to be roughly a pound of ground beef piled onto the behemoth pizza. Doug was expecting the new delivery to be placed on the table for everyone to partake in, but to his shock Orwald pulled the plate of brownies from Adam's fat chest just as he pushed the last two into his cavernous mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this from Grandma!\" Orwald said with a bright tone. \"You know she's always got something cooking over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mophm.\" Adam grunted. His bulging mouthful of brownie not allowing for civilized speech. As Doug sat there munching on his own brownie, he swore he had heard the word 'more' hidden within that grunt, but it was probably just his overwhelming shock of simply being in such an awkward and foreign situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Doug.\" Carl called out. \"You've got a little something on your chin. Haha.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Doug said stupidly, wiping his chocolate covered chin upon his sleeve. \"I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl took a heavy swig from his soda can and winked. \"What's wrong Doug, Ain't you ever seen a healthy appetite before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug stammered in his reply. \"Well, yeah... I guess. I'm not trying to be rude, I... I've just. It's a lot of food I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course it's a lot of food, have you met our Grandma before?\" Carl asked with a smile. \"Gotta have a good appetite when you live next door to her. Now dig in, and don't go worrying about formalities here. We're all family here, so don't be ashamed about what you see, 'ol Adam isn't gonna bite you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Adam had killed the chips, chugged the rest of his Pepsi two liter and was working his way through the enormous pizza. Rolling up each slice into a giant pizza tube, Adam's jaw worked like a wood chipper as he pushed each whole slice into his mouth one at a time, shiny orange grease leaking and dripping down his chins and onto his shirt. Doug was beginning to feel more at ease as he and Carl made small talk about the surrounding neighborhood, whilst Adam bore through his pizza. Upon finishing his final piece of pizza his face was once again an angry shade of red, as it was when he first made the trip downstairs. Red faced and huffing for breath, Adam lethargically reached down to his sides and unseated his tucked shirt, pulling it up and out of the too-tight waistband of his khakis. The swollen dome of his stuffed gut underneath his many mounds of flab quickly made his shirt ride upwards several inches, exposing two extremely pale jiggling fat rolls at his side, it was easy to see this rotund boy didn't get out much. Adam then reached down at full arms length, and was just able to reach the button of his overtaxed pants, which he easily popped open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doug,\" Carl pointed towards Adam's blubbery form. \"would you mind giving him a hand, undo that zipper would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more than a little nervous Doug brought his hand to Adam's zipper and pulled it's oversized length down, which was more the equivalent of opening a floodgate than a simple zipper. The sound of flesh dragging quickly across fabric resounded hard and fast as Adam's gut flopped out heavily between his legs, forcing not only outwards from it's confines, but sagging a good two inches lower past his knees without the fabric to hold it back. Carl jokingly applauded from across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew... better.\" Adam huffs out. His breathing is shallow, heavy and quick. Probably from the pressure of all that junk he unabashedly forced into himself. Doug didn't have a whole lot of time to think about it before more footsteps were heard. Orwald entered into the room once again with decent sized slice of chocolate cake and a bowl of ice cream for Doug and Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go,\" He said smiling. \"Compliments from Grandma. Eat up boys there's plenty more... whoa!\" Orwald stopped when he saw Adam, his shirt ridden up and his creased sack of belly flab hanging in the open. \"Thata boy! Give me a second, I'll get your dessert.\" Orwald finished, giving the boys exposed belly a gentle tap, even a movement so minor sent tiny waves through such soft fat. Doug was staring once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrwald returned to set what appeared to be the remainder of the chocolate cake on Adam's chest, well over half of an entire cake. And a gigantic bowl of vanilla ice cream to boot. Orwald simply dug his hand into Adam's soft shoulder next to him and said, \"Dig in!\"</span></div></div>",

She jumped up and went to take his order.

Kate being a FA was in heaven, but the boys were oblivious to it. Kate was talking to Adam eating up every word he was saying  entranced by his humongous body.

Adam stood up and was about to push Doug out of his chair but under the table Kate tripped him and Doug got up and Adam fell and collided with Dougs belly and bounced backwards onto the ground. But Doug falls on him to make sure he won\u2019t get back up. To the rest of the table all they saw was that Adam got up and tried to tackle Doug but failed and Doug defended himself. Orwald then grabs Adam and Grandma And Kate grab Doug and grandma sends Adam home and They continue their dinner. Doug sits back down exhausted from the \u201cfight\u201d. Orwald apologizes and loads up Dougs plate, \u201c Here you go Doug sorry for his behavior.\u201d Then Grandma says, you know what Doug you finish my plate too, you need to get your energy up after that\u201d as she loads up her plate with more goodies. \u201cThank you Grandma I\u2019m exausted\u201d said Doug and he happily accepted the food. After dinner, which Doug devoured after the \u201cfight\u201d, Orwald, and Doug were in the living room while Kate, Grandma, and Carl were in the kitchen cleaning up. Kay eloped to help grandma because she wanted to get close with her and grandma taught her how to cook sometimes. Then Grandma came out holding two pies, one for Doug and one for Orwald. She said, \u201cI made a pie for everyone.\u201d After Doug finished his grandma came in with another one saying Kate didn\u2019t want hers. So he slowly ate hers as well. Then she came out with another one and offered it to them,\u201d since Adam had an outburst one of you can have his pie.\u201d Orwald said he was full and Doug was about to say no but Kate said, \u201c Doug will eat it\u201d as she came out and sat next to him.

She said it was because his doctor, who happened to be Kate\u2019s mom, told him he needed to drink more liquids. \u201cThis is for you because my mom said you needed to drink more liquids, it\u2019s ok my dad has the same problem. \u201c Then her mom sat next to her dad and they started the meal. Then Kate started to fill up Doug\u2019s plate. Doug looked at the other side of the table and saw Kate\u2019s mom filling her dads plate up too. Then he realized something. Kate and her mom look super alike. Her mom was beautiful, short, had dark hair, and had a voluptuous ass.  Doug dug into his meal. Towards the end he was watching Kate\u2019s mom feed her father. And Kate was helping by filling up his plate and giving him a spoonful of mash potatoes whenever her mom wasn\u2019t already stuffing his face. She would also tend to Doug and fill up his plate whenever it was in danger of being empty.  Doug thought, \u201cwhat a pig, he eats like Adam\u201d. Although Adam has lost weight Doug still saw him as the giant mass that he was first introduced to. Doug was eating his meal entranced by the giant man in front of him being stuffed to the brim by two beautiful ladies. He had a warm feeling in his chest as he kept on eating. After dinner Doug left stuffed to the brim with the cake Kate\u2019s mom made for him. Kate drove him home, but not after she stuffed him again with some brownies Kate\u2019s mom happened to give to Kate as she left.</span></div></div>",

I just wasn't enjoying it like I used to and so decided to relax for a while. But a casual swim in your Grandma's awesome pool sounds too good to resist, especially when the weather is so perfect! What time should I come over?'<br>\r\n'In 30 minutes OK?'<br>\r\n'Perfect. Seeyou in a bit.'<br>\r\n'Laterz.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that 30 minutes Doug puts on his swim shorts and grazes on the food his grandma left him on the couch. After 50 minutes Doug is a little confused that Kyle hadn't already arrived. Just then there's a knock at the door and Doug opens it to see Kyle standing there. He doesn't appear to have changed much, except Doug had caught up with him height wise. Kyle's blue eyes were still as electric, but his blonde hair had grown somewhat into a surfer dude style which suited him. He still had his broad shoulders and thick arms from the swimming days, but a baggy t-shirt hid the rest. Doug gives Kyle a big bear hug being careful not to hit the bags he was carrying in his muscular arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's awesome to seeya Kyle, your hair looks amazing'<br>\r\n'Likewise buddy' replies Kyle 'and you're a little taller huh?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle explains how he got a bit hungry on the way over so grabbed a McDonalds bigmac meal before deciding to get 2 more - one more for him and one for Doug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aww dude thanks loads. 2 meals Kyle! You had best watch out, all those calories now you're not swimming' jokes Doug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've put on a weight in the year but luckily it's not showing too much, as you can see'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You look exactly the same!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finish the McDonals and not to mention the pop Doug's grandma had left, the boys strip down to swim shorts and head to the pool.

With no one around most of the time she doesn't get to practice cooking as much as she likes, and she now has her own guinea pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug doesn't mind, her food is delicious, and there is always plenty of it. He especially likes going to bed with a full stomach, which he doesn't really have an alternative since his Grandma always guilts him into eating as much as she can. Many times he finds himself waking up in the middle of the night and snacking on left overs He also loves waking up to the smell of a great breakfeast everymorning. Something new everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he leaves the house he generally meets Kyle out for lunch and brings him a basket of goodies from his Grandma. Kyle eats them without fail everyday with the help of Doug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug and Kyle generally eat two or three times a day in between events and going places. From lunches at McDonalds to snacks at the house to Dinners with Kyles family or out at a resturant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Doug arrives home he is generally greeted with a second Dinner, which he manages to eat most of no matter how much he ate during the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout three weeks after Dougs arrival, Kyle came over to Doug's house to go swimming with him.

Yesterday the high temperature had been ninety degrees and anyone near enough to feel it was sweating bullets. This certainly encluded Doug who had let the mantra 'Don't worry about it' a little too in focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay sleeping, out like a ton of bricks, on the couch, breathing heavily in the intense heat of his grandmother's anti-air conditioned household. Some birds were chirping loudly enough outside that they woke him up, almost suddenly, from sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwake, he heaved himself up with a groan so that he was sitting on the edge of the sofa. His stomach had grown a bit, but Kyle's constant reassurance put any thoughts of it getting out of control from his mind. However, the space vacated in his brain from encouragment had become home to a new urge: Eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing on every morning's agenda was breakfast; and this one was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug plodded into the kitchen in due time, picking up a note his grandmother had left him, which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Douggie,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       Went to the store and have some errands to run. There's plenty of food in the kitchen, but if nothing catches your eye I left fifteen dollars for you.<br>\r\n                                                                                              Love,<br>\r\n                                                                                                         Grandma<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled \"Nice!\", he said aloud. This meant he could do some cooking of his own for once; a prospect which excited him. So, using only some leftovers, he whipped up some basic, traditional foods to start out: Bacon, scrambled eggs, toast, OJ, and some strawberries which he topped lovingly with whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of it set out, in fairly large portions, Doug could contain himself no longer and dove in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes the vast array of foods he had prepared vanished from the table, leaving only a lucky crumb to be identified. His stomach was feeling fairly tight, and from the looks of it a little plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug started to second guess all the excuses Kyle had been throwing out as they had ballooned over the past month. He was getting scared now; he had to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet on the scale, he breathed in, and looked down:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale read... </span></div></div>",

He jumped off the scale and ripped his shirt off to access the damage.  Sure enough his body showed him what the scale had already told him.  Doug had a full blown belly, now slightly bloated from breakfast, hanging over his gym shorts.  He had two huge love handles that actually had started to form a roll on either side in the middle of his back.  He slapped his tits only to see them jiggle back and forth.  He even had a double chin forming.  His entire body had gown soft and chubby.  But the feature that had enlarged the most was that of his ass.  All that sitting and eating all day long really gave him two jiggling cheeks that pulled his gym shorts completely taunt.

I have no idea what your saying.\"  Kyle said, trying to make sense of his frantic cousin.<br>\r\n\"I've gotten fat, Kyle.\"<br>\r\nThere was silence for a moment, and then Kyle burst out into laughter.<br>\r\n\"That's what you're stressing out about??  I told you we had all summer to chill and not stress out about our bodies man!  It's seriously no big deal!\"  said Kyle, still chuckling.<br>\r\n\"Look I can't even fit into my baithing suit anymore!\"  Kyle shouted, half offended and the lack of sympathy for his predicament.<br>\r\n\"Hey, calm down dude.  I'm on my way over right now, alright?  No reason to stress out.\"<br>\r\n\"That's easy for you to say..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Kyle showed up, and though it had only been about a week since Doug had seen him last, his jaw dropped.  Kyle looked as if he had put on twice the weight Doug had.  His shirt was completely taunt around his massive soft belly, even to where it exposed the bottom portion of his clearly soft belly.  His whole body was thicker and softer, from his ass to his arms to his face.  Surely enough he had two big McDonalds bags in his hand.<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" said Doug in awe, \"you've gotten bigger than me!\"<br>\r\n\"I told you I wasn't going to worry about my weight this summer and neither should you!\"  said Kyle, patting his belly causing a rippling effect.  \"Seriously dude, don't worry about it.  I brought us some snackage to, cause personally I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you expect to lose all that??  Especially with what's in your hand!\"  Doug asked in disbeleif.<br>\r\n\"Swimming, working out, whatever.  We're young man...it'll take no time at all to burn all this off.\"  Kyle said, setting down the bags.  \"Plus, half of these burgers are for you,\" he said with a mischevious smile on his face.<br>\r\n\"You really need to weigh yourself Kyle,\" said Doug as he eyed Kyle biting into his first double cheeseburger.  He would be lying to say that those burgers didn't look delicious and that his stomach wasn't crying out for all of that food!<br>\r\n\"Fine!  If I weigh myself will you calm down and have a burger?\"  asked Kyle settlingly.<br>\r\n\"Sure, just do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyle stepped on the scale, they were both hit for a suprise when the number stopped at </span></div></div>",
