        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">So, this interactive is based of the cartoon series Horseland, which ran for around 40 total episodes. (2 seasons if my math is right.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I know that the series did travel to other parts of the world, but the setting is going to take place in and around the Horseland Ranch. You can play as one of the horses, one of the Riders, or even add a human or horse OC into the story, but please don't go crazy and try to focus on getting a whole bunch of OC included. Try to keep it minimal, and please, always leave a spot open for another to be able to add their own twists to the interactive, and not have it go only one certain direction. If you do try to make a chapter's selections only go a certain direction, and not allow a reader's choice, the chapter will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings that are allowed in the interactive are the following:<br>\r\n1. Age Regression<br>\r\n2. Transformation (Can via some drink, or via unbirthed into a mare's womb.)<br>\r\n3. Nursing/Breastfeeding<br>\r\n4. Non-Fatal and clean soft vore (Oral, Anal, Unbirth, Cock, Teat) The Horses will be the only ones capable of vore. So no humans or other animals being able to vore.<br>\r\n5. Same Species Sex (No Beastiality. I know Unbirth and Cock Vore can be seen as sex, but they are not in this story.)<br>\r\n6. Adding your own OC into the story. Be it horse or human.<br>\r\n7. Putting yourself in the story. Be it horse or human<br>\r\n8. Diapers<br>\r\n9. An anthro storyline where the horse characters are anthro.<br>\r\n10. Lesbian Couples.<br>\r\n11. Straight Couples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings not allowed in the interactive are the following:<br>\r\n1. Fatal Vore of characters.<br>\r\n2. Death/Killing of characters<br>\r\n3. Hermaphrodites (Don't try and use transformation in the womb to get around this.)<br>\r\n4. Gay Male Couples. (Don't have a character transform to get a gay male couple.)<br>\r\n5. Human's being able to vore.<br>\r\n6. Other Animal Characters other than horses being able to vore.<br>\r\n7. Absorption in the cock, stomach, teats or womb. (This is seen as a form of death.)<br>\r\n8. Digestion of the characters.<br>\r\n9. Scat.<br>\r\n10. Watersports.<br>\r\n11. Physical or mental Abuse of any of the characters, horse or human.<br>\r\n12.Cuntboys. (Males with a pussy and womb.)<br>\r\n13. Cockgirls (Females with a penis and testicles.)<br>\r\n14. Ending the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules may change in the future. If you have any questions, or are curious about a subject not listed in the rules, feel free to email me on site, and I will answer you questions to the best of my abilities. Anyone who violates the rules the first time, will have their chapter deleted. Do so a second time, not only will I delete it, but I will ban you from the interactive. And do not email me to ask to be exempt from the rules I have set. The rules are there for a reason. If you want to have such chapters that go against my rules, then I suggest you create your own interactive story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun with the interactive story.</td>",
