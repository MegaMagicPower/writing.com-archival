As I leaned back in my chair I decide to surf for a while before going to bed. <br>\r\nA few moments past before I could think of what to do. I had always had a fascination with twins, I even thought that it was possible that I had a twin somewhere, or at least someone who looked similar to myself.<br>\r\nI typed the word 'twin' in the search window on my screen, wondering if there was a site that specialized in locating twins. If I had a twin was it possible that he was looking for me. <br>\r\nWhen the listings came up it was almost endless, so I decided to refine my search. I then typed in 'searching for my twin'. There had to be a site somewhere that matched people with a lost sibling. To my surprise this list contained only five entries. After reading the first four descriptions I began to feel I was possibly the only person who wanted to know if they had a twin.<br>\r\nThe fifth entry seemed almost to good to be true, so I clicked on the link and waited for the sites home page to come up.<br>\r\nAfter reading the disclaimer for'Search Twins.com' I found them to be exactly what I was looking for, they almost guaranteed results.After reading several testimonies from satisfied users and even from some who a matches were not found, I thought that I would give it a shot after all it didn't cost anything. I began answering the questionnaire that would begin my search.<br>\r\nThey seemed like basic questions; name, location, sex, age, height weight and e-mail address. I clicked the submit button once i was finished. A window then opened that asked if I had a picture of myself that I could submit for comparison. I clicked yes and was asked to locate and click submit when done.<br>\r\nI located the most recent photo I had, taken at my nephew's birthday only two weeks ago. after submitting my photo I was asked if I was looking for a specific individual or a close look-a-like. I clicked look-a-like and the screen went blank and a task bar appeared in the center of the screen. the message above the bar said 'processing photo'.<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the bar disappeared and the message was replaced with '1 match found'. The screen went blank and image began to download. The downloading seemed to take forever so I got up from my desk, stretched and went into the bathroom. <br>\r\nWhen I returned I found...  </span></div></div>",

It was weird looking at my own reflection knowing that it wasn't me. Under the image was the name \"James\" followed by his age, height, weight and location.<br>\r\nJames was less than a year younger than I and at 5'10\" only a inch taller. He lived in Tulsa, Okla. almost half a country away from my suburban Philadelphia, Pa. home. Oddly his weight was left blank.<br>\r\nThe similarities between this James and myself were so shocking that I clicked 'continue' in the box that asked 'search again or continue'. <br>\r\nI was then asked to submit a photo of myself that would be forwarded to James. I quickly located the most recent image of myself taken a week earlier at my nephews birthday party.<br>\r\nAfter submitting my photo the site said 'Notification Sent.--Reply will come from ----JAMES--. No Guarantees or promises of reply are made by SearchTwins.com.'<br>\r\nEven though I was thrilled at find a twin so quickly I found this disclaimed disappointing because it meant that I might never hear from James.<br>\r\nThe next day I found myself fantasizing what it would be like to meet James, introduce him to friends and family. I couldn't wait to get home and check my e-mails.<br>\r\nWhen I got home I found.... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I couldn't understand why someone would post their profile if they had no intentions of responding to a match. I wondered though if the situation were reversed would I delay in responding. <br>\r\nI was still excited about the prospect of finding someone who looked like me that I fantasized about our meeting. I thought about how I would introduced him to my friends and family and how they would react. Sometimes I thought they would get along fine, other times the might hate each other. But I never considered that he and myself wouldn't be friends. How couldn't we since we looked so much alike.<br>\r\nIt had been a long afternoon since we short staffed at the store. This usually means more impatient and rude customers. I got home and began to prepare my dinner when the phone rang.<br>\r\nIt was probably a telemarketer, I thought.

I...\"<br>\r\n I dropped the pan that I had on to the table. James Kent that was the name of my twin. I ran from the kitchen into the living room and picked up the phone.<br>\r\n \"I received your picture from Search Twin.com.\" he was saying.<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" I said as I picked up the receiver.<br>\r\nThere was an awkward moment of silence, then James said, \"Is this Robbie Best?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but the names Robert. I thought that you were to e-mail me?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"I was,\" he said. \"this just seemed a better way for our first contact.\"<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" I said, \"I have so many questions, I don't know where to begin.\"<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" he said in a very deep southern drawl. \"I'll e-mail mine, if y'all do the same.\"<br>\r\nI agreed then he gave me his e-mail address.<br>\r\n\"So, What'cha all doin'.\" he asked sounding like an old friend.<br>\r\n\"I just got home and was making my dinner.\" I told him.<br>\r\nSuddenly he changed and it felt like he was hurrying me off the phone.\"I'll just hang up and let y'all eat.

('funny question to ask'I thought.)<br>\r\n\t\tI had been rather athletic, but lately I've spent more time online than \t\tworking out. Still rather trim for my age.<br>\r\n\t9) What were my favorite foods?<br>\r\n\t\tAnything not healthy I confessed.

Lose weight, yes. Seems everyone i know is either exercising or dieting.<br>\r\nThe following day I was more observant of people around me. I noticed many guys with a slight bulge to a full fledge belly. <br>\r\nWhen I got home I turned on my computer and readied myself to write James back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, <br>\r\nI'm sorry your girlfriend tossed you out. I hope things work out so you can see your son.<br>\r\nI got to ask, I never knew someone who wanted to gain weight so,....<br>\r\nhow long have you been gaining?<br>\r\nWhy did you start? How is this Joey involved?<br>\r\nI'm not sure I understand but I don't think it should come between us (except maybe during a handshake or hug).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued to develop our relationship online. James was so proud of his son, that I received  a picture of him at least once a week. A month or so into our growing friendship I sent Chad, James's son a toy truck and an outfit signing the card Uncle Rob.<br>\r\nI fell into calling James \"Jim\", but he kept calling me Robbie. I repeatedly told him I preferred Robert or Rob, but he continued with the Robbie. He explained once that he called all his buddies like that, everyone was either Bill, Bobby or Joey in his area of Tulsa.<br>\r\nSix months after his girlfriend tossed him out Jim was still staying with Joe. Jim sent me a picture of Joe and himself and I had to admit that Joe's belly was impressive. Jim must have mentioned my remarks to Joe because I soon received a e-mail from Joe asking if I was considering gaining. He said he was curious if he could have the same results with me that he had had with Jim.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a big beer bellied guy standing with one hand on the truck and in the other a can of beer. From the pictures i received from Jim I realized that this guy was Joe. Funny that Jim didn't mention Joe was making a run all the way to the east coast. As I approached I saw that he was talking to someone in the cab.<br>\r\n I parked my car in the drive and as I exited I saw a large white tee shirted ball belly approaching from the truck. </span></div></div>",
