As the three walked to the kitchen, Maria couldn\u2019t help but think about when she met him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nduring the winter, Maria was coming home from the store after she went and bought some food when she was ambushed in an ally by some thugs with guns, demanding for her to give them the food and her money. as she was about to say no, when a boy showed up at the other end of the ally. \"what do we have here? three guys and one girl, a mugging, or is this some sorta kinky four way.\" the men looked at the boy with death stairs. \" get out of here kid, this is non of your business.\" the boy laughed at that. \"well that's really sad, cause,\" he gets into a fighting stance. \"I'm making it my business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nas the boy went running up to them, he ducked down, sliding under his legs, then spinning his body, hitting the first thug with his legs, knocking the thug down. getting up, the boy dashed tword the next thug with amazing speed, thrusting his elbow into the bottom of the second thugs jaw. as the last thug stood there, he watched as his men went down. \"nice, but try me.\" the boy stood there. \"Are you going to use that gun of yours?\" the thug shook his head. \"no.\" after dropping his gun, he ran tword the boy, who dashed at the man as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen they met, the boy launched the first hit at his face with his fist, making contact on his jaw. thinking he won. \"really,\" the boy jumped. \"how did you even beat my men when that's how had you hit?\" grabbing the boys fist. the thug threw him tword the back of the ally into the fence. as the boy fell to the ground, he landed next to Maria, who was watching the whole event. as Maria watch the boy not move, she was about to get up and take the guy down, when she felt a hand on her shoulder. \"he's mine.\" jumping up, the boy lifted his leg up to his chest and brought it down on the thugs head. \"now this is a fight!\" the thug said as his head bleed. taking his other foot, the boy placed a swift kick into the mans skull, knocking him into the wall. the thug now had a smile on his face as he trough a fist at the boys face. laughing, the boy stood back up, wiping the blood from his cheek. \"nice hit, but mines better.\" as he jumps up, his fist makes contact to thugs jaw, sending him to the ground. checking to see if he was really down, he looked to see that his eyes were going back into his head. \"Oh shit!\" running over to the girl, the boy covered her. the thug soon started to glow as a massive energy that would send any human to the ground. soon a huge wind blew into the ally as a monster came out of the mans head, teeth bared and eyes blood red. \"now this is the party.\" the boy said as he got off the girl and reached for his hip, revealing a large, black 9 mm. as the demon raged after the boy, he fired a volley of bullets at the beast, filling its chest full of lead, but the beast did not fall. soon the boy was in the demons hands. the demon was opening its mouth when another gun was drawn by the boy, this one a dark crimson color, and fired into the demons head. the shot caused the monster to drop him as he fired both guns into the beasts skull, shredding it. the monster seemed to be done, but the demon got back up and came back at him, with a fully healed head. \"fine, I do this the had way.\" holstering his guns, the boy pulled out a sword out from his back, the size of his arm. the blade looked like a wing of a dragon with a green eye in the gard. running tword the demon, he slashed a deep scarlet cut into the beasts chest. jumping back in front of the monster, he slashed upward, knocking it up into the air. going after it, the boy starts to slash and stab constantly before the demon started to fall. quickly holstering his sword, he pulls out his guns and starts unleash all of hell onto the monsters whole body, tearing it to shreds, leaving nothing but the pulp that landed on the ground and the sea of guts and blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolstering his gun, the boy turns to ask if Maria was alright. after hearing she was alright, he starts to walk off. \"wait!\" Maria yells. the boy stops. \"What\u2019s your name?\" the boy looks at her with a look that could stop a lion in its tracks. the boy was in a trench coat made of  black leather, his shirt was covered by a red buckle vest. his shoes looked like hiking boots, only they went up to his knees. on his head was long, black hair that was the shiniest she ever saw. but what caught her attention was his crimson eyes. 'the same as the monster from earlier.' the boy looked down at her. \"My name, my name is Redgarve, zsaag Redgarve.\" with that, the boy walked off, his coat flapping in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat was the day Maria met the man of her dreams. As left her home after eating, she went to town. When entering, she asked around if anyone knew where zsaag Redgarve was. Walking to the center of town, she noticed a large building, it looked kind of old. Going in she swallowed her fear and walked in, noticing that, above the door, a neon sign, it read Redgrave. Going in, she looked around, she saw that there wasn\u2019t much in the building. A pool table, a couple chairs, a drum set, a jut-box, a stair case that lead up stairs and a desk at the end of the room with a man with long black hair and two guns on his hips with crimson red eyes in the chair behind it with his feet propped up on the desk looking at her with tired eyes. \u201ccan I help you?\u201d                   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As zsaag ran through the fields, holding his carbine close to his chest,  he hoped to find shelter for the night. Getting to the bushes at the other end, zsaag crouched down, his breathing getting deeper and heavier. Looking back, he noticed that the drones were still following him. \u2018Damn, I thought that I got rid of them.\u2019 Putting his carbine on his back, he pulls around the Rossmore that he had with him. It came in handy when he was in empire, killing howlers and spider stalkers and the occasional grey jack that tried to get friendly with him. Jumping up and aiming his shot gun, zsaag thought that he could destroy the drones before they either kill him, or before they go to the Anthra and reporting his position, but there was one problem, the drones were gone. Looking all around his front, he couldn\u2019t spot the flying killers anywhere. Sweat poured from his face as he searched, only to keep tripping over his own feet. As he kept looking, he started to hear a faint humming sound, this was zsaag\u2019s new destination, \u2018got ya.\u2019 Running, zsaag got his Rossmore at the ready, the bullets eager to get out. Heading into the trees, the branches hitting his face and cutting it open, zsaag starts to get closer to humming, knowing that the drones were the source of the noise. When he got close enough, he could see the drones clearly, but one was down on the ground, and looked like it was destroyed when the other was hanging from a rope, half dead. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d looking on the ground, zsaag saw that there were humans lying dead, all of them, slaughtered. \u2018This is bad, this looks like Anthra, but not even those monsters would do something like this.\u2019 Looking for any hint of what did this, he noticed that one of the bodies was still breathing, but barley. Rush over to help him, he notices that the boy was not even twenty. \u201cHey kid, you alright?\u201d the body does not stir. \u201cDamn.\u201d Looking for any signs of Anthra, the boy in his arms began to wake. \u201cHey, you alright-\u201c  zsaag was cut off. \u201cG-G-Get out wh-while you can.\u201d Zsaag couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. \u2018What kind of hell has he been through?\u2019 before he could ask what happened, a blur went by his head. Looking for where it came from, zsaag could see a shadow in the tree. Looking down at the boy, he saw that what went past him was a piece of shrapnel that was thrown into the kids\u2019 stomach. Barley breathing, the tried to get out one last word to him in desperation. \u201cR-R-RUN FOR YOU-\u201c The boy stopped, his face frozen in fear as blood flowed from his mouth. Looking at his head, zsaag saw that another piece of metal was thrown into his skull. Looking back up at the shadow, it seemed to be laughing at the boys death, like it enjoyed it. \u201cYOU BASTERED!!!!!\u201d The figure kept laughing as it jumped down and ran into the trees for cover. Looking down at the boy who died, he could see that he was an innocent pawn in all this murder. Not able to hold it back, he let his tears flow from his eyes, his feelings taking over his mind.  \u201cRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d As he yelled, the animals in the trees ran and flew away from the noise. When he was done yelling his lungs out, he hung his head in agony. Looking back up, his face was turned to stone, it showed no emotion what so ever. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you for that.\u201d Laying the kid down, zsaag looked next to him and saw a Fareye sniper rifle. Placing both his Folsom carbine and Rossmore on his back, he slings the Fareye over his chest and grabs two 9mm and some ammo before dumping some fuel that was nearby onto the bodies of the humans, but he poured more fuel onto the boy that was killed in his arms. \u201cI promise, I\u2019ll kill that laughing prick in your name.\u201d taking out a match, he thou it onto the bodies, setting them all ablaze. \u201cAnd thanks for the rifle, I\u2019ll put it to good use.\u201d After giving them all uliagies, zsaag took one last look aat the fire and set off for the beast that killed them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking up at the building covered in snow before him, zsaag walked towered the old bus station with his Folsom M5A2 Carbine in his hands, covered in blood, and guts of point blank shots. On his back was his Rossmore shot gun and Fareye sniper rifle, all three eager and ready to kill whatever came at them. Walking up to the station door, he noticed that it was boarded up and chained shut to keep homeless out till someone buys the building. Taking out his Rossmore, zsaag put it up to the door, pulling the trigger; he blasted a round into the door, creating a new door for the station. Walking in, the first thing that noticed is that for a empty building, it was very well lighted with Anthra lighting. Taking his size thirteen boot, he placed it directly on the ten foot light, pushing it down. Not getting the results that he wanted, he decided to fire a round in the air. Waiting, he finally heard what he wanted, the growl of monsters. Loading some rounds in the Rossmore, zsaag lifted the gun up to his eye level. \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d Out of nowhere, an Anthra popped up in front of him, baring its teeth at him, only to have his head blown to bits. \u201cCome on!\u201d getting his wish, the whole nest of Anthra showed up, baring claws, teeth, guns and B.O. to back them up. Smiling, zsaag swung his Rossmore behind him and pulled out his Carbine and let hell out. Round after round, stink after stink, he made his way through to the only goal that he had at the moment. Soon after he got past the ticket counter, the Anthra pulled out the big guns. Standing before him was a howler. A beast that looked like a baby Godzilla, only was red and black, had horns on his head, and its breath was toxic to humans. The one thing that gave it a edge was the fact that it had no eyes, it see\u2019s with its tongue. And the reason that it was called a howler was of its horrible howl that it made when it found food or needed help. As zsaag faced the beast, the howler stuck its tongue out, liking the air. Turning to him, the monster let out its blood curdling howl as it ran, mouth open, at zsaag. Rolling to the side, zsaag aimed his Carbine at the monsters head and let loss on the monstrosity, shredding the things head. Thinking that he killed the howler, zsaag smiles triumphantly as he headed off to the back door when he stopped, getting a feeling that something was not right. Looking back zsaag saw that that the howler that he killed, was fixing its self, the fragments of its head, was returning back to the spots that they belong. \u2018Hmm.\u2019 putting back his Folsom and taking back out his Rossmore, zsaag went back up to the howler, his thoughts racing. \u201cYou just won\u2019t die, will you?\u201d The howler responded him with a shout of its own. \u201cWell then, come gets some!\u201d as soon as he said that, the howler went running up to him, it\u2019s green breath visible to zsaag. But he didn\u2019t move. Instead, he just stood in that one spot, his gun at his hip. \u2018Come on, hit me\u2026..\u2019 As the beast got closer, his finger slowly tightened around the trigger, his patience wearing thin. Finally, the howler reaches him, as the thing was about to close its jaws around his body, zsaag pulled the trigger, unleashed the round that was inside the Rossmore, splitting its head into pieces again. As same as before, the fragments started to go back to their original spots. Looking at the ground, zsaag noticed that one piece was under his foot. Picking it up, took out a grenade and strapped it to the skull fragment, releasing the trigger on the bomb. As the skull piece went back, he wondered if this would work. Once it was back, the howler growled at him, but in the middle of its growl, zsaag heard a small ping inside of the things head. What followed it was a explosion, busting open the howlers head form the inside. zsaag waited for the thing to regenerate, but it never did. Smiling, he took his Rossmore and reloaded it, knowing that he would need it. Taking back out his Folsom, zsaag went into the garage and looked around. Only finding papers and blood spate walls, he decided that what he was looking for wasn\u2019t hear. Just as he was about to leave, a silver blur went past his head, landing into the desk behind him. Looking at the object, zsaag saw that it was a piece of shrapnel, \u2018got ya, you little prick!\u2019  Looking at the spot from where it had been thrown, zsaag saw that it was a Anthra that had thrown it, the same one that he swore to kill. Running up the stairs, zsaag tried to get the second floor, hoping that it was still there. Upon reaching the next floor, he saw that the thing wasn\u2019t there. \u201cDamn it.\u201d Looking outside, zsaag saw that the stink was standing outside in the snow, with a smirk on its face. \u201cHe wants me to follow, he\u2019s going to wish he stayed inside.\u201d kicking the window open, he jumped down to the ground, his fall softened by the fall. Once down there, zsaag looked around for the stink. But to no avail. \u201cDamn, where\u2019d he go?\u201d after some time, zsaag finally got his answer. Listening, he could hear giant steps in the distance. Heading in the direction of the of the sound, zsaag was soon at the top of a snow covered hill, but whatever made that sound was nowhere in sight.  \u2018Now where could it have gone?\u2019 suddenly, the ground under him started to rumble and shatter under his feet. Then out of nowhere, the ground beneath him imploded outward under him. Landing on his back, zsaag looked up at the spot that he was on to find that a titan was in its spot, with the Anthra that he was looking for. A titan is a massive Anthra, over ten feet tall, huge arms and legs, with a withered fox head. In their hands is always a RPG that they sometimes use to beat their enemies to death with. As the Anthra at the top of its head shouted orders in its own language to the titan, the beast let out its RPG, firing down upon zsaag like lightning. Taking cover, zsaag opened up onto the titan with his Folsom, firing round after round at the beasts body, only to have the shots bounce back and nearly hit him. \u2018Damn, this thing just won\u2019t get hurt. Everything I throw at it just comes back.\u2019  Not wanting to do it, zsaag takes his gun and aims it directly at the titans head. Using the grenade launcher on it, he fired one single shot at the things head. What surprised him was that it did not come back at him. Instead, it exploded on the titans face, leaving a black face behind. Now knowing, zsaag let loss all of the clip that was in the rifle into the things head, jumping out of the way of oncoming rockets. Once it was down on its knees, zsaag ran up to its head, with his Rossmore in hand, and held the gun to its temple. Pulling the trigger, he unleashed both barrels into the titan\u2019s skull, killing it. Looking around the body of the titan, zsaag found no sign of the Anthra that was riding it. Looking at the top of the head, he saw what a trail of blood looked. Following it, zsaag found what he was looking for. The Anthra that he had followed to the station, but the thing wasn\u2019t jumping away, it was crawling, its legs blown away. \u201cSweet, sweet karma.\u201d  Walking up to the stink that was crawling, with his Rossmore in hand, zsaag stood above it, his gun pointed at its skull. \u201cNow how do you feel? You can\u2019t fight, can\u2019t move, just like the kid you killed.\u201d As he spoke, he slowly forced his gun into the Anthra\u2019s skull, causing it to bleed. \u201cI\u2019m going to do the same thing that you did to that kid, but before I do,\u201d he lifted his gun. \u201c Any last words.\u201d The stink didn\u2019t speak. Instead, he spat on zsaag\u2019s shoes. \u201c So be it.\u201d Putting the gun back in its skull, zsaag slowly pulled the trigger. When it was finally pulled, the Anthra\u2019s head became a dish for the snow. \u201cNow to finish this.\u201d Going back over to the titan, zsaag grabbed the gun that held and fired one rocket at the station, setting it ablaze. As he watched the fire, a man walked up next to him, with a cigar in his mouth. \u201cNice work, you did this in no less than an hour.\u201d Zsaag looked over to him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d the fat man laughed. \u201cTo offer you a prize. But first, have you heard of project stink?\u201d      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the boy lay strapped to the table, men in white looked down upon their faces covered by masks. As he struggled at his binds, he yelled and cursed the names of the men he saw. One man walked up to him, holding a syringe filled with a blue liquid. As the man neared with the needle, the boy nearly lunged at the man, only to come up short, for he still laid bind to the table.  Once the needle was in the boys arm, he slowly started to calm, his eyes, becoming half shut, barley able to see what was going on. \u201cHe\u2019s down, you can let them in now.\u201d Drifting his head over, he could see that two people came into the room. One male, one female. \u201cHe\u2019s is in a very violent state now. The only way to put him under was do what we call is \u201clife over death\u201d. He is now in a very deep sleep, but it won\u2019t last long, so I suggest that you make it brief.\u201d  The man and woman walked over to him, the women was in tears for some reason, he felt that he should help her, but his body wouldn\u2019t move. \u201cSon, if you can hear us, we want you to know that we love you and that were doing this for your safety and are own.\u201d The man said. The boy just lay there, staring up at him, wondering why this man was calling him son, yet he felt that it was right.  One of the men in white came up to the couple, gesturing them out. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Redgarve, you have to leave now, we are about to do the operation on him now.\u201d With that, the two were gone.              \u2018Wait, don\u2019t leave me here!\u2019  As the men put needles in his arms, three men came in; wearing what looked like military uniforms. \u201cDoctor Higgins, where is this new test subject that you promised me?\u201d the biggest officer said. One man looked over his shoulder to see the man. \u201cAh, general Starch, so good to see you. The boy is right here on the table.\u201d Referring to the half out boy. The general studied him for a seconded, looking over his whole being. \u201cKind of scrawny isn\u2019t it?\u201d  He asked. Higgins laughed. \u201cYes, well, the experiment will make him stronger than he looks to let you know, so you won\u2019t have worry about that.\u201d  The general still didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cWhat about his parents?\u201d the doctor laughed again. \u201cWell then we will just tell them that it didn\u2019t work and that he could still kill them.\u201d  The general nodded in agreement. \u201cProceed Doctor.\u201d Once he heard this, Higgins reached for the saw that lay on the tool table, and started to cut the boys head open. \u2018Hey, stop that! It hurts! I can still feel it!\u2019 But the boy\u2019s body didn\u2019t move, it just laid there on the table, stiffer than a rock. After Higgins stopped cutting into the boy\u2019s skull, blood flowed over the child\u2019s head, into his eyes. \u201cNow that we have cut through his skull, we may now implant the wires to his lobs.\u201d <br>\r\nHiggins was overjoyed by this. No test subject has ever made it this far. The boy looked at the doctor with half open eyes, like he was looking into his soul. \u2018What are you doing to me? What did I do?\u2019 With his lips curling back, Doctor Higgins took two wires, showing them to the boy. \u201cLook, you\u2019re the only one to make it this far and, well, live.\u201d The boy didn\u2019t reply, well, not physically. \u2018What are you talking about? What are you doing to me, it hurts!\u2019 Inserting the wires, Doctor Higgins attached them to what looked like a monitor, turning knobs and throwing switches on the control panel. Sending electric shocks to the boy\u2019s brain. \u201cThis general, will let him know that if he does something that we don\u2019t what him to do, we will send a painful shock through his system.\u201d The general was pleased with what the doctor was doing. He may very well get his weapon after all. \u201cBut,\u201d the doctor added. \u201cthis may take awhile.\u201d This displeased the general. \u201cWhy doctor?\u201d Higgins ran to the other side of the table, afraid that he was going to be hit. \u201cSince the subject has lasted this far, it may take awhile for him to submit and to alter his DNA.\u201d Starch sighed. This is not what he wanted to hear. \u201cIt better be worth the wait.\u201d And with that, Higgins went back to work.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been several months since Higgins has seen the general. His work with the boy has come a long way. As he works on the boy, general Starch came in.  \u201cHow\u2019s it coming Higgins?\u201d The doctor was delighted to see the general had stop by. \u201cCome see for yourself.\u201d Referring to the object on the table. As the general walked over to the table, he could see that the cloth that had been placed on top of him was moving up and down. A sign that he was alive. Once he reached the table, Higgins slowly removed the cloth to reveal what looked to be a corps. \u201cWhat is this Higgins? The morgue!\u201d Doctor Higgins chuckled to hearing this. \u201cNo general, this is what I have done so far.\u201d On the table, lay the body of the boy who he had taken from the Redgarves a few months back. Only there were a few things different. His skin, for one thing, was no longer a healthy tan, glowing with personality, but now a ghostly white; it looked like he was almost transparent. His finger nails were now black, and somewhat charred from Higgins experiments. The boys lips were also black now as well, sealed shut by a glue put on his lips earlier. And lastly from what the general saw, was that the boys hair, what used to be a light brown oak, was now snow white, and down to his shoulders. The way he looked was just alien to Starch. As he took one last look over the body, Starch noticed that the wrist cuffs that were supposed to hold the boy down were open. \u201cWhy are his cuffs open like that?\u201d Higgins looked down at the table and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s down, he can\u2019t hurt you.\u201d  Doctor Higgins spoke to soon, because as soon as he said that, the boy\u2019s eyes opened. Turning his head, the boy looked into the generals eyes, as if he was talking to his soul. When Starch saw the boy\u2019s eyes, he nearly broke out into a cold sweat. What he saw was not human. This child had emerald green eyes that could calm the most savage hearts, now which was replaced with deathly golden yellow eyes, and the whiteness of his eyes was now a deep black. \u201cWhy is his eyes open? And why do they look like that?\u201d Doctor Higgins looked down at the body like it was a thing and didn\u2019t matter. \u201cOh, he does that sometimes.\u201d Starch still thought that the way that his eyes were the scariest thing that he ever saw. \u201cWhy are his eyes like that? And his, well, everything?\u201d Doctor Higgins looked down at the boy and grinned. \u201cYou like? I got the idea from a show that my son watches. His eyes are like that because if you are on the battle field and you saw this young man\u2019s eyes? What would you think? That death is at your door, or you need new pants.\u201d He pointed at the boy\u2019s body. \u201cI choose this because of all the things that you can do with it. His skin is like an iron hide, and can give perfect camouflage in dust storms, snow and other scenarios. \u201cHis hair is the same thing with the camo.\u201d Looking down at his eyes, Higgins poked the blackened area. \u201cHis eyes can also see in the dark, while his ears have been strengthening to the sensitivity of a million dogs!\u201d Higgins screamed as loud as he could, afraid that no one would hear it. \u201cAnd I believe that this is my greats work yet sir!\u201d Starch took one last look at the boy before the cloth was put back over him. \u201cHow much longer till he\u2019s done?\u201d Higgins thought about this for a moment, putting all the numbers together. \u201cAbout a few more years.\u201d A lab assistant came running up to Higgins, out of breath. \u201cSir, the Redgarves are here to see you.\u201d Higgins nodded and the assistant left. \u201cTime to get rid of a problem now.\u201d At the far end of the lab, two people came in. Mr. and Mrs. Redgarve. \u201cAw, how delighted to see you both. How are you?\u201d Higgins asked.  \u201cWe really just came here to see if our son is alright now.\u201d Mr. Redgarve said, his voice deepened from the moths that his son has been here. \u201cWell, your son has shown no sign of change. I\u2019m afraid that he was a fail.\u201d Higgins tried to say without laughing. \u201cBut can we see him?\u201d Mrs. Redgarve Higgins thought about this for no longer than a split second. \u201cNo.\u201d This angered Mr. Redgarve. \u201cWhy!?\u201d Higgins let out his laugh, no longer able to hold it in. \u201cBecause he is no longer your son.\u201d This made Mrs. Redgarve furious not able to see her child. \u201cWHERE IS HE YOU WORM!!!?\u201d Now the good doctor was scared, but then he got a really great idea. \u201cWell, if you want to see him, then come to the table\u2026\u201d Higgins was eager to see what would happen. As Mr. Redgarve headed over to the table, he could see the cloth on it rise and fall, thinking that it was his son. When he reached the table, Mr. Redgarve could just barely make out what was under the cloth. Taking it off, Mr. Redgarve saw what looked like a dead albino. \u201cWhat kind of sick joke is this? Where is he?\u201d Doctor Higgins couldn\u2019t help but smile, this was going better than he could predict. \u201cThis is your son. We had to change him up to make the, um, process to work right.\u201d Mr. Redgarve had heard enough. Tightening his fists, he ran over to Higgins, fist ready to strike, only to be cut short by his wife, who had her hands balled up, and egger to tear his face off.  Knocking Higgins onto his back, Mrs. Redgarve began to punch furiously at his face, leaving bloody pools all over. Higgins was now scared for his life, it looked like it was going to end for him. But he had an idea. \u201cYont, wake up, I need you.\u201d On the table, the boy that laid there was now standing up, looking at the woman on the doctor. \u201cGet her off me!\u201d When Higgins looked back at the table, he could see that the child was no longer on the table. Looking back at Mrs. Redgarve, he saw the boy, standing over her. Lifting her by the waist, the boy took her away from the bruised doctor. Setting her down on the floor, the boy looked down upon her, wondering why she looked familiar. \u201cKill them.\u201d Higgins said, his face, covered in purple. The boy stood there, his golden globes staring off into Mrs. Redgarves eyes. \u201cI said kill them now!\u201dBut the boy did not move. He felt as if she was something to him. \u201cTony, it\u2019s me, your mother. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d \u2018I know you, but, who are you? You say that you\u2019re my mother, but are you?\u2019 As he reached his hand out to her, Mr. Redgarve could see Higgins reaching for a button. \u201cHey, stop!\u201d but he was too late. Higgins activated the electric nodes in his brain, sending a 5000 volt shock through his body. As he screamed in pain, Mr. Redgarve ran over to Higgins, lunging at him, knocking him down. The remote that held the boy to Higgins, was dropped, and skidded across the floor. Mr. Redgarve saw an opening and dove for the remote, hopping to turn the tide, only to be stopped by the albino boy, whose foot was crushing his hand. \u201cNow this is more like it,\u201d Higgins laughed. \u201cNow, let\u2019s try this again, kill him.\u201d Mr. Redgarve looked up in the boys eyes, to see nothing. No sadness, no anger, only fear. Lifting Mr. Redgarve up by his throat, the boy slowly tightened his grip, his black nails into Mr. Redgarves neck, blood started to flow. The albino, throwing his prey, began to smile. Walking over to where Mr. Redgarve fell, he could see where his fingers were, the blood print of his hand stained Mr. Redgarves neck. For some reason, this made the boy even happier. Standing over the old man\u2019s limp body, the boy raised his foot over Mr. Redgarve head. As he looked down at his terrified face, a twisted grin appeared on the boys face, as if he was enjoying this. The last thing that Mr. Redgarve saw was his son\u2019s foot, and then, blackness. Mrs. Redgarve just sat there, watching her former son, wiping the blood off his shoe. Soon, the boy looked over at her, with the same look in his eyes as before. As he walked over to her, Mrs. Redgarve slowly stood up, hoping to make a bluff that would get him to stop. But it didn\u2019t work, for the boy continued to approach her, his lips curled back in a twisted smile. When he was close enough, the boy stared into her eyes, his golden globes piercing her soul. As she was about to tell him that she loved him, the boy thrusted his hand into her stomach, his hand flat and ripping her stomach open. Forcing his hand farther in, Mrs. Redgarve fell over his shoulder, her eyes blank. The boy liked how this felt. The sensation of warm blood flowing through his hands. Taking his hand out, the boy lets Mrs. Redgarve fall to the floor, her body still. As he looked over her, Higgins took the remote and activated the probes in the boys head, causing the boy to scream in pain. Soon the boy could not handle it, and feel over, submitting to the pain. \u201cThat\u2019s a good boy.\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThat was not how I wanted you to get rid of them.\u201d Starch was standing at the other side of the room, very displeased. \u201cDon\u2019t worry sir, we can have this fixed in no time.\u201d Starch was still impressed with the overall test that was, unnecessarily conducted. \u201cThe boy still has a few bugs to work out. But don\u2019t-\u201c Starch held up his hand. \u201cJust get it done.\u201d And with that, he walked away.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(this is a little guide that I did for the next story.)<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world of Sufira<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the world of Sufira, monsters and humans coexist together. One hating the other. But there is a catch, the monsters can be caught and taught how to protect and fight for you. Or to be your friend and help you. This guide is to help you understand the world you live in and live a longer life, not in a monsters belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you go out into the world, you need to know a few things. <br>\r\nOne- you need to know how to fight. If you don\u2019t know how to fight, then you can\u2019t defend yourself if a monster jumps out in front of you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTwo- you need a summon-stone. Before you head out on your own, you need to have a partner. Summon-stones are monsters that have been forced into a soul-gem by the means of magic or science. You will learn about soul-steeling later. You will learn about the way a summon works later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree- you need a scanner. There are two kinds of scanners, the hand held and the gauntlet. You will learn about scanners later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour- you need to have graduated from school. Summon-school is a mandatory for all hunters to accomplish before you can go out and look for summons. You will learn more about this later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive- you need Soul-gems. Soul-gems are round and can hold monsters in them, which become summons. You will learn more later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummon-school<br>\r\nBefore you go out and hunt your first monster, you need to have an education.  And what better place to get that then your local Summon-school. When in school, you will be taught the basics. How to fight, how to catch a monster, how the sealing of the monster works, ect. You also have basic classes, like science, gym, and English. But your main classes are to teach you about your summons that you will work for. There is one thing you need to know, the outfit that you show up in on your first day, will be your school uniform.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFighting-<br>\r\nWhen searching for a monster, you need to have the right skills and uniform. Most hunters, the ones who hunt the monsters, go with basic hunting gear. Basic hunting gear comes equipped with a tracer that locks on to a monster and tracks it with a push of a button. The basic gear is light weight and allows mobility. But most common gear is heavy and limits mobility, but has great defense. But the younger hunter often want to look good and \u2018fly\u2019, so they wear light weight cloths. When fighting a summon, most people use a sword, to get the feeling that their ancestors had. But now a day, hunters use a gun to take down a monster. But bullets can\u2019t always go through a scaly or leathery hide. So a sword has to be kept with you when hunting, for safety reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul-gem- <br>\r\nA soul gem is a stone that is basically an empty shell till a monster becomes sealed inside.  When a monster is sealed away, it becomes a summon. The way that a Soul-gem captures a monster, is by two ways. The first way is by magic. The way that the magic works is by reciting the steal-spell. The seconded way is by Science. The way that this is done by the scanner gauntlet. You will learn about this later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummon-stone-<br>\r\nThe Summon-stone, the thing of mysteries. A summon-stone holds only one summon at a time. When you use a summon, you must call it out, by lifting it above your head and calling out the summons name. Summon-stones come in a variety of colors-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRed<br>\r\n\tBlue<br>\r\n\tGreen<br>\r\n\tGold<br>\r\n\tBlack<br>\r\n\tWhite<br>\r\n\tPink<br>\r\n\t\tRed-the beginner level of a summon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\tBlue-the novice level of a summon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\tGreen-the intermediate level of a summon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\tGold-the master level of a summon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are special summons in the world of Sufira. The colors of these summonses are black, white, and pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBlack-black summon-stones are dark monsters that have been sealed away by the forces of nature or by holy monsters. It is very rare to find a dark monster not in its stone form. When approaching a dark monster, use caution, for they are known to be very deadly. <br>\r\n\tWhite- White summon-stones are holy monsters. Holy monsters are sent to protect humans and normal monsters from dark monsters. If a dark monster bites a human or a monster, then it becomes a dark monster as well. Holy monsters are extremely rare to find in stone form. But you can find them at churches and others sacred grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for the most dangerous summon of all. <br>\r\n\tPink- the pink summon-stone is common and very dangerous to have. Pink summons are known as; \u2018Mother-stones\u2019. Mother-stones are monsters that are all female and act like a mother. Mother-stones have only a few moods, which you will learn about later, the moods are: loving, caring, protective, forcing, needing, and wanting. These moods are only for mother-stones. If a mother-stone has been summoned, the stone will vanish and the summon cannot be sent back. If you ever come across a Mother-stone, you must run. You are not allowed to kill a Mother-stone, for they are more advanced than a normal summon. Mother-stones can break free of the holds of their stones and become people, have kids, and make families, even with humans. When the first Mother-stones became free and made families, they went to court and fought for their rights. When they won they made it clear to take any Mother-stones they find to the nearest summon fillers so it can be given to the Mother-stone realists. You are not to kill any Mother-stone you find, for it is against the law.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nThere are a few summonses that are called \u2018The forgivers\u2019. The forgivers are the gods of the summons. There are only three forgivers, they come from the darkness, the light, and Mother-stones. The forgivers,(in the same order.) are chaos, cosmos, and the flower spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummonses have three forms. Attack, rest, and chibi. When they are in attack, they are ready for a battle. Rest is when they are in the stone. And chibi is when they are out and about.<br>\r\nChibi is a smaller form of a summon. It is a, what some say, cuter form of a summon.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMoods- moods are the way that a summon acts. There are several moods to summons; happy, energetic, feisty, sleepy, sad, anger, hatred, guilt, protective, loving, evil and good.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere are some cases that a Mother-stone has a child. When a Mother-stone has a child with a human, the child is half monster and half human, meaning that the child can be caught and turned in to a summon. If you are one of those kids, then be very careful who you tell who you are. For you may be double crossed and sucked into a Soul-gem. Kids who are the offspring of a Mother-stone and a human have powers and can do amazing things. Scientist have tried to give people the powers of summons, but failed to do so without a Mother-stone. And they have tried to dissect the children of Mother-stones to get the DNA of the summons to make the dream possible. If you are caught, this may happen to you.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWell, that\u2019s about it. Other than what I just told you, you are on your own for now.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>School is never fun, especially for the new kid. For a new kid, the school is boot camp. You don\u2019t know anyone, you can\u2019t find your classes, you don\u2019t know your teachers, and you don\u2019t even know where the bathrooms are. My name is Zane, and this is how my day started, and ended. A nightmare, and now a dream come true. I started the year with no friends, and ended up with a friend for life. <br>\r\nAs I walked up to the school, I could smell the fear and shame radiate off the evil building, somewhere on the other side of school, I could hear a child scream for his life. This was the same way that every school looks like, frightening and bone chilling. As I walk in, I could smell death and old people the moment I open the doors. Going up to the office, I could see the lady behind the desk, working on her nails. Without looking up, she handed me a slip of paper. To my surprise, it had my name on it. <br>\r\n\u201cYour first class is in five minutes. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d This woman said this without looking up from her nails. <br>\r\nI shuddered the moment that I got away. I still wonder how she knew who I was, or if it was by a stroke of luck. As I walk down the hall, I could see that all the kids were paying no mind to me as I walk down to class. Suddenly, the bell rings, and the halls were empty in 0.5 seconds, leaving me alone. <br>\r\nI found my class, after I wondered around the school for hours (Actually, about 15 minutes.). When I walked in the door, the teacher stopped what he was doing and looked over at me with his dark green eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cAre you Zane?\u201d He said, rather than asking. I nodded, for fear had stolen my voice.<br>\r\n\u201cCome over here.\u201d He told me to stand next to him; I did as I was told, for I knew that if I didn\u2019t, he may have done something. <br>\r\n\u201cClass, we have a new student today, please welcome, Zane,\u201d The teacher stopped, and I knew why.<br>\r\n\u201cKnights.\u201d <br>\r\nThe teacher looked down at me, with his emotionless face. \u201cThank you.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n\u201cZane is all the way from Rome, and is new here, so you are to make him feel comfortable.\u201d He looked over to a group of boys. \u201cNo cakes like last time either. We don\u2019t want another law suit again.\u201d The group of boys laughed.  <br>\r\nThe teacher sighed and turned back to me. \u201cMy name is Mr. Raven, I will be your history teacher for first hour.\u201d He handed me a sheet of paper. \u201cYou may sit in any seat that is not taken. And do hurry.\u201d <br>\r\nTaking my seat, I looked at the sheet that he had given me. I had information on the Aztecs and some Spanish guy. I had no clue what they were doing. <br>\r\n\u201cNeed some help?\u201d The girls next to me asked. I looked up to meet he gaze, to be met with a big pair of dark brown eyes. \u201cMy names Julie.\u201d  She held out her hand. \u201cMay I see your paper?\u201d I handed my sheet to her. As she took it, I could smell her sweet perfume. As she looked it over, I couldn\u2019t help but look her over as well. Julie looked about 5\u20197, black hair with streaks of purple, and wore dark clothing and jeans. I thought she was beautiful, but I would never tell her that. Not yet anyway. <br>\r\n\u201cThis is about when Cortez concord the Aztecs.\u201d  Said Julie as she handed me back the paper.  \u201cMay I see your schedule?\u201d complying, I reach into my  backpack and take out my schedule, giving it to her. Julie looks it over and gives it back to me. \u201cWe have all the same classes. So I can show you where your classes are.\u201d <br>\r\nJulie lead me all over the school, she even paid for my lunch. After school, she took me to her home, which wasn\u2019t that far from my house. When we got to her house, I found my parents visiting with Julie\u2019s family. Things were pretty quiet for the most part for the rest of the night, my dad made friends with Julie\u2019s dad really fast and my mother and Julie\u2019s became rivals in almost everything, I met Julie\u2019s sister, Crystal. When Julie introduced me to her, I overheard her say that I\u2019m cute, which made Julie punch her. I\u2019m not the best looking guy, my silver hair and my dark clothes usually tend to make people stay away. But maybe this might happen here. <br>\r\nAfter dinner, Julie\u2019s parents suggested that I stay over at her house for the night, so she can show me around town. After a quick tour, I and Julie get ready for bed. As I lie in bed, I started to smell something coming from Julie\u2019s room. Ignoring it, I went back to bed. <br>\r\nThe next morning, I felt very sore for some odd reason, like I lifted rocks all day. Trying to stand, I fell forward on my face, trying to stand again, I got the hang of it, but it felt wrong for some reason. Looking around, I noticed that the room was a lot larger than what I remember. Suddenly, the door opened, to reveal Julie\u2019s mom, Maria Sanders. <br>\r\n\u201cZane, are you up? It\u2019s time for breakfast.\u201d Maria looked around for me but didn\u2019t find me. <br>\r\n\u201cDown here Mrs. Sanders.\u201d She looked down, for a minute she didn\u2019t see me. But when she did, she screamed for Julie. When Julie got in the room, she asked Maria what was wrong; all she got was her mother pointing down at me. When Julie saw me, she screamed. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d <br>\r\nMaria went over to the desk that was in the room and took the mirror off it and placed it in front of me. What I saw shocked me. My body was no longer human, but the body of a cat, a small house cat. <br>\r\n\u201cWha-what happened to me?!\u201d I tried to stand on my hind legs, but ended up falling over, getting a giggle out of the two girls above him.<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny you guys!\u201d I yelled at them. They stopped laughing, a giggle escaped every now and then. The noise from Julie and her mom combined lead Crystal to leave her room and see what was so funny. When she saw me, she immediately bent down and picked me up and started to coo and aw me.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do it again Julie?\u201d Crystal asked, looking over to her sister. Julie nodded. <br>\r\n\u201cIt may have been what I was working on last night.\u201d Before Julie could say another thing, an alarm went off thought the house. This made the girls go nuts.<br>\r\n\u201cWere late for school!\u201d Crystal yelled, nearly breaking my small eardrums. Julie and crystal scrambled all over the house, getting on cloths, eating food, and grabbing backpacks before Julie finally realized something important.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Zane? He can\u2019t go to school as a cat!\u201d This became a problem that happened naturally later in my life. Then Maria smiled.<br>\r\n\u201cHe will just have to stay here till Julie can fix this.\u201d The three of us looked at Maria with a puzzled look.<br>\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t go like how he is, so he can stay here. He can keep me company.\u201d Crystal and Julie looked at each other and smiled.<br>\r\n\u201cThat could work.\u201d Said Julie. So with it decided, the girls went to school, leaving me with Maria all day. <br>\r\nI didn\u2019t really go outside of the room for most of the day. I spent most of the time trying to get the hang of walking, and learned that cats can\u2019t use toilets. So Maria put in a cat box for me, I don\u2019t even know why they had one in the first place. At some point during the day, I eventually went out the door and into the living room, to see what Maria was doing. She was sitting on the couch folding cloths while watching the news. As I walked over, I noticed that Maria hadn\u2019t seen me yet, so I decided to surprise her. Jumping up, I walked up to her; she was still focused on the T.V. and the cloths in front of her.<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d Maria jumped when she heard me, for I think that she forgot that I was here. <br>\r\n\u201cZane, I forgot you were here,\u201d I knew it.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get you something?\u201d after she said that, my very small stomach roared as if on cue.  <br>\r\n\u201cMaybe something to eat?\u201d she said, trying not to laugh. This made me blush, or I would have if I didn\u2019t have fur on my face. Maria got up and went into the kitchen, with me following. Getting on the table, I watched her take out a can of tuna and empty it onto a plate, and place it in front of me. As soon as it was on the table, I heard my belly growl for the food. I bent down and devoured the food, satisfying my belly\u2019s hunger.<br>\r\nWhen she finished cleaning the plate, the two of us went back to the living room. As she folded cloths, I lay beside her, and watched her fold. When she was done, she lifted me up and placed me on her lap. I was about say something when she started petting me, which, for some reason, felt really good. As I was being petted, I could feel sleep take over, I decided not to fight it and went to sleep. It wasn\u2019t long before I awoke to Julie and Crystal standing over me, smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how was your day?\u201d They asked at the same time. I simply nodded, for there was nothing to say. <br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Julie started, before she lifted me up to her face. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to get you back to your human form Zane.\u201d <br>\r\nTaking me up to her room, Julie placed me on her bed, and take out a pot from her closet, setting it on the floor. Next she filled the pot with strange colored water that kind of smelled like burnt hair. She then reached over behind her and grabbed a vile of white powder and sprinkled a small amount of it into the liquid. <br>\r\n\u201cKay, get in.\u201d She said, getting out a pointed hat and a black cloak. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked her. She got that annoyed look that only woman can do, I\u2019ve seen my mother do it many times.<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me, in the pot, unless you want to stay a cat.\u201d She had a stick in her hand that looked like it had been burnt at the tip. Jumping down, I made my way over to the vat of goop, only to be snatched up by Julie and dumped in, nearly drowning. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that for? You could have killed me!\u201d I snapped at her, which only got her laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re mad. Maybe I should keep you.\u201d Said Julie as she reached out to lift me out of the pot. <br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed as I ducked away from her hands. <br>\r\n\u201cThen let me finish.\u201d Keeping quiet, I let her finish what she was doing, which put a funny leaf on my head. After she did that, she took a stance and started to mumble something under her breath in Latin. Before she could finish, Crystal burst into the room, with my clothes in her arms. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, Jules, here\u2019s his clothes.\u201d She placed them on her bed. \u201cJust so things don\u2019t get weird.\u201d Crystal looked down at me and giggled. \u201cA shame he won\u2019t stay in this form. I really wanted a cat.\u201d And then she walked out the room. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, if there are no more interruptions, I would like to finish my spell.\u201d Said Julie complaining. That was when I put it together. She was a witch. That smell that I got came from this pot. <br>\r\nReturning where she left off, she continued speaking in Latin for about a good long five minutes when she pointed the stick at my face. When she did, I felt a small tingle form in my nose, causing me to sneeze into the water, and for some reason, a cloud of dust shot up and out of the pot, covering my tiny body. When the dust cleared, my line of sight was higher than what it was before. Looking down, I could see my human hands and legs again. But one thing was wrong, I still needed my clothes. Looking around, I couldn\u2019t find Julie anywhere.<br>\r\n\u201cGet dressed pleased!\u201d I heard her say form the bathroom. I did as I was told and got my cloths all on in less than a minute. Once all my clothes were on, Julie came out of the bathroom, her face very red. <br>\r\n\u201cAre you clothed?\u201d She asked without looking up. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, you can look up now.\u201d When she did, I could tell that she was embarrassed about almost seeing me without my clothes. I laughed, which made her very mad.<br>\r\n \u201cYou know I could have left you furry ya\u2019 know!\u201d Julie was very upset at me for laughing at her. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry, just thought it was funny that you\u2019re turning red.\u201d Before she could answer, Maria called from downstairs. <br>\r\n\u201cZane, your mom here!\u201d This interruption left both Julie and me redder than turnips. <br>\r\n\u201cUm, here.\u201d Julie handed me a folder with papers inside it.<br>\r\n\u201cThere what we covered in are classes. You\u2019ll need to make up a quiz in math. And Mr. Raven needs you to take a test to see how much you know on Monday.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, tomorrow is Saturday.\u201d  With that, I left her house. When I got home, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what happened in Julie\u2019s room. I found out that she\u2019s a witch, and that she might like me. That was a lot to take in at the time, my heart was pumping fast. Julie was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever set my eyes on, and she\u2019s the first that hasn\u2019t gotten scared of him, she was a witch, she could probably could\u2019ve have killed me if she ever gotten mad at me, yet she got mad the whole time that I was in her room, and I lived. Maybe Julie is the one for me. Suddenly the phone downstairs rang.<br>\r\n\u201cZane,\u201d My mother called. \u201cIt\u2019s for you; it\u2019s your new friend. She sounds nervous.\u201d Going down stairs, I took the phone from my mom. <br>\r\n\u201cYell\u2019lo?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cZane?\u201d Julie asked. Mom was right, she did sound nervous. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, what\u2019cha wants Jules? Something wrong?\u201d I heard a sigh on her side of the phone.<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to talk to you about, can you meet me tomorrow?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure. Where do you want to meet?\u201d I didn\u2019t get a reply right away.<br>\r\n\u201cBy the lake, where the park is. Can we meet there?\u201d She sounded scared now.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I can meet you there.\u201d <br>\r\n\tThat night was the longest night I had ever to wait through. I was somewhat excited and frightened about seeing her. What if see was going to erase my memory? Or do something worse to me? The power of fear was not in control, nor was any other emotion in my body. It was something else, something I couldn\u2019t understand. Eventually, I fell asleep, but dreamt about me and Julie, but we didn\u2019t look the way we do now, we, looked older. <br>\r\nThe next day, Julie waited at the lake for me like she said she would. I decided to drive there in my car, my piece of crap car. My car was a Mazda, one of the first Mazda\u2019s, so I can call it crap. Anyway, getting out, I made way over to Julie, who was wearing a white dress with blue flowers on it with her hair pulled back into a ponytail. <br>\r\n\u201cZane, I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We spent months packing all are things into boxes and loading them into trucks. It was a lot of work, and my sister Hailey didn\u2019t really do much to help me and mom a whole lot either. <br>\r\nOh, I\u2019m sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Tony, I\u2019m Sixteen and I live with my Thirty five year old mother and thirteen year old sister. My father divorced my mom when I was only six and my mother was pregnant with Hailey. This move is the biggest thing mom has ever done since the divorce. So she\u2019s really happy, which makes me happy. I really hate to see girls cry. <br>\r\nThe house we we\u2019re going to move into was a large old house that looked like it could be in a horror movie. She said that it was a great home, and that it was a bit of a fixer upper. Yah, right. This house is a piece crap! There is no heating in the living room, and there is no lighting in it. The bedrooms have only two temperatures; summer day, or winter night during a full moon. So it\u2019s best not to use the heating in the rooms. When we arrived at the house that day, there was the original owner waiting for us at the door. He was an old gent that has seen some things in his years. <br>\r\n\u201cSo good to see you all.\u201d He said. The man handed mom some keys. \u201cHere is the keys to the house, treat her well.\u201d Before we could ask him any questions that we had, he ran off down the road, shouting with glee. <br>\r\n\u201cThat was odd.\u201d I said, scratching my medium length black hair. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd very creepy in a strange way.\u201d Hailey added, texting her friend. Mom didn\u2019t really care. She was still very excited about getting the house and for a very cheap price.  <br>\r\n\u201cI just glad that the house is finally ours.\u201d Her smile then became a puzzled look. \u201cI still wonder why he gave for free though.\u201d But instead of questioning it, she just shrugged it off.  Unloading the truck, with no help from Hailey, we managed to get all of our stuff, inside the house. I had to help mom with her things into her room which was on the first floor. She didn\u2019t have a whole lot of things. She never really kept much for herself. Hailey on the other hand, had over a million things that were hers. She had things from when she was three still. Mom told me to help her take her stuff into her room which was near the downstairs bathroom. The sad part was Hailey didn\u2019t help me take her stuff into her room. I didn\u2019t mind helping, I just wish that she would help.<br>\r\nOnce their stuff was in their rooms, and the things that go in the other far corners of the house were out in their spots, it was my turn to take my stuff to my room, which was on the second floor. Having to go up three flights of stairs, I finally reached my room. Going inside for the first time, I could see why mom gave me the room. Going to the closet to put my things away for now, I noticed a mirror inside on the door. It looked very old and somewhat modern. It had a very Victorian border, yet looked like a full body mirror you\u2019d find in the bathroom. Not giving it a second thought, I quickly put my things that were going to stay in the closet and shut the door. The only problem was that it wouldn\u2019t shut. <br>\r\n\u2018It\u2019s still new, you can fix it later.\u2019 Heading into the bathroom, I decided to take a shower, for moving all the boxes was very tiring work. No thanks to Hailey. While I grabbed some new clothes from one of the boxes in the closet, I felt something odd. It was as if someone was watching me. Turning around, I couldn\u2019t see anyone at all. The only things that were in here was the huge desk and bed that was left behind. Shrugging it off, I went into the bathroom and started the shower. Stripping, I jumped in and cleaned off all of the work that I put in today. Ever since dad left mom, forcibly, not willingly, I have taken the role as man of the house. Doing all the things that dad did. Fixing things, painting, and all that fun stuff. <br>\r\nAfter I was done and dried off, I headed out to put on my clean clothes when I felt that strange presence again that I felt earlier. Looking around, I saw no one in the room but me. Taking off my towel to get dressed, I heard a female laugh coming from the closet. Looking inside, I saw no one in it. I was used to weird things, but this was a bit much.  Later that night, after I helped mom set up the living room, still without the help of the all-mighty Hailey; I retired to sleep early, for I had to hook up Hailey\u2019s stereo. <br>\r\n Up in my room, I turned off the main light and turned on the lamp that was beside my new bed. It too looked a bit Victorian like the mirror. Striping down to my boxers, I climbed into bed and turned off the light. As I lay in bed, I could still feel like someone was watching me. Rolling over, I was faced to face with the mirror on the closet door. Looking into it, I saw something strange; I saw that I wasn\u2019t in it. I didn\u2019t see my face looking back at me. But I did see a lump sleeping in the bed in the mirror. Getting out of bed, I jumped over to the mirror and took a closer look. I didn\u2019t show up in it, no matter how close I got to it. Too tired to really care, I gave up and headed back to bed when someone spoke. <br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d The voice came from the mirror. Turning around, I saw that the form in the bed was sitting up and looking right at me. Taking a quick glance at my bed, I could see that there was nothing in it. <br>\r\n\u201cThere no one in the bed.\u201d  The girl in the mirror got out of the bed and what seemed like it, walked up to the mirror. This girl didn\u2019t look all that bad to me. She had hair that went down her back that was a very dark blonde color. Her skin looked very smooth, and her eyes were a very deep blue. She looked very cute.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you.\u201d I jumped when she said that. How did she know?<br>\r\n\u201cI read your mind.\u201d Knowing this now, I decided that asking questions was a good idea.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d The girl tilted her head to the side and gave me a crocked frown. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a girl. What the hell am I suppose to be? Bugs bunny?\u201d That set me off. <br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that! When I said \u2018What are you\u2019, I was talking about the fact that you\u2019re in mirror and I can\u2019t see myself!\u201d The girl looked around her room, which looked like mine in every way, and had a puzzled look on her face.  <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know that. All I know is that I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d She tried to push on the mirror, only to no avail. \u201cI can\u2019t really get out.\u201d Taking another look over her, she was wearing a long shirt that went past her knees. She looked so small with it on.<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m not small! I\u2019m 5\u20197!\u201d That was getting annoying really fast.<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you reading my mind?\u201d The girl shrugged.<br>\r\n\u201cI duh know. Your mouth doesn\u2019t move, yet it\u2019s like you\u2019re still talking, very loudly.\u201d That explains part of it. <br>\r\n\u201cCan I hear your thoughts?\u201d She just stood there, not saying anything for about five minutes. <br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d she asked. I shook my head for a no, which brought her to smile. \u201cThen I don\u2019t think that it works for you.\u201d Wonderful, I\u2019m stuck with a girl that can hear my thoughts.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t like it either. You think I like being stuck in a mirror having to technically share a room.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem happy. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re going to stay, can I at least get your name?\u201d I asked, wanting to end this conversation. The girl glared at me with evil eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cYa know, it\u2019s customary for the man to say his name first.\u201d I sighed and shook my head. <br>\r\n\u201cTony Vladimore.\u201d I was waiting for her to tell me her name, but instead, she went over to the bed and went back to sleep. Great, that was really nice. Getting back in bed, I went back to sleep. As I lay in bed, the girl said something. <br>\r\n\u201cTonya.\u201d And she said nothing else after that. Well, at least I know her name.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all you get to know.\u201d<br>\r\nThe next day, I had a very rude awakening. <br>\r\n\u201cHey! Get up!\u201d Getting up, I looked over at my door to see that it was still closed. \u201cIt\u2019s about time, thought you were never going to get up.\u201d That\u2019s when I remembered what happened last night. Looking over at the mirror, I saw that Tonya was real, and not a dream.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m real dumb ass.\u201d She was acting very rude toward me for some reason.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else am I supposed to do? I can\u2019t leave.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWould you just shut up?\u201d I yelled at her. I must have said it too loud, for mom came running up the stairs and knocked on my door. <br>\r\n\u201cTony, are you alright?\u201d Damn, why know? Wait, this is perfect, she can come in and see Tonya and do something about it. Letting her in, I pushed her to my closet. <br>\r\n\u201cNo mom, there\u2019s a girl in my mirror and she\u2019s really annoying!\u201d Mom looked at the mirror and then back at me. <br>\r\n\u201cHun, there\u2019s no one there but us.\u201d I was confused. Looking at the mirror, I saw the same thing as I did last night, a room like mine, with no Tony in it, not even mom. But she could see herself and me in it. <br>\r\n\u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d She asked, putting her hand on my fore head. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine mom.\u201d Sighing, mom left the room and went back down stairs.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was close!\u201d I jumped from the sudden voice. I looked back at the mirror to find Tonya hiding behind the bed.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she could see you.\u201d I said, going into the closet to get some clothes on. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, wouldn\u2019t it be weird if she found out that a girl was living in your mirror?\u201d I still think it\u2019s weird that I know it.<br>\r\n\u201cI heard that!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cStay out of my head!\u201d that got my sister to come up. <br>\r\n\u201cBro, you all right?\u201d Wow, she never asks me things like that.<br>\r\n\u201cYah sis, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d For a moment, there was silence, then the sound of feet going down the stairs.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, now my family thinks I\u2019m crazy!\u201d I felt like screaming.<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably are.\u201d I turned around to see that Tonya was pressing her fore head against the mirror. \u201cThink about it, they can\u2019t see me, only you can. That does make you sound a bit crazy.\u201d I hate to admit it, but she has a point. <br>\r\n\u201cHa! You admitted it!\u201d I scowled at her. <br>\r\n\u201cDid not!\u201d She stuck her tongue out.<br>\r\n\u201cDid too!\u201d I threw my hands up in the air and went into the bathroom.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, where you going?\u201d Tonya asked.<br>\r\n\u201cTo shower. I need to think.\u201d After leaving the room, I felt like I was finally at piece. I wanted to stay in there forever, just to feel the way the warm water rushed over my body. It felt just like when--, no, that times gone. Getting out, I headed back to the closet and grabbed some clothes out, all the while trying to keep the towel wrapped around my waist. <br>\r\n\u201cI can kind of see your, um.\u201d I looked up to see Tonya crouched down and her head tipped sideways. <br>\r\n\u201cWha, why are you trying to look!\u201d she shrugged.<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to see how well you cover up. You\u2019re very bad at it.\u201d I was getting really annoyed now with her. <br>\r\n\u201cCan you give me some privacy for a minute Tonya?\u201d Compiling, Tonya turned around and allowed me to get dressed. Every now and then I swore she was peeking. When I was done, she turned around and went over to her bed and grabbed a pile of clothes off the bed.<br>\r\n\u201cNow you need to give me some privacy.\u201d Turning around, I could hear her getting dressed. I tried not to think about it, but I couldn\u2019t really help it. \u201cHey! Stop that, it\u2019s disgusting!\u201d turning around, I saw that she was done changing and was pulling up her socks. <br>\r\n\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d I asked, still trying to be nice to her. Tonya shook her head.<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, I haven\u2019t gotten hungry at all.\u201d That might be for the better. One less mouth to feed.<br>\r\n\u201cHeard that ya know.\u201d Damn.<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went pretty normally, I hooked up the T.V., Hailey\u2019s stereo and got no thanks from her. I helped mom with the yard work, and got the living room set up along with the kitchen. After that was done, I went down to the basement to put some boxes away, when I saw that there was a sheet covering what looked like a couch. Taking it off, I was correct. It was a nice old couch that was in really great shape. Looking across from it, I saw that there was another sheet covering something else. Taking it down, I saw that the sheet was covering a huge, 55\u2019 flat screen T.V. (What? Can\u2019t a guy dream?) <br>\r\n\u201cI thought you might like this room.\u201d Turning around, I saw that mom was standing on the stairs, holding what looked like a key in her hand. \u201cI already told Hailey that the T.V. stays down here.\u201d Before I could thank her, she tossed me the key and went back upstairs. This was great. Later that night, mom told me that she was going to visit a friend for the night and was taking Hailey with her. Once they were gone, I went back down stairs and sat in my new man room and turned on the T.V. While I was down there, I felt a huge surge go through my body, it was the urge to pee. Running up the stairs, I headed for the door to get out, only to have my bladder release itself, making the front of my pants wet. Going back upstairs to my room, I saw that Tonya had just come from the bathroom. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to you fat-head?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI just pissed the front of myself, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d I wasn\u2019t in the mood to put up with her shit. Tonya looked from her bathroom and back at me. <br>\r\n\u201cCan you sit down for a sec?\u201d She asked pulling up a chair. <br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t I change first?\u201d She shook her head. Sighing, I grabbed the chair that was at my desk and sat on it informally. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI think I just found out something.\u201d Giving her a puzzled look, I sat there and waited for an answer. Tonya just sat there, looking relaxed.  For a minute or two, she didn\u2019t say anything at all. Then as I was about to get up, I felt a warmness spread all over the front of my pants. Looking down, I saw that I had pissed again. Looking over at Tonya, I could see a wet floor around her. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I asked, still amazed by what she did. Tonya just looked at me and smiled. <br>\r\nI just found out something by this little experiment.\u201d She was still grinning from ear to ear in a puddle of pee.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, that you have a sick mind?\u201d What must have been going through her mind when she thought of this? <br>\r\n\u201cI heard that! And I do not have a sick mind. What I found out is that I have complete control of your bodily functions. And I can make you piss yourself any time I want to.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019d end up pissing yourself as well dumb ass.\u201d Tonya stopped smiling and thought about this for a while. While she was thinking, I decided to get some new pants and underwear and head for the shower.  When I got out, Tonya had cleaned her floor and changed, while my floor was still soaked. Throwing my soaked clothes into the dirty laundry pile, I went to cleaning my floor, while Tonya watched from behind the mirror.<br>\r\n\u201cwhy did you do that?\u201d I asked her. She didn\u2019t answer for a second. <br>\r\n\u201cDo what? Make you piss yourself the first or second?\u201d she was getting a kick out torturing me.<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet I am! You make it to easy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStop reading my thoughts!\u201d Tonya stuck her tongue out at me.<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t fat head!\u201d She still hadn\u2019t answered my first question.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you make me, um.\u201d I didn\u2019t really want to say it.<br>\r\n\u201cPiss yourself? I don\u2019t really know.\u201d I was getting really tired of her doing that. Looking at the clock, I noticed that it was around 9:54 PM. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Tonya just stared at me as I stripped to my boxers and climbed into bed.<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s only nine, why do you want to go to bed?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause talking to you was tiring. Why do I have to give you a reason?\u201d After that, Tonya did the same thing.<br>\r\n\u201cGood night Tony.\u201d Good night Tonya. I didn\u2019t really feel like using my mouth at the moment. That is one time that her being able to hear my thoughts being a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple of weeks, Tonya made my life a hell hole. Her and I would get into fights constantly, and end with me yelling at her. That would end up bringing mom up stairs and asking what was wrong. The fact that mom and Hailey couldn\u2019t see or hear Tonya made my life even worse. Every time I tried to tell them or show them her, they would only say that they only see their reflections. That made them think that I was mentally. Mom took me to a phyciatrist a few times. They all said that I either had something inside me that I have bottled up, or that I was messed up in the head. At home, I tried to spend as little amount of time from my room. Today, I was confined in my room, for mom was told by the last guy who poked around in my head said that I needed to be isolated from people and to take these huge pills the size of my fist. Lying on my bed, I tried to think about how to get rid of Tonya, but every time I did, she would yell at me.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to take that football yet?\u201d She was referring to the blue pill on my desk.<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d  Tonya was about to say something to make me take it, but before she could, I got up and took the pill into the bathroom and flushed it. When I got back in the room, She was scolding me like a mother.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were supposed to take that.\u201d I smiled at her.<br>\r\n\u201cI did, I took it to the toilet.\u201d I could tell that she wanted to slap me, but thank god for the mirror. Going back to my bed, I could feel a strange tingling sensation all over my body. Looking back at Tonya, I saw that her eyes were shut and really concentrating. When she opened her eyes, she had a look of enjoyment on her face. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d She didn\u2019t really answer me. What she did was laugh at me. Looking down, I was horrified. What I saw was long flowing pink sun dress with ruffles around the shoulder area. <br>\r\n\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d Tonya stopped laughing her ass off long enough to answer.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know, but it suits you fat head.\u201d That was the last straw. Going in the closet, I reached into my baseball bag and pulled out my bat. The sight of it stopped Tonya\u2019s laughing completely.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are doing Tony?\u201d I just stood in front of the mirror with the bat in hand. Looking as serious as possible. <br>\r\n\u201cChange my clothes back, now.\u201d Tonya shook her head, keeping her eyes on the bat.<br>\r\n\u201cChange me back, or I smash the mirror.\u201d A frightened look appeared on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTry me.\u201d Five whole minutes passed by before I felt the tingle that I felt before. Looking down, I saw that my clothes were back to the way that they were before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I said, putting the bat on my bed. Tonya wasn\u2019t all too happy with me.<br>\r\n\u201cWould you have actually smashed the mirror?\u201d She sounded really scared. I shook my head and laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but it got you to change me back, didn\u2019t it?\u201d That made her mad. As I sat on my bed, I felt a warm feeling grow around the center of my pants.<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it Tonya!\u201d I looked over at Tonya to see how bad she wet herself, but she was completely dry.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wet?\u201d Tonya looked down at her legs and then back up at me. <br>\r\n\u201cI think I learned how to only make you wet. I think that might come in handy.\u201d She walked over to her bed and sat down on.<br>\r\n\u201cI think that you should start treating me a whole lot nicer from now on.\u201d She still looked a bit mad. I just stood there, glaring at her. <br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tonya rose to her feet and walked over to the mirror.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She heard me. <br>\r\n\u201cI know I heard you, why not?\u201d I went over to the closet and grabbed new clothes.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t like you and I think that you\u2019re not real and that you\u2019re just here to drive me insane. Well guess what? You did it. Now, since you have accomplished what you\u2019re here for, I want you to leave, now!\u201d Tonya looked as if she was about to say something but I interrupted her. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have any say in the matter. I want you gone now and to leave and never come back!\u201d I felt really good after I said that. Looking at Tonya, I could see that tears were forming around her eyes. She was about to cry.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t start that!\u201d That didn\u2019t really help. I think it made it worse for she started crying her eyes out. Not wanting to listen to her sobbing, I decided to go into the bathroom to change. While I was in there, I could still hear Tonya crying. As I was about to leave, the crying stopped. Getting out and going to the mirror, I saw what I would never see again. <br>\r\nMyself.<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d I checked the entire mirror, no signs of her. \u201cShe\u2019s finally gone!\u201d for the first time in weeks I had my room to myself. As I sat there, proud, I began to feel something swell up deep in my gut. I pondered what it was for some time, and then I realized what it was. Guilt, loneliness, I felt empty for some reason. Was it because she wasn\u2019t here anymore? Getting out of bed, I walked over to the mirror and sat on the floor. I waited for her to pop up, laugh and call me a fat head. But she didn\u2019t. For hours I sat in front of the mirror, waiting. But she never came. Hopping that she would show up in the morning, I decided to go to bed. As I lay there, I couldn\u2019t help but feel terrible about what I did. Looking at the clock, I saw that it was around 3:00 in the morning, that\u2019s when I felt it. There was something in my bed with me. Rolling over, what I saw, or, who I saw, was Tonya. She was curled up and clinging my arm. This was really weird. Tonya, the girl that lived in the mirror in my closet, was in my bed holding my arm. I didn\u2019t really know what to think about this. I did know that I didn\u2019t want her to let go and leave again. Putting my arm around her, I pulled her in tight and hugged her. She, the girl that I thought made me go nuts when she was around. But I was wrong. She was the girl who made me go nuts when she wasn\u2019t around. As I held her, I felt her move slightly. When she opened her eyes, she seemed a bit spooked.<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026\u201d I cut her off.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean what I said. I don\u2019t hate you. I thought that when you were here only to make me mad and insane.\u201d I looked up at her with tears in my eyes. \u201cAnd when you left, I felt happy. But then, the longer you were gone, I felt sad and scared. I thought that with you gone, my life was going back to normal and I could live it again.\u201d I buried my head in her chest. \u201cBut I realized that I couldn\u2019t live without you. Without you, my life wouldn\u2019t be normal. I want you to stay.\u201d The flood gates opened and my tears fell out all over. After what seemed like an eternity, I felt her hand rub my back. Looking up, I saw tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s really sweat. And I don\u2019t think that I could have been able to live my life without you either.\u201d  Taking my head, she placed it on her shoulder and stroked it. For the rest of the night, we stayed like that. Eventually I fell asleep in her arms.<br>\r\nThat very morning, I felt great, like a great weight has left my body. As I opened my eyes, I felt a presence next to me. Looking up, I saw Tonya, still stroking my hair.<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Tony.\u201d She was smiling at me. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d I smiled up at her. <br>\r\n\u201cLike I haven\u2019t sleep in all my life. What about you?\u201d She kissed the top of my head and continued to stroke it. <br>\r\n\u201cLike I finally got what I was missing back.\u201d For a few hours we cuddled in my bed, and then we heard some footsteps coming up the stairs. <br>\r\n\u201cCRAP!\u201d We were both scared. Mom and Hailey could see or hear Tonya when she was \u2018in\u2019 the mirror, but what about out of the mirror? Getting out bed, Tonya, who was only in her bra and panties, ran for the mirror. Just as the door was opening, Tonya went through the mirror. I shall have to ask her about that later. When it opened all the way, mom came in with Hailey behind her, carrying a tray of food with her. <br>\r\n\u201cTony, are you okay?\u201d Mom said, coming in without my permission. \u201cWe heard you yell.\u201d Damn.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d Hailey walked up to me and placed the tray on my desk. <br>\r\n\u201cDid we hear a girl in here?\u201d Crap, they can hear her.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it might have been the T.V.\u201d I lied, pointing to the turned off T.V. set. Looking at it and me again, both Hailey and mom left the room. When I was sure that they were gone, I went over to the mirror to check up on Tonya, who was hiding behind her bed. <br>\r\n\u201cThat was to close.\u201d I said as she came out from hiding. \u201cTonya, I have to ask you something, how did you get out of the mirror?\u201d Tonya shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. After what you said to me last night, I felt as if I didn\u2019t have any reason to exist, and I could feel myself fade away. As I was fading, I felt that you were upset, and you wanted me back. And that\u2019s all I remember. I don\u2019t really know how I got in your bed.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cCan you get out now?\u201d Tonya shrugged. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d Watching her, I could see that she really wanted to get out. And I really want her to be able to get out as well. Concentrating, Tonya walked towered the mirror and pressed her body on the glass. What we thought would hold her back; she went through like it was water. Catching her before she fell, I pulled her into a hug. <br>\r\n\u201cFor a second there, I thought that I would never hold you again.\u201d Tonya hugged me back.<br>\r\n\u201cI as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple months, I and Tonya became really close. I think I spent less and less time in my \u2018man room\u2019, and more time in my room. Tonya started to spend more time in my room than her room ever since she found out she could get out of the mirror. <br>\r\nAs time went on, she learned how to do many other things as well. She learned how to change her form, as well as other people\u2019s form also. I\u2019ve spent some time as a girl for some time, and it was pretty fun. Every now and then, she would turn me into a really fluffy wolf and use me as a pillow when we slept. I didn\u2019t really mind it at all; it actually felt really nice to have her laying on me. Whenever I came entered the bed room after I left home, she would pounce on me. We still had are fights. But they never lasted long. She still calls me fat head.<br>\r\n Eventually, mom found someone to be with too. <br>\r\nHis name was Mark Garver. He was a construction worker that did some work on are house from time to time. They have been dating for as long as Tonya and I have. He was a really nice guy, when he was sober. When he was sober, he was the nicest guy ever. He would take a bullet for you. But when he was drunk, he would be the one to fire the bullet. <br>\r\nThere have been times when I almost met the \u2018Garvanator\u2019 on his drunk run. Then, one day, I didn\u2019t get out in time. <br>\r\nI was at a friend\u2019s house for most of the day. When I got home, I met Mark at the door, with a beer bottle in hand. <br>\r\n\u201cWhere have you been boy?\u201d He asked, the beer rolled off his tongue.  I looked up at him with fear, but I stood my ground.<br>\r\n\u201cAt a friend\u2019s house.\u201d I noticed that his arm was bandaged up from the wrist to the shoulder.  That must have added to his anger. \u201cDid you just get off work?\u201d Mark waved the beer bottle in my face. <br>\r\n\u201cThat is an affirmative. So, why are you late? Your mom said that you\u2019d be home by eight.\u201d<br>\r\nI looked at him with an odd face. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only 8:10. I\u2019m only ten minutes late.\u201d That wasn\u2019t enough for Mark in his drunken state.<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to learn about being on time.\u201d He started to walk to me.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s mom?\u201d Mark laughed as he took another drink. <br>\r\n\u201cOut.\u201d Before I could get away, Mark grabbed my arm tight and pulled me into the house. Once I was inside, Mark closed in on me. Reaching for his belt, Mark brought it across my face, the belt siring my skin. Mark continued to beat me with his belt all over my body. When he was done with that, he grabbed the collar of my shirt and lifted me up. I didn\u2019t like what he did next. <br>\r\nMark was strong; he had to since he was a construction worker. Using the back of his right hand, Mark did the all powerful bitch slap across my face. Going back in forth, Mark mercilessly beat my head to a pulp. After that, he went to beating my gut with his fist over and over. I could feel my lung go up into my head. With my body beaten and bloody, Mark let me drop to the floor with a thud. <br>\r\n\u201cNow go think about what you learned.\u201d I left as soon as I could, for fear that he would change his mind. Reaching my room, I found Tonya waiting by the door. When she saw me, I looked like she saw a ghost. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! Tony, what happened?\u201d She reached her arm out for me to take hold of. Using her other arm, Tonya wrapped her arm around me, causing me to wince in pain. Taking to the bathroom, Tonya stripped me of my clothes and placed me in the tub. I was amazed how well she was doing this. She wasn\u2019t embarrassed by the fact that I was naked in front of her. Turning the water on, Tonya let the warm water run over my sore, beaten limp body. It felt good to have the water flow over my wounds. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d She asked while she cleaned my face. <br>\r\n\u201cMark, he was drunk again. Said that I was late and decided to beat a lesson in me.\u201d Tonya had a look of great sadness on her face. Once I was clean, she took me out of the tub and went to drying off. When she reached my crouch, I got a little horny. Tonya noticed this. She smiled but kept drying me off till there was not a drop of water on my body. <br>\r\nAfter that she took me into the bedroom and placed me onto the bed. Going into the closet, Tonya grabbed a pair of boxers and slipped them on me. After that she pulled the covers over me. Tonya had learned to change the appearance of the body not too long ago. She could make it look like I had no cuts or and wounds at all, but the pain I felt would still be there. She was about to do so when the door started to open. Tonya jumped into the mirror before it was opened up all the way to reveal mom in a party dress. <br>\r\n\u201cTony?\u201d Mom turned on the light to reveal the marks that I had all over my body. Mom was frightened at the sight. \u201cHoney, who did this to you?\u201d She was really scared for me.<br>\r\n\u201cMark.\u201d Is all I said. Moms look of fear left her face. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, did he have a reason?\u201d She didn\u2019t seem to worried about the fact that her boyfriend beat the ever-living-shit out of me.<br>\r\n\u201cHe said it was because I was ten minutes late.\u201d Mom just sat beside me for a minute. It looked like she was thinking. When she answered, I was shocked by what she said.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe you disserved it. Maybe you\u2019ll learn not to be late next time.\u201d After she said that, she told me that Mark was taking her to a fancy dinner for the night. She said that Hailey would be here if I needed anything. A few minutes after mom left, Hailey came into the room with a cold ice pack and a bottle of water. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, Tony, how ya feeling?\u201d Hailey never acted this nice to me before.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she knows that what happened was wrong and wants to make you feel better.\u201d Tonya said, still behind the mirror. Hailey sat on the bed and placed the Ice on my forehead.  <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that what Mark did was right. If he wanted to punish you, he\u2019d take that mirror away from you.\u201d That got my attention. Did she know about Tonya?<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about Hailey? Why the mirror?\u201d Hailey shook her head and poked the cut on my cheek, brining a scream from me.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid Tony. I know that there\u2019s something about that mirror that you don\u2019t tell us.\u201d She went over to it and placed her hand on it. \u201cSo, what is it?\u201d Would telling her be a help me?<br>\r\n\u201cIt might. She could be more helpful with her knowing.\u201d Tonya was trying to stay behind the mirror. She really wanted to jump out. Well, since she has some clue, might as well have her come out.<br>\r\n\u201cTonya, come on out.\u201d With those words, Tonya stepped out of the mirror. I thought the sight of a girl coming out of a mirror would scare the ever living crap out of her, but it didn\u2019t. She stood there with her trademark emotionless face. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been hiding. That\u2019s a big secret.\u201d  She\u2019s taking it well. <br>\r\n\u201cI tried to tell you guys before, but you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d Hailey looked down at me on the bed with her blank face.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. So, what\u2019s her name?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cTonya.\u201d Hailey went up to her and shook her hand. <br>\r\n\u201cIt was very nice to meat you. Are you taking good care of num-nuts over there?\u201d Hailey asked, referring to me. Tonya smiled and nodded her head.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you don\u2019t have to worry about anything. You go get some sleep and I\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201d Before Hailey left, she gave me a kiss on the head and went down stairs to her room. Once she was gone, Tonya came over and went on to healing the marks on my body.<br>\r\n\u201cThat should take care of your bruises. But the pain will still be there.\u201d She stroked the hair in front of my face. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really mind as long as I have you.\u201d Tonya smiled her sweet smile. Just as she was about to leave, I took hold of her arm. <br>\r\n\u201cPlease, stay.\u201d Tonya didn\u2019t say anything. She just smiled and crawled in next to me. For a while, Tonya stroked my hair and hummed. I felt safe with her, like she was a second mother to me. I was always told that men look for women to marry that reminded them of their mothers. Tonya didn\u2019t remind me of anything about my mom. Tonya was better.<br>\r\n\u201cTonya.\u201d I asked. \u201cCan you tell me who you are?\u201d Tonya stopped what she was doing and looked down at me. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to know.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBut I do want to know.\u201d Tonya sighed and went back to stroking my hair.<br>\r\n\u201cAll right. I am you. A part of you. I am your most curious thoughts.\u201d I didn\u2019t quite understand, but I still listened. \u201cWhen you came to this house, you had many things on your mind. The mirror sensed that. The mirror makes your strongest thoughts come to life. What came out of you was me.\u201d That made sense I guess. <br>\r\nAfter some time, I fell asleep in Tonya\u2019s arms. It felt nice to be in her arms. As I sleep, my thoughts went wild.<br>\r\n****Dream world****<br>\r\nSitting in the living room, I watched T.V. as Tonya sat next to me in my lap. Tonya looked at me with a very seductive look in her eyes. I had a good feeling about this. Moving in to kiss her, The front door opened to reveal Mark with mom behind him. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, what do we have here?\u201d I was speechless. Marked walked over to Tonya and grabbed her by the neck. \u201cThis is a very nice little piece of meat you got boy.\u201d He took her to the middle of the living room. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t think you should deserve such a girl like this.\u201d Taking his hand, Mark went on to beating her. I tried to get up to stop him, but I couldn\u2019t get off the couch. Looking at the couch, I saw hands pulling me back down on it. I sat there helplessly as Mark beat Tonya to death. As he was doing so, mom came up next to me and placed a hand on my shoulder. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d She had a blank look to her face, like Hailey\u2019s face, only worse. Soon after Mark was done, Hailey came down the stairs with the mirror in hand. She had a collar around her neck. <br>\r\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d Mark took the mirror from her and gave her what looked like a dog treat. Setting the mirror up, Mark took Tonya and threw her into the mirror with great force. Taking the mirror, Mark smashed it on the ground. I felt my heart tear in two. I could see Tonya in the shards of glass. Mark the gathered the glass shards up and thrown them into the fire. I sat there with tears in my eyes as I watched the glass melt with Tonya in them. <br>\r\n****Real world****<br>\r\nBolting up in pain, I was sweating pools onto the bed. Tonya wasn\u2019t in my bed. Getting scared, I fell out of bed. The sound of my fall must have got the attention of Tonya, for she came out of the mirror. She must have wanted to let me sleep. <br>\r\n\u201cTony, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d She bent down and held me to her chest. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I was happy that she was alright, but the dream was still in my mind.<br>\r\n\u201cI, I had a nightmare.\u201d Tonya looked down at me and kissed my head. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat was it about?\u201d I spent the next half hour telling her what my nightmare was about. When I was done, Tonya\u2019s face was pale.<br>\r\n\u201cTony, it was only a nightmare, nothing more. That would never happen.\u201d As she held me, I began to smell something awful. Then I felt something squish in the back of my pants. I started crying. I couldn\u2019t help it. Tonya noticed this and embraced me tighter, but I felt no pain. Letting me go, Tonya went into the bathroom and brought out a towel and laid it on the floor. Moving me onto the towel, Tonya proceeded to take my pants and boxers off, which were filled with crap. Putting them aside, Tonya went in the closet and came out with a diaper and wipes. <br>\r\n\u201cYour sister left them in there a few weeks ago. She might have done it because of all the times I made you wet yourself.\u201d That\u2019s right; Hailey was the one who did the laundry in the house. So she must have thought that something was wrong. Leaving them there must have been her way of helping. <br>\r\nPlacing the extremely thick diaper under me, Tonya took out the wipes and cleaned my bottom. The whole time, I was really embarrassed.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed, I\u2019m doing this so you don\u2019t make a mess later tonight to be on the safe side.\u201d  I had to agree with her on that part. When she was done, Tonya lifted me up and helped me onto the bed. On the way to the bed, I could feel the thickness of the diaper between my legs. <br>\r\nLooking behind me, I could see that with the diaper on, it made my butt stick out about a good foot. Getting me on the bed, Tonya went back into the closet and came out with out of my boxers. Using her powers, Tonya made them into an onesie sleeper. Putting it on me, Tonya crawled into bed and lay with me. I thought that the sleeper was not really needed, but I didn\u2019t say anything.  <br>\r\nFor the rest of the night, we slept together in my bed. I didn\u2019t have any more nightmares that night. For the first time in years, I\u2019ve been able to sleep. For the first time in years, I was truly happy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You know what I hate? Moving. We just recently moved into a new house. Sounds like fun right? Wrong! My new home was the home of a dead girl that lived here about two months ago. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. <br>\r\nMy name is Justin Fletcher. I\u2019m 16 and I live with my sister at my Aunts new home. My parents died about a year ago and my sister Rika and I have lived with are Aunt since then. She\u2019s a nice lady, she\u2019s about twenty seven, she was moms \u2018younger\u2019 sister. My Aunts old home didn\u2019t have enough room for a 16 year old boy and a 14 year old girl to live in. that\u2019s when My Aunt, Judy, found the house we now live in.<br>\r\nThe house was an old one. Filled with cobwebs, spiders, dust and old things that should have become the dust. The house was up for about two months before we bought it. And we got it for real cheap to. The guy who sold it to us didn\u2019t say why. It\u2019s been a couple weeks since we\u2019ve move in, me and Rika got enrolled into the school nearby and will be starting when summers over. Rika has already made a good number of friends, while I only have about three. <br>\r\nAnyway, at the moment, I\u2019m sitting my room, boxes are everywhere, with me lying on my bed tossing an orange ball in the air and then catching it. I tried to get up and put stuff away, but that would require work, and me being the lazy teen I am, didn\u2019t really want to get up. So I went back to playing with the ball. Before we started moving things in, I did a bit of research on the house. It turns out that this house had only one owner before us. <br>\r\nA family whose daughter died in her room, my room. After the daughter died, the parents left and put the house for sale. No one bought it for over two months, since they said that they have been seeing things move. <br>\r\nI didn\u2019t really believe any of it. That night, when I was going to sleep, I felt a weird presence in the room. Ignoring it, I went back to sleep. After what seemed like hours, I awoke to a voice in the room. It sounded like a girl\u2019s voice. <br>\r\nLooking at the foot of the bed, I saw that I was right. There was a girl in the room. She looked a bit short, but then I saw that she was floating about three feet off the floor with her legs crossed, looking at me. The thing that stood out the most about her was that she was transparent. I could see the wall behind her. The next thing I did, I\u2019m not very proud of. I fell out of the bed yelling \u2018HOLY SHIT!\u2019 When I landed, I hit my head on the floor. Seeing me land on my head must have been funny to her, for she started laughing. <br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d I said. What I said must have startled the girl. Uncrossing her legs, she floated above my head. <br>\r\n\u201cCan you see me?\u201d I nodded my head. The girl seemed to scream with joy at my jester. \u201cFinally, I have someone to talk to!\u201d I was really confused.<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What are you talking about?\u201d The girl came down and sat on the bed. <br>\r\n\u201cRight, I guess I should explain first. My name is Katie; I used to live here about two months ago. But when I died, my parents were really sad about it and wanted to leave, for my death really hurt them. The day that they were leaving, I tried to get their attention by moving things around. But that made them leave faster. Ever since then, people never come in the house. When people do, they don\u2019t stay long, for I try to get their attention, but that just scares them.\u201d She looked up and looked me in the eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the first person to be able to see and hear me. It gets really boring here when you can\u2019t really talk to anyone.\u201d Wow, this was a lot to take in. I just met a ghost of the girl who died in this very room, and the first thing she wants to do is talk? <br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d I start. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Katie looked at me and smiled. <br>\r\n\u201c17. How about you?\u201d I gave her a smile, trying to stay friendly. <br>\r\n\u201c16. by the way, my names Justin.\u201d Katie smiled and jumped off the bed and, what looked like walking, went to the end of the bed. <br>\r\n\u201cWell Justin, it seems that I\u2019m a year older than you.\u201d I was getting scared now.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that means what?\u201d Katie just kept smiling at me.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just felt like saying it.\u201d She laughed. Great, I\u2019m stuck with a ghost that thinks she\u2019s funny.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Katie, can I ask you something?\u201d Katie nodded her head and sat back down on the bed, her ghost butt going through the bed slightly. \u201cCan you, like, do things that ghost can do?\u201d That was a really dumb question. Katie sat there and thought about it for some time.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know. I can move small things like ash trays and small books. I can\u2019t touch many things. When I try to close a door, I go right through it.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cCan you possess people?\u201d Katie bolted up and looked at me with the biggest, goofiest grin ever.<br>\r\n\u201cI never tried it before; do you want to give it a shot?\u201d Wow she was impulsive. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure, why not?\u201d Giggling, Katie went above my head and lowered herself inside of me. As she did this, I got a very strong tingling feeling all over my body, like when your leg falls asleep. When the tingling stopped, I could feel myself move into the back of my mind, but I could still see out my eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cJustin?\u201d I heard my body say.<br>\r\n\u201cKatie?\u201d I heard my body scream with delight.<br>\r\n\u201cYay, it worked! I\u2019m you!\u201d Well, she\u2019s happy.<br>\r\n\u201cKatie, can you hear me?\u201d I felt my head nod. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah. This is so cool!\u201d With Katie in control, all I could do is sit in the passenger seat of my mind while Katie drives. \u201cIt feels good to be alive again!\u201d  Katie moved my hands all over my body. Feeling every muscle I had. \u201cYou have a really nice body.\u201d Katie then got an idea. \u201cCan I sleep with you to night?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Katie jumped up and down.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! I\u2019ll get out of your body in the morning, I promise.\u201d I guess I had no other choice.<br>\r\n\u201cFine, just, no exploring.\u201d Katie giggled and jumped in the bed. <br>\r\n\u201cGood night Justin.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood night Katie.\u201d For the rest of the night, Katie sleeps in my body. She told me that since she was a ghost, she couldn\u2019t sleep. So this must have been nice for her. As I sit there in the back of my mind, I could feel myself get tiered and pass out. <br>\r\nThe next morning, Katie was out of my body. I knew she was, for I tried to kill my alarm clock when it went off. Finally unplugging it, I rolled over meet Katie\u2019s gaze who was floating above my face. <br>\r\n\u201cGah! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d Katie Laughed as she floated down beside me. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d She was doing a good imitation of lying down, when she really would have just went through the bed. <br>\r\n\u201cHow long were you watching me?\u201d Katie shrugged.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Did you know that you snore like a heard of dying hippos?\u201d That was new to me.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Getting out of bed, I proceeded to the kitchen where my Aunt and Rika were eating breakfast. Seeing how they weren\u2019t screaming or yelling, I don\u2019t think they can see Katie.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Aunt Yuri (okay, I know what you\u2019re going to say, but, don\u2019t) what\u2019s for breakfast?\u201d Aunt Yuri looked up from her plate and smiled at me. <br>\r\n\u201cEggs and bacon dear. Theirs a plate on the counter.\u201d Getting a plate, I proceeded to get my food, while Katie sat on the counter.<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had eggs and bacon in forever!\u201d She said, trying to sniff my food. <br>\r\n\u201cKatie, this is my food.\u201d I whispered to her. She got her puppy dog eyes on.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease? Can I have some?\u201d Sighing, I asked Aunt Yuri if I could take my food to my room. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, just don\u2019t make a mess.\u201d Agreeing, I took the food to my room with Katie trailing in tow. Once inside, I placed the food on the bed and stood in front of Katie.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, get it over with.\u201d Not wasting anytime, Katie takes my body and begins to chow down the food. I watched as Katie devoured the food in less than a minute. <br>\r\n\u201cThat was delicious! You have to thank your Aunt for me.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSure, can I have my body back now?\u201d Katie sighed. <br>\r\n\u201cFine, I suppose.\u201d Leaving my body, Katie sat on the bed, displeased. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Katie gave me a humph. <br>\r\n\u201cI just really want a body again. It\u2019s fun to be human from time to time, but I want to be alive again!\u201d I had to feel sad for her. She has only been alive for about two times. I imagine that she wants it full time. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know. What if I help to get your body back?\u201d I didn\u2019t have time to add on before Katie pounced me.<br>\r\n \u201cOh thank you Justin!\u201d What might have been a pounce, turned into going right through me. When she went through me, it felt like when she took me over. After Katie finally realized that wasn\u2019t in the same room anymore, she came back in, giggling. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I forgot that I couldn\u2019t really hold you yet.\u201d She was laughing to herself. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh with her. For some time I thought about what she said about how she couldn\u2019t hold me yet. Does that mean that she likes me? I decided not to ask her about that.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, um, I know a guy who is into things like this. Ya know things that don\u2019t really happen all the time.\u201d Katie looked at me with a bit of curiosity. <br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cTony Vladimore.\u201d Katie had a blank stare on her face. <br>\r\n\u201cNever heard of him.\u201d I laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cI would think that you would have. He\u2019s lived here for over a year and went to your school.\u201d Katie still had a blank look. It was kind of funny. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll go talk to him today, see if he can help.\u201d <br>\r\nI did what I said that I would, after I took a shower and had Katie pestering me the whole time about how I don\u2019t clean the right way. The whole time I tried to tell her to get out, she finally did once I was done. Later that day, I decided to call Tony and ask him to meet me at the library around twelve. While I waited, Katie was asking me a lot of random questions.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this Tony guy like?\u201d I thought about it for a while.<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s, a bit odd at times. Once you get to know him, he\u2019s really normal.\u201d That wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy her curiosity, so she kept asking questions. When Tony finally arrived, he had Tonya with him. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Justin.\u201d Tony said once he reached us. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Tony, Tonya.\u201d I said to the both of them. \u201cI have a bit of a problem.\u201d I looked up at Katie who was floating above my head. Tony was looking at the same spot.<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWait, you can see her?\u201d Tony nodded.  Tonya was looking at the same spot as well.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s as clear as day.\u201d Katie squealed with delight.<br>\r\n\u201cYay! More people who can see me!\u201d Tonya laughed while Katie did some spins.<br>\r\n\u201cShe seems to be a happy ghost. What would you need help with?\u201d I sighed and told Katie to come down.<br>\r\n\u201cI need your help to get her body back.\u201d Tony looked at me with disbelief.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry; did you say that you want us to help you get her body back? That is very hard to do.\u201d Tonya tapped Tony\u2019s shoulder and pulled him aside. After she was done talking to him, they came back with Tony very unhappy. <br>\r\n\u201cTonya might know someone who can help.\u201d Katie flew over in front of Tonya.<br>\r\n\u201cWHO? PLEASE TELL ME!\u201d She was very excited. Tonya had to back up a bit before Katie went through her.<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a gypsy. She helps me from time to time with some stuff. She may be able to help you.\u201d Before I could ask where this gypsy was, Katie possessed my body and gave Tonya a hug.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, this is a bit weird.\u201d Tony said. <br>\r\n\u201cKatie! Can I have my body back?\u201d Katie shook my head. \u201cThen can you ask where the gypsy lives?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOh, right, Justin wants to know where the gypsy lives.\u201d After Tony gave us the directions, the four of us went out for some fun, the whole time Katie had my body. Soon after, Katie and I left Tony and Tonya and went home. I knew what Tonya was and what she and Tony were going to do when they got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Katie and I went out to the area that Tonya said she would be. As we traveled, I noticed the dirt road that Tonya said the gypsy would be down. After some time, we finally reached a small trailer that was covered in vines and flowers. Katie, who was floating beside me, noticed that a woman was sitting on the outside of the building. <br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you two children?\u201d She said with a craggily voice.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can see Katie?\u201d The woman nodded.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and I also know why you have come to me as well.\u201d The woman beckoned for the two of us to follow her inside. When inside, I was amazed to see that it looked much better than the outside did. <br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s see what we can do about your body.\u201d The woman said. Getting out a deck of cards, she placed three on the table and started to speak. \u201cThe young lady here lost her body due to a car running her over.\u201d She flipped the first card over to show a car. \u201cAnd then she met you in the night, wanting help.\u201d She flipped over the next card to show a girl floating in front of a boy. \u201cAnd then you want to get your body back so you can be with him.\u201d She pulled out another card from the deck, showing the room that we were in. <br>\r\nShe took out one more card. \u201cThe way to get the girl\u2019s body back is to give up your pride.\u201d She said pointing at me. Flipping over the card, it showed a girl in boy\u2019s clothes. I didn\u2019t really get it but I wanted to stay with what I told Katie. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he ran through the field, he could hear a whole heard of Genprey, feeding on the dead carcass of a Popo, a large mammoth like monster with short legs and massive tusks. Genprey are like raptors, only bigger. Their skin is a deep green color and on their head is blade like horns. \u2018This is great. A whole pack of Gen, just waiting to be picked off.\u2019 Zack was one of the best hunters that the town of Shell Shine has ever seen. He could take down a Tigerex within minutes and not break a sweat. As he approached the Gen, Zack pulled out his sword, and waited in the brush, waiting for the Genprey to finish their meal. Zack always lets any monster finish the food they eat before attacking. But this was not a job that he could be polite on. He had a time limit and he was almost out of time. Zack, with his sword ready, leaped out of the brush and ran towered Gen with his blade held high. From the sound Zack made, the Genprey looked up to see him. Without thinking, the pack ran toward Zack, hoping to overpower him. But that was not the case, for He was hoping that they would go for him, rather than run. Swinging his sword, Zack landed a good amount of solid hits on the pack. As three Genprey fall, only one was left standing, the smallest Gen. \u2018This guy is hurt already, may as well take him.\u2019 The Gen before him was still trying to fight, which did it little good. Zack moved away from the Gen, and pulled out a Soul-gem and attached it to his scanner gauntlet and activated the soul steal program. Within seconds, the Gen was trapped within the stone, turning it into a summon. <br>\r\nThe town of Shell Shine was a large town, but also a poor town. It manly makes its money from tourists and selling the summons that is collected from hunters. In the center of the town was the school. This school was for children that could use the powers of summons without the summon out. Zack was one of those kids. He could call on the power of any summon to aid him. But there was one thing different about him. He had powers of his own. Zack was about 5\u2019 not that built, but strong considering the way he looks. His was born with dark green long hair that he keeps in a braid most of the time. The sword on his back was called \u00e9xtasis, the rapture. As he entered Shell Shine, Zack noticed a man at the gates. \u2018Crap.\u2019 \u201cZack, how good to see you. How goes the killing?\u201d Zack sighed, pulling a cart up. \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d the man said, running over to see the kill. \u201cHow much trouble did they give you?\u201d Zack still said nothing, for he knew what was coming next. The man shrugged his head and smiled at the Gen, only for his grin to go down. \u201cWhere is the fifth Genprey?\u201d Zack didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he pulled out a stone, it glowed bright red. \u201cWhy did you do that? I told you I wanted them all dead!\u201d The man kicked the carts wheel, hurting his foot. \u201cYou can forget your pay!\u201d This got Zack talking. \u201cI took this job because I need the money. I didn\u2019t know you needed the whole pack!\u201d the man laughed. \u201cYou should have thought about that sooner.\u201d  The man thought for a minute, then got an idea. \u201cHow\u2019s this, you give me the summon, and I give you half the pay.\u201d Zack looked down at the stone and shook his head. \u201cNo deal.\u201d The man shrugged. \u201cYour loss.\u201d With that, the man left the town with the pack of Gen. Inside the town, Zack went to a store, and this was no ordinary store, it was for hunters. Inside was nothing special. The floor was dirt, and the shelves were filled with Soul-gems of many colors. \u201cJohn, you in?\u201d Zack was eager to get home, but he had to get some things done. \u201cYeah, in the back.\u201d Behind the counter, was a doorway that was covered by a curtain, Johns work space. Coming out, Zack could get a better look at him. John was a fat man, and a happy one. He had that look to him that he could never be pissed, and the big white beard did little to help. \u201cWhat can I do for you Zack?\u201d Zack smiled and pulled out the summon. \u201cCaught a Gen while on duty, thought that it could make a rookie happy.\u201d John took the stone, eyeing it from every angle. \u201cI\u2019ll take a look at it. Tell your mom I said hi.\u201d \u201cWill do.\u201d And he headed off. <br>\r\nZack\u2019s house wasn\u2019t very special; it was mostly a one-story house, with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a monster living room. As Zack walked in, he could smell food being made. \u2018Moms cooking, this can\u2019t be good.\u2019 Going into the kitchen, he saw his mother cooking by the stove. Trying to sneak up on her, Zack went over, only to have a roller smack him on the head. \u201cOw, what was that for?\u201d he asked. \u201cFor trying to sneak up on your mother.\u201d Zack\u2019s mother turned around to show what she was cooking. Zack\u2019s mom name is Cait. She is taller than Zack, but not by much. Her hair was green too, but a lighter color than his. She was a sweet woman; she would do anything for you. And when Zack was little, she was like a mother bear taking on a tank to protect her cub. And she would win. There was on thing about her that made her different then other woman, she was a Mother-stone. On top of her head was a cute pair of green cat ears that could hear Zack in all parts of the house. And to get this out of the way, she does have a tail. \u201cI am making your favorite honey,\u201d Cait said, pulling a tray from the stove. \u201cPie!\u201d Zack\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw it. He was wondering if it was the exact type of pie. \u201cIs it..\u201d Cait nodded. \u201cYes, I baked some catnip into it. And for a overpowering smell, I sprinkled a bit of that Egyptian catnip on the top. Just the way you like it.\u201d Because Cait is a Mother-stone, and a cat girl, her love for cat things were transferred to Zack when he was born. He got her genes. \u201cYah! Can\u2019t wait for it!\u201d Cait smiled. She loved to see her boy happy since he had one of the most difficult chooses. Today was the anniversary of when he lost his arm and leg. \u201cGo wash up and be back down here in ten.\u201d Zack nodded and rushed up twored the bathroom. Cait was glad that he was happy. It\u2019s sad that he has to go back to school in a couple weeks. Later, after dinner, Zack went in the kitchen to help her mom wash dishes when Cait stopped. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong mom?\u201d Cait closed her eyes, trying to hold back the tears. \u201cI know why you have been taking all those jobs from your uncle.\u201d Zack was shocked. How did she know? \u201cWhy did you do them? What did you kill today?\u201d Zack felt ashamed. He knew that this was going to happen. \u201cA pack of Genprey. He said they have been killing live stock and scaring people.\u201d \u201cAnd were they?\u201d Zack said nothing. Cait felt torn that her brother would do this. \u201cHoney, why did you take the jobs?\u201d Zack was on the verge of tears. \u201cI heard that you needed the money or we will have to move. And you love this house.\u201d Cait now felt sorry for Zack, for he was getting himself involved with her problems. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re a child, you don\u2019t have to get yourself tangled up in this, and you just need to make your life the way you want.\u201d Cait said as she hugged him. Zack was shocked about what she said. But she is right. He needs be a kid, and he hasn\u2019t done that for a year. Zack decided to start that now and embraced her hug. Cait was surprised that Zack was hugging her back, but felt that he needed it. \u201cHow about some pie?\u201d Zack nodded. Getting up, Cait got up and went to the kitchen, happy that Zack was now sharing what he kept bottled up. After getting the pie, Zack could smell it and began to drool. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re done, I got something that you will like.\u201d Zack looked up at her and got curious about what she got. \u201cYou can get it when you\u2019re done eating.\u201d  Zack nodded and looked down at his piece, and started to devourer it, getting pie all over his face. When he was done, Cait cleaned his face like the way she used to, with her tongue. He hated the fact that she was cleaning him, but he wanted to make her happy. \u201cNow that your clean, I have something for you.\u201d Zack was about to ask when she took out her necklace. Her necklace had a stone in the center. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d Cait smiled. \u201cTo awaken the true you. Your now old enough to handle the power of shape shifting into your true form.\u201d Zack was confused; he was the son of a human and a Mother-stone, what could be his true form? As he pondered, Cait was placing it on his head and saying something that he didn\u2019t catch. By the time he found out what was going on, a bright flash of light engulfed the room. Zack could feel a strong pain in his side as it moves to the rest of his body. When the light was gone, he could barely see do to the fact that of the flash. When his sight came back, the first thing he noticed is that the room was bigger. Zack was normally 5 feet tall, but he seemed shorter. Looking down, he noticed that his pants had fallen to the floor and his shirt covered his body. \u201cMom, what did you do?\u201d Cait was behind the couch, with a mirror in hand. Getting down to his level, she held the mirror in front of him to show him what he looked like. Zack nearly fell over if it wasn\u2019t for his mother. Zack was now 3 feet tall, and looked like a cat. His hair was still dark green, but it was now in a ponytail. His skin was now fur, and it was a deep white. His hands, now paws, were  big.  What he was more curious about, was why he had two long locks of hair coming out from the top of his head. \u201cWhat are these things?\u201d he asked, now noticing that his voice was higher. Cait just smiled. \u201cThose are your antennas; they allow you to do more than you could.\u201d Zack was confused, but that went away when he saw that he could move them like he moves his arms. \u201cNow,\u201d Cait said, getting Zack back to reality. \u201cFor your surprise.\u201d Zack stood up and walked over to her. \u201cWhat, I thought this was it?\u201d Cait smiled even bigger. \u201cNo, this is.\u201d Pulling out a bag from behind her back, which got Zack to smell it. And when he did, he jumped up and hug his mother in the most affectionate way ever since was ten. Dumping the contents of the bag, Cait turned into her true form. This was a bigger, female version of Zack. Looking at the floor, Zack noticed that the stuff that was in the bag was catnip. Cait sat on the couch as he rolled around in the plant and rubbed it all over himself. <br>\r\nLater, after Zack was done, the two decided to sit on the couch and watch TV. \u201cMom,\u201d Cait looked down at him. \u201cWill I stay like this?\u201d Cait shook her head. \u201cNo, this is your chibi form, just like summons. Your human shape is your resting form, and you have another form. But I want you to find out what you look like yourself.\u201d Zack crawled over to his mother and laid his head on her lap. \u201cWill I have ears in my human form?\u201d Cait shrugged. \u201cMaybe, if you let them. And If you want, you can keep you antennas out as well. It is all your choice.\u201d Zack nodded. He liked being like this, but he has a job to do, and school, and his friends. Before he could think of anything else, his eyes began to close. Soon, he\u2019s off to sleep. Cait looked down at him and smiled. \u2018He looks so cute.\u2019 But then she frowned. \u2018But he has his life to think about. I can\u2019t keep him in my arms all the time.\u2019 She saw him curl up into a ball and clutched her dress, like a child. \u2018But just for tonight, let\u2019s let him live a nice childhood.\u2019 And with that, she carried him to her room, where she and Zack slept for the rest of the night.             <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Early the next morning, Zack awoke, with a splitting head ach. Looking around, he noticed that this wasn\u2019t his room, it was his mothers. Getting out of bed, he realized that his pants were on the bed post, not on his body. Quickly getting them on, Zack went downstairs to find his mom watching TV with a bowl of cereal. \u201cHello dear, how did you sleep?\u201d Cait said without looking away from the TV. \u201cDamn those ears.\u201d He mumbled to himself. \u201cI heard that.\u201d \u2018That\u2019s not good.\u2019 Sitting on the couch, Zack found a massive amount of catnip on the floor. \u201cMom, why is there catnip\u2026\u201d \u201cOn the floor?\u201d she interrupted him. He nodded. \u201cYou had a lot of fun last night, you should practice going into all your forms at some time.\u201d Cait was still looking at the TV, munching away. Zack was scared. \u201cSo, that wasn\u2019t a dream?\u201d Cait shook her head. \u201cNope.\u201d This was too much for Zack to take as he soon passed out. Cait looked at him and shrugged. Getting up, she went to the cumbered and grabbed a leaf of catnip and held it under Zack\u2019s nose. This did the trick, for he started to rub it all over his face. \u201cNow that you\u2019re awake, you should go get ready for work.\u201d He forgot all about work. \u201cAnd you have a message on your cell, it\u2019s from Mr. Raven, says he has a job for you.\u201d \u201cThanks mom.\u201d As Zack got ready, he could feel his head pound, which is probably from his ears wanting to come in. As much as he tried, he couldn\u2019t hold them back anymore. Zack closed his eyes, hoping that if he can\u2019t see it, they won\u2019t hurt. But what came in weren\u2019t his ears, it was his antennas. The two, hair covered antennas that he controlled. \u201cDamn.\u201d \u201cNO CUSSING IN THIS HOUSE!!!\u201d Cait yelled from the couch. \u201cSorry mom.\u201d With any luck, he could go on with his head like this. Once he was finished, Zack started to put his hair in a braid when Cait stepped in. \u201cYour antennas don\u2019t go with a braid, they go with your pony tail you had last night.\u201d Not wanting to make her mad, for she had his hair in her hand, she puts his hair up and into a pony tail. And Zack had to admit, it did look alright, but it kinda made him look a bit girly. After she was done, Zack said goodbye and left. Only to come back in seconds later to grab his sword. <br>\r\nAs Zack walked, he thought about last night. \u2018Was it all real? And can I do it again?\u2019 Rounding the corner, Zack saw his destination, his office. Zack spent most of his time here, in what used to be an old church, now renovated to accommodate for his needs. Upon entering, he noticed a man in his chair, but he was unable to see his face. Being Zack, who normally gets defensive first and then ask, pulls out \u00e9xtasis and pointed it at what he thought to be the man\u2019s head. \u201cWhoa, calm down son, it\u2019s me.\u201d Zack, no realizing who it was, felt a bit embarrassed about what he did. \u201cHow did you get in here? I locked the door.\u201d The man chuckled lifting a key. \u201cOh, right.\u201d Zack felt very small now (no pun), he had just raised his blade to his friend. \u201cZack,\u201d He started. \u201cdid you get my message?\u201d Zack nodded. \u201cYeah, so what\u2019cha got for me Raven?\u201d Mr. Raven smiled. He was an assertive man, tall, normally has a fine suit on, light brown hair, and eyes that could stop a mad gunner. <br>\r\n\u201cCall me Mr. Raven\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cYour job is your average bodyguard thing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, why a C-rank job?\u201d<br>\r\nMr. Raven sighed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a C-rank; it\u2019s a A-rank.\u201d This got Zack interested. Why would a bodyguard job be an A-rank level? \u201cWhat is it? Big boss, a dealer, who?\u201d Mr. Raven smile left his face as he pulled out a sheet of paper. \u201cThis note was pinned to my door last night, saying that a girl needs your help. She\u2019s being followed by-\u201cZack interrupted him. \u201cThis is a job for the cops.\u201d Mr. Raven handed him the note. \u201cShe being followed my some monsters. She has been a target for wild monsters, some summons, and a few half breeds.\u201d Zack thought about this for a monument. \u201cIf you do it, this client will pay you big time.\u201d This got Zack going. \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d Mr. Raven smiled, handing Zack a box. \u201cGood, and also, a package was on your door step.\u201d Zack looked at it with interest. Opening it, he could smell fresh cleaning supplies inside. Looking in, Zack eyes got big. His guns are back from the smith. Zack took pride in his weapons, but was really proud of his guns. A friend, before he died, made these two guns for him. A custom made job that was payment for Zack helping him. The guns were named the black and blue roses. Each gun looked like a old time six shooter, but had a custom grip, and double barrels. \u201cHow was last night?\u201d Mr. Raven was making a martini at the bar only for him. \u201cGood, had a strange thing happen last night.\u201d Zack said as he put his guns on the table. \u201cOh, is that why you have bangs that go out of your head and a pony tail?\u201d Zack looked up at his head, frowning. \u201cMaybe.\u201d Pulling out the thing holding his hair up, Zack let it all flow down. Zack never cut his hair; he let it grow down past his knees. \u201cMy mother did something last night.\u201d Mr. Raven looked over at him, his glass pouring hot liquid down his throat. \u201cSo you awakened then did you?\u201d This was a shock for him, wondering how Mr. Raven new about that? \u201cHow\u2026\u201d \u201cZack, I was the one who pulled you out, I help take care of you, so, I know more than you do.\u201d Now thing were making sense. \u201cThat\u2019s why you gave me all of these jobs, huh?\u201d Mr. Raven laughed, almost spilling his drink. \u201cNo, I gave them too you because it\u2019s your job to take them.\u201d Zack understood now, he was really watching over him, even though Mr. Raven wouldn\u2019t admit it. \u201cSo, are you like, my uncle?\u201d   \u201cNo, I\u2019m you middle man.\u201d Mr. Raven handed him a file from his jacket. \u201cThe girl should arrive around eleven \u2019o clock. Till then, here is another job for you.\u201d Zack looked over the file, and he didn\u2019t like it. \u201cI really hate you sometimes.\u201d He said as he threw the parchment at Mr. Raven. \u201cI know.\u201d And with that, he got up and left.            <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that gathering was not a skill of his. \u201cWhy are you doing it then? Is the pay good?\u201d Zack ran his fingers through his hair, sighing. \u201cYeah, but the problem is that I\u2019m not the one gathering.\u201d Now Cait was confused. \u201cI thought that you hated gathering?\u201d \u201cI do, it\u2019s just that I can do the job in over a minute, but I have to watch out for monsters while some dumbass priests do it.\u201d Zack stood up, rubbing his shoulder. \u201cYour shoulder bugging you?\u201d Cait asked. Zack nodded, walking over and sitting in front of her. Taking out the cream, Cait told him to take off his vest and shirt. Doing as he was told, Zack removed his garments and moved his hair over to the left side. On his right, was a arm made of auto mail, a robotic arm attached to his very nerves, making his arm movements the same as his old arm. Attached to his chest was a plate that concealed the spot that his arm connected to his body, and every now and then, it would start to rub and chafe his skin, and his fingers were too big to fit between the metal and his skin. Taking the ointment and putting some on her fingers, Cait moved her fingers into the space and rubbed the cream on his skin. As she did this, she couldn\u2019t help but remember how it happened.            <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years ago, Zack was one of the first kids to become First-class his school, and to complete his transition to first, he had to do a First-class job. His job was to find out what was killing local Popo, and stop it. When he got to a local farm, he saw a whole heard of Popo, lying in a pool of their own blood. When he went out to inspect it, he found a man with a giant knife, licking the blood off it. The man turned and saw him, and started to swing madly at Zack, forcing him to back up and trip over a Popo corpse. Just as the mad man was about to kill him, a fellow class mate, Sarah Garver, came and stopped the man\u2019s blade from killing him. The maniac kicked her over the Popo corpse and went after her. Zack was scared then, not for himself, but for her. Getting up, Zack ran as fast as he could, trying to get in front of the man. But when he did, the man had swung his knife, cutting off Zack right arm and taking half of his left leg. When the man heard the sound of flesh tearing, he stopped and looked down, seeing his prizes and took off with them in his arms, fleeing. When help came, he was taken to the hospital, where Sarah waited. When I arrived, he was still asleep, with Sarah was sitting next to him. When he awoke, he said nothing, except asking if Sarah was alright. Sarah had suggested that she give him auto mail to replace his missing limbs. And since then, he has had auto mail limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cait was done, Zack asked if he if she could give him something to eat before he left. Cait looked up at the clock. 3:00. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d When she got up, she could see that Zack\u2019s eyes had glazed over, a normal thing for him. When that happened, it meant that he was thinking about the past. \u201cZack,\u201d she nudged him. \u201cZack, wake up.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d Zack looked up at his mother\u2019s face, her sweet caring face. \u201cYou should get ready before you have to go, and take a coat.\u201d Zack smiled. His mom let him act like an adult, but she still treated him like a kid when she had to. After feeding him, Cait then went to the kitchen to clean when Zack yelled for her. When she went in, what she saw was too good. Zack had gone into his chibi form. \u201cMom, a little helps please?\u201d Cait just stood in the door way, giggling to herself. \u201cMom! I have to leave soon!\u201d Cait sighed, getting her necklace out. \u201cFine, but you need to learn to control your powers soon, or you\u2019re going to get yourself in a load of trouble some day.\u201d Zack gave his mother the stink eye. \u201cFine, can you please hurry up!\u201d   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
