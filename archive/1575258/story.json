            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ugh!\" You let out a snarl as you slammed the door to your house. This day had truly been a day from hell. You missed your bus and were late for class, forgot to do the essay for another, failed the recent literature midterm, and to top it all off, you lost your student card. \"Seriously, this day can suck it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, is that you?\" You heard your long-term boyfriend Chris calling from the kitchen. You had met at a house party in your first year of college and hit it off splendidly. The two of you had started dating shortly afterwards, and been together ever since. After you moved out of the dorms, you decided to rent a house together. Honestly, it was one of the few things that seemed to be going right lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris came out of the kitchen to see what was the matter. He was tall, with short blonde hair and blue eyes. A frequent gym goer, it was surprising to a lot of people that he was working towards his CPA in college, as he really didn't seem the type. He was also quite soft-spoken and laid back; perhaps too laid back, if you were honest. It was a good thing he had you to keep him on the straight and narrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled you into his arms, and you leaned up to give him a kiss. He pushed your shoulder length brown hair over your ears, and wrapped his strong arms around your small shoulders. As he pulled away, he looked into your green eyes and asked, \"Bad day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a soft snort. \"You have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffed the air, and looked at Chris accusingly. \"What's that smell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked a mite sheepish as he answered. \"That would be my homemade ravioli, with a side of garlic bread and brownies for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Chris, what did I say about carbs!?\" Again with this! You'd tried a number of times to make him understand why carbs were a bad thing, but the pasta junkie just refused to listen. \"If I keep eating like that, I'll be as big as Jenna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris rolled his eyes. He'd heard this argument a thousand times before. \"You're not going to gain 100 pounds from eating one plate of ravioli. You're built like a stick anyway, so it's not like it would hurt. What's enjoyable about eating like a rabbit, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes nearly bugged out of your head. \"I can't believe you said that to me! You want me to get fat, is that it!? You're jealous of Brad's land whale and want one of your own!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris' own temper was starting to flare a bit. \"Don't put words in my mouth. That is NOT what I said, and don't you dare attack Jenna like that just because you're mad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad and Jenna had been their friends almost as long as they'd been dating. Brad had been the star running back until he tore his Achilles tendon. Fortunately, he was far from just another dumb jock, and was currently working on his degree in Criminology, with plans to enter law enforcement after graduation. It was while he was recuperating that he met Jenna, who was assisting his physiotherapist at the time. After graduating with a degree in Kinesiology, she was currently working on her masters in order to become a physiotherapist herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the argument above suggested, Jenna was not a small woman by any stretch of the imagination. Nearly six feet tall, she weighed over 250 pounds. The weight was fairly evenly distributed around her body, though her booty and bust did take a bit more then their fair share. She had a pretty face framed by bright red hair, but this was all over-shone by her personality. It would have been simply impossible to find a kinder, sweeter woman in the world, and Chris was fully justified rising to her defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, you knew that your attack was unfair, but now that your dander was up, you refused to back down. \"Rising to her defense? What a shock. Heaven forbid you back your own girlfriend. I'm going to our room. You throw that filth away and make something healthy for the two of us. We're not building up our blubber to hibernate for the winter, like certain gingers I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stormed off to the bedroom and slammed the door shut behind you. Almost immediately, you started to tear up. <i>I shouldn't have said that,</i> you thought as tears ran down your face. But how could you apologize now? If you did, you'd look weak, and then who would make any decisions around here? Chris? He'd just agree with whoever had spoken last, and feed you carbs until you couldn't walk. No, you had to stay strong, stay thin, and never back down when you were right. Your Mom didn't, and your Dad left her for his 21 year old secretary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim, you pulled out your phone and checked facebook. Daddy Dearest had posted photos of his newborn son, bringing you up to a total of four half-siblings. <i>He and Mom only had me in ten years of marriage, and he has four with HER in less? And he smiles a lot more in these photos then he ever did with Mom.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw your phone across the room. <i>Mom gained ten pounds and he left her for some hussy half his age. I won't be weak. I won't, I won't, I won't!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stood in the kitchen, shaking with anger. Though he was usually pretty good at hiding his emotions, Amy had pissed him right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She had no right to speak like that,</i> he thought. Directly attacking him was one thing, but Jenna? The woman had come and picked them both up at 4 in the morning when their car had broke down on the back roads in the middle of winter, with only the directions \"just past the burned down barn\" to go by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris wasn't sure what to do. He loved Amy dearly; he even had his Grandmother's ring in a box hidden in the attic, ready for his planned proposal to her. But her personality could be so acidic when she got like this. She had a tongue like a razor, and was a total control freak. He couldn't have a long-term relationship with someone like that, no matter how much he loved her. But neither did he want to leave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Chris decided, there was only one thing left to try. He walked to the small den to retrieve a very different sort of ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the couple had moved into the house, Amy had proceeded to redecorate every room, but Chris had been adamant about the den. If he was only going to have one room, it was going to be this one. The den seemed like it had been transplanted straight from the Victorian era. Tall bookcases of dark wood and brass ran along the walls, and his Grandfather's old oak desk filled most of the floor space on one side. Chris went to the desk, drawing his key chain and unlocking the lower drawer. He pulled out a lacquered wood box and set it on the desktop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Grandparents had told him for years that his family was descended from magicians, findsmen, and oracles. Of course, he hadn't believed it, but if anything in his blood could help him out of the situation he currently found himself in, he'd change his tune in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlocking the box, he opened it up and revealed a whole bevy of magical paraphernalia. Rings, talismans, charms, and an old wand were filling the box to the brim. While it might be harsh, he was going to give Amy a taste of her own medicine. Make her see what it was like to live as what she hated, and hopefully she'd learn from it. Chris thought, <i>She may never forgive me for this. I hope she does, but she really needs this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what ring should he use?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris drew out a silver and black ring. Looking at the ring, he could see a series of designs running around the inside. The various images showed a young woman eating and gaining weight, from small to quite large. On the flat top, there was an image done in gold. Now, if he hadn't seen the images on the inner ring, he'd never have known what it was, but because he had, he knew it was the same woman grown to an immense weight. She'd nearly disappeared into her rolls of fat, and judging from the food in her hands and her open mouth, was still intending to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This seems like just the one I'm looking for,</i> he thought as he put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, he felt a jolt run through him. He was so startled, he nearly took the ring off in panic. It was only through sheer force of will that he kept it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, I think there might be something to Grandpa's stories.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris forced himself to calm down. He looked at the ring, and hesitated only a moment. It was time to put this plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the bedroom, you were wiping your tears away with a kleenex. Your crying had made your mascara run, and you wiped it off before you wound up looking like a raccoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about apologizing to Chris, but squashed that idea as soon as you had it. Backing down was simply not an option. He'd probably just refuse to throw out the ravioli like you told him to, but if that was the case, you'd just go to the health food restaurant downtown and have supper there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If he'd just listen, he wouldn't waste so much time and ingredients on stuff we won't eat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you wiped off the last of your makeup in the mirror. Honestly, it would be so much easier if he would listen. <i>He must seriously have a fat fetish or something. He knows I need to watch my figure. Hell, I think I'm already developing a double chin.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked in the mirror, you did notice that your neck seemed to be sporting a bit more flesh then it had before. In fact, was it... growing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes locked onto the small roll under your jaw bone, and you were certain that it was getting larger as you watched. <i>What the hell!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched, you became aware of other changes occurring to your body. You felt yourself rising in the air as your booty filled out. Your thighs first touched, then began to push themselves apart. Your belly, formerly flat and a bit bony, suddenly began to pooch outwards and spread across your lap with an audible groan. You felt your arms begin to thicken with fat, and your bra began to feel uncomfortably tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on!?\" You screamed as you rose to your feet, sending your stool flying across the room. As your clothes grew tighter and tighter, you promptly removed them as fast as you could, trying to save your expensive outfit before your growing body destroyed them. As you fattened up more and more, your legs were shaking so severely that you had to lean against the wall to support yourself. Adding insult to injury, your stomach let out an audible growl, demanding the level of food necessary to maintain a body this large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought you were going to go crazy, you felt the changes slow, and finally stop. You were nearly hyperventilating, and stood still for a moment, waiting for your mind to catch up and your body to stop jiggling. Much to your chagrin, the latter took a considerable amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just what was that!?</i> you mentally screamed as you stared at your new, doughy form. You were feeling more then a bit panicky at all this. <i>I have no idea what is going on! Why did I gain so much weight!? How much did I gain!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought that, you looked at your scale in the corner and decided to see just what damage had been done. You let go of the wall and made your way over to the scale. Walking with your new bulk proved to be an interesting challenge. With no time to get used to your newfound weight or proportions, you felt clumsy and awkward in the extreme. You kept your legs too close together and moved them too quickly, as opposed to the waddle someone of your build (rather bottom heavy) would naturally have adopted at your size. Your new flab wobbled and jiggled incessantly, and combined with your poorly chosen stance meant that you were on the verge of falling over more then a couple times while merely crossing the room. The fact you also felt tired from such a short distance was also worrisome. Unbeknownst to you, your muscles had not increased with your transformation, only your body fat, which meant your physique was woefully underwhelming when it came to supporting your increased girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting lightly from both fear and what was apparently strenuous physical activity, you turned on the digital scale. Once it lit up, you stepped on it with your eyes closed. After a few seconds, you finally had enough nerve to open them up again. Looking down, you read the scale. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The scale reads back only three letters to you: ERR<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, stepped off to reset it, then stepped on it again. Once again, the scale came back with the error code. You knew right then that either the scale was broken, or... <i>Oh, God, let the scale be broken!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fair bit of difficulty, you drop to your knees and pick up the scale. The whole process is an embarrassing, jiggly mess. Your thighs, hips, and belly constantly wobble with only the slightest movement. Sudden moves are accompanied with a loud slapping sound as your new apron belly smacks into your thighs, and the sheer scale of your frame makes bending in any direction more difficult then you would have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the scale in hand, you flip it over, and feel a chill go down your spine as you read these words: \"Max Weight: 325 Pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh. No.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can scarcely believe it. No way, absolutely no way, are you suddenly over 325 pounds. It's impossible, right? But as you look over your massively expanded features, you know that it is more then possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the scale on the floor, you slowly rise back to your feet. If you'd thought getting down here was painful enough, going back up again was even worse. After some effort, you managed to get your right foot sitting comfortably on the floor. Grabbing hold of your desk, you gave a quick count of three, then pushed up. It was such a disconcerting feeling, having your rolls of fat pressing against each other and your joints, trying their level best to push your body in ways you didn't want to go. It was officially the hardest time you'd ever had standing up, bar none. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're panting quite hard by this point, and the soreness in your limbs is shocking, to say the least. Your muscles definitely aren't made for moving this sort of load, and you decide to rest on your bed. A few shaky strides bring you to the edge, and you carefully turn, fearful of your terrible lack of balance. Once positioned correctly, you lower yourself as slowly as you can manage. You can feel your belly spreading across your newly enlarged lap as you bend forward, and your thighs touch the mattress far ahead of the rest of you. The final few inches go a fair bit faster then the first; a combination of gravity and inadequate musculature see to that, and your tush flops on the bed with a loud creak from the springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel from the bed just how big you are. Your booty forms a full-on shelf behind you, and seems to have taken on a decidedly rectangular shape. Your thighs are large enough that, despite your belly being big enough to reach your knees, they protrude flabbily beyond for several inches, at least. Your love handles are, from what you can tell, the size of footballs if not larger, and your back is divided into several large rolls. Your apron belly is divided into two large rolls along your belly button line, with a smaller third roll just underneath your breasts. Speaking of your breasts, they've also grown to a respectable size; or, rather, they would be respectable if they weren't being completely overshadowed by the rest of your gargantuan measurements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing off the parade of lard were your arms and face. Everything about your arms, from shoulder to wrist, was heavy with fat, and was rather tiring to move. And your face now sported a firm double chin and chipmunk cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now, simply put, enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? How did I get so fat? How fat am I?\" You honestly weren't expecting an answer, and you jumped quite a bit when you heard a voice from the door. Much to your annoyance, the jiggling of your fat was quite noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the first question, the answer is Me. And the second, my guess is 361 pounds, give or take a few. I was aiming for 271, literally a pound over Jenna's weight, but it seems it was misinterpreted as an additional 271 pounds of pure fat on top of your current weight. That's quite the load to carry at your height. I'm honestly impressed you can move unaided right now.\" Chris stood in the door, looking at your naked, corpulent frame in all its glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris? What? What are you talking about? What did you do!?\" You started to get angry, but promptly quieted down when you saw the look in his eyes. It was frightening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used magic to make you fat. Really fat, as it turned out.\" Your boyfriend walked in the room, and proceeded to walk around you. You felt like a side of beef in a supermarket, being judged by a customer. \"You carry it well, if that's any consolation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you have serious problems. Amy, I love you to death, but you're a judgemental control freak. If people don't agree with you, they're ignorant. If they don't do what you want them to, they're attacking you. And God forbid if they have an ounce of extraneous fat on their body, or actually want you to eat something other then celery.\" Chris stopped in his circle around you, and you could feel his eyes on your gigantic ass. \"Seriously, though, how big do you think your ass is? This shelf has to be two feet deep, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to turn around to look at him, but your oversized dimensions made that an exercise in futility. \"Please, Chris, please turn me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I'm sorry! I'll be better, I swear, just turn me back! Please! Eek!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a small shriek as you felt Chris' firm hand strike your bottom with a loud smack. Given how far behind you that felt, you suspect a two foot ass might be an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is a ripple effect,\" Chris said, clearly watching the reaction of your fat rolls. You feel his hand on your lardy body move as he walks around to face you. \"Anyway, you don't need to fret. I don't intend for this to be permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to smile with a small surge of hope, but that promptly dies when he holds up a finger. \"But you're going to need to do something first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't your voice has ever sounded so small as you asked, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need you to live like this for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, I can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can, and you will. At least until such time as I feel you've learned your lesson. Live the life of the fat girls you deride and mock. The timing couldn't be better; with you needing to get a new student card, your photo will be updated to the new you. That should help you avoid any serious trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the people I know!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about them? I can alter the memories of those closest to you just enough so that you were fatter from the word go, and you know almost no one on campus. You were so convinced of your own superiority that you wouldn't deign to talk to anyone unless you needed to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like crying again, because you knew Chris was right about that. You probably would have bawled right then and there if you could have heard his thoughts: <i>I can alter their memories to a point, at least. There is a limit on how much one can adjust, and she's so damn FAT right now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung your head in defeat. There was nothing else you could do at this point, and you knew Chris knew it. \"...just for now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put both his hands on your fat-stuffed shoulders, though you didn't raise your head. \"That's right. Go to class, come home, repeat. Hang out with friends, actually try to meet people, enjoy the little things in life for once. Don't plan everything down to the T. Don't be so judgemental about others, especially their weight. It'd certainly come off as hypocritical if you were at this point; honestly, you're the fattest woman I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour old temper certainly came to the fore at that remark. \"Well, whose fault is that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris didn't even hesitate in his answer. \"Yours. You have a poisonous element to your personality, and while I'm not so naive as to think there'll be an US after this, I know for a fact that, if you don't change, you're just going to drive away everyone you ever meet. The thought of you spending your life that way kills me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stepped back and looked at you in your entirety. \"I figure we'll move you down to the spare bedroom on the main floor. The stairs are fairly narrow and steep, and that seems like it's just asking for trouble. I'll swing out and get you some temp clothes so that you can grab a proper wardrobe on the weekend. Also, I should warn you: the spell is also designed to make you maintain your current weight. You'll suffer some rather severe hunger pains everyday until you hit a certain calorie threshold. You can theoretically lose the weight, but it would be nearly impossible. Even if you did, the spell would push you to gain right back to that level again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stepped forward a step, and reached out his hands. \"Now come on. Let's get you downstairs. You can start on the ravioli while I run to the store.\"</span></div></div>",

Weighing in at ninety pounds and at the stature of 5\u20191\u201d she both looks and feels as small as a middle school student. With the magical properties she has been blessed with, Amy focuses her powers on changing her own physical being. Only thinking of one thing. Larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo mystical glows or sounds emitted from the use of her powers. The growth just happens without any special effects. Amy\u2019s weight and height slowly began to rise with her eyes closed focusing on her power. The feeling of getting taller and gaining weight had come to her. The shorts around her waist became snugger in combination with her shirt pinching her upper torso. When she opened her eyes a different version of herself reflected in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph,\u201d Amy palms her new belly flesh, \u201dSo this is what it feels like.\u201d After countless times of subjecting unsuspecting individuals to sudden growth, being on the receiving end kind of feels\u2026nice. Amy sunk her hands into her stomach and wiggled her belly in glee, \u201cWhy hadn\u2019t I thought of making myself bigger before? Being small is for the birds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mirror, Amy smiles back at her rounder face. She feels her thicker neck and pokes around at her peeking double chin that hung around her face. Below, her size nine shoes burst off with the increasing size of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-maybe I should\u2019ve taken my clothes off.\u201d Amy blushed looking at her reflection. Her plump mammaries had occupied most of the tank top fabric and rested atop of her gut. She squished and fondled her breasts as she continued to take in her sudden changes. Tightly around her waist, her jean short shorts clung to her hips. So much of Amy grew that the bottom of her buttocks slipped from the jeans. Going from a scrawny butt to a full booty is going to take some getting used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s attention glued onto her body. Her new curves, the love handles pooling around her waist, the widening back and booty, and the increase in height?!? All of it felt so alluring. She poked and prodded the different expanses that grew onto her. Maybe she could even reach the top shelf without needing Chris\u2019 help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy takes a scrunchie from the drawer and ties her shoulder length hair into a pony tail. She swishes it around while doing a little dance in the mirror. Strangely, she feels a little more confident in herself. Perhaps this will give her the courage to have more say in the relationship between Chris and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she could get him over to her house now to assert herself better or Amy could improve her chances and grow herself even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy decides to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tiffany ordered huge amounts of high calorie food, huge platter of pasta, a 48oz steak, several orders of potato cakes, and bread rolls which she heavily buttered. Spectators watched on as Tiffany feverishly crammed food in her mouth, utterly astonished that such a thin woman would eat in such a gluttonous manner and even more astounded that she was so thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I take your dishes?\" asked the waiter staring at stacks of empty plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah oh and I'm ready to order dessert.\" Tiffany replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dessert?\" uttered the amazed waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'll take 3 slices of chocolate pie, some icecream, and a whole cheesecake.\" Tiffany ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"a-a whole cheesecake?\" the waiter confirmed seeing Tiffany nod her head shoving another buttered roll in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish\" said the waiter walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone has quite the appetite tonight\" smiled Alexander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggle \"You know you like it.\" smirked Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your dessert madam\" said the waiter bearing Tiffany's tremendous order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any hesitation,Tiffany dove right in ferociously consuming the sweet meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that was so delicious Alex.\" professed Tiffany showing no signs of weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad you liked it.\" replied Alex as he paid the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving home a devious smile emerged on Alex's face. Tiffany changed her clothes, removing her little black dress unveiling her slim figure, and putting on a much larger version of her dress. The loose dress hung off of Tiffany nearly falling right off. Tiffany then approached Alexander who licked his lips as he glared at his skinny wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I'm ready.\" said Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tiffany's thin body swelled up with copious deposits of jiggly fat.

Every inch of her body softened as it was smothered in fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now part two of our date can begin.\" Alex stated as he embraced his fat wife initiating intercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple enjoyed Alex's powers of size manipulation. Tiffany reveled in being a thin girl, but she loved food and intensely despised diets causing her to be pudgy. Alexander on the other hand adored obese women and had the magnificent fortune of possessing a power that enabled his to change peoples' sizes. This power gave the couple everything they wanted. Alex would keep Tiffany slim in public allowing her to eat anything she wanted and in private Tiffany would be Alex's fat wife with glee. Plus Alex's powers would provide other forms of pleasure for the couple such as fattening up annoying women or making himself taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a night of debauchery.... </span></div></div>",

Two piece swim suits that would slid right off of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany also shopped for plus sized outfits identical to her thinner ones to create a sexy comparison for Alex.
