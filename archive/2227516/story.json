You really didn't want to be there, but the money and tips were pretty good. Also the company while working wasn't bad either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was your boss Amy, 30 years old about 5'7\" brown hair and brown eyes she had an average body with a little bit of a gut but nothing crazy. She was pretty, and also a pretty great boss, being nice and genuine for the most part. Sometimes she would get a bit angry but she usually was playful and kind though she does go out and smoke quite a few cigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a young latin American girl named Alejandra who was around your age, she seemed about 5'6\" with a nice ass, jet black hair and tan skin. She was pretty nice and sassy, though you hadn't gotten to talk to her that much, you knew she was going to school for nursing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was 18 year old high school senior Bella. She was as feisty as she was pretty, with light brown hair tied back in a pony tail and piercing blu eyes with beautiful lips and perfect cheek bones, she was also equipped with a smoking hot body. you and her would playfully bicker and make each other do work but you at least felt like it was all in good fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also supposed to be a new girl in today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed it was just you and the girls today, so how did it happen?</span></div></div>",

Are you here yet?\" Amy shouts from the backroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, what's up?\" You reply. As you head into the backroom you see Amy leaning back at her little managers desk. Cluttered with schedules and food orders, pens and pencils and food wrappers. An open sandwich sits on her desk next to a coffee from a rival company no less, and her feet are out of their black flats and perched on a pile of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great I need your help you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\noption 1: \"I need you to go buy me some cigs from the corner store across the street\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\noption 2: \"Bella has been having trouble with her insoles, do you think you could help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\noption 3: \"I need you too rub my feet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\noption 4: \"We are experimenting with a new kind of sandwich\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh great!\" Amy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait I didn't -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly I can't thank you enough seeing as Bella is our youngest staff member and also the newest its great to see fellow co workers supporting each other. Well in your case supporting her full weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy said as she cut you off and went rummaging through her desk, she clearly had no intention of letting you back out of this. Though you never even agreed to anything, It seems like Amy took your lack of flat out refusal as a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then pulled a small envelope out of her desk drawer that read SHRINK REMOTE. She proceeded to tear it open and pull out a small remote like device and point it directly at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright light strikes your eyes and a weird tingling sensation rushes through your entire body. It takes you a few moments but when you come back to your senses your nostrils are assaulted with a pungent aroma and you look forward realizing its origin. You are now no taller then your boss Amys sweaty black flats positioned directly infront of you. You are completely stunned and in shock with no idea how to process this information. Amy stares down at you grinning, and then lifts her feet off of her desk slamming them down to the floor on either side of you. This causes a slight tremor for you and you fall back onto your ass. She begins wiggling her toes up and down as she watches you try to come to terms with your new size.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After you had clocked in, you walked to the register to wait for customers. As you got to the counter though, you soon noticed a strange glass. You didn't remember seeing it before when you came in and there didn't seem to be anybody around right now. You picked it up and examined it closer. The drink had a dark green color to it. The smell was nice and alluring. You lifted it up to your mouth to taste it. Though you were only planning on taking a sip, you found yourself unable to resist the taste. It was really good and made you desire more. It only took a few seconds to finish it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the glass down and gave a sigh. You started turning towards the cash register once more when your stomach started to cramp up. You placed your hand on the table for more balance and tried to breathe. Perhaps it wasn't a good idea to chug that drink down, especially without finding out what it was. You couldn't take a step before you suddenly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you felt weird. You sat up and looked around. You immediately notice that everything is much bigger now. You seemed to be the size of a bug and your clothes didn't shrink with you. You needed to figure out something before the situation got any worse. After thinking about it for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: You decided to climb up the counter and wait for somebody to arrive. Though it would be difficult, you figured it would be safer than staying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: You decided to head into the back to find someone. Though it wouldn't be very safe, you didn't want to wait around for someone to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Before you finished deciding on a plan, Bella suddenly appeared. She noticed the clothes on the ground but didn't see you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 4: Before you finished deciding on a plan, Amy suddenly appeared. She noticed the empty glass and bent down to find you.</span></div></div>",
