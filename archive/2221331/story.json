I just recently discovered I am a familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fantasy, a familiar is an animal, likely a cat or crow that possesses unimaginable magical power. While they can not use it, they can grant some or all of it to a witch or her coven to greatly increase their powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my case, I have unimaginable reserves of strength, energy, speed and endurance I cannot access. However, I can grant some or all of these reserves to a person or group I happen to befriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI first realized this at the first senior football game of the school year. The football players treated me as one of their own during practice. I came to know them quite well and befriend them. Each member roughed up my hair for luck on their way in to the game as I was their 'towel boy' for that year. They went on to earn a flawless victory, literally plowing through the other team's defenses as if they had become berserkers in combat. I do not know how I knew it was me giving them strength, I just knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy only fear was what would happen if anyone found out...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",
