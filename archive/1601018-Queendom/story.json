Vern wakes up with his eyes still shut, \u201cYeah what is it?\u201d asked Vern. \u201cIts my first day\u201d answered Susie. Vern opened his eyes and saw that she was wearing a uniform that looked like it belong to a witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right...\u201d said Vern as he sat up and got out of bed. \u201cWell brother? Are you going to wish me luck?\u201d asked Susie as she crossed her arms. \u201cOf course sis, hope it goes well\u201d answered Vern as he moved up and hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...I better hurry, don't forget to do the shopping\u201d said Susie as she broke free from Vern's hug and rushed out of the house. \u201cOf course\u201d said Vern as he got changed, took the money that was in the money pot and headed off towards the local shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vern was walking down the streets, he looked around the area and noticed that he might be the only man left inside the village as everywhere he look, there was women. Some of them looked at him as if he was some sort of outsider. Which if you think about it, he kinder is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this sort of this doesn't bother him as he entered the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he bought the things he need, he left the shop and headed home. As he was walking home, he spotted a woman dressed highly as if she were rich. Thinking nothing of it, Vern carried on walking till he heard the scream from the rich looking woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over and saw that a man with a knife in hand were trying to steal the bag that she were carrying. Vern dashed over to the man and whacked him on the head with the bag in Vern's hand. The thug looked at Vern as Vern kicked him in the stomach. The thug dropped onto his kneels along with the knife, and then at the woman before he ran off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d said the woman as she smiled at Vern. \u201cYour welcome...are you okay?\u201d asked Vern as he picked up his bag of shopping. Before the woman could answer, the sound of another woman shouted out, \u201cWhat do you think your doing!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVern and the woman looked towards the direction that the voice came from and saw that it was a woman wearing a uniform wielding a sword in her right hand. As the woman got up to the rich looking woman, she aimed her sword at Vern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVern put his hands up and asked, \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d \u201cDon't speak to me as if you got right\u201d snapped the woman with the sword. \u201cBut he has got right\u201d said the rich woman as she looked at her. \u201cMy highness?\u201d asked the woman as she still looking at Vern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHighness?\u201d asked Vern. Upon saying that the woman moved her sword towards his neck. \u201cLucinda please stop that, this man saved my life\u201d said the woman as she tried to get her to lower her sword.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaved your life, I told you to stick by me\u201d said Lucinda as she looked at her. \u201cThat's my bad but please can you lower the sword to my hero\u201d said the woman. With that Lucinda lowered her sword and looked at Vern with angry eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I speak?\u201d asked Vern as he was kinder scared at the eyes that she was giving him. \u201cSpeak\u201d ordered Lucinda. \u201cMay I go home please\u201d answered Vern. \u201cFlee worm\u201d snapped Lucinda as she pointed down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don't to him like that\u201d said the woman as Vern walked towards his home. \u201cIts best that we return to the castle princess\u201d said Lucinda as she turned the other way. Vern stopped in his steps when he heard the word princess. \u201cPrincess...I saved Princess Josefina\u201d said Vern as he looked back and saw the two woman walking off. He spotted Josefina looked back at him and waved, Vern took a moment before waving back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment, Vern's life changed forever as he carried on walking home. </span></div></div>",

How was your day?\u201d answered Vern as he began eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I learnt many things about Runes. By the way, have you heard the news?\u201d answered Susie. \u201cWhat news that then?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at her. \u201cThey say that Princess Josefina was almost a victim to a thug within the village\u201d answered Susie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, what happened?\u201d asked Vern as he knew what happened. \u201cThey say that she was saved by a man. I guess that there are still good men in Queendom...beside you of course\u201d answered Susie as she smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them were finishing off eating, there was a knock on the door. Vern went off and answered it, \u201cYes\u201d said Vern before he knew who it was at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there was Lucinda along with Josefina. \u201cGoing to let us in maggot?\u201d asked Lucinda as she looked at Vern with those angry eyes again. \u201cOf course, how rude of me, please come on in\u201d  said Vern as he allowed the two of them in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them entered the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d said Susie as she covered her mouth with her hands. \u201cGreetings\u201d said Josefina as she waved at her. \u201cWhy is the princess in our house?\u201d asked Susie. \u201cI like to ask the same thing too\u201d said Lucinda as she looked at Vern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren't that easy to find hero\u201d said Josefina as she smiled at Vern. \u201cHero...what does she mean by that?\u201d asked Susie as she looked at Vern. \u201cVern is my hero\u201d answered Josefina as she moved towards Vern and kissed him on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god...are you saying that Vern is the man that save the princess\u201d said Susie. \u201cWell that's the story...beside, why are we here princess?\u201d asked Lucinda as she looked at her. \u201cI like to give back the favour for my hero\u201d answered Josefina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of favour?\u201d asked Vern. \u201cI'm going to let you work at the castle\u201d answered Josefina as she smiled at Vern. \u201cWhat?\u201d said all three of them. \u201cWhat do you mean working at the castle?\u201d asked Lucinda as she looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means what its means, I'm allowing my hero to serve under me\u201d answered Josefina as she looked at Vern. \u201cBut...but...wasn't the law state that men aren't allowed to do anything, like a job\u201d said Vern.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you are going to work for me and if anyone else doesn't like it then, it doesn't matter. You are going to live at the castle with me\u201d said Josefina. \u201cVern's going to live at the castle...may I as well\u201d asked Susie. \u201cOf course you can\u201d answered Josefina. \u201cOh I'm not going to like this\u201d said Lucinda as she shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be like that!\u201d said Susie as she looked at her. \u201cOh shut up and lets get going\u201d said Lucinda as she left the house. \u201cCome on then\u201d said Josefina as she held Vern's hand. \u201cHay wait up!\u201d said Susie as she grabbed her hat and left the house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lucinda entered last and stayed quiet all through the trip, giving Vern the evils.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four of them were heading towards the castle, Vern felt like he was really out of place. \u201cSo how did you manage to find Vern?\u201d asked Susie as she looked at Josefina. \u201cWho do you think you are asking the princess like you got right\u201d snapped Lucinda. \u201cCan you please loosen up\u201d said Josefina as she had a cross look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me princess\u201d said Lucinda as she looked at the floor of the carriage. \u201cWow, so ho did you find Vern?\u201d asked Susie as she looked at Lucinda with a smile across her face. \u201cIt was easy really, Vern was the only man that was living within the village and after a few questioning I found out where he lives\u201d answered Josefina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess...what is it that you want me do as your servant?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at her. \u201cOh you just have to do everything I say, that's all\u201d answered Josefina as she looked at him. \u201cOh Okay then\u201d said Vern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them just sat there waiting to arrive at the castle which happened within an hour. \u201cThere it is Vern, your new home\u201d said Josefina as she looked outside the window and saw the castle in plain view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that's huge!\u201d said Susie as she was impressed at the sight. \u201cHmm, take that it that a low life like you never seen anything bigger than your little house\u201d laughed Lucinda as she looked at her. Josefina looked at her with angry eyes which to Vern's surprise worked as she kept quiet for the remainder to ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the carriage arrived at the gates of the castle. As they all went out,  a group of women dressed in maid outfits walked towards them. They all looked at Vern thinking as if it strange for a man to riding with the princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome home your highness\u201d the group said as they each took a bow. \u201cThank you, can one of you escort my guests to their room\u201d said Josefina as she smiled at them. \u201cPlease, come this way\u201d said one of the maids as she smiled at Vern and Susie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two of them followed her while Josefina, Lucinda and rest of maids walked off elsewhere within the castle. \u201cCan you please tell me what you were doing alone at that village?\u201d asked Lucinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you before didn't I?\u201d asked Josefina as she looked at her and saw that she shock her head. \u201cI don't know really, I had this strange feeling that I was meant to have gone there\u201d answered Josefina. \u201cCould it have something to do with the runes?\u201d asked Lucinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosefina looked at the back of her right hand and looked at a mark that shaped liked a sun. \u201cPerhaps, it might be by chance or by fate that I met Vern. If it was by fate, then I hope he bares the other\u201d answered Josefina. \u201cEither way princess, you have to convince the queen when she gets back into keeping him within the castle\u201d said Lucinda as she looked at the rune on Josefina's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen the more reason that he should have the other rune. I hope the maid can report back to me that he is the barer\u201d said Josefina. \u201cAnd if he's not?\u201d\u201d asked Lucinda as she saw that they were heading towards Josefina's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf not then, he will be living here as long as I will it\u201d answered Josefina as she smiled at her. Lucinda stood within the hallway as she saw the princess and the maids enter the bedroom. \u201cDam...I'm so not going to like this\u201d said Lucinda as she shook her head as she walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile within the guest room, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I cannot believe that we're living within the castle of Queendom\u201d said Susie as she looked out of the room's window and saw the area that shrouded the castle. \u201cYeah me too, I wasn't expecting much but to live within the castle...it feels kinder strange\u201d laughed Vern as he stood next her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh is something wrong?\u201d asked Susie as she noticed that Vern was starching the back of  his left hand. \u201cEverything is fine, come on then, lets see if we are allowed to wonder the castle\u201d answered Vern as he stopped starching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease guests, rest for the night, its getting late for a wonder about\u201d said the maid as she was standing by the entrance of the room. \u201cOkay, thank you. What time does everyone get up?\u201d asked Vern.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone wakes up at eight O'clock sharp, do you two wish to waken by then?\u201d answered the maid. \u201cPlease\u201d said the two of them. \u201cAs you wish\u201d said the maid as she took a bow before leaving. With that the two of them headed into their beds and slowly fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Vern, something was shining on the back of his left hand as it was in the  shape of a crescent moon.     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Vern couldn't even sleep. He was worried about as to why he, the only man within the castle. Along with the fact that the back of his left hand was itching him like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sunlight began to shine through the shadows of the curtains of the room, Vern stood up  and got himself changed. As he was wearing his clothes, he don't know why, but to him it felt like it was loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to take a tour around the castle, Vern left the bedroom and walked down the corridor. As he was walking down the corridor, he could hear the sound of footsteps coming from behind. Vern stopped in his tracks and looked back and saw that there was no one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u201d said Vern as he turned back round to carry on walking. \u201cYou know its rude not say hello right?\u201d asked a female's voice. Vern stopped again and looked back and saw that there was no one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm right here\u201d said the voice that was behind him. Vern looked back and saw an eighteen year old woman with purple hair. \u201cErm...hello\u201d said Vern. \u201cHello, nice to meet you...erm?\u201d said  the woman. \u201cVern, Vern Byrd\u201d answered Vern as he stuck his hand out for her shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlora Ashley, nice to meet you hero\u201d said the woman as she shook his hand.  \u201cSo I guess you heard about me then\u201d said Vern as he let her hand go. \u201cOh please, tell me a woman that doesn't know that lives inside the castle\u201d said Flora as she smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally...I'm that famous\u201d said Vern as he scratch the back of his head. \u201cOf course you are, and that you are the first man that's not married to the royal to be living in the castle\u201d said Flora as she turned round and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHay erm\u201d said Vern. Flora stopped walking and looked back with a smile. \u201cYou don't suppose you could show me around?\u201d asked Vern. Flora placed her index finger on her chin and said, \u201cWell, its not really my place to give you the grand tour but I can show you something that's better\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally thank you\u201d said Vern as the two of them walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them entered up on the roof of the castle. \u201cWow\u201d said Vern as he looked out at the view that the rooftop gave him. \u201cPretty yes?\u201d asked Flora as she looked out at the sunrise which was mixed with the clouds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery\u201d said Vern as he looked up. Just then, the two of them could hear the sound of a sword clashing into another sword. The two of them looked towards the direction of the sound and saw Lucinda with her sword in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's the training ground for all soldiers that serve under the queen\u201d said  Flora  as the two of the walked towards the edge of the rooftop to get a better look. \u201cIs she always that serous?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at Flora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery, she and the princess and pretty much the best of friends. And well, due to the way she grew up under the queen's wing caused her to pretty much hate men\u201d said Flora as she looked back at Vern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u201d said Vern as he looked back at Lucinda as she swung her sword with another woman whom also wielded a sword. \u201cWell then, best for you to return to your room so that you can get the grand tour\u201d said Flora as she walked off the rooftop. Vern followed her.  </span></div></div>",

Vern looked at the direction and saw that it was a tall woman whom was wearing a long white coat, black high heels, short glasses. The woman has long cyan hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe we haven't met\u201d said the woman as she pushed her glasses up.  \u201cI'm Vern Byrd\u201d said Vern as he held his hands out. The woman shock Vern's hand and said back, \u201cThe name's Cecile Ortiz, I'm the doctor of the palace\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVern noticed the way Cecile was talking to him, it was as if she didn't mind that he was a guy. \u201cIn case your wondering, I don't mind about you being a man\u201d said Cecile as she took her hand back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVern needs to get back to the guest room in time for the tour\u201d said Flora as she was trying to get Vern to leave with her. \u201cOh that's alright, I just informed the princess that Vern needs a check up. So's there need to hurry back\u201d said Cecile as she walked towards Vern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why do I need a check up for?\u201d asked Vern as Cecile held his left arm. \u201cWell its to see  if you are in top shape to be the princess' servant\u201d answered Cecile as she smiled at him. Vern couldn't tell why but something seems to be off, Vern is a tall man but noticed that Cecile was almost as tall as him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Flora gave a shrug and said, \u201cOkay then, see you two later then\u201d  Cecile led Vern to her office. \u201cWhy don't you take a seat while I get everything ready\u201d said Cecile as she walked to her table while Vern too a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few tests, which shows that Vern was in tip top shape. All that was left was to take his measurements. \u201cOkay then Vern, before I let you go I need to get your measurements\u201d said Cecile as she stood next to a measurement scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVern took his shoes off and stood next to the scale. Cecile began to do the measurement, once done, she wrote it down and said, \u201c5'7...strange\u201d \u201cI'm sorry what?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at her with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're 5'7, based on your last check up...it says that were 5'9\u201d answered Cecile  as Vern put his shoes back on. \u201cWhat...how is that possible?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at her.  \u201cWell, seeing as how you are the only man in the village...the female doctor that checked you properly didn't do right due to the fact that you're a man\u201d answered Cecile as she walked back to her table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I think I think about it, she did seem like she wanted me leave her office  as fast as possible\u201d said Vern. \u201cYou are in good shape, Vern. Just don't worry about the height confusion. Okay then, time for your tour\u201d said Cecile as she walked next to Vern .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two of them headed towards the guest room where they saw, Josefina, Lucinda and Susie waiting outside. \u201cAh, the maggot returned\u201d said Lucinda as she looked at Vern and Cecile walking towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucinda...we talked about this\u201d said Josefina as she looked annoyed. \u201cI'm sorry\u201d said Lucinda as she looked at the floor. \u201cSeeing as how Vern is to become your servant, what am I to do here?\u201d asked Susie as she looked at Josefina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got a job as a Runologyist right?\u201d asked Cecile as she looked at her. \u201cHuh, how did you know?\u201d asked Susie as she looked at her. \u201cI was informed, anyway aren't you? \u201c answered Cecile. \u201cWell, I'm just a Runologyist in training\u201d said Susie. \u201cWell, if its alright with the princess,   I'm willing to teach Susie how to use Light Runes\u201d said Cecile as she looked at  Josefina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's really up you Susie\u201d said Josefina as she looked at Susie. \u201cWow...thanks, I love to\u201d answered Susie as she smiled at everyone. \u201cWell then, since everyone is here, show I get to show you all around\u201d said Josefina as she led the way.

After a few hours of showing the place, the three them headed back to the guest rooms and then they heard a voice shout out, \u201cPrincess!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them looked at whom spoke and saw that it was Lucinda walking towards them. \u201cYes what is it?\u201d asked Josefina. \u201cIts the Queen, she has returned\u201d answered Lucinda as she looked a bit happy. Josefina knew why she was smiling as there would be a great chance that Vern would be kicked out of the castle or worst, being sent to jail for the remainder of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is mother?\u201d asked Josefina. \u201cShe's at the throne room listening to the requests of her guest\u201d answered Lucinda as she walked off towards the throne room. Josefina looked at Vern and said, \u201cIts best that you stay in your room for the time being\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, how come?\u201d asked Vern as he was confused at her statement. \u201cPlease, it would be best that mother doesn't see you before I say anything to her\u201d answered Josefina as she walked off. \u201cOh...okay then\u201d said Vern as he and Susie entered the guest room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosefina and Lucinda both entered the throne room. There they saw the Queen, whom looks a lot like Josefina but slightly older with a slash of gray in her hair. Josefina's mother goes by the name of Celina.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back mother, how was the meeting Sandby?\u201d asked Josefina as she walked towards her. \u201cWait one moment please, carry on\u201d answered Celina as she didn't look at her daughter but looked at the guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guest was a woman with long blond hair that reaches to her waist worn a black tail coat that pianists wear along with blue trousers as well as black high heel boots. \u201cThank you Queen, I believe that everything is accounted for, give me what I want and you shall get what you want\u201d said the guest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it is a deal Lucus. I shall have it ready when you return\u201d said Celina with a smile on her face. \u201cThank you, then I shall return in a week\u201d said Lucus as she took a bow, stood up and then left. \u201cMother...may I ask what that was about?\u201d asked Josefina as she walked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina looked at her and answered with a smile on her face, \u201cNo, you may not\u201d \u201cOh, okay then, then about my first question\u201d said Josefina. \u201cWell the meeting with the other royals didn't go as planned\u201d answered Celina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you mean?\u201d asked Josefina. \u201cIt means that the war that Nooj have started might reach here  within months. So Lucinda, its best to get the rest of soldiers ready\u201d answered Celina. \u201cAs you wish\u201d said Lucinda as she took a bow and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something daughter of mine?\u201d asked Celina as she noticed that she was still in the room. \u201cIts just that yesterday...I almost got attack\u201d answered Josefina. \u201cOh my poor daughter, are you okay?\u201d asked Celina as she stood up from her throne and hugged Josefina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm, I'm fine I was save by a guy called Vern and to reward him I allowed him serve under me\u201d said Josefina very fast hoping that she wouldn't get mad. \u201cI'm sorry, what did you say?\u201d asked Celina. \u201cI was saved by a guy called Vern\u201d said Josefina hoping that she wouldn't ask the thing goes next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, I heard that one, the thing you said next\u201d said Celina as she looked at her daughter. Josefina looked at the floor and answered, \u201cMy reward for him to serve under me\u201d \u201cThat what I thought, you know how I feel about men working in the castle\u201d said Celina as she left her go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you allowed father to stay here\u201d said Josefina. \u201cYes that was when we were married, did you really think I wouldn't notice a man living in my castle\u201d answered Celina as she walked back to her throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mother, I believe that he is the one\u201d said Josefina as she walked towards her. \u201cThe one what?\u201d asked Celina. \u201cThe one with the other rune, just like the one father once had before he died\u201d answered Josefina. \u201cIf you really think that he is the one, then please show me otherwise, he shall be kicked out\u201d said Celina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I shall do that\u201d said Josefina as she left the throne room as Lucinda entered. \u201cLucinda, if the boy that has the rune is true...make his life here a living hell\u201d said Celina as she looked at her.

As she was walking she heard the sound of someone eating an apple. Josefina looked towards where the noise came from and saw the woman that was just inside the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u201d said Lucus as she still have her mouth full. Josefina stopped walking and looked at her and saw that Lucus was leaning against the wall with her left foot on the wall along with a purple apple in her right hand. \u201cHello\u201d said Josefina back as she was about to carry on walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful day isn't it\u201d said Lucus which stopped Josefina from walking. \u201cIt is\u201d said Josefina as she tried to walk away. \u201cWar is coming\u201d said Lucus as she put her left foot down on the floor. Josefina looked at her with a confused look. \u201cIs it really?\u201d asked Josefina as she sounded worried. \u201cOh yes, yes indeed. It shall come so very soon, closer than you think\u201d answered Lucus as she walked up to her taking another bite from her apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d asked Josefina as she took a step back. \u201cWell, you understand in due time. Oh by the way, best use this\u201d answered Lucus as she handed Josefina a pocket compass. Josefina looked at it and noticed that the arrow keeps on spinning 360, this makes her think its broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts broken\u201d said Josefina as she looked back and saw Lucus walking off taking another bite off her apple. \u201cI said its broken!\u201d shouted Josefina. \u201cIts not for you silly princess, make sure the moon bearer use it when you see him\u201d shouted Lucus without looking back. Josefina looked at Lucus as she saw her walking out from her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Josefina rushed off towards the guest room and saw Vern sitting on his bed. \u201cPrincess?\u201d was all Vern could say as Josefina rushed in towards him and placed her hands onto his shoulders. \u201cVern...can I ask something\u201d said Josefina as her face was close to his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...what is it?\u201d asked Vern as he was kinder nervous of being very close to the princess. \u201cDo you have a Rune on you?\u201d answered Josefina. \u201cA Rune...what are you talking about?\u201d asked Vern as Josefina let him go. \u201cA Rune, a Rune that's shaped like a moon. You have something like that on you?\u201d answered Josefina as she grabbed hold of Vern's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Vern could answer, an aqua light shaped like a crescent moon shinned on the back of Vern's left hand. Josefina looked at the Rune and then looked at Vern with a smile across her face. Vern didn't know why but he felt something like a heartburn inside his chest for only a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me\u201d said Josefina as she pulled Vern up onto his feet. As Vern was being dragged, he noticed that his clothes were a bit more loose. He even noticed that Josefina was slightly taller than before but he only lay it off as if she was wearing high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josefina dragged Vern inside the throne, Lucus was standing by the corner of the corridor that leads to the throne room. She looked on with a smile and she walked off whistling out of the palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go mother\u201d said Josefina as she walked towards Celina. Josefina stuck Vern's left hand towards Celina whom just looked at hand and said, \u201cSo he has it daughter, so he has\u201d \u201cWell done maggot, you've just won yourself a room\u201d said Lucinda as she walked towards Vern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVern looked at Lucinda as he has a feeling that the events that are to come are going to be trouble.</span></div></div>",

Just then there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them looked at it and saw Josefina enter. \u201cMorning...how are feeling today?\u201d asked Josefina with a smile on her face. Vern sat up and answered, \u201cI'm feeling better than yesterday\u201d \u201cGlade to hear that...hope you don't feel anymore heart burns\u201d said Josefina as she remembered that Vern was complaining about it after everyone learnt that he had the rune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVern stood up and noticed that something was odd about Josefina; thinking about it, he noticed something odd with Susie as well. \u201cYou okay?\u201d asked Josefina as she saw Vern looking confused. Josefina touched Vern's right shoulder, with this, Vern felt a tingle at the sole of his feet. \u201cBest go see Cecile\u201d said Susie as she saw that Vern didn't look good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay...I shall go see her\u201d said Vern as he smiled at the two of them. With that he left the room, leaving Josefina and Susie. Josefina took out the pocket compass that Leigh gave her the day before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's that then?\u201d asked Susie as she saw the compass. \u201cHuh oh, its just something that's meant to be for Vern\u201d answered Josefina as she showed her the compass. Susie looked at the compass and saw that the arrow on it was spinning a full three sixty. \u201cHuh...is it broken?\u201d asked Susie as she looked at Josefina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not sure...I was told to give this to Vern\u201d said Josefina as she put the pocket compass away. \u201cAre you going to give it to him?\u201d asked Susie as she saw the princess was walking towards the entrance. \u201cOf course, after she finished cheeking on Vern I'm going to give him it\u201d answered Josefina as she smiled at her as she left the room. </span></div></div>",

Vern was sitting on a chair as he looked at the doctor whom was walking left and right. Cecile goes through her notes and every now and then she looked at Vern and then back at the notes. \"I've been getting these pains, like heart burns\" answered Vern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heart burn is it...hmm...that would explain it\" said Cecile as she wrote something down on the clipboard. \u201cWhat? What does that mean?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at her. \u201cHmm...oh it means that the effects are kicking in\u201d said Cecile as she was still writing. \u201cWhat effects?\u201d asked Vern. \u201cThe effects of the Runes, Josefina has a full Sun Crest Rune while you whom is the new bearer of only have a fourth of the Luna Crest Rune\u201d answered Cecile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat effects!\u201d snapped Vern as he stood up from the chair. Cecile stopped writing and looked at Vern. It took a moment before Vern noticed that something was different. Cecile saw that Vern knew what was going on in his head. She took a deep breath before she said, \u201cShrinking...you are shrinking Vern\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean I'm  shrinking?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at Cecile as he saw that she was standing a little taller than he last saw her. \u201cWell then, think of it like this. When its night, the moon is the strongest and when it day the sun is the strongest. During the day the moon can be seen but it isn't at its strongest because the sun engulfed the moon. The moon will become over shadowed by the sun\u201d said Cecile as she put her clipboard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at her. \u201cWhat I'm saying is that the two runes act  like the sun and moon. The only way the two are even is when the dusk and the dawn blend together becoming the twilight\u201d said Cecile as she carried on talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwilight? Why are you telling me this?\u201d asked Vern. \u201cBecause the two sides must be whole; other wise bad things will comes\u201d answered Cecile as she sat down. \u201cWhat bad things?\u201d asked Vern. \u201cThe things that are to come is something that I do not know but what I do know is that we need to fill that rune of yours\u201d answered Cecile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do we do that then?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at Cecile standing up. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. \u201cCome on in\u201d said Cecile as she looked at the door. The door opened and in came Josefina. \u201cAh princess, what can I do for you?\u201d asked Cecile as Josefina was walking towards her and Vern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts just that I couldn't help but over hear about runes\u201d answered Josefina as she looked at the the back of her right hand. There was a faint markings of a sun on her hand. \u201cIts just that...am I the cause of Vern's shrinking?\u201d asked Josefina as she looked at Vern. \u201cDon't worry...I'm sure everything will be alright if we can fill my rune\u201d said Vern as he looked at the back of his left hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh that's right...this belongs to you\u201d said Josefina as she took out the spinning compass. The two of them saw that the arrow was spinning 360. \u201cBelongs to me?\u201d asked Vern as Josefina handed the compass to him. As Vern looked at the compass, he saw that the arrow stopped spinning as it was pointed north west. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...the arrow...stopped\u201d said Vern as he showed the woman the compass. \u201cWhat the?\u201d said Josefina as she took the compass from Vern. From that moment the arrow began to spin 360 again . Josefina showed the others this. \u201cStrange...\u201d said Cecile as she took the compass off Josefina which was still spinning. Cecile then looked at Vern and handed him the compass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrow stopped spinning and pointed towards north west again. \u201cI thought so\u201d said Cecile as she looked at the compass and took it off him. The arrow began to spin again. \u201cThe compass only seem top work when ever Vern holds it\u201d said Cecile as she handed the compass back to him. \u201cSo that what she meant\u201d said Josefina to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that princess?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at her. \u201cOh its nothing, nothing important\u201d answered Josefina. \u201cWell then...shall we see how tall you are?\u201d asked Cecile as she picked up her clipboard and walked towards markings on the wall. \u201cWha?\u201d was all Vern could say. \u201cCome on...we need to know how tall you and see if we can cover your height loss from others\u201d  said Cecile as she looked at him as he walked towards the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVern took his shoes off and stood with his back against the wall. Cecile looked at the wall and wrote down Vern's new height. \u201cWell...how tall is he?\u201d asked Josefina as she walked next to her. Cecile showed Josefina the writings. \u201cWhat....what is it?\u201d asked Vern as he looked at the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, I think we can cover this\u201d answered Cecile as she showed him the height which is 5'5. Vern has lost four inches. \u201cWha...what do I do know?\u201d asked Vern as he put his shoes on. \u201cIts best that you begin your first day while I work things out with what the filling of the rune\u201d answered Cecile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on then, Vern...lets begin our first day together\u201d said Josefina as she smiled at Vern.
