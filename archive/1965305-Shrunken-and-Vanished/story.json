It felt like you had been hit on the head and dragged through sharp stones.  \"That wasn't a magic apple, it was a drugged apple.\"  This wasn't the first time you woke up in an unfamiliar place, so like always you peered around for landmarks.  As you turn around, you see something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...  That woman is massive!  She's as tall as a building!\"  And indeed she was.  Sitting on a equally massive couch was a woman bigger than anything you'd ever seen.  \"The apple was magic...  Excuse me!  Miss!  Down here!  Can you hear me?\"  You called to her, and it seemed like she noticed.  Her hand, which was big enough to crush you three times over, came rushing towards you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And shoved right past to pick up a tall glass of water.  You were sent tumbling onto your butt, shocked and confused.  \"Excuse me miss, but I need some help, and that was quite rude.  Can you please help?\"  You began to ask this when a bigger problem emerged.  From below the table, the mystery girl swung her feet up and heavily set them right next to where you were standing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your human sciences class, you had recently gone over average sizes of human body parts, so from a quick glance at the relative height of the woman's foot (which is an average size of 11 inches) and could guess your own height to be a little less than half of that, around five inches or so.  At that height, you should be clearly noticeable.  Something was wrong.  You scamper onto her huge ankle and dashed over to her lap.  You tried again, this time hopping up and down to see if it would help.  \"Miss!  Miss!!  MISS!!  PLEASE HEAR ME!!! I NEED HELP!\"  Nothing.  She was oblivious to your plight.  This must have been part of the magic in the apple, making it so you would be unnoticeable.  This was bad, because if you can't be seen you can't be saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no time to panic.  I need a plan so I won't panic...\"  You start by looking at the woman's face.  Maybe she is familiar.</span></div></div>",

With the apple's magic preventing direct contact, it would be extremely difficult to interact with her.  On the bright side, if you managed a way to get her attention, she'd be sure to help.  The best way to get that attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Mom!  Jordan made a mess in her diaper again!</b>  That loud voice coming from the other room would be your 10 year old sister, Dani, while the Jordan in question was your baby sister.  You look towards your mother and hear her sigh before bellowing out, \"Coming dear!\"  You look for a handhold, but your mom is wearing some pretty skimpy short, and you are left rolling down her bare skin as she stands.  You hit the knee and go flying off into the carpet below.  You begin to stand when a shadow is cast over you; a quick look up shows the sky is pink, wrinkly and covered in a light film of sweat:  Your mother's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mom!  NO!\"  You cry out and flinch as the sky smashes into you.  The foot, over twice your length, is barely on your body for a second, but it was enough time to coat you in some of that sweat, along with knocking the air out of your lungs as the powerful ball of her foot smashed into your upper torso.  Groaning as the massive steps tread away, you realize that you suffered no major injuries other than your ego being popped.  You climb back to your feet and start running to the hallway.  Maybe one of your sisters could see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprint as hard as you can to Jordan's room and in five minutes you make it.  On the opposite side of the room, your mother is just finishing up with the baby, so you push out one last burst of speed to reach her, only to have your plan stopped by Dani, who walks from the side of the room and stops right behind Maddie.  You try to slow down, but end up smashing into her colossal bare heel.  Even at 10 years old, Dani's foot is about twice your size.  In your awe at how small you are, you are unable to move as she takes a half step back, right onto you.  Her toes end up covering your feet, and as she stands in the same spot listening to your mother explain something, her toes grab at the carpet, and end up snagging you too.  When Mom finishes her talk, Dani, being an excitable little girl, jumps up in agreement, sending you flying through the air, landing on top of</span></div></div>",

Looking a bit more, you realize you were on the top of your mother's head!!  Trying to get her attention, you reach down to pull as hard as you can on her hair.  Something weird happened though.  As you grasped onto the hair, it was possible for you to hold onto it, but pulling it became impossible.  The magic again.  Whatever kind of magic that was seemed to be preventing you from getting noticed.  You would need to find a way around it to be seen. . .or at the very least. . survive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the baby's diaper changed, Maddison turned on the television nearby.

Yeah!!\"</b>  Dani squealed as Dora the Explorer's sounds blared into the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of your sister was so loud and painful, you wanted to grab your ears, but if you let go you'd go tumbling down the giant!!

Maddison was now in the kitchen, looking over some papers from the mail.  You guessed that they were probably bills.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sorted them, she reached to the side and grabbed a small plate.  On the plate was two pop tarts.  She must have had them from before but hadn't had time to prepare them.  Thinking things over, you decided that now you would make your move.  With all those papers below you, you might be able to jump down so your mother could see you.

The wooden floor rushes up to meet you, and it's \"hello\" was forceful enough to knock the sense out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot completely unconscious, you shakily pulled yourself up to your feet.  Your view of the world was blurred, and your head hurt like hell.  You try to take a step, but your body rejects that plan and instead ejects your lunch and falls over.  End result:  You're face first in a pool of your own vomit, without the coordination to get back up.  Fearful thoughts start to bubble up; do you have a concussion? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the thought train can reach its destination, you start to hear words.  Peering up, you think you can see your mother's feet walking through the kitchen, followed closely by Dani's...  and someone else's?  It's hard to tell if your mind is playing tricks or not.  They begin to speak, but you can only pick up snippets of dialogue through the ringing in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... break...  she'll babysit...  not that I...  be goo... she <i>is</i> your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pounding feet get ever closer as the procession of people walk through the kitchen.  As their shadows cover you, your eyes close and you lose consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delightful smell of stale vomit wakes you up not long later.  The hardwood floor of the kitchen has been replaced by the white carpet of the family room.  You sit up carefully, not wanting to aggravate any injuries, only to find that you feel much better than before.  Odd, but so is shrinking and becoming functionally invisible.  Having reassured your health, you jump straight to your feet, smashing your head against the soft ceiling you hadn't noticed.  Although the angle is odd, it isn't too hard for you to determine with 90% accuracy that you are under a foot that's dangling off the couch.  As you crawl out from under it, you remember something about a babysitter.  Looking up, you determine that this is:</span></div></div>",

You turn around and look at the belly and face of your enormous baby sister. \"J-jordan...\" You mumble in amazement as your baby sister giggles. It rumbles through you. Turning around again, you see your mother putting the cleaning supplies away.

Apprehensively, you watch as barbie gets closer and closer to her mouth, and right as you get to her leg, she begins to suck on it.  Hard.  Even from down here, you can hear her slobbering and drooling, and in your heart you know the apple slipped away, taking your chances of salvation with it.  But wait...  There!  In the corner of her mouth!  Something's coming out, and you hope to god it's the apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Splash!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpit.  That's all that came out and now you're soaked.  You fall to your knees.  That apple was your way out of this hellhole, and now it's gone, sucked down by an oblivious toddler.  As tears start to form and you begin to cry, you hear a voice calling out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Primary objective modified:  Pacifier.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apple!  You watch as the doll began to glow, getting brighter every second.  Jordan was shocked, and yanked the soaking Barbie out of her mouth.  The doll flashed like a light bulb, and when it was done, it was not longer there.  In its place was...  A pacifier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan make a happy sound and popped it in her mouth before getting up and waddling away.  You watched her massive footsteps, then looked back to where she was sitting.  In her place was the apple!  But it wasn't the same.  Now it was full sized.  You run up to it and try to talk to it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me apple, can I still get the wish?\"<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">I have been reset thanks to a primary wish being fulfilled.  To receive further wishes, please consume me.</span>\"<br>\r\n\"Not a problem!\"  You stretch your mouth open and bite right into the flesh of the apple.  Or I should say you tried to.  Whatever the apple was made of, it's skin was too tough for your little teeth.  Good thing you don't give up that easily!  You look around the room for a way to cut it open...  By Dani's shoe, there was a pencil!  You run up to it, and right as you grab it, Dani's door swings open.  Not wanting to be trodden on again, you move away from the shoes to the wall as your sister enters her room.<br>\r\n<i>Don'tseetheappleDon'tseetheappleDon'tseetheapple</i><br>\r\n\"<b>Hey look!  An apple!  Perfect for the party.</b>\"  As she reaches down to grab it, you curse your bad luck.  You need that, and if she's going to party with it, you'd have to follow her.  You don't have much time, as she's slipping purple socks on and will soon be leaving.  You need a ride, and the closest option is...  Godamn it.  Her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoot up to her blue converse sneakers.  You hated the idea, but from experience you knew a little trampling wouldn't kill you, even it it would hurt.  Plus, you didn't have to time to come up with a better idea, so here you are, lowering yourself into a size 7 shoe, praying that she'll take it off at the party.  Without a moment to spare you slip in, right as she grabs to shoe and takes it to her bed.  She sits down and slides on the shoe you're not in, leaving you plenty of time to watch her purple clad foot hover above you.  You're immediately regretting this decision.  Her sock is tattered and stained, and your about to get real close to it.  Before you can try to run, her toes flex and dive to the opening of the shoe.  The floor is tilted and you slide to the toe end.  You see her toes clench once at the insole before they rocket towards you.  Helpless, you scream as they over take you.  The frayed sock is rough to your skin and the pressure is nearly unbearable, even before she sets her foot down.  As soon as she ties her laces, she slams her foot down.  Dani was a petite girl, but to you she felt like a steamroller.  Every step rocked her foot into you, grinding you like you weren't even a person.  To be fair, at this point she didn't know you were.  Unfortunately, it felt like her toes did.  She always was a bit of a fidget, and now you were getting the brunt of it.  Your head was kneaded like dough under the ball of her foot, rolled like a pebble between her sweaty toes and ground to a bloody pulp like a worthless bug.  Within 15 minutes, you heard a snap, and you lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke some time later, wrapped in a ball of sweaty purple fabric.  Your head is light and your mouth tastes like copper.  From outside your purple prison, you hear the squeals and sounds of a bunch of preteen girls, and know you've arrived.  In the fabric of the sock, there's a hole to the outside, so you start to move towards it.  Going is slow, as it seems you've lost the ability to move your right arm.  You're unsure if you'll ever be able to again, but at the moment, there are more pressing concerns.  You  manage to pull yourself free of the soaking bundle, revealing to you:</span></div></div>",

You quickly take in your surroundings, noting the location of the two doors, the bed and dresser, and a massive pile of stuffed animals before finding what you're looking for:  the apple.  There it was, on top of a table in a stack of other fruit.  You don't know why Dani needed fruit for a slumber party, but it's not important right now.

The chipped paint of an old locker surrounded you, but the door was mercifully open.  A quick hop over the side of the shoe, and you were looking out into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it was the pool.  The locker was situated near to the pool, and it was rather empty today.  Only a small group of young girls were in it.  Well, and the teenage lifeguard, who was sitting bored-like in the lifeguard tower.  Seems like the place was rented out for the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling was already beginning to return to the arm, so no major losses on the ride here.  First priority was to find that apple.  That was the key to survival here.  It wasn't in the locker, so it had to be out in the greater pool area.  Squinting, you could just make out a table with stuff on it over on the other side of the pool.  It'd be quite a trek for someone of your stature, but it was the best place to look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaulting down to the warm concrete, you start to walk towards your goal.  Strictly speaking, the quickest route would be following the edge of the pool around to the tables.  That would be dangerous though, as you'd pass right by the wild splashes of the party.  It might be a smarter choice to go around the lifeguard tower.  With less screeching pre-teens that way, you'd be much safer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a trade off: safety or speed?</span></div></div>",

Instead, you slam face first into the taut stomach of one of Dani's friends, an endless wall of skin that stretched out in all directions. You push off it, kicking away and back into the abyss, but you hardly manage to float away when her hand, easily the length of your body, scoops down beneath you and propels you to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breach, screaming as you and a fifty foot wall of water are launched through the air.

Fruitlessly you call for her attention, but she doesn't notice and begins her assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lays into the water, slapping right then left then right palm into the water to force cold spray into her friends. Her strikes all hit home, driving into your head like a nailgun. You see stars as she slaps you down, pushing deep under again. You sink, stunned, below her waist, finally losing momentum and coming to a stop around her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, the girl gets splashed and, unable to take what she dishes out, flinches back. Her legs instinctively lash out and find you. The rest of the air in your lungs is forced out as her toes jam under your rib cage, sending you hurdling through the water in a trail of bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't take much more of this. You angle towards the light on the water's surface, running on fumes and hoping to god another girl won't interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything starts to go dark.

You can't even try to tip the glass before five fleshy digits press into the sides of the clear container, squishing and losing color mere inches from your soaking wet body.  You knew what was coming next, and screamed in terror.  \"Aunty!  Please don't drink me!  I don't want to die!\"  Her lips spread apart and the glass was tilted.

Her nose twitches, nearly shaking you off, and she stands up to walk to a tissue box.  You pull again, this time harder.  \"Ugh, my nose is so itchy today.\"  She pulls up the tissue to her nose, completely covering you in it, and she blows as hard as she can.  You are thrown right into the tissue as gallons of gooey snot pour all over you.  Your mouth opens as an involuntary urge to scream, but it fills up so quickly you only get a gurgle out.  With her nose clear, she balls up the tissue (which forces you into the fetal position) and chucks the snot-rag towards the garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your current vantage point, you can't see all that much.  However, you could feel the Kleenex hit a solid surface and fall downwards.  With the motions over, you pry open the rag and pull yourself out.

With the back of the tissue, you wipe off most of the goop, and begin to take stock of your surroundings.  The tissue had landed far from Casandra, leaving you much closer to the kitchen, which, if your remember right from the last time you visited, leads to the two restrooms and the bedrooms.

That too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your's and Lydia's opinions were promptly ignored, and Cass grabbed her little girl and headed towards the bathroom. Lydia expressed her First Amendment right and began to protest, violently kicking her legs and screaming. You were screaming too, as the girl's kicks shook you back and forth. You could feel the sticky bond holding you to your cousin loosening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it broke. You weren't saved from a watery grave though, as the juice-glue broke on a forward swing of the kick, hurling you into the porcelain death trap of the tub. Your Aunt's massive form leaned over and turned on the faucet, much to your dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering over the sheer walls of the tub, you watched as Cass stripped her little girl, who'd seemingly forgotten about her hatred of cleaning and was happily playing with her plastic bath toys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass vanished from the room again, only to reappear with a bottle of friendly looking bubble bath. She dumped the remainder of the bottle over your head. You hadn't expected that, and your eyes got quite their fill of soap. It felt like your very own pupils were bubbling out of your face.  So much for tear-free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water rose about you, but it was too sudsy and you just couldn't manage to clear out your eyes. Everything was still a blur as you struggled to stay afloat. A massive wave washed over you as Lydia stepped into the other side of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly could see as _______ hand wrapped around you, ready to unawarely use you as _______.</span></div></div>",

That's just plain disgusting, and would probably not even work.  You instead choose to let go and drop from your precarious perch, hopefully to somewhere you could get noticed at.  You take a final look down past the massive maw that had nearly swallowed you, down towards Cassandra's lap.  With any luck, this time you would be able to scramble off her lap before ending up in any other drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlan in mind, you screw your eyes shut and count down.  <i>1... 2... 3...  GO!</i>  You opened your hands and dropped like a stone.  Unfortunately, when you checked your flight path, you forgot to account for your aunt's breasts.  Your feet each land on a separate boob and you fall on your butt, straight into her cleavage.  You instinctively scream out for help, even though you know you won't get any.  Refusing to be humiliated by Cassie any longer, you pull with all your might and manage to free your butt from the all consuming grip of the massive mammaries.  Uneasily you get to your feet, constantly shaking on the wobbly flesh of your relative.  Right as you finally get the hang of standing you catch your foot on the edge of her shirt and trip backwards.  You fall backwards towards the ground, face up as you watch the head of your aunt, a person who used to be about your height, get farther and farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know, you're surrounded by a soft fabric with a musky odor.  Lifting your aching head up, you find yourself in a cave a little more than twice the length of your body.  No, not a cave.  You still haven't quite got used to your new size.  You shake your head and reassess the situation.  Funky smell, plush interior, about twelve inches long...  A shoe!  You had to be in a shoe!  And it was a soft one at that, clearly for use around the house.  You puffed up from pride at your detective skills.  Nothing gets past you!  Except for your Aunt's foot, which was sliding into the shoe behind you.  The toes had already knocked you down by the time you noticed, leaving you no opportunities to escape.  You pound at the fleshy sole as it overtakes your sky, trying and failing to be noticed, but all too soon the petite foot (Ha!) of your Cassie had completely overtaken you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was Saturday.  Like most American children, your cousins Lydia and Eliza were home.  Being four and six respectively, the two spent this free day playing with dolls and related accessories.  To them, life was good.  Life was also enjoyable for Cassandra.  After watching \"Sex and the City\" on DVR, she was feeling pretty happy.  For the last half hour she could hear her daughters playing peacefully and felt like she should join them.  After all, life's good when you spend time with your kids.  She finished her water, turned the TV off and slid her feet into her loafers.  Time for some bonding time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were also getting some bonding time, just in a different way.  Far beneath your aunt's attention, you are lying in her soft shoe, face pressed into her heel.  She hadn't taken her first step yet, and you had no idea what would happen.  Would her heel crush your head to a pulp, or had the apple made it so you were safe from this pressure?  With no options but to take the abuse, you closed your eyes and screamed as she began her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza and Lydia were in the neighboring room, so it only took a few steps to get there.  Being excitable little girls, they dropped what they were doing and ran up to their mother.  <br>\r\n\"MomMomMom!!!!  Are you going to play with us?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes I am!\" she says as she sits crossed-legged on the floor.  \"What are we playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two went into explanations of the massive dollhouse drama they had set up, you were starting to wake.  As soon as her heel hit the ground the first time, your face was compressed between her soft sole and the softer insole.  Even with all that plushness, you couldn't take the change in pressure and lost consciousness.  Then when her foot stopped pressing you as Cassie sat down, blood returned to your brain and you woke up very quickly.  There isn't enough light to see, but you can still feel, and what you feel is that her foot and your former ceiling was now a wall.  This gives you an opportunity.  If you can curl up into a ball and shove the heel of the shoe off, you can get free from your prison (which is starting to smell).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou act quickly, curling your legs up and bracing your back against her arch.  With all your might you push against the insole of the loafer and pray to God that she won't move before you finish slipping it off.  God doesn't listen.  Before you can even get the foot halfway out of its prison the doorbell rings.  Your world shakes as you feel Cassandra move.  In your current position, even a single step will be enough to break most of your bones.  As the foot swings around, you send one final prayer to the big man:  Please God, make it quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it!\"  The sound of Eliza's voice comes erupting into the shoe.  \"Okay.  Thank you.\"  The loafer swings back to its former position, and you resume.  Although the going was slow and occasional twitches interrupted your progress, you were eventually able to slip the entire shoe off.  You hit the ground and the shoe hits next to you.  The ground rumbles as your Aunt moves a little, looking down at her foot.  She pivots on her ass to where her calf was right above you, and while still playing dolls she begins to grab at the loafer with her slender toes.  Awestruck, you watch as her five digits flip the shoe right side up before inserting themselves into it.  Her legs then swipe past you, nearly knocking your head off as they fold underneath their owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the three women play for a while before what happened really gets to you.  Without any help, you were able to move an object twice your size against the will of a woman hundreds of times stronger than you!  \"I did it.  I really did it!  Take that world!  Life is good!  Ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha <i>retch.</i>\"  Your fit of joy was interrupted as you spewed out the foot sweat.</span></div></div>",

If you could get noticed, then right now, when the whole family is sitting on the floor, would be the best time.  You lean against Cassandra's leg and take in the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like they were playing with a family of dolls.  Eliza, the six year old, was shaking a Barbie around and making it talk about how it loved its job.  Cassandra had another Barbie, and she seemed to be taking the role of a coworker.  Meanwhile, Lydia, who didn't quite understand the whole concept but loved being part of the group, was alternating smashing her Barbie into the ground, and sucking on its head.  With all of this in mind, you decided you should try and get Eliza's attention.  Although she was young, she was being less violent than Lydia was and your previous attempts at getting Cassandra's attention all failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lydia has the doll in her mouth, and Aunt Cassandra has her's pulled away, you sprint up to the little blonde girl held firmly in Eliza's fist.  At a foot tall, Barbie was over twice your height.  Scaling her like how a lumberjack climbs a tree, you hold onto her plastic head and scream at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ELIZA!  I'M DOWN HERE!  FOR LOVE'S SAKE, NOTICE YOUR SHRUNKEN COUSIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so Barbie said to you, 'I'm tired of all of the puppies that bark so loudly.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even note your disappointment, Lydia reacts to Eliza's comment, yelling, \"Bark!  Barkbarkbark!\" while swinging her doll wildly.  It smashes into you, but the spit soaked hair wraps around you and ties you to the plastic woman.  \"Lydia...  LYDIA NO DON'T\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four year old can't hear you, and she begins her routine again.  The doll, with you firmly attached, is smashed into the ground repeatedly.  Your face takes quite a beating as the squealing little girl roughly plays with the toy.  With a final, face-burning drag across the carpet, you feel the doll lifting steadily up.  Through your bruised face, you see the cavern that's about to great you.  Her lips part slowly, revealing teeth that haven't fully grown in yet and the tongue that looks hungry for your body.  The girl isn't even watching you, with her eyes trained on the doll drama going on between her sister and mom.  You scream out a final time as the top of the doll is inserted into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza and Lydia only play for another half an hour, but your bruised, beaten body only managed to stay conscious for the first twenty minutes.  The massive fleshy tongue is heavily interesting in you, smashing against your face as you hold tightly to the soaking hair of the doll.  Lydia sucks violently, causing massive suction that threatens to rip you from your perch and force you down her gullet.  However, this was all child's play compared to when she chewed.  Her teeth were sharp, and her jaw was strong, so with every bite you skull felt like it was being crushed into paste.  She gnawed you with her front teeth, ground you with her molars and crushed you in every way imaginable.  By the time you faint, you've felt the worst pain you had ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith playtime over, Lydia pulled the Barbie from her mouth and dropped it in the toy box.  She and Eliza were getting ready to head to preschool, so she did a quick change and jumped in the car.  Upon arriving, she feels... something in the back of her mouth, and stealthily spits onto the short carpet.  She didn't know, and probably never would, but the thing she felt was her five-inch tall cousin, who could barely fit in her maw while curled up.  The little spit she experienced had launched the poor boy out of her jaw, and into the wild of the daycare.  There question is, where?</span></div></div>",

And for that matter, being dead sure feels like being tossed up and down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reopen your eyes.  Cassandra's sole was still merely inches (on your scale) above your head, but it wasn't coming down.  In fact, it was going up!  Then coming down.  Then going up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief.  It wasn't time for you to die quite yet.  You'd let out a laugh, but you didn't want to risk filling your mouth with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra had a whole day ahead of herself.  Her kids were with the ex-husband, and there wasn't anything on her schedule but to kick back and watch some TV.  So, she dropped her feet into her most comfortable loafers and began to play with them.  This wasn't a conscious plan; her feet just wanted to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV was playing one of her favorite movies of all time, \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\"  As she watched, her favorite scene came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...  is your favorite color?\" the old man asked Sir Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue.  No, wait, green?\" Sir Robin's answer wasn't satisfactory, and he was launched into the ravine.  Cassandra burst out laughing.  How could anyone forget their own favorite color?  Her entire body moved with her laughing fit, including her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a plan began to form in your head, the foot stopped bobbing right on top of your head.  Worried, you strained to hear the outside world.  It wasn't clear, but it sounded like it involved the color green?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, your Aunt started her laughing fit.  Her legs kicked out, bicycling in the air.  The momentum smashed you into her now-vertical foot.  The shoe was flung far away as her toes stretched out, and it it wasn't for your death grip on her heel, you feared the same would happen to you.  Her feet continued to swing, this time left and right as her fit started to die down.  With less momentum, it was harder to hold on to her white flesh, and before she was still again, you fell off, straight to the ground.  You hit the blue carpet and rolled under the couch.  From here, you watched as her feet settled back onto the ground, and she continued to watch the movie.  It seemed like luck was on your side, since death didn't greet you after such a forceful event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took this as a moment to rest.  Although you've only been five inches for less than fifteen minutes, it had already drained you of energy.  So, you took a nap, not waking up until the following morning.  What day is it?</span></div></div>",

In fact she was unusually kind, which made her the perfect person to try and get help from.  First and foremost, you'd need to get off her legs.  Her dress was long, so you end up using it to slide to the ground, landing safely.  You peer back up and gaze in awe at the colossal legs high in the air above you.  It's a while before you can tear your eyes away and get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mind back on the task at hand, you're able peek around the room and start brainstorming.  It appeared to you that you were in her bedroom, with a desk and bed in the room's corner away from the TV.  Her door was situated next to the TV, and her backpack was placed next to it.  The carpet wasn't too thick, barely passing your ankles, and you could see Kelsey was a clean person, with her soccer gear (Yep.  She was an athlete.) placed next to her closet, all  neatly folded.  With the room all mapped out, you could make your move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne plan could be the side of the room with the bed and the desk.  From there, you could try again to get her attention when she was sleeping, or you could find a way to write a message with the equipment in her desk.  Of course, these plans rely on Kelsey to find you.  It was possible there was someone more suited to assisting you, and for that you'd head to the other side, near the door and pack.  From there, you could either jump into the bag and hitch a ride back to your school with the assumption someone there would be helpful, or you could slip through the slightly ajar doorway to...  somewhere.  To be completely honest, you didn't know too much about Kelsey's family or house.  You vaguely remember talk about a younger brother and a younger sister.  Maybe they could help.  Either way, a plan had to be enacted before long, or something bad might happen.</span></div></div>",

At five inches, you could not use the stitches of the fabric as hand holds, and instead had to gather up a clump of the sheets and push up with your feet.  After nearly an hour, you were about half way up and out of breath.  As you contemplated letting go, the loud thump of footsteps began to ring out.

Completely forgetting your exhaustion, you stare dumbstruck as your titanic friend begins to remove her clothes.  Your mouth drops as her skirt does, and your mind flies as she tosses her shirt into a hamper.  Her underwear mesmerizes you, with both panties and bra far above.  You don't realize what's happening until she starts to put on some soft looking pajamas.  Then the enormity hits you:  She going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble to climb down as fast as possible, but you spent too much time staring.

How was it that she couldn't feel you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly could feel her.  If you weren't in such pain, you might be impressed by how tiny you were.  The ball of her foot was over your head, and yet your feet couldn't quite reach her heel.  Hardly half the size of her foot, you were.  Humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly a fraction of a second went by from her foot pressing down to her walking away, but in that time frame you were able to get a good feel for your surroundings.  Most obviously, it was impossible to move.  If you weren't claustrophobic before, you certainly were now.  The \"ceiling\" wasn't just on top of you; it molded around you.  The cold, clammy flesh had give to it, allowing you to sink in a bit.  The flesh smelt faint, like she washed it, but only enough to keep it clean.  Of course, the odor might be from the shoe and not the foot, but everything was too close and personal to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your thinking time was up.  Her foot swung forward, g-forces pulling you out of the foot and into the insole.  Then just as quickly it swung back down, the giant mass rushing to meet you once more.  This went on, alternating from terrifying acceleration to crushing agony.  The flesh was still cool, but soon it'd be heating up and sweating, making this even harder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, this came to a stop.  She must be sitting in her mom's car, getting driven to the game.  Another up swing came, pushing you down into the insole.  It was stronger than before, and you braced for the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo impact came.  Instead, you got the feeling the shoe was in the air.  Did she cross her legs?  Without warning, the entire prison began bobbing up and down.  She was shaking her foot, and you were being shook along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was it possible you hadn't been felt yet?  You weren't some pebble or piece of lint; you were a goddamned person!  If you were going to get her to notice you, before the game would be best.  No need to experience the life of a soccer player from down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother dilemma: How were you going to do it?  Your arms and legs were immobile, so kicking and punching were out.  All you could move was your head side to side...  and your jaw.  Grimacing, you knew what you had to do.  Opening wide, you bit down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at sixteen, her skin down here was thick and strong.  The first bite didn't so anything, and neither did the second or third.  But the skin was beginning to weaken, and on the fifth bite, you chomped down as hard as you could.  Finally, the skin tore just ever so slightly.  Blood dribbled into your mouth, replacing the taste of old sweat with that of copper.  She had to feel you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?</span></div></div>",

We have five minutes before the game, so hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey grinned and bobbed her head in acknowledgement as her fingers curled around you, obscuring your view of anything except the lines on her palm. Unbeknownst to you, Kelsey was running off to get two things: a Q-tip, and superglue. She took the Q-tip, dipped it in superglue, and traced a thin line around your body. Then she hastily put the glue back on the shelf and raced through the locker room to the showers. There, still in the showers despite the fact that it guaranteed her being tardy for the game, was Olivia. Olivia was a decent enough girl, if you got to know her, but few girls (including Kelsey and her friend) got past the two obvious hang-ups. The first was that Olivia had a gastrointestinal problem that led to her farting constantly. Her flatulence was one reason why she was only the goalie when the wind wasn't blowing the wrong way. The second reason was her obliviousness. She still didn't know it was game time, thus the reason for her being in the shower was also a contributor to her nickname, Oblivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey shouted \"Come on Oblivia, it's game time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water in the shower stopped. \"Oh God, not again!\" Olivia burst out of the shower, soap in her hair, completely naked. Kelsey waited for her to come to a complete stop in front of her, took careful aim, and threw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a perfect shot. You landed vertically in Olivia's asshole, facing outwards, effectively stoppering up her ass. The mountainous cheeks on either side of you quivered, but Olivia, true to her nickname, didn't notice a thing. As she raced to put on clothes, her buttocks ramming you with every step, Olivia also didn't notice Kelsey laughing at how oblivious she was -- your friend could still see traces of the superglue, if not you, but that would dry and disappear long before Olivia pulled down her shorts to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, will Olivia be able to fart to her heart's content as goalie, or will she have to put up with being a player, unawaredly forcing you to try to avoid drowning in her sweaty ass?</span></div></div>",

You fall down a fair bit, splashing down in a pool of her stomach acids already starting the digestion process and breaking down the pizza. You sputter, spitting acids out of your mouth and taking a quick look around, The dark spacious cavern had walls lined with flesh, excreting out acids and moving slightly with the rest of her body's movement. You swim around until you find a slightly larger piece of pizza, grabbing hold you brace yourself as the stomach shifts around, tossing about all of the food. You're just concerned at staying alive at the moment when you feel something drip on your head, a drop of milk. You realize what that meant just as a huge wave of white milk poured down on your head, soaking you with the white liquid. Everything was tossed about as it seemed that Kelsey was getting up to do something. You started to feel light headed and you realize that you didn't have much oxygen left in the stomach. The contents of her belly sloshed around as she walked around her home, getting ready for her next football game. She continued on her day completely oblivious to the small man in her stomach, slowly getting digested along with her breakfast. She could only wonder what happened to her friend when she returned back to school, un-aware that he was now a part of her body.</span></div></div>",

Your friend gets off her seat and walks towards the door.  Still stunned, you do nothing as her polished toes climb over you and her soft sole grinds you into the pink carpet.  As soon as her foot lifted, the foot of the child landed onto you as well.  Even though he was so young, his foot was still a good two inches longer than you and his step showed it.

The only wise option would be to hitch a ride to your high school, where everyone would be sitting down and you'd be able to easily secure some attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosely inspecting the backpack revealed some vital information: Kelsey loved the color pink, and the littlest pocket could easily be reached by climbing the stuffed frog hanging off the zipper.  The frog was soft and easy to grab, and within minutes you'd managed to climb to the barely open zipper and slide into the pocket.  You landed roughly on a discarded calculator before tumbling down to the bottom of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all that's left was to wait for Kelsey to get you to school.  How long would that take?  Well, school started at 8:00 am, so she'd have to leave at least half an hour before that.  An idea formed in your head.  With all your strength, you pried the lid off the calculator and slammed the \"on\" button.  A couple more button presses and voil\u00e0!  The time was 7:15 am.  You have about ten minutes before she'd be coming for the backpack, so you might as well take a quick nap.  You were exhausted from the jog across the room and you'd probably need your strength later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\"  All around you was an intense fog, shielding the environment from prying eyes like your own.  \"Hello?  Is anyone out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no plan or direction, you begin to wander.  Blindly you stumble through the cloud, looking for a sign of anyone or anything.  After what feels like ages, you smash into something...  soft.  As you feel it, trying to discover its true nature, it rears up, throwing you back.  A sound like bones cracking emanates from the cloth monster, and the fog begins to float away.  Siting there, not inches away from your legs, was a massive, pink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSock puppet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can react, it snaps forward and grabs your legs in its mouth.  The two plastic eyes lock onto you, and you feel the five slender fingers within it grip harder on you.  The puppet drags your screaming form through the air, and your eyes can hardly comprehend what sits before you:  A massive set of teeth, contained within two shiny pink lips.  The mouth opens and a crackle of laughter fills your ears.  The largest tongue you've ever seen comes out and licks over your face.  \"Don't do this,\" you scream to it.  \"I'm a person too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouth laughs again.  \"Not anymore.  Maybe you were a person once, but now you're nothing more than a snack.\"  The mouth opens all the way, and the sock puppet tosses you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes snap open.  Your face is plastered to a cold, hard ground, and you're covered in a cold sweat.  <i>Just a dream,</i> you think to yourself.  <i>But my God was that realistic.  I wonder if it's a side effect of the magic apple.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ponder any longer, the ground begins to shake.  You lift your head up in time to see a blue flip flop hit the ground next to you.  \"Oh shit!  I must have fell out of her bag!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen did this happen?</span></div></div>",

The foot was neatly tucked into massive pink flip flops. They weren't just massive because of your micro size; the sole of the flip-flop was at least an inch and a half thick, which had it over your knee level.  It was also worth mentioning the length of the since it was a good 2 and a half inches longer than your shrimpy little form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prepare to lift yourself onto the sole of the shoe, when suddenly the whole thing shakes.  You fall back, and the foot slides out of the footwear.  The flip flop is discarded midair, and it hurdles down towards you.  Your time playing video games must have payed off, since you are able to instinctively roll away as the flip-flip lands upside down where you were standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPride courses through you.  Maybe this won't be so hard after all.  \"If that flip-flop can't crush me, nothing can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we continue, it's important to note that one of the side affects of unneeded bravado is temporary blindness to your surroundings.  Thus, you didn't notice the other foot do the same thing.  This time, it landed right side up, and the muddy sole crashed down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesson learned, you crawl your way out from under the foam and wipe the muck off.  Looking up, it appears she tucked her feet under her, as if she was preparing for a long ride.  Good, since time wasn't on your side.  A new plan needed to be made, so you took check of your surroundings.  Her backpack was stowed under the seat, next to her seatmate's pack.  Speaking of her seat mate, she hadn't pulled her feet up, leaving them for you to potentially use.  They were sandals, not flip-flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you are left with a decision.  Will you try to ride the sandals of the seat mate, or will you spend the time to make a new plan?</span></div></div>",

Of course, if you were tired of feet and didn't want to see her slender, wriggling toes out of their prison, you could just climb her leg.  She was wearing a pair of denim jeans that would be easy to climb, and would give you a better vantage point on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what can a person do?</span></div></div>",

Of course, by sights you meant the slightly pink sole of the teenage girl whose shoe you currently resided in, but your point still stands.  As her foot lifts away from the insole, you crouch like a tiger, ready to pounce for your freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the girl didn't get the memo.  She dropped the shoe to the ground, knocking you into the sweaty floor.  Her foot dives down and smashes toe first into the footwear.  You are shaken out, and watch as she doesn't put the shoe on, but instead leaves her foot vertical as she grinds and kneads her toes up and down the bottom of the shoe.  You dread to imagine what would have happened if you didn't manage to get knocked out.  Remember, even though her foot is only twice your size, it has plenty of force left to tear you a new asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that near death experience fresh in your mind, you needed to decide on a new plan.  You could always try and get someone's attention, but it might not be such a good plan from down here on the floor.  Instead, maybe try to climb a desk?  Or, since you needed a bit of a breather after that life-flashing-before-my-eyes moment, this could be the perfect time to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, your teenage mind goes straight to exploring the girl's locker room.  That decided it.  Lustful thoughts filled your mind as you strolled to the door.  Scantly clad chicks and bouncing breasts filled your mind, distracting you from your surroundings.  Had your mind not been preoccupied with that one girl in your math class, then maybe you would have noticed students packing up.  Maybe not, but it could have helped what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Briiiiing</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell to end the period.  Snapping back to realty, you watched in horror as thirty monolithic high school students rose from their seats and began to march towards the door.  The very same door you were standing in front of...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet start to pound closer and closer.  You dodge the first few, but a converse swipes the back of your head and go go flying.  Your arms reach out, looking for something, for anything to hold on to so you don't become a stain on the bottom of a sophomore's foot.  It was so unlikely for you to succeed, but you did.  Your arm locked underneath the middle toe of a preppy girl's designer sandals as her foot lifted for a step.  The force swung you against the main part of her foot, and as her step finished, you had time to secure both arms between her toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another reminder of how insignificant you are:  With your arms wrapped around her toes and your head up to the bottom of the purple toenails, your feet couldn't make it to her ankle.  There wasn't much of a choice for you, so you held on.  Each of her steps tried to toss you off, and the motion was constant.  You couldn't see anything but vague flesh tones, since the world soared by too quickly.  Occasionally she wiggled her toes and squeezed your arms, nearly pulling them off or breaking them in half.  As you buried your face between the third and fourth digits of the left foot of a girl who didn't know you existed, you couldn't help but wonder if you could actually hold on until she stopped moving.</span></div></div>",

Thank you so much!\"  You crane your neck as far as possible and see two fingers reach down towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. B!  I'm right here!  No!\" Her pointer finger and thumb grab for the zipper, which is right by your waist, and end up being knocked off your belt loops.  Frightened of falling and being stranded, you wrap yourself around her thumb as she finishes pulling her zipper up.  She calls a thanks to the stranger, then resumes her jog.  This was painful for you, because she jogged with her hands in a tight fist, leaving you unable to move and being swung through the air faster than you've ever moved.  It doesn't take long for vertigo and nausea to cause you to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake, you are still stuck in her fist, but the environment has changed.  It appears she is sitting down, taking off her shoes.  Still tightly wrapped around her thumb, you are greeted with a face full of sweaty flesh and smelly sock as she shoves her thumb (and you) between her foot and shoe, using you a leverage to slip out.  The overall effect of the smell, pressure and the fact you just woke up lead to you dropping off her thumb and rolling down the sole of her foot as she removes it, landing face first in a puddle of sweat in the bottom of the shoe.  You climb to your knees and look over the edge of the shoe.  At five inches, you can easily get over the side of the shoe.  You walk to the nearest edge and...</span></div></div>",

You almost died from falling, from being crushed and from being squeezed, and not a soul knew.  You had to do something, and it had to be quick.  Next time, you might not be as lucky and could end up falling off the belt loop or being squished by the thumb.  If direct contact failed, it could be possible to write out a message.  You know you can move things since your face unzipped Ms. B's pants, so if you could find some paper and a bit of pencil lead, you could get some help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new plan in mind, you vault over the wall of the shoe and find yourself in a wide open area.  Across the room lay two doors, one to the left and one straight ahead.  You can't remember which way your teacher went, so it'll be down to guesswork.  The door behind you that you came from probably leads outside, and there are various sneakers and shoes to confirm it.  Right across the hall, the door has an animal flap to let a pet in, but so does the left door.  One final observation is that the far door has boots and shoes next to it, while the left one has a welcome mat.  It seems likely the far door leads to a back yard whilst the left one leads back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn towards the left door and begin your march, when all of a sudden the pet flap opens and a small (to a normal person) cocker spaniel marches out.  Not waiting to find out if it can see you, you run to the nearest door, which happens to be the third one.  It is slightly ajar, and you take advantage of this, slipping through and running out.  The area appears to be a back garden, but being scared of the massive beast of a dog, you jog through the plants without paying attention to anything.  You don't stop until you run smack dab into a green plastic wall.  Looking up reveals Ms. B holding a hose, watering her plants.  She steps back, right over your head, giving you a short view of the mud encrusted bottom of her rubber boot.  Her feet land behind as she keeps stepping back, spraying more and more of the ground with water.  For the first time since you ran into her boot, you take your eyes off her and look at what's happening.  The water is soaking into the soil, helping the plants grow and turning the ground into a tsunami of mud rushing right towards you.  Wasting no more time, you turn towards the teacher and run.  With you already winded from running from the dog, there is no chance of you escaping the mud flow.  You grab a rose sticking up, and climb it up to the top.  Safe from the mud and with a new perspective, you look around and see where you are.</span></div></div>",

You climbed down and jumped into the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started your trek through the damp, squishy ground.  The going was rough, but you didn't run into many problems.  Soon, you got near your giant teacher.  It looked like she was planting a camellia.  As you got even closer, the ground got looser, and your foot sunk in to your knee.  You pulled against the mud, but it wouldn't budge.  Using your hands like a trowel, you began to scoop the ground away from your feet.

You spit mud out, and realize the ground is much closer than it was before.  Did you shrink?  No, that wasn't it.  You were simply pushed into the ground all the way up to your neck.

They're all young girls, anyway, none older than maybe thirteen, so how rough can it -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready go!\" shouts the girl above you as she jerks to life. Her shifting leg bucks you off, and your shocked form slams into her laces as her foot soars forward, pancaking you for just a moment between ball and shoe before you bounce free, rolling into the grass. You act, quickly spitting out the clumps of mud and scrambling to your feet but from behind you crashes the footsteps of the shortest girl of the bunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fair! Megan! Karen just got back!\" she laughs. You're having a lot less fun as the smooth sole of her ratty sneaker soars down onto you. Her step is hard, pushing down into the damp soil, the weight of the girl unforgiving as she chases her friend. When her foot lifts your screaming form, still muddy and gunky from the garden, sticks to it, and you shout your way through the arc of her step until she slams back down, filling your mouth with grass and dirt. Her step leaves you this time, a discarded doll broken in the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball is caught up in between the four of them, their kicks tearing up the poor yard as they fight over the ball, before finally a lucky kick sends it careening away - - right towards you. <i>Oh no,</i> you think, diving flat to avoid the ball. A glance through the towers of grass shows the four girls, all smiles and giggles, now turning towards you, their massive steps churning the earth beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls, no no stop!\" you shout, as they're on you. Megan and Karen are neck and neck, and so Megan's orange and Karen's blue cleats find you first, their spikes tearing gashes into your skin as the trod over you, their swinging steps propelling you forward with them, holding you as a mobile hostage, trodding on you just to fling you forward for the next to step down. You wail, as Megan's heel grabs a hold, your head jammed in a clod of mud stuck to her shoe, ragdolling you as she finally catches up with the ball. She kicks it, passing it towards the taller of the other two, shouting \"Go for the goal Soph!\" She stood, rooted in one place in awe as she watched her friend make the shot, unaware that you were beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were choking, a spike crushing your windpipe as she stood.

There's got to be some way to quicken your trek across the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you see something at the distance.

Coming out of the house was the group that nearly killed you: the young female athletics. They were also still wearing their soccer uniform, are they're going for second round? You hope not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, the big game is finally here so time to show everybody what you all got.\" you heard an older female voice from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, Coach Kimberly.\" you hear Megan's familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just practice real hard today here so there's no way we'll lose.\" said Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo apparently these girls are on their way to a soccer match; not that you don't care for it.

This was the only way to get out of the yard; whether you like it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed onto the giant ball just as the girl picks it up and holds it under her right arm. You wanted to just jump off after she got out of the grass and into the sidewalk, but you already knew that's obviously a terrible idea. Maybe after she goes inside the car, you can make leap for the outside just as the door closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Karen both soon joined the coach and the other girls as they all get inside the car.

You retch into the bottom of the shoe, and climb out before she can jog with you again.  You stumble away as she puts her shoes away, and as you try to get to a door, the foot comes back and lands right on you.  Without the shoes to hold in the heat and sweat, it isn't as bad, but when her foot lifts up, a sickening peeling sound is made as it tries to stick to the cold tile floor.

Remember, you chose to eat the apple because you wanted an adventure, and to be fair, it's what you were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This magic's keeping me alive...  But is it driving me crazy?\"  As you peer into the distance, you finally get a chance to take a good look at the bed and realize that it was occupied.  If you still wanted a chance to get some attention, you could climb the bed and see where it takes you.  If not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they say, the world's your oyster.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your feet padded lightly across the cool tile. The kitchen was disappointingly plain; fridge, cabinets, sink, oven, it had the whole set, but there was nothing odd or out of place. The idea that your teacher was hiding an adventure was starting to seem unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crunch</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crumb, small enough for even you to trod on. It wasn't alone, either; a trail of similar crumbs led off into that dark room beyond. Probably nothing, but what if it was the lead you've been searching for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jog along the trail, your mind racing with possibilities. Was Ms. B really just a messy eater, or was there something more? Perhaps an animal was breaking into her kitchen, and you could be the tiny exterminator she's been in need of! Or maybe it was a group of other tiny people like you, who've been collecting food for their hidden colony? Or it might be some other magic happening that your newly awakened mind just can't comprehend! You speed up, and cross into the dark room beyond. After a couple of seconds, your eyes adjust to the dimness, and you discover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ordinary dining room. The trail of crumbs leads towards a table, on which a covered chocolate cake sat. Grabbing a crumb, you gave it a sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cake,\" you say to the empty room. \"So, the answer is that she's a messy eater?\" You drop the crumb to the floor. \"I'm hungry, but not <i>that</i> hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room responds with a low growl. You freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\" you say, your voice shaking. Again, a growl, louder this time. It seemed to be coming from the far end of the room, just beyond the table and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about this said to turn around and leave, to find a different room to explore. You wanted adventure, not death. Yet, here was the void, growling right at you, an adventure like no other. You had to check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and with caution, you crept towards the table. Pushing past the tablecloth, you creep beneath it. The growling had faded to a low rumble of heavy breaths. You drop to the ground, completely uncertain in your invisibility. Peaking past the cloth, you find before you a massive dog, curled up in a ball in a soft blue dog bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, standing to your feet. \"Aww, what a cute little doggo. And to think I was worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuicker than you thought possible, the dog's head swiveled around and stared right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, can you see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog began to stand, its shaggy form towering high in the air. Its eyes never left you, its mouth open and starting to drool. It took a step towards you, tail wagging gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" you shout, and turn to run. The dog's follows close behind. You make it to the kitchen with the dog just inches away from your neck. It slips on the tiles and slams into a cabinet, which swings open as pots and pans fall out. It barks out, but before it finds its footing you're out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room, you quickly look for a hiding spot. Under the couch? No, it'd have no trouble grabbing you there. On the coffee table? It'd be here long before you summited that peak. In the tv stand? The doors were firmly shut, and you weren't getting those open. That left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turned pale as you stared at the overturned oxfords. They were a light brown casual pair, something she could wear out on a day in the town, and by the wear and tear it looked like that was something she'd done quite a few times. You'd had enough of shoes for a lifetime today, yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't likely the dog would chew up its owner's shoes just to get at you. And it wasn't like you had any other options. With a grimace, you rushed over to the shoe and tucked yourself in. It was uncomfortably warm and ever so slightly damp, but it was preferable to becoming a chew toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog, having finally recovered in the kitchen, charged forth into the room. You watched as it looked about, then began to sniff. Nose to the ground, it began to follow your steps, and in moments it stood over the shoe. You curled up in the far end of the shoe, watching the dog weigh its options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stood up to its full height and began to bark down at you. \"Bark! Bark! Bark!\" At this distance it was deafening. You felt it bat the shoe with its snout, barking the whole time. It wanted you, and it wanted you bad. It was only a matter of time before it got its way. You just had to hope it got bored first.</span></div></div>",

You grabbed on to the fabric as hard as you can but unfortunately, it wasn't strong enough to hold you. After a few waggles, you were ultimately fling out of your hiding spot and into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and watched as the giant dog now dropped the shoe and started sniffing the ground; apparently now lost you.

This went on for a good ten minutes before the dog finally gave up and left the room. \"Thank god that's over!\" you said as you sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look behind you and found out that you are now next to the towering door that leads outside.

And what on earth is with her get up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman herself was of Asian descent, kind of skinny and looking like she was in her late twenties or possibly her early thirties. She\u2019s sporting a questionable blue and yellow headband with gems fastened to it with two feathers attached to the side dangling down behind her ear. Her hair was black and long nearly down to her waist but showed signs of having been poorly cared for with clearly visual split ends and what looked to be flowers tied up in there too. She wore a green loose fitting tank top with a purple floral pattern that just barely exposed her midriff. She wore no make up no eye shadow lipstick/gloss or even perfume. And on the topic of smell she smelled a little odd too, not bad at all though. \"Probably her own natural scent\" you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the waist down she had a skirt with some gray tights that had purposefully had tears in them and cut off at just above her ankles leaving her feet exposed and resting on the table. Speaking of which while dashing to her lap you failed to notice a couple of things one of which being that her nails were unclipped, they were long and like her hair didn\u2019t seem to get a whole lot of attention they didn\u2019t even have any nail polish on them whatsoever. You could even see some dirt stuck beneath her nails as she unconsciously flexed them. Gazing at them more you thank heavens that she didn\u2019t hit you with those she might\u2019ve inadvertently cut you with them you chuckle to yourself. Going through her appearance led you to believe she was some sort of hippie, admittedly you hadn't had much dealing with there kind before. Though this was probably the cutest one you'd come across thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind returns after trailing off and starts focusing on another thing you failed notice. The room was rather large and not just due to your new diminished perspective. It had hard wood floors with a single carpet laid beneath the sofa and table, a couple of exotic plants here and there shelves with some books in them, a fireplace, and a couple large windows with matching drapes. And as soon as your eyes met with the window you immediately felt sick to your stomach, outside you saw trees not even normal ones. Ones you\u2019d find in very dry climate accompanied with dried bushes, dirt, sand, mountains, hills, and rocks lots and lots of rocks with the sun harshly beaming down on them and mountains. You fell to the ground (or rather this woman\u2019s thigh) as this sudden realization hits you \u201cOh god. I\u2019m nowhere near home, I\u2019m like on the other side of the globe! Is this the desert? Mountains? Am I on the outskirts of Vegas, or Texas or\u2026Something?!?!\u201d All these possible locations filled your head as I tried to come to terms with being small unnoticeable and long, long away from home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that damn apple, I\u2019d still be at home with my friends and family living my life not this B-movie horror show!\u201d Your fit of rage is immediately interrupted as your landmass begins to move. You start sliding off her thigh as she starts to stand, you grab at her managing to firmly grasp her tights stopping just short of her skirt. She begins to walk to the front door with you in tow scared of being flung off, with each step it feels like being hit with turbulence while on a plane as they slightly jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho or what awaits the mystery hippie at her door?</span></div></div>",

Harmony made finally made it to the kitchen area only to have a little stumble that nearly caused her to fall over \"Oof, that was a close one, nearly fell over\" she said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Harmony slid open the kitchens backdoor and proceeded to go outside to her patio. The patio itself was a rather small setup with several assortments of thriving potted plants that were the result of Harmony's love and work. With a smile Harmony sat down and crossed her legs Indian style and began to focus on the positives in life, closed her eyes and started meditating as the harsh sun continued to beam down it's rays to the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand weren't so fortunate, back in the kitchen when your ride took that little stumble it knocked your grip loose and you flew right down onto kitchen floor. You started to get back to your feet, and as you did you were greeted with the bare sole of Harmony and she made her way to the door. \"NO WAI-\" you were cut off and her foot came down squarely on your body knocking the wind out of it. For a brief moment you felt the entire weight of this woman and then blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what happened\" you thought as you picked yourself up, then you recalled the event's that led to you being flattened by the foot of a hippie. \"That's right... I'm small lost and unnoticeable *sigh* I still need to get her to notice me. Wait where is she?\" You scan the kitchen and see no sign of her, until you turn your attention to the still open back door. There she was sprawled out on the patio floor. You raced to see what was wrong with her. The sun though beginning to set was still dealing out a heatwave to welcome you. You reached her massive body and saw she was covered in sweat, her clothes were drenched and tightly clinged to her eliminating any lingering imaginations of what she'd look like without them. Her face was also drenched and bright red and was clearly showing signs of Heat Exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wanted to live she'd have to get back inside but looking at her you told you she was in no condition to do it herself, she'd have to be woken up with a proper \"stimulant.\" Noticing the plants you soon spot a hose still attached to the spout, though with your size turning it on and dragging it all the way over is a tall order and your aren't confident your little body can do it. Then there's the chance you could race back inside in hopes of finding something else that would work, but that's a gamble. Finally the last option was an indecent one but it might work, you look to her massive vagina. \"If get her excited enough that might do it, but then again it's a massive invasion of privacy, and there's no guarantee I might get out of there unscathed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of pondering you finally settle on</span></div></div>",
