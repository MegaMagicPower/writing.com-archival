He was still hated! He then thought of his peers especially a certain five! Kiba was once was his best friend but one year he started picking on him like everyone else..then Shikamaru and Choji joined in...they used to be his friends! But now they're just like everyone else! Sakura he had saved her from bullies when she was younger and she used to be sweet to him but when she met that Ino girl she changed and became just like her an arrogant heartless Sasuke-loving bitch! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond's hatred that he tried to stem all these years was coming up in one big burst...golden energy began to surround him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe read the usual messages by the villagers, \"GO TO HELL! DEMON JUST DIE! WE'LL AVENGE OUR LOVED ONES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it! Something within Naruto began to awaken and this strange force frightened even the Kyuubi. Then the force washed over the fox freeing it of the illusion it was placed under.<br>\r\nNaruto roared, \"FINE SCREW THEM!!! I DON'T NEED ANYONE!!!!\" His energy flared up more and created a masive shockwave throughout the village...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, Kiba, Shikamaru, and Choji all sneezed and shivered feeling like they would regret ever abandoning a certain blond who once was their greatest treasure and friend until they chose to abandon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Next morning Naruto woke up still angry with the village...he now was 4'10 he had grown a few inches....his hair was longer his eyes now had wisdom beyond his years. He then got up and went to his closet looking for some new clothes...He found them and placed them on.<br>\r\nHe now wore an all black outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then instinctively waved his finger and a powerful illusion appeared around his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond then walked out of his house and made it seem like he walked out of nowhere...<br>\r\nAs he headed for the academy  the civilians all sneered at him only to be shocked as he completely ignored them.<br>\r\nOne idiot actually threw a rock at Naruto's head only to be shocked as the rock suddenly froze in mid air then returned right back at him. The rock hit the idiot hard giving him a rather nasty knot on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe civilians were now wondering, 'What's with him? He's never fought back before! h-have we finally gone too far?! Have we been wrong all this time?! If so then may Kami had mercy on our souls!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA certain pink haired woman who was Sakura's mother saw the boy and was shocked at how much he favored the Yondaime in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto got to the academy someone called out to him, \"Hey baka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sakura was frozen just from the steeliness of the glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then spoke coldly. \"What do you want Haruno?\" The way he said her last name like they were nothing more than just classmates sent sharp pains into her heart. It hurt bad even Sasuke's rejections didn't sting as bad as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just sneered before returning to a cold stare. \"If you're not going to speak Haruno then just stay out of my sight. After all I am just a nuisance to you. Just go to your bitch of a friend and that bastard you all deserve each other!\"  He turned and walked into the building. His harsh words cut into Sakura's heart like knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was about to yell at him but as more memories of her past with Naruto came up she began to realize she had screwed up...big time, Sakura watched the blond's back with tears in her eyes before she fell to her knees practically bawling with her hands over her face, realizing she had messed up bad. She had abandoned a true friend and the only possible guy in the village that actually ever liked her all because of...her foolish desires to be liked by everyone. From the way Naruto looked at her and spoke to her earlier it looked like she didn't have any hope of ever getting him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno came up only to be shocked as she saw Sakura bawling....the blond girl ran up to her friend and asked. \"Sakura? What's wrong? Did Sasuke reject you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crying girl shook her head vehemently. \"N-No... it's...Naruto...h-h-he hates me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno gained a dark look. \"What  did that baka do you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura cried out. \"No! He's not the baka here! I AM! He was the only boy of our age group who didn't make fun of me....he actually complimented me! He liked me! And I just...\" She started bawling again. Ino was shocked what kind of past did Sakura have with Naruto to make her cry so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno wanted answers....but she couldn't just leave her best friend out here.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I will by asking Naruto-baka' Ino thought as she continued to comfort Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto walked in and, after ignoring all of the stares he was getting from the other students, sat down in at a table in the back. He lied his head on it and stared at the chalkboard at the bottom. He decided to go to sleep since he already knew how the teams would be formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as he almost dozed off he heard a 'Naruto-baka!'. He moaned to himself and looked up seeing Ino. \" What?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What did you do to Sakura and what kind of past did you have with her!\" she barked at as an order. \" Go ask Haruno I want to go to sleep,\" he said as he laid his head on the table. Ino was shocked. Whenever she ordered him to do something before he always did it, but now he just flat out refuses. She couldn't take it. \" Tell me now or else I'll beat you into a pulp like I always do when you annoy me!!!\" she yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was staring at him one second and seething in pain another. She was now stuck in the wall with blood going down her stomach and back. She saw that Naruto was glaring at her now so she guessed he was the one who did this, but she didn't even see him move. She pulled herself out and went to a seat choosing not to bother Naruto right now. After a few minutes all of the students who passed finally arrived so Iruka started to call off teams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to Team 7, he called off,\" Team 7 will consist of Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Naruto Uzumaki, now next,\" Sakura sat there shocked before thinking 'Yes I can finally apologize to Naruto and hopefully we can be friends again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing Iruka left and let the teams wait for their senseis. The rest of the teams left with their senseis and Naruto finally woke up, but he started to meditate so he could keep everything outside away. After a few hours their sensei finally appeared.

I was foolish to abandon him! I want MY Naruto back!\" Ino looked at her best friend with  deep guilt and regret, \"I'm sorry Sakura it was my foolish offer that made you abandon the only boy who ever liked you...I think we should rekindle our friendship Sakura ,I'm tired of trying to obtain a boy, who doesn't even notice me.\" Sakura looked up with teary green eyes, \"I-Ino...I agree!\"  The two girls have become best friends once again, they have agreed to stop wasting their lives trying to get an ungrateful boy to notice them. Now Ino looked at Sakura, \"Sakura I make a new vow, that I will help you get Naruto back no matter what!\" The now once-again best friends smiled at each other with new hope in their hearts and went into the building together...They were knocked aside quite rudely by the Hyuga Heiress Hyuga Hinata...who brushed past them during her arrival on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sneered as she looked down her nose at the lower-class girls, \"Oh sorry... I didn't realize the trash was still out.\" Hinata had dark blue hair in hime-cut style, with chin-length strands framing her face. She wore a black open zip jacket and black pants that showed off her well-endowed figure underneath the jacket she wore a black fishnet-collar shirt that revealed a bit of her  cleavage and the tops of her large C cup breasts...Hinata was the most developed young kunoichi this year and the kunoichi of the year with Sakura coming at a close second...Being the Hyuga heiress she was practically Konoha's princess yet she was in love with Naruto the now-former class clown...something that irked Naruto's rival considering he was interested in Hinata but she didn't even give him the time of day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled and went over to Naruto to greet him, 'I'll show you Naruto-kun...that you don't need that pink-haired weakling or any friends...I'M all you need...after all it is destiny for us to be together.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno helped Sakura up while glaring at the Hyuga girl's retreating back, \"What a bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura glared as well seeing Hinata going over to HER Naruto, she clenched her fists, 'Bitch! Naruto-kun is MINE!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy in the middle row with dark-blue/black hair shaped like a chicken watched the beautiful girl go over to his rival  with envy in his eyes he wore a high-collared blue shirt and tan shorts with white blue-lined wristed bands on his wrists. He was Uchiha Sasuke the only survivor of the 'Uchiha Massacre' hince his title the Last Uchiha...He was Naruto's rival and the reason why Sakura, Kiba, Shikamaru, and Choji all abandoned Naruto...He was the rookie of the year and when he first met Hinata he felt something toward her...how ironic, he ignores all of his fangirls yet he's interested in the mose popular girl, but she doesn't love him, no she loved his 'loser' rival...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was sleeping ignoring everything but thanks to his newly-awakened deity powers he can sense everything that goes on around him....Suddenly Naruto felt a pair of arms wrap aroun him and felt two large and soft pillows pressing against his neck...He snapped open his eyes and smelled the scent of lavender, \"H-Hinata-chan...\" Despite his new powers, Naruto's shy around this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata leaned and whispered sensually into Naruto's ear, \"Hello Naruto-kun...  how are you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stiffened blushing, \"I-I-I'm fine Hinata-chan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata giggled, \"Aw ! You're so cute when you're nervous Na-ru-to-kun...\" She purred out slowly,  then made Naruto nearly jump by licking his ear in a sexy manner, \"Maybe we'll be on the same team...And then I can finally make you mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was trying to hold back the urge to beat Hinata to a bloody pulp knowing the Hyuga was stronger than her...and it hurt to see Naruto reacting toward her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon their Teacher Umino Iruka arrived and began to announce the teams...Team 7: Uchiha Sasuke, Yamanaka Ino, and Inuzuka Kiba (Not following Canon get over it!), Team 8: Uzumaki Naruto, Hyuga Hinata, and Haruno Sakura, Team 10 (Remember Team 9 is Gai's Team): Nara, Shikamaru, Akimichi Choji, and Aburame Shino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata grinned and licked Naruto's ear again, \"Well Naruto-kun it seems destiny is on our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nearly fainted from the sheer pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was about to cheer, until she remember Naruto was still angry towards her so she calmed herself and looked at him, 'Don't worry Naruto-kun I'll get you to forgive me somehow and then I'll really make it up to you for abandoning you.' Her Inner Self cheered her on, \"CHA! we can do it we can earn Naruto-kun's forgiveness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke groaned, 'Damn it why did the dobe get Hinata on his team! I'm stuck with a fangirl and a mutt!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked at Naruto with regret, \"I wonder if this is punishment for abandoning him?\" He whispered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru looked down at him like he was an idiot, 'What an idiot why did I have to choose HIM as my partner, of course it's punishment for abandoning Naruto you moron, your mother Tsume-sama was very angry when she found out!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba wasn't the only one regretting his abandonment of Naruto both Shikamaru and Choji were also regretting it...Choji especially since he had been teased in their younger days as well about his weight and Shikamaru was viewed as a 'lazy-good-for-nothing' loser who would die on his first mission.</span></div></div>",

Naruto being the god he is no longer needs to eat to live so he figured he would go test his newly found powers when he heard Sakura calling him. \"Naruto!\" She called while running after him. Naruto turned around to yell at her when Hinata appeared in front of him. \"Hey Naruto-kun!\" she said as she kissed him. Sakura came to a stop ten feet away when she saw Hinata kiss Naruto. \"H-hi H-hinata, w-what's up?\" Naruto asked when she stoped kissing him. \"Nothing much, Naruto-kun. I just thought we could hang out together.\" Hinata said turning around to see Sakura who was standing there the whole time. \"What do you want billboard brow?\" Hinata said while getting closer to Naruto. Sakura snapped when she heard her old nickname that was used to make fun of her big forehead. \"You just shut the fuck up! I'm here to talk to Naruto!\" she screamed as loud as she could. \"Don't you yell at me you bitch!\" Hinata screamed just as loud. While Hinata and Sakura continued to yell at each other, Naruto went to sit and watch the show just because he was bord and he didn't want to get involved. The girls went at it for about five minutes when Hinata got tired of fighting with Sakura and went to go calm down. Naruto saw this and got up to leave when Sakura  ran up to him. \"Naruto, can we talk?\" she said. Naruto turned around and said \"Why the hell should I talk to you or any one other than Hinata and Iruka! Huh, let me guess your here to try to get me to be your friend again. Is that it?\" Sakura looked down and started crying as she said \" Look, I'm sorry ok. I made a big mistake. I left you all alone when Ino asked me to be friends with her. I'm sorry, please Naruto! Forgiveshe ran at him and hugged him. \"Is that all you have to say?\" Naruto said pushing her away. \"Your sorry, that's it. You have no idea how much crap I went through just to get you to say hi to me and now that I stop you want me to just forgive you!\" He screamed creating a shockwave that made Sakura fall down. \"Untill you see just how much you hurt me I will only see you as the bitch who left me all alone.\" Naruto said as he walked away leaveing Sakura crying.</span></div></div>",

Hinata though held onto him even tighter. \"Can I come?\" she asked as she nibbled on his ear.

If I know Kakashi he won't be back at the Academy to meet my team for a few hours so that I long enough for me to get some sleep,\" Naruto said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked he heard a voice in his head. \"Hey Naruto-kun come here.\" Naruto sighed as he finally got home, jumped in bed, and went to sleep so he can get to his mindscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kurama-chan (Kyuubi's real name)?\" Naruto asked as he got in there. Suddenly his face was enveloped by two huge breasts that are easily larger than Hinata's, probably about DD-cups. \"I'm happy you're finally here!\" she squealed as she hugged him with even more force and suffocating him. Now Naruto may be stronger than Kurama will ever be, but he will never be able to defeat her when it comes to fear, emotions, and threats.\" Yeah, I am here. What did you want?\" Naruto asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to talk with you. We haven't talked for awhile and I missed you,\" she said with a pouting face causing Naruto to blush. Naruto sighed as he nodded, but almost had a nosebleed when she sat on his lap. \"Aw, is little Naru-chan nervous?\" she asked playfully as she poked his cheek. Naruto glared at her, but she just ignored it and smiled. \"So how are you feeling? Especially with Haruno's apology?\" Kurama asked him with a serious face. Naruto just shrugged his shoulders.\" \"I don't really know. It was unexpected and a part of me feels sad that I did it, but still I won't forgive her after all the shit she put me through!\" Naruto yelled angrily, but called down when Kurama rubbed his head. \"Okay. Naruto-kun sadly it's almost time for you to get back to the Academy,\" Kurama told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What, but it feels like I've been here for a few minutes,\" Naruto said confused.

This book contains knowledge of demons. True demons, rather than what the people of the elemental nations see as demons. Demons that have travelled across countless worlds and seek to destroy all life, in every world. Together, these demons are known as the Burning Legion. The Legion is led by the Fallen Titan, Sargeras.

In exchange for this act of kindness, he/she takes Naruto as a subordinate to the Akatsuki. During his time as a subordinate, Naruto is also taught by the Akatsuki members. (The Akatsuki will have a different goal than 'capture the tailed beasts' if you pick this choice.)

They seek biological and technological perfection, but the most efficient way to do so is to forcibly assimilate all other species into their collective, thus creating new borg drones and purging them of individual thoughts. The only (known)  borg that have individuality are the queen(s), and a certain borg known as Locutus of borg (it means 'he who speaks'). Borg abilities include, but are not limited to very powerful, and highly adaptive, shields (at most, a certain attack can work 4 times if you're lucky before every single borg is immune to the attack. i.e. a fireball jutsu would only kill a few borg compared to the millions right behind them), superior strength (think just below Tsunade strength, but they rarely use that), injection tubercles in each arm (once someone is injected, the borg drone sends out nano-probes into the victims blood, immediately transforming them into borg drones), and many other abilities. If you pick this option, Naruto will be assimilated and become known as 'Locutus of borg'. I'd normally go with a different name, but the borg aren't very imaginative, and this does fit.
