You continued running with your camera bouncing around crazily as you fumbled for your phone, trying to find the email from this morning. Had you read things wrong? Was there a follow-up you missed? There had to be something! Otherwise, why the hell was Alissa n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shockwave behind you sent you tumbling across the thick, ankle deep grassland you\u2019d gotten dumped into this morning. Groaning, you tried to get up only to notice the dark shadow slowly encompassing you. Despite all the horror movies you\u2019d watched, you broke one of the cardinal rules and looked over your shoulder. As soon as your eyes met the source of the shadow the terrified internal monologue that had been running in your head was silenced. Now, you were just trying not to wet yourself as she commanded your complete attention. Today\u2019s client wasn\u2019t just a giant in her field, she was a literal giantess looming over you as her converse-clad feet finally came to a stop a few yards away from your prone form (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/fb/d1/acfbd1e1f95c1d01d37a96633a7b774a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/fb/d1/...</a>). You tried to grab your phone again, hoping a last-ditch call to the asshole who hired you for this job might save you\u2026but your phone wasn\u2019t in your grasp anymore. With your stomach dropping through the floor, you began crawling toward the nearest shelter you could find: the base of the tourbus\u2019s couch. If you somehow got through this alive, you swore that there would never be another \u201ccandid camera\u201d job again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou\u2019d done enough of these candid jobs that you had some confidence in your cardio; if you could keep up this pace, you thought you would get to cover in 30 seconds\u2026even with the waist-high carpeting inhibiting any progress you made. Unfortunately, today\u2019s job had made you a little smaller than where you normally operated. Running was harder, distances were longer, and (of most immediate relevancy) your ability to judge the distance something Alissa\u2019s size could move was seriously lacking! What you thought was a nice distance between the giantess and the couch turned out to be anything but as Alissa slowly turned around\u2026poked her ass out\u2026and jumped backwards to crash on her couch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOM!...BABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cF-Fuck!\u201d you screamed, curling up into the fetal position with your eyes clamped shut as Alissa became a literal mountain of woman flying overhead! At less than an inch tall, the 5\u20194\u201d singer\u2019s smallest moved were enough to knock you down. Something like this? You were surprised the floor didn\u2019t split under your feet and swallow you up thanks to the tremors that reverberated around you! By some miracle, you hadn\u2019t been killed by the jumping titaness overhead\u2026and as you opened your eyes, you saw just how close Alissa had come to squashing you like a tiny ant. Had you been a little faster, you saw that your body would currently be under the wall of dirt-smeared white rubber that had fallen right in front of you! Staggering backwards, you tried your best to comprehend the wall of converse rubber that comprised your entire field of view. Stains on the side of the white rubber wall were bigger than you were\u2026and as you craned your head up to try and see over the warship-sized shoe, you saw that even Alissa\u2019s dirty laces were large enough to support rush-hour traffic (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7a/9e/67/7a9e670e5653be9bdf497597ced7b0d2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7a/9e/67/...</a>)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlissa yawned and stretched up, feeling the tension in her body rise for a moment before melting back into the couch cushions. After tonight\u2019s show, she\u2019d planned to go to the bar and relax\u2026at least, that was her plan before she remembered how comfy this couch was. Her manager had tried to talk with her about something before she went on stage. Something about a photoshoot? \u201cUgh\u2026I\u2019ll call tomorrow about it,\u201d Alissa decided, grabbing the remote and flicking on the TV. If she was staying in, then she could at least ditch her Converse, Alissa thought. She shifted her feet, trying to come up with the energy to lean over and undo the long tower of laces only for the post-show exhaustion to hit her\u2026hard! Sighing, Alissa decided she\u2019d do it later\u2026maybe at the next commercial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou owned a few pairs on Converse at home; the design was pleasant to look at and it went with a lot of your outfits. If you got out of this situation alive though, you\u2019d never look at the shoes the same way again. After finding yourself caught in the instep of Alissa\u2019s right foot, you figured going to the couch wasn\u2019t the right option\u2026especially after you lost your phone. If you wanted to get big again, you\u2019d need Alissa\u2019s help; it might have meant climbing the mountain of woman, but that was preferable to living off crumbs till you were crushed or vacuumed up! Turning toward the roaring television set, you started running along the side of the battleship-sized shoes. While you size offered several disadvantages, you\u2019d always liked the new perspective it gave everyday things. As you started your run along the side of Alissa\u2019s Converse, you tried to take in every detail along the way (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6031/6269585611_ab27575fe9_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6031/6269...</a>); if the giantess stayed this still, that would be something to be grateful for\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNNNNNNNNGH~\u201d Alissa\u2019s voice thundered overhead as your fate-tempting turned instantly against you. The yawn and slight stretching of the giantess made her shoe shift ever-so-slightly. While Alissa might not notice the shuffle, you were blindsided as the dirt rubber wall flew at your face\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe taste of rubber and dirt filled your mouth along a tinge of iron as your ears rang like church-bells. You tried to get to your feet only to fall on your back; the bill for whatever concussion you\u2019d just gotten would be sent directly to Alissa\u2019s studio. It took a few minutes, but eventually the world stopped spinning enough for you to lift yourself off the ground. You were still a little dizzy, but you could at least stumble toward the toe of Alissa\u2019s Converse. After a few steps, you finally noticed that the little shift of her foot had sent you tumbling almost perfectly between her feet. Nothing but carpet surrounded you for far more ground than you were comfortable covering! Your heart began to hammer faster as you tried to fight back the anxiety, whispering to yourself, \u201cD-Don\u2019t worry. Just keep moving\u2026it\u2019ll be alright\u2026.\u201d In the distance, the TV finally went to a commercial break. To you, it meant nothing\u2026to Alissa, it meant it was time to sit up. You heard the groan of the couch behind you but tried to dismiss it as the giantess shifting around or moving a pillow or something. Unfortunately, you were wrong once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHMMMMM? WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?\u201d Alissa\u2019s voice thundered overhead as you nearly shit yourself. Looking up, you prayed the giantess would be looking at the TV or her phone. Once again, you were wrong though\u2026Alissa was staring down at you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ozah7KlBei/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/ozah7KlBei/</a>)....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That hope was quickly dashed as the massive face overhead began to contort into a grimace. Alissa slowly sat back up and brushed her hair back, her lip raised in a mix of disgust and annoyance as her voice thundered around you, \u201cFUCKING GROSS\u2026I THOUGHT WE GOT RID OF THESE THINGS\u2026\u201d (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/f6/14/a5/f614a5bcdac5fa0b4efa92bc9eab72f7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/236x/f6/14/a5/f614a...</a>). A bug. She thought you were a fucking bug on her floor! Your heart went into overdrive as every cell in your body screamed at you to run for your life as the titanic tower of rock-star sat up and sighed. The ground rumbled to your right as something moved\u2026something big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh no,\u201d was all you could squeak out as you watched Allisa\u2019s Converse-clad foot starting to lift overhead. Your ears were assaulted by the grating sound of her treads dragging along countless thick carpet fibers; bits tore loose like a large cruise-ship had ripped off its mooring while leaving port! Arms and legs pumping like mad, you thought for a moment you might actually make it out of here until you looked to your left and saw that you\u2019d just barely made it past the arch of Alissa\u2019s stationary shoe. You were too small to be recognized as human\u2026of course you were too small to outrun Alissa\u2019s sneaker! The colossal converse continued rising into the air as Alissa\u2019s eyes regarded you with a mix of disgust and indifference. It didn\u2019t matter who you were, how long you\u2019d been there, what you thought of her\u2026all that mattered to the giantess was that you\u2019d been foolish enough to invade her space and get caught doing it\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEWWWWW, IT EVEN RUNS GROSS!\u201d Alissa\u2019s voice thundered as the shadow of her raised shoe slowly moved in your direction. You\u2019d been praying  that some sort of shelter would appear for you, but as the light overhead was completely obstructed by the giant woman\u2019s converse, that hope was dashed. For some reason, you stopped running and allowed yourself to look up\u2026. Some small part of you had been praying that Alissa might be smirking down at you; that this was just some sick joke and you\u2019d get a great settlement check from her manager and be on your way home. Of course, that wasn\u2019t the case though. Your eyes, instead, saw row after row of rubber corridors that made up her sneaker tread (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000gyOKzdSkZg8/s/600/901/Arch-Enemy-Best-Buy-Theater-102414-12.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.photoshelter.com/img-get/I00...</a>).

Her stony grey eyes squinted down at you with a critical glance, sending a shiver down your spine. You figured there was only a matter of seconds before she mistook you for a bug and tried to snuff you out under her thumb or the thick soles of her heavy boots! You could heard your heart pounding in your ears and the metallic taste growing in the back of your mouth as a panic attack took over. Turning on the ball of your right foot, you took off in the opposite direction of the couch, trying to get as much distance as possible between you and the titanic woman. Your lungs were already burning by the tiny you\u2019d passed the instep of her boots, but that wasn\u2019t what concerned the colossal woman overhead. A dark shadow suddenly raced overhead before-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slammed into a warm, soft wall and bounced backwards, falling on your ass. Winded, you looked forward to see the pale pad of Alissa\u2019s fingertip suddenly in front of you like a plush barricade that had dropped from the sky. The air around you grew warm and humid with Alissa\u2019s breath as the giant woman whispered, \u201cNO, NO, NO\u2026WHAT THE FUCK EVEN IS THAT THING?\u201d You looked up and almost pissed yourself at the sight of the giant woman\u2019s scrunched brows and massive open mouth, wording silently as Alissa\u2019s equally massive thumb began approaching to pin you to her pointer-finger\u2019s pad (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/474x/7b/43/f1/7b43f119f3102a11011cb925877f6541.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/474x/7b/43/f1/7b43f...</a>). Turning back and forth, you couldn\u2019t see any way to escape\u2026and soon didn\u2019t even have time to act as the warm, pale, plush pads squeezed you between them and hoisted you into the air\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCoughing, flailing, and growing faint, you could feel your ribs starting to bend under the weight of Alissa\u2019s pinch as the giant woman investigated the tiny thing that had been scuttling around on her carpet. You thought for a moment that you should be happy Alissa hadn\u2019t mistaken you for a bug, but ever slight twitch of her fingers trying to maintain their grip on you was becoming more torturous with each passing millisecond. If the giantess so much as sneezed, you knew you\u2019d have ended up as a red splotch between her fingertips. Rising higher into the air, you could feel your ears aching from the changing air pressure and broke out in a sweat thanks to the mix of heat radiating off of Alissa\u2019s skin and the 98.6-degree blast of air coming from her mouth and nostrils. Too afraid to look up and meet Alissa\u2019s gaze, you instead just squirmed uncomfortably as she held you level with her pierced lower lip\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTHE HELL? IS THAT A\u2026BUG?\u201d Alissa asked, making your heart sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSomething in you tripped as your head snapped up and met Alissa\u2019s eyes\u2026her pupils suddenly going wide as your face burned bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNO\u2026FUCKING\u2026WAY\u2026\u201d she said, bringing you closer so you could see your own disheveled reflection in Alissa\u2019s green/grey eyes. \u201cA PERSON?! WHAT THE FUCK, PERVERT?!\u201d She shouted, making you wish for a moment you had been mistaken for a bug instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlissa! W-Wait! Pl-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGROSS! SO FUCKING CREEPY!\u201d she shouted, her face growing redder as you looked and saw her massive mouth opening even wider, each of her teeth easily taller than you were. Before you could even try to argue your case though, Alissa growled, \u201cFUCKER\u2026\u201d You could yourself suddenly in free-fall toward the pink, muscular surface of Alissa\u2019s tongue wriggling below you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8nYsYzbDPVAEpNSkDKqqtB.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8nYsYz...</a>).... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last thing you remember is being asked to make sure that the back seat of the limo was clean because it was needed for an important client. You were in there with some new spray cleaner when the fumes got to you and you passed out. You stand up and take a look at your surroundings. You definitely are still in the back seat of the limo but everything was HUGE! Looking around and looking at yourself, you soon realize that somehow you\u2019ve shrunk and are standing on the backseat of the limo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re world is vibrating and shifting. You can tell that the limo is in motion. Probably on its way to pick up the important customer. Soon the car stops and you hear the driver get out.

A very BIG Nicki Minaj! She turns so that she\u2019s in front of you in profile. Her big booty sure was showing nicely in those tight pants she was wearing. She lifted he foot up and set it inside the car. Now that nice rear of hers was moving closer to you. You stand there mesmerized by the sight of it. Her but gets bigger and bigger, it takes you a moment to realize that it\u2019s getting closer to you because she\u2019s sitting down on YOU! You make a dash for it and barely get far enough way as her big booty slams down into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and catch your breath. You just missed getting crushed by the butt of a singer. You regain your composure and begin to access your situation. You look up at Nicki Minaj who is now sitting in the limo seat talking on her cell phone. She is gigantic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I just arrived\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m in the limo getting ready to head out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we going to the arena, Ms. Minaj?\u201d the drive asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and step on it! I want to get there early so I have plenty of time to prepare for tonight\u2019s concert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world gets put in motion as the car accelerates. You have to brace yourself to keep from falling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I\u2019m back now\u201d she continues on the phone. \u201cSo the fight wasn\u2019t too bad. We hit some turbulence along the way. I was feeling a little woozy but it\u2019s not like I had to barf or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s apparent that she\u2019s completely oblivious to your presence. You\u2019re in desperate need of help and this woman is the only one who can help you now. You think about climbing her but that could be dangerous. Maybe you can stay where you are and an opportunity might present itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were truly stuck and forced to sweat it out in her cleavage...literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not matter the low amount of clothes that she wore during the performance, you still noticed that as she was in her dressing room preparing, sweat started to build up. As she was trying clothes out you could hear a door open and someone from out side say \"Miss, your on in 5 minutes\". Oh man. If your gigantic boss putting on clothes is this bad for you imagine her dancing around with you still here. You might not be able to breath or worse you could get crushed or even worse you fall lower down her body. Either way you have to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to wiggle and struggle to get from out of here to no anvil. Eventually Nicki starts to walk toward the exit of the room.

It was almost mocking to look at the faces of all the screaming fans happy to see one of there favorite artists before them, while you were here knocking at deaths door. You could start to feel the giant singer's increased heart rate right behind you as her performance came to a close.

Thank God you remembered who you are: 20 year old Josh, a well known backup dancer for all of the big celebrities. Last night you danced an Ariana Grande concert and the last thing you remember is finishing breakfast. You were suppost to be on the dancers tour bus for 9.you looked at your watch an saw it was 9:13. You quickly jumped to you feet rushing to get to the bus, but you don't get 2 steps before falling on your ass,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hand on the material you were on. It didn't feel like wood or carpet. It felt like a smooth and soft surface. It was dark pink and you looked behind you to see a wall of the same material. The material curved down toward the wall and you knew you were in trouble from that point. You thought back to when you have seen something like this before and as you were thinking the ground started shaking ever so slightly and became stronger and stronger. You felt it the third time and then I hit you. When you first met Ariana she was in her tour bus and sitting on a seat that was the exact same as what you are laying on. It was a half circle couch that took up one side of her bus. Then you felt a tremor. As you kept thinking these tremors got stronger and stronger and louder and louder. It sounded like foot falls on a carpet. You had connected the dots in your head but what you saw next confirmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see a gigantic Ariana Grande walking over to where you are on the seat. You always thought she was hot and even though she wasn't wearing a sexy outfit she looked hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://celebmafia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ariana-grande-street-style-out-in-los-angeles-february-2014_3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://celebmafia.com/wp-content/uploads...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still on her phone she turned around and you what was coming next. You just lay down fully and stare at her huge ass as it started descending towards you. You were ready for her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.celebrityomg.com/15-hottest-celebrity-butts-yoga-pants/13/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.celebrityomg.com/15-hottest-c...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her the second she sat down. She sat in that position for a few seconds before standing up again. You thought maybe she felt you but no instead what she did is go to the other side of the couch. From there she pulled one foot out of her Ugg and put it on the couch. She then proceeded to do the same with the other foot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Ariana-Grande-Feet-1262197.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Ariana-Grande-F...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was standing on the opposite side of the couch with her back facing you. You had no idea the horror of what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana jumped backwards and this action scared you and had you thinking it was the end of you. It was like time slowed down as you watched her glorious ass go up in the air and then start falling directly on top of you. You thought you would end up as a stain on her perfect ass but that didn't happen. She landed perfectly on top of you and you really didn't feel the weight. It felt the same as before. Then Ariana started to grind her ass on you to get more comfortable. In doing this she turned you on. She kept grinding for a solid 30 seconds until she finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was she really comfortable?</span></div></div>",

Something had been wriggling for sure under her butt when she crashed on the couch\u2026and from the sensation tickling her, it seemed that whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t done yet. Her finger seemed to find nothing. Withdrawing her hand, Ariana decided to grind her butt into the couch cushion a little more\u2026yet the sensation continued! Now annoyed, the young woman stood up and let her butt pop out a bit as her hand groped her generous cheeks and began rubbing to find the small irritant that had attached itself to her rear (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn3.teen.com/wp-content/gallery/ariana-grande-quotes/untitled-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn3.teen.com/wp-content/gallery/...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggy and nearly crushed under the singer\u2019s unyielding ass, you were unable to even put up a fight when Ariana\u2019s pointer finger dug into your gut painfully. It felt for a moment like her nail alone was going to cut you in half. The surge of pain was enough to pull out one more desperate wiggle from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>HMMMMM\u2026</b>\u201d Ariana mused as her finger withdrew from your gut for just a fraction of a second. You were almost knocked out when her finger slammed into your face. The giantess almost broke your back as her nails dug into her skin and managed to barely peel you off her butt cheek. You\u2019d nearly blacked out from the pain, only slightly aware of your tiny body getting crammed somewhere tight thanks to her finger\u2019s unyielding movement. For a second, you\u2019d thought maybe Ariana had found and recognized you, it would explain why she was so rough; you doubt you\u2019d be forgiving of a tiny person stuck to your butt. As the pain faded though, you finally recognized where you were and knew that it was just wishful thinking Ariana had noticed you. In the haze of pain, you thought maybe the contricting feeling was because you were pinched between two fingers\u2026but that wasn\u2019t the case; you were so tiny and pathetic that your body wasn\u2019t even able to be perceived like that. You hadn\u2019t been plucked off the giantess\u2019 butt\u2026you\u2019d been scraped off and were now stuck under Ariana\u2019s white fingernail like common filth (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDFpX8MUgAE-8qk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDFpX8MUgAE-...</a>). Struggling wasn\u2019t even an option at this point. Best case scenario, you\u2019d get loose but then fall to the ground and die; worst case scenario, Ariana noticed you but thought you were a bug and crushed you\u2026 So you stayed still while you rose into the air, riding the giantess\u2019 finger like the first climb of a rollercoaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the climb seemed to slow. Ariana\u2019s finger twisted around until you suddenly found yourself staring into the giantess\u2019 dark brown eyes. You\u2019d taken a breath to scream, only to lose it as the young woman plopped back onto the couch. The impact jarred you hard enough that your jammed body popped out from under the thick fingernail. You hadn\u2019t been expecting to get dislodged and so found yourself floundering in the air until you managed to spin around and latched onto her fingertip. Of course, Ariana missed the whole thing. Her eyes only turned down to her fingers as your body was pressed quite closely to the tip of her finger, your back was facing her as her gaze settled on you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view5/2246456/ariana-grande-confused-o-s.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view5/2246456...</a>). It would have been the perfect time to scream, wave, jump, really just about anything would have worked well\u2026unfortunately, if you tried any of those right now, you\u2019d absolutely plunge to your death. Closing your eyes tightly, you just prayed Ariana recognized that there was a little person clinging onto her fingertip. <br>\r\nAriana didn\u2019t really get what she was looking at as she leaned in to inspect her fingers. At first, a quick scan seemed to show nothing on her hand and the young woman was worried whatever she\u2019d sat on was still stuck to her butt. A second later though, her big brown eyes focused on a tiny bit of filth that seemed to be stuck to the tip of her pointer-finger. She grimaced a little, not really wanting to bring whatever it was closer to her face. It seemed like there were little extra bits coming off the main mass in the middle\u2026maybe it was a bug or something she\u2019d sat on, Ariana thought to herself. Her nose scrunched up in disgust as you heard the one phrase you\u2019d hoped not to hear, \u201cEEEEEW!\u201d There wasn\u2019t even a moment to respond before the world suddenly began to shift again. Your chance to get Ariana\u2019s attention was gone; the giantess wanted nothing to do with what she thought was a bug\u2019s corpse. Looking over your shoulder, you felt sick as you the pointer-finger you were clinging to get separated from the rest of the digits as they withdrew. From above, Ariana\u2019s other hand began to lower, her other pointer-finger primed against her thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait! Please don\u2019t d-\u201d you\u2019d begun to scream, too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blacked out for a split-second from the impact\u2026it was actually a miracle Ariana\u2019s fingernail didn\u2019t obliterate your body on impact. Twitching, you gasped and seemed to come back to life with a violent jerk only to be struck by a horrific case of vertigo. Then again, you were tumbling through the air, unsure of what way was up or down. Your stomach knotted and you knew you were going to throw up in the dizzying display. It was like you were on a plane that was going down in a horrific flaming spiral. Your eyes caught sight of one thing though: your landing spot. Screaming, you curled up tight to endure the impact\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was impossible to see through the thick forest of light tan hair that sprung up all around you. You tried to grab onto a few strands only to have them slip from your grasps. Once again, you were falling\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d you groaned, writhing a bit on the slightly less forgiving ground. The floor was soft under you, which only made sense considering where you were. Slowly, your eyes opened and your stomach dropped as you confirmed your fears were right. You found yourself staring up from the bottom of a huge hole. The walls were absolutely covered in light tan fur that shimmered in the lighting inside Ariana\u2019s bus\u2026the fur was slick as hell and thankfully a little different from the denser fabric under your back. Sitting up, you saw the long, dark tunnel ahead of you and felt a small whine rise in your throat. It was official\u2026you\u2019d managed to land inside Ariana Grande\u2019s ugg (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dtpmhvbsmffsz.cloudfront.net/posts/2014/01/16/52d8863dba534015e700114b/m_52d88642ba534015e700114e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://dtpmhvbsmffsz.cloudfront.net/post...</a>). You were terrified that Ariana was going to put them on again\u2026but as you heard her getting comfy up on the couch, you remembered what time it was. She wasn\u2019t going anywhere tonight, just to sleep. Sighing in relief, you knew it meant at least a few more hours to try and plan an escape from her massive boots. Laying down, you thought of maybe trying to climb the sides again when you couldn\u2019t help but notice how soft the insole of her uggs were\u2026 Your body was aching and this was the first forgiving surface you\u2019d been on all day\u2026 What could it hurt to close your eyes for a little, you thought? After all, you\u2019d survived what would have killed a normal person. Just a short nap\u2026yeah like five minutes and you\u2019d be right back to planning your escape\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>HMMMM\u2026OK, I GOT IT</b>,\u201d Ariana\u2019s voice boomed as she spoke into her phone. Waking up with a start, you looked straight up and felt your stomach tie itself into knots. The light wasn\u2019t from the bulbs in the bus anymore, but sunlight pouring in the windows\u2026you\u2019d slept through the entire fucking night! You tried getting to your feet when the entire world suddenly seemed to jerk around. Collapsing onto your face, you barely managed to look up in time to see the one sight you\u2019d been dreading. Ariana smiled as she began getting her foot positioned over you; her bare sole was alive with wrinkles as she flexed her delicate toes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Ariana-Grande-Feet-196374.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Ariana-Grande-F...</a>). You opened your mouth to scream, but no sound came out. A rush of adrenaline ran through your veins as her long toes pointed down\u2026and began their descent. <br>\r\nYou flipped over onto your stomach and began doing your best to climb up the slope of Ariana\u2019s furry insole. Your heart was hammering as you cursed yourself for even thinking it was ok to take a nap in such a stupid place! All around you, the sound of Ariana\u2019s smooth skin brushing against the furry walls hummed in the boot, most of the sound absorbed by the fur that was closing in on you from all sides. Already the cavern was getting darker as Ariana\u2019s foot began filling the mouth of the boot\u2026the darkness definitely wasn\u2019t making it any easier to see the path before you that you needed to climb to make it to the toe section. Not that it would matter for long. There was a small tremor as Ariana\u2019s toes touched down against the insole of the furry ugg boot\u2026and of course it was enough of a shake to make you lose your grip. \u201cH-Help! Fuck! Nooooooo\u201d you screamed, smashing into the insole and rolling down the slope head-over-heels. It was an oddly similar sensation to getting flicked and flying through the air now that you thought about it. Though the thought didn\u2019t linger as you came to a sudden stop, slamming against a warm, soft, yet unyielding surface! The wind was knocked clean out of you, making you gasp and grab the warm slab of flesh behind you. Looking over your shoulder, you tried to see what you\u2019d landed against only to get suddenly flung forward as the wall shifted forward. Landing hard against the ground, you weren\u2019t even allowed to try and get up before Ariana\u2019s soft toes slowly began to overtake you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Ariana-Grande-Feet-1426689.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Ariana-Grande-F...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed into the soft, damp insole of Ariana\u2019s ugg as her toes pressed down and put a hairline fracture in at least two of your ribs. Another surge of adrenaline ran through you, though since you were pinned down, it achieved nothing except making your awareness of the impending death from Ariana\u2019s foot that much more acute. Her toes lifted off you for a second as Ariana prepared to shove her foot deeper into her shoe. You took the chance and tried to get up, hoping to roll to the side and get out from under her tan flesh. Of course though, your plan didn\u2019t work. Ariana jerked her foot as she grabbed the sides of the mouth to push her foot in deeper; you found yourself rolling once again until you came to a rest in a small crevice of her boot. Looking up, you saw a stream of light coming in past a round orb of flesh. Even with the adrenaline coursing through your veins, there was no way to know Ariana\u2019s heel was about to come down on you till the bony ball slammed into your body. The unyielding wall of boney heel pressed your body into the back of Ariana\u2019s ugg as her toes wiggled in the warm front. Suddenly, you\u2019d almost wished you\u2019d ended up between the damn things. Fighting against her heel, you felt your body begin to slide under it\u2026a sensation which only made you fight all the harder. You knew if you were under her heel when her foot came down, Ariana would crush you like the bug you basically were. Ariana shook her foot gently, leaving you\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Still unsure of how you\u2019d arrived in this situation, you couldn\u2019t help but admire the view as you watched Amy Lee laid out on her bed, sleeping blissfully it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking from around even with her waist, you decided to try and make your way to her face in order to get her attention. Slowly, you began heading around an outstretched arm of Amy Lee. Her hand, outstretched, was about as big as a house you figured as you stopped before it; would it be better to go under her fingers, or spend more time going around the whole hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>MMMMMMM</b>\u201d Amy moaned as she suddenly shifted in bed, rolling away from you. The ground rumbled under you, knocking you on your ass as the ground shook violently under Amy\u2019s tossing and turning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShit, that was scary,\u201d you said under your breath as you pushed yourself up again on the soft sheet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few more steps, you looked at the gently expanding back of the giantess as her breathing made her tank-top tighten as her lungs filled with more air than you could imagine. You figured, after a few more minutes of walking, that you\u2019d made it to around Amy\u2019s shoulder if you had cared to get closer to her. The gently rising and falling back of the giantess loomed over you like a small building as you wondered what the next step would be. If you approached now, you\u2019d maybe get in trouble if Amy decided to roll over once again. You thought about trying to climb the pillow, but getting up to it proved to be a can of worms all on its own. As you got more and more absorbed in what to do while staring at Amy Lee, you totally missed the deadly omen flashing behind you. If you had ever looked away from Amy for even a second, you\u2019d probably have noticed the alarm clock behind you\u2026and how you were out of time to get in touch with the giantess\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEEP\u2026BEEP\u2026BEEP\u2026BEEP\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell on your knees and pressed your hands to your ears as the alarm began to blare, shaking you to your bones. The ground under you began to shake as well as Amy Lee was roused from her sleep. As the giantess rolled over, you were thrown onto your stomach as you soon found yourself staring into the cold, crystal blue eyes of the giantess as she slowly began reaching out for the alarm clock, her hand on  course to slam into you\u2026which it did (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://xdesktopwallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Amy%20Lee%20Side%20Pose%20In%20Black%20Top%20And%20Jeans.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://xdesktopwallpapers.com/wp-content...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t WHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt felt like you\u2019d been hit by a train as you found yourself quickly plastered against the thick wall of Amy\u2019s fingers while they slowly began gliding through the air. Grunting as you felt the Jetstream of air pressing you to the finger like you imagined a bug felt on a car\u2019s windshield, you saw as acres of bedspread were zipping by under you by the second. Suddenly, a great updraft slammed into you as the bed-sheet plains dropped off into the steepest cliff you\u2019d ever seen in your life. The gust of wind caught you by the shirt just as Amy\u2019s fingers began to slowly spread out as her hand started turning to reach for the alarm. In an instant, you found yourself spiraling through the air. Twisting, turning, and tumbling through the air, you weren\u2019t ready for it as you were quickly met with a sudden stop\u2026you\u2019d found the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HMMMMMM</b>,\u201d you heard thunder above you as you lay bare on your back, desperately trying to catch your breath. You heard the bed groan loudly above as you imagined Amy trying to get up out from under the covers, the thick head of raven hair cresting over the cliff-side of the bed as she began to rise higher than anything you\u2019d ever seen in your life\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nYou leapt out of the way as a gigantic, pale foot crashed down next to you, almost crushing you to a pulp. As the gust of wind from the footfall died down, you looked up to see Amy\u2019s arm pressing down on the nightstand as she appeared to be trying to get up\u2026 You watched as Amy\u2019s foot pressed into the floor harder than you though, like she was trying to jump up on one foot. In fact, she was\u2026she just wasn\u2019t very good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>SHIT!</b>\u201d Amy called as she found herself losing her balance, drifting forwards over the bed. You watched, in slow motion, as her other foot began to come crashing down near you. Turning, you tried to run as you thought you\u2019d be crushed under a fleshy-meteor at any moment. Small legs didn\u2019t get you far though as Amy\u2019s heel crashed down into the floor, sending another explosion of air behind you as you just barely avoided getting caught under the pale, powerful toes of the giantess (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Amy-Lee-Feet-190726.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Amy-Lee-Feet-19...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you saw yourself suddenly face-to-crotch with the music idol as she just managed to keep herself from falling flat on her face out of bed. As the giantess slowly began to stand up again, you wasted no time trying to get up and run as you noticed you\u2019d wet yourself when Amy fell. Ignoring the uncomfortable warmness in your pants, you began running from the giantess as she began to take her first step. Your lungs were on fire as each step you took seemed to be infused with all the strength your body had in it. Even so, the shadow of her foot raced overhead with shocking speed as Amy Lee\u2019s foot suddenly slammed into the ground, nearly knocking you over again as the tremors rocked you. Before you could even start running again, you felt a familiar sensation as you were once again slammed into by a part of Amy Lee\u2026this time it was her other foot as she took her next step forwards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou groaned as you slammed into something hard. Opening your eyes, you almost threw up as the world continued to spin around you terribly. It felt like your body was still on a roller-coaster as the ground shook violently under you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>COLD\u2026</b>\u201d Amy\u2019s voice boomed as you tried opening your eyes again. The spinning had gotten slower, but it was still too much as you shut your eyes tightly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour eyes shot open this time just in time as you saw Amy\u2019s massive foot slowly lifting off the ground and headed towards you. Looking up, you froze as you saw Amy smiling down as her foot slowly began to obscure your whole world (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th02.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2011/247/c/d/amy_lee___evanescence_by_drsokkar-d48wisg.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://th02.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/20...</a>). Looking around, you felt your stomach drop as you realized she wasn\u2019t looking at you, but instead at the massive platform you had been knocked onto. Her foot moved agonizingly slowly from your point of view as you desperately tried to think of something to do to get away from the colossus. You turned and took a step only to freeze as you nearly tripped. Your ankle rolled painfully as the ground under you didn\u2019t support you like before, but seemed to sink a little under your foot like you were walking on a strange sponge. The ground shook terribly as Amy\u2019s big toe finally made contact with the surface of the gigantic flip-flop (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Amy-Lee-Feet-781970.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Amy-Lee-Feet-78...</a>). Falling flat onto your face, the ground continued to rumble under you as Amy\u2019s toes were slowly dragging across the floor of the flip-flop. Looking back over your shoulder, you felt like you knew how Indiana Jones must have felt as the pale wall of flesh that comprised the front of Amy Lee\u2019s big toe continued its slow crusade towards you. Quickly, you began clawing your hands into the foam of the flip-flop to try and pull yourself forward. Like a slingshot fired off, you were once again zipping across the uneven ground as best you could while the whole platform continued to rumble; it seemed like you were living through a badly made disaster movie as the tremors continued to throw you off balance. Stumbling over your own two feet every few steps, you thought it was a miracle that you had managed to grab hold of the study trunk of the flip-flop\u2019s thong at all. Gasping for air your lungs continued to burn as the fetid air hung heavy with the acrid odor of Amy\u2019s foot that seemed to be engrained into every square inch of the flip-flop. Chocking down the tainted breaths, you turned around and looked to see how much time you had left until Amy\u2019s foot was upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWHOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe wind rushed around you warm and whirling violently. It was as though you\u2019d been in a subway station as two trains suddenly pulled up at the same time. As the massive walls of flesh suddenly surrounded you they quickly squeezed together on you as Amy pulled the flip-flop tightly to her foot. You groaned as you found yourself sandwiched between the steadfast pillar of plastic that belonged to the thong and the massive wall of flesh that spanned between Amy\u2019s big and second toe. Just as you thought you were going to pop, the walls relented, letting you fall against the thong of the flip-flop and try to catch your breath\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGrahhh!\u201d you screamed as you suddenly felt yourself between the massive walls of flesh once again only to be released a second later. This time, you fell back against the warm flesh of her foot. You sank in slightly as Amy relaxed her foot while she got her other flip-flop on. Your brain suddenly began working again as your hand gently brushed against the rough surface of Amy\u2019s skin. Quickly, you pushed yourself up and spun around. In a heartbeat, you were once again on Amy\u2019s skin, but this time laying into it with a flurry of blows. You felt the slight resistance of her thick skin as your fists, knees, elbows, and kicks sank into her pale flesh. Sweat was already beading on your forehead as you continued to slam your body into Amy\u2019s foot as hard as you could. Groaning and hurting all over from the wild ride that got you to this point, you thought for a moment you\u2019d been noticed when the toes that had almost crushed you began to lift ever so slowly. Smiling, you slammed into the foot once more as Amy\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The singer smiled as she laid back on the seat of the limo and hit the switch for the television inside to come up. Stretching out, Demi kicked her feet up on the long couch and laid back into a small pile of pillows she had cobbled together for herself as she had the driver put the partition up. Demi giggled as she felt something squirming in her pocket, it was probably time to let her out. Reaching into her pants pocket, Demi\u2019s fingers gently groped around, hoping to find the little thing before it got crushed; Demi\u2019s prize was delicate after all. A big grin spread across Demi\u2019s lips as she felt something begin to struggle against the pad of her pointer finger. Gently, Demi wrapped her fingers around the little thing and tugged, bringing it into the twilight-like glow of the limo as the opening credits of the movie began to roll. The giantess giggled as she felt the tiny thing wriggle between her fingers once again as it was retrieved from her pocket. Stretching out further along the couch, Demi winked down at it before dropping it onto her stomach, right in the small band of exposed skin as Demi\u2019s shirt rode up her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey! You can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d Jess screamed as she sank slightly into the smooth surface of Demi\u2019s skin. Looking up, Jess felt a surge of anger go through her as Demi ignored her; the giantess instead turning her attention to the bag of popcorn in her hand as the booming music of the movie rang behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRNNNNNMMMMMBBBMMMMMM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess froze as Demi\u2019s gaze turned to her once again. The ground under Jess\u2019 feet rumbled as Demi giggled, entertained by the stunned look on your face from her stomach\u2019s protests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops, was that scaring you? You could easily end up in there after all if I get too hungry,\u201d Demi teased as she reached her hand for some popcorn and shoved a fistful into her mouth dramatically (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Demi-Lovato-Popcorn-Gif.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/20...</a>). Demi winked down at Jess as she licked her lips and reached down for another fistful of popcorn. Jess could only watch in awe and fear as handfuls of popcorn bigger than houses disappeared down the throat of the giant woman who she had been the biggest fan of only an hour ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, let me go, I won\u2019t tell anyone I swear!\u201d Jess pleaded as Demi\u2019s hand nearly knocked her over now as it rested on the massive plain of Demi\u2019s stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Demi said as her hand suddenly sprang to life, her fingers wrapping around Jess\u2019s struggling body as her stomach once again roared underneath her. Jess fell flat in the palm of Demi\u2019s hand as the star lifted the little lady up to her face (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://static1.purebreak.com.br/articles/0/30/80/@/18182-demi-lovato-diapo-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://static1.purebreak.com.br/articles...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ll let me go?\u201d Jess said hopefully, though her body still quivered in fear as she felt like a toy being stared at by Demi. Jess almost felt like she was naked as she sat, exposed in the middle of Demi\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll let you go. You can go in here,\u201d Demi said, giggling, as she slowly began to open her mouth and let her long tongue hang out as her eyes locked onto Jess like a cat locking eyes on a defenseless mouse (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img-w.zeebox.com/images/proxy/8e23fe67731316fadeb1c78ca4c253ec41b81ec6:preview?src=http%3A%2F%2Fmtv.mtvnimages.com%2Furi%2Fmgid%3Auma%3Aimage%3Amtv.com%3A9286306%3Fwidth%3D1200%26height%3D675\" target=\"_blank\">http://img-w.zeebox.com/images/proxy/8e2...</a>). Jess screamed her lungs out as Demi slowly brought her hand closer to her hanging tongue. The thick wall of slick muscle pushed against Jess, pressing her down into the palm of Demi\u2019s hand for a brief moment before slowly dragging itself up, coating the tiny girl in a thin sheen of saliva. As Demi pulled her tongue away, strands of spit thicker than telephone wires tethered her to the massive tongue, bending in the middle as gravity pulled them down. Jess shivered as she looked up the slope of Demi\u2019s tongue into the blackness of her throat, she could see tiny shards of popcorn stuck in Demi\u2019s teeth as the last mouthful had yet to be fully swept up by the monstrous tongue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess felt a warm trickle of liquid down her leg as she stared at her own reflection in Demi\u2019s tooth which had clacked down in front of her like a pearly white guillotine (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/slideshows/images/slides/244/677/0/S2446770/slug/l/screen-shot-2014-02-24-at-9-19-58-am-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.blogcdn.com/slideshows/images...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm, so should I eat you now or save my snack for later?\u201d Demi mused aloud as she slowly began to open her mouth again.

Yeah, whatever you say!\u201d Jess squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAwww, cute!\u201d Demi chirped as she dangled Jess even higher in the air and licked her lips again, giggling as Jess squirmed uncomfortably in her hand.  Letting Jess hang, Demi moved the popcorn bag off her as she readjusted, sitting up straight. Demi couldn\u2019t believe she actually was getting to do this. In her hands was the bully of one of her closest friends from childhood, now Demi could do anything she wanted with her. Of course Jess was clueless as to why one of her biggest idols was treating her this way, all she knew was she felt less than powerless in between Demi\u2019s fingers as the giantess now began crossing her legs. Jess started feeling sick as she thought about what Demi was going to make her do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRRRRRRNNNNNMMMMN\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll eat you anyway,\u201d Demi said lowering Jess towards her mouth once more as her stomach continued to rumble below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo! No! No! Please! Please stop!\u201d Jess wailed as she felt Demi\u2019s tongue slide against her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid you stop when anyone told you to?\u201d Demi said coldly as she licked Jess\u2019s legs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d Jess cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne of the girls you continue to torment is a good friend of mine. I don\u2019t like bullies, so tonight I\u2019m going to make you understand just how powerless you made her feel\u2026 and I\u2019m going to enjoy it,\u201d Demi said, anger filling her voice as her usual, bubbly-self disappeared for a terrifying moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d Jess stuttered, unable to grasp what was just said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Here\u2019s your first job,\u201d Demi said as she flashed Jess a peace sign quickly and began lowering her down\u2026right towards her boots as the singer giggled from high above (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/061411_demi_lovato_tatoo_5441106142103091110718192824.jpg?w=544\" target=\"_blank\">http://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress....</a>). Demi smiled as she pinched Jess between her fingers like a Q-tip and rammed her head first into the bottom of her boot, sticking the tiny woman\u2019s head right into a clump of mud that had been stuck in her treads for God only knows how long. Twisting her back and forth, Demi made sure to sink Jess in up to her lower back so that she wouldn\u2019t accidently beak her neck while doing this. With a light tug, the clump of mud came loose dropping as Demi pushed her fingers forward, ripping Jess out of the mud as she let it fall to the floor of the limousine. Before Jess could even begin to protest, Demi dug her into another bit of earth stuck to her boot and began pressing her face into the side of it, supporting the back of her head with her pointer finger as Jess became a shovel to scoop it out. Demi quickly smashed Jess\u2019s face into a pebble that was lodged between the rubber walls of her boot, digging her under it to get leverage on the tiny stone. As it lifted out of the tread, Demi took a quick look at Jess\u2019 face and smiled brightly. A line of crimson could be seen on her face from what might have been at worst a broken nose, but at least the little bully was starting to get a taste of her own medicine. Snickering, Demi continued cleaning out her treads with Jess for a few more minutes, doing everything from racking her against mud to chipping away dried dirt, to digging out pebbles with her face (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thedunmore.com/boot-black-under.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thedunmore.com/boot-black-und...</a>). By the time Demi\u2019s treads were clean, Jess\u2019s face was already swelling from the beating she had taken. Lifting her up to her face for inspection, Demi could only smile as she saw the shrunken bully now quivering in fear and panic as Demi\u2019s eyes seemed to stare her down hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease stop\u2026\u201d Jess choked out weakly, exhausted from her ordeal under Demi\u2019s boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStop means its snack time!\u201d Demi said as she slowly began opening her mouth again, bringing the little woman closer to her maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait! I can keep working!\u201d Jess shouted as Demi\u2019s tongue now stopped right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood!\u201d Demi said as she withdrew her tongue, almost touching her nose with it cutely as she looked down at Jess happily (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://gossipgirl.alloyentertainment.com/files/2013/07/tumblr_moa9gr3fds1sphvgto1_250.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://gossipgirl.alloyentertainment.com...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cW-what can I do for you now?\u201d Jess stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cClose your eyes and pucker up,\u201d Demi said seductively as she began to slowly bring Jess towards her pursed lips. Demi could feel the tiny girl squirm in her fingers nervously as she was brought right to the edge of Demi\u2019s luxurious lips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSWOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJess screamed aloud as she was suddenly getting covered in a thick, warm, sticky liquid. Looking up, she saw that the waterfall was coming from the fountain of Demi\u2019s lips; she was being coated in spit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry, guess that was a sloppier kiss than usual,\u201d Demi joked as she spat again on the tiny girl, soaking her in a thick film of saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI-it\u2019s fine,\u201d Jess whimpered, afraid to offend the giantess who held onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you think of my boots?\u201d Demi said, changing the subject as she turned Jess around to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey\u2019re really nice!\u201d Jess said, hoping to score some brownie points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think they need a shine, don\u2019t you?\u201d Demi said, a sinister smile spreading on her lips that sent chills down Jess\u2019s spine. Jess wasn\u2019t even given any time to answer as she was suddenly once again being thrust towards Demi\u2019s massive boot-clad feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSQUELCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemi giggled as she pressed Jess right into the dusty surface of her boot and then spat another great wad of saliva on top of her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ashitalia.it/app/webroot/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/demi_lovato_wears_ash_journal.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ashitalia.it/app/webroot/news...</a>). The little bully was now a little washcloth as Demi slowly began to drag her across the surface of her boot, leaving a sparkling streak of fresh black leather wherever Jess\u2019s body went. Demi giggled as she first drew out a smiley-face on her boot, dabbing Jess to make eyes as she swiped her body across to make the lips on the very tip of her boot. Afterwards, Demi spat once more and dipped Jess in the pool of saliva before writing her signature on the side of her boot with Jess\u2019s body as the pen. Demi made a bunch of little sketches using the fine point of Jess\u2019s head as she turned her foot over and started cleaning the other side. When her boot was decorated with shining patches of decoration, Demi spat on her other boot and repeated the process till her feet were covered in tiny drawing in the caked on dirt. Pulling Jess up from the puddle of spit Demi was glad to see she hadn\u2019t drowned her, though the tiny thing was definitely not doing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did so good on this one! Don\u2019t worry, we finally made it home. After we _______, you can call it a night,\u201d Demi said sweetly as she got out of the limo.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jess panicked as she began darting around the counter, looking for somewhere to hide from Demi before the giantess came back. Ducking behind a fruit bowl, Jess shivered as she felt the ground under her begin to rumble with Demi\u2019s footsteps. As the thundering footfalls grew closer, Jess closed her eyes and waited for them to pass by.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBOOM!...BOOM!....BOOM!...BOOM!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not playing games right now, get out, we have laundry to take care of,\u201d Demi said, her normally cheerful tone gone as Jess shivered in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cO-ok!\u201d Jess said as she gave up on hiding and exited from behind the fruit bowl with her hands up over her head in resignation. As she stepped out from behind the bowl, Jess saw a shadow of something hanging over her head, slowly descending....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemi\u2019s hand smashed against the counter, right in front of Jess as the shrunken woman fell to the floor, pissing herself as she was crying hysterically, wanting to go home as Demi picked her up between her tremendous fingers. Jess\u2019s cries turned into a high pitched squeak as Demi\u2019s fingers began crushing her ribs between them, a tacit way of telling Jessica to shut up if she didn\u2019t want to get into more trouble than she was already in with the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you try to hide from me again, the next time you\u2019re going to be crushed, am I clear?\u201d Demi said coldly as she looked at Jess. The tiny woman sniffled and nodded her head as Demi suddenly grew back into her normal smiling, bubbly self. Jess was still in tears as Demi lifted her up and began walking down a hallway, the lights still off. As the giantess zipped past doorways and stairwells, Jess felt like she was riding on a bullet-train, things blurring past her eyes faster than she could comprehend. The ride came to stop though as Demi opened a door and dropped Jess on the floor or a very plain, bright room. Looking around, Jess saw gigantic fabric bags looming over her like mountains before the tremendous alters of two incomprehensibly large white cubes\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM! BAM! BABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJess curled up in a ball as she thought the sky was falling on her. After a few seconds of silence, she opened her eyes to see that she now was surrounded by her own fortress\u2026 built entirely out of Demi\u2019s footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s your punishment for trying to hide from me. You have to clean my sandals, those boots, and my gym sneakers while I do laundry. If you don\u2019t finish before I get the last load in, you\u2019re going to be in even bigger trouble\u2026so get to it!\u201d Demi said as she pointed to her tremendous, strappy sandals. Jess looked up at her blankly, wondering what she was meant to do with three pairs of tremendous shoes when she had almost gotten killed putting just a tiny shine on the tips of another pair of boots before! Demi just smiled down at her and then turned away, grabbing one of the mountains and putting it down as she tore it open and began removing a dizzying display of designer clothes for the wash. As the giantess walked away, Jess began running to the tremendous sandals that had been pointed to, jumping onto the flat landscape before slipping instantly on a small slick of too-well-worn leather. It was like a patch of ice as Jess crashed onto her ass and slid right into the towering thong of the sandal (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Feet-1526941.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Fee...</a>). Groaning, Jess tried to get up, grabbing hold of the strap of the sandal, just to wretch and pull back, finding it covered in a small film of Demi\u2019s sweat. Looking up at it, she saw that the light caught on the thong, making it glimmer as Jess understood her first task. Quickly, grabbing her shirt, Jess pulled it off and wrapped it around her hand, making it a washcloth as she began dragging it up and down the length of Demi\u2019s sandal thong, trying to snatch up as much sweat as she could. Jess tried to catch onto it again, this time her hand holding onto the now cleaner patch of leather. Looking up at the long expanse of thong above her, Jess shivered\u2026this was impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJess froze as Demi\u2019s barefoot crashed down behind her, the familiar scent of sweat she had gotten used to on the sandal now wafting over her. Slowly turning around, Jess screamed as Demi\u2019s foot slowly slid towards her, toes spreading, as Jess pressed herself against the thong of the sandal. Demi giggled as she squeezed Jess between her toes and pulled backwards, ripping her off of the sandal thong as she began to swing her foot over towards her boot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Feet-768360.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Fee...</a>). Kicking over her boot, Demi released Jess, letting the tiny woman fall onto the rubber sole of her boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on, chop-chop, get moving,\u201d Demi said as she turned away again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait! I wasn\u2019t done there yet!\u201d Jess screamed as Demi paused and looked down at the sandals. Slowly bending over, Demi inspected the work Jess did and shook her head, clicking her tongue in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019d better clean my boots better than this,\u201d Demi said as she picked up her sandals and began striding back to the washing machine. Jess felt a nervous knot in her stomach as Demi strode away. She hadn\u2019t been given enough time to even start the sandals and she was already being judged for them?! Terrified at what Demi would do if things didn\u2019t go better for the boots, Jess ran to the edge and looked down at the channels of treads on the bottom of the titanic boots (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=46203092\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.o...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJumping into one of the treads, Jess slammed down into a pebble that had been lodged in there, making it shake as it slightly jerked out of the rubber prison holding it in. Squeezing herself down between the rock and the roof of the tread, Jess pressed her legs into the pebble as best as she could, slowly inching it forward slowly until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tScreaming, Jess continued to plummet deeper into the treads of the boots, suddenly slamming into a clump of dirt wedged into the treads of her captors boot. Pushing herself up, Jess began brushing the mud off of her as she started thinking of a way to get this clump out of the boot treads. Pressing herself to the wall, Jess tried to do the same trick she used for the stone\u2026with disastrous consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSQUELCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJess began screaming and pulling as her legs were sucked into the mud like Indiana Jones fell into quicksand. Struggling to get out, Jess could feel her body sinking in deeper as she began calling out for Demi to save her. It was no use; no one could hear her as the thick mud sucked in more of Jess every time she tried to pull herself out. Now stuck up to her thighs in the thick mud, Jess continued struggling in vain, her legs sucked in by the vacuum she was creating with her very struggles to survive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDemi! Please help me!\u201d Jess screamed, hoping to God she\u2019d be rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you really not done with this one too?!\u201d Demi\u2019s voice boomed as Jess turned to the side to see her bare feet tapping angrily. Despite the small tremors, Jess was never happier to see Demi as a massive finger scooped her out from underneath the treads of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDemi! Please, I need more time to do-\u201d Jess began, only to feel like she was hit with a wrecking ball one second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemi flicked the mud-caked Jess into her gym sneakers before walking away, annoyed with her little toy\u2019s lack of progress (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/demi-lovato-now-im-a-warrior-tattoo-sm.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>). As Demi began putting in the final load of laundry, she started thinking of things she could do as a punishment for the little woman. Her efforts had been terrible and clearly she needed to be broken in more as a pet before anything good could be expected of her. Grabbing some dirty gym clothes, Demi looked back at the shoe and shook her head. The thing needed to learn it didn\u2019t get a choice anymore; it was Demi\u2019s way or \u201csplat!\u201d Meanwhile, inside the shoe, jess was keeling over from the sheer smell. It was clearly the pair of sneakers Demi wore when working out, the aroma of sweat inside was nauseating as the little woman fell to her knees, struggling to keep her lunch down (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.whosay.com/28298/1/28298_la.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.whosay.com/28298/1/28298_la...</a>). As Jess drank in the thick air, she began to get light-headed as she struggled to find out exactly what she was supposed to do in this shoe. Taking a step, Jess looked down as she heard her foot squelch like she had stepped into wet mud; pooling around her own shoe was a small, glistening puddle of sweat. A sudden surge of nausea overcame Jess as she bent over and threw up on the massive insole, the putrid environment was in direct combat with Jess\u2019 body\u2026 and it was winning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemi kicked the sneaker accidently as she walked past it to put away a bundle of socks, knocking it over onto its side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJess had been knocked clean onto her ass as the sudden overturn of her workspace had landed her face-first into the moist side of Demi\u2019s sneaker. Groggily getting up, Jess saw Demi busy examining the pairs she was making\u2026this might have been the chance she was waiting for. Taking a step forward, Jess froze. She could try running for freedom, but if she failed it wasn\u2019t going to end well for her. Her head was in a tizzy as her legs refused to move. The clock ran out for a choice though as Demi turned around and froze, seeing the sneaker tipped over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM! THOOM! THOOM! THOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, you know what\u2019s going to happen now don\u2019t you?\u201d Demi said as she <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awake, feeling a bit dizzy. You aren\u2019t sure what happened. The last thing you remember cleaning out the back seat of the limo that was going to pick up Demi Lovato who is in town for a concert. You remember being in the back of the limo with some new spray cleaner when the fumes got to you and you passed out. Now awake, you stand up and take a look at your surroundings. It\u2019s dark where you are but you see a little light so you walk towards it. You can see that you\u2019re definitely in the back seat of the limo but everything was HUGE! Looking around and looking at yourself, you soon realize that somehow you\u2019ve shrunk and are standing under the backseat of the limo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re world is vibrating and shifting. You can tell that the limo is in motion. Soon the car stops and you hear the driver get out. There\u2019s silence for a moment but then from outside you hear the driver say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me get the door for you Ms. Lovato.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d you her sweet voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright blast of light hits your eyes as the car door opens. You watch as one of her sandaled feet drops to the car floor then you hear the sound of the seat above you depressing as she sits her nice butt into the seat. She brings her other foot inside and the driver slams the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d the driver asked after getting into front. \u201cThe area?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d Demi replied. \u201cI want to go to the hotel and freshen up a bit before the concert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car accelerates, shaking your world up. You have to brace yourself to keep from falling over. Understanding the seriousness of the situation, you realize that you need to get her attention somehow. All you can see are her feet. She\u2019s wearing sandals which give you an idea. With her exposed feet, you can touch her skin and maybe she\u2019ll feel you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin making your way out from under the seat. You look up but all you can see are her long legs and the pants she\u2019s wearing. They go up and disappear over the edge of the seat. You continue to walk over to her feet. You\u2019re cautious because a slight movement she makes could be very serious to you at your current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the limo takes a sharp turn and you are brought to your feet. You roll across the floor, stopping when you slam into the hard leather of Demi\u2019s sandal. So much for taking is slow! You get back up on your feet and climb up onto her sandal. Now is your chance. You poke the skin of her foot with your finger\u2026nothing happens. You press your hand against her foot\u2026nothing happens. Finally you begin to scrape and claw at her foot hoping that she\u2019d notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to claw at the skin. Suddenly, her foot begins to move. \u2018It must be working\u2019 you think to yourself. You look skyward, hoping to see Demi look down but what you fail to notice is Demi\u2019s other sandaled clad foot rising up and coming towards you. You see the movement out of the corner of your eye. You turn your head and quickly access the danger. With great effort you leap as hard as you can and jump off the sandal right as the sandal on her other foot presses into the skin of her foot. You watch as she rubs the sandal against her foot realizing that if you hadn\u2019t been quick enough that it would have been you trapped between her foot and sandal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone scratching her itch, Demi returned her foot to the floor. She then lifts the foot you were on and brought it up across her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s itching me?\u201d you hear her say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat! If you had managed to stay on her sandal, you would\u2019ve been up there where she\u2019s looking! The limo takes another sharp turn and once again you find yourself rolling around on the floor. Coming to a stop, you begin to mope over you situation. You are so consumed in thought that you don\u2019t notice her bringing her foot back down. You just happen to look up at the right time to see the sole of her sandal heading straight for you! You make another quick lead and manage to get away just in time before the sole of her sandal hit the floor. BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get noticed but how? You can try the foot again. Maybe you\u2019ll have better luck the second time. Maybe you can try climbing her pants leg to get closer to her or look for another way to get up on the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s no way she\u2019s going to notice your tiny form on the floor of the limo. You wait until you\u2019re confident that she has stopped moving her feet then make a dash for the sandal. You climb up onto it right at her big toe. You begin to reach out to touch it when Demi\u2019s foot began to move. She shifts her foot and moves her toes. This sudden move takes you by surprise. Unprepared for it, you lose your balance and fall forward. Unfortunately, this puts you right underneath her big toe which slams down on top of you as she relaxes her foot, pinning you to her sandal. Demi settles her feet giving you a moment to access your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of her big toe presses heavily on your body. Luckily, your head did not get squished under it with the rest of your body. You can see up between her toes. The smell is not too bad either\u2026a bit of a sweet smell. Probably the scent of the body lotion she used in the shower this morning. You try to move but find that you couldn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, the pressure around you begins to grow. The skin of Demi\u2019s foot begins pressing around you. She is curling her toes, squishing you in the process. You try to scream out but the force of her toes against your body pushes the air out of your lungs. Finally she relaxes her foot, releasing you. You fall face down onto the sandal. Her big toe lands on your back, forcing your face into the worn leather. The smell here is not so pleasant. It\u2019s apparent she\u2019s worn these sandals a lot and there is a nauseous odor from the sweat that has soaked into the material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the limo stops and the car door opens. Demi\u2019s foot begins to move as she steps out of the car. As she stands up her toes push down, pressing you harder into the sandal sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll check in and freshen up\u201d she tells the driver. \u201cBe back for me in two hours. We\u2019ll go to the arena then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mam\u201d the driver replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi starts to walk. When her foot lifts up, the pressure from her toe on your body weakens only to be thrust back down on you hard. With her step, BOOM! The hard sole makes contact with the concrete and her toe lands on you. She lifts her foot and the force on your body lets up a bit only to come back down with her next step, BOOM! With each step you are beaten into her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hotel clerk carries her luggage up to her room ahead of her as Demi checks into the hotel. Key card in hand she makes her way to the elevator, completely unaware of the tiny many under her toe. Her mind is on the concert. As the elevator ascends she closes her eyes and envisions the stage and crowd in her mind. The song plays over in her head and she begins to move her body, doing a little dance. She wiggles her butt a little, begins shifting her weight from side to side and starts to shift her feet. Lifting her heels she begins moving her sandals from side to side, moving on the ball of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toe presses hard against you as Demi shifts her weight. The pressure is worse than when she was walking. Her feet slide a bit in her sandal. Her toe, still pressing hard against you, pulls you along with it. You are literally being ground, rubbed back and forth against her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator doors open bringing Demi back to reality. She makes her way to her suite, unlocks the door and steps inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally! I\u2019m here\u201d she says after the door closes behind her. She turns on the air conditioner and sits on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have got to get out of these shoes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down she carefully undoes the strap of one sandal and then the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! That\u2019s better\u201d she says as they drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up with your mind a haze, the memories of the past few hours vague. Looking around you saw the sun was too bright and too close, blinding you as you laid there.  Your only salvation from its glare was the shade from a curving structure just above you, it was an alien structure made from plastic and built up in three arcs meeting a central point. The pale arcs extended up from a vast plain of purple on which you currently rested. You try to sit up, only to find your arms bound to the ground by iron shackles that appeared to be welded down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggle to free your arms, you catch the glint of metal coming towards you. A quick glance down at your feet causes your heart to drop in fear as an object the size of a semi truck, made of gleaming steel and brightbred materials, comes hovering up from below. It presses down over your legs and after a moment of painful pressure, a deafening sound not unlike a shotgun being pumped is sounded. The truck-like object lifts up and away, leaving in its way thick metal shackles around your ankle. The strange object lifts up yet again and lowers around your waist, after another painful push and a sharp click, it lifts away leaving another metal binding around your waist and utterly immobilizing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know a could staple your head down, but I want to feel you squirming around,\" Came the booming voice of a woman, one who sounded oddly familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that word, the sun itself seemed to turn off and yet the world around you was still brightly light. In wake of the light vanishing, you saw a monolithic woman's face hovering over you like the moon in the sky. It took a moment for you to recognize her, it was Demi Lovato, though she was somehow huge. She also didn't look to happy as she looked down on with a frown. Now understanding the scale of things, the world around you began to become clear. The \"sun\" was just a desk lamp, the metal shackles were mere staples, the truck-sized object was a stapler, and worst of all the vast plain you were bound to was a giant sandal. Looking around as much as you could you saw Demi was sitting at a table in her trailer, holding the sandal firmly in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid pig, this is what you get for perving on me,\" Demi chastised you as she glared down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her words, memories of the past few hours began to return. You had been at a concert for Demi Lovato, you weren't the biggest fan, but your girlfriend liked her, so you went. Towards the end of the show, you had decided to go the extra mile for your significant other, sneaking past the backstage guards, you made your way to Miss Lovato's dressing room, hoping to get her autograph. However as you opened the door, you saw the bare flesh of the pop strt changing and heard an ear-piercing scream as she saw you. A split second later there was a flash of light followed by blackness and silence as you passed out. And only now did you wake up to find yourself only a few inches talk and in the hands of the angry singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Lovato, this is all a misunderstanding!\" You yell up at her, hoping to get out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As nice as it would be to gag you and that squeaky mouse of a voice you have, I really think it'll be nice to have you kissing and smelling my sweaty toes after that last concert,\" Demi replied, essentially ignoring your pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the sandal began to tilt and tremble as Demi moved it towards the ground. Her fingers released the sandal and you felt gravity pulling you downward. Your head smacked painfully against the sandal as you hit the ground. As you shook away the pain and looked up, you were presented with a terrifying sight. Demi Lovato's tan left foot hovered several hundred feet able you, her right foot already slipped into a sandal. Further up her long, fit legs, you saw the pop star dressed in very casual comfortable clothes, a pair of grey sweat pants and a purple graphic tee which matched the highlights in her ebony locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid to give my feet a few affectionate kisses, it's the least you could do to pay me for that peek you got,\" Demi explained as her foot began its descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive foot blotted out the lights, casting a shadow over you as a glided gracefully over you. The foot slide into place, the skin rubbing up against you as Demi's big and second toes slide around the sandals thong. A bit of light filtered in above you through the gap inbetween her third and fourth toe. He foot hung there for a second, before pressing down painfully. The breath was knocked from your lungs as the slimy, sweat-layered ball of her foot came down on top of you. You forcefully inhaled, and unfortunately caught the sore scent wafting from between the woman's toes, where lint and sweat had built up over the course of the last performance. To either side of you, Demi's toes drummed up and down, nearly deafening you as the spread foul salty sweat across the sides of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel any kisses,\" Demi mentioned, a tone of impatience in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a surge of anger that started in your half-squashed stomach and burned its way up toward your throat. You didn\u2019t know where it came from, but a fiery blast of anger erupted from your mouth\u2026or it would have if Demi didn\u2019t shift her weight forward onto the ball of her foot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Feet-408691.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Fee...</a>). The giantess giggled as she heard a pained, tiny squeak from between her toes while she examined herself in the mirror. Smirking, Demi looked down at the red face controrted in pain between her sweaty digits and chuckled, \u201cSO? FEEL LIKE GIVING MY TOES SOME KISSES LIKE A GOOD LITTLE BITCH?\u201d The swell of anger came back\u2026and before you could stop yourself, you said something you never should have to a woman who could dominate you with just her foot. Demi thought that there was going to be a tiny pair of lips pressed to her toes, instead she got a bug that seemed to misunderstand its position beneath her. Leaning forward, Demi put her hands on her knees as she waited impatiently for you to apologize and begin kissing her foot\u2026what she got was a very different response. Lifting her foot off you for the slightest second, you could finally take enough of a breath for just one response\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Go\u2026Go fuck yourself!\u201d you hissed through clenched teeth as Demi\u2019s exhausted toes continued to drum on either side of your head, slamming down onto the foam of the sandal\u2019s sole with easily enough force to crack your head open like an egg. As the words left your mouth, the digits slammed down and you could feel your ribcage begin to creak as Demi rolled her weight forward onto the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI KNOW YOU DIDN\u2019T JUST SAY WHAT I THINK YOU SAID,\u201d Demi mused sweetly, giggling as she felt something snap beneath her foot. You screamed at the top of your lungs as the giantess\u2019s weight snapped some of your lower ribs. You looked up to see Demi looking down at you with what almost seemed to be pity (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.whoa.in/20130907-Whoa/demi-lovato-sad-face-with-white-feather.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.whoa.in/20130907-Whoa/demi-lo...</a>). She looked away from you completely and fixed her hair. You thought that maybe she had had enough of messing with you. You were very wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have screamed as Demi shifted her foot to the side and turned the bones in your left arm to dust\u2026if not for the fact that the giantess had planted her big toe onto your face. Your stomach began to churn as the sweat from Demi\u2019s toe dripped down onto your face. Squirming and spasming beneath her toe, you tried your best to suppress you gag reflex. This was it. You were positive that Demi would press down and crush your head beneath her big toe like a bug. The pressure began to increase. You could hear your skull groaning\u2026 A small whine of desperation escaped your lips right into the flesh of Demi\u2019s digit, tickling her\u2026which alone might have been the only reason that the giant singer lifted it from your face and sighed. \u201cONE MORE CHANCE, BUG. I BETTER FEEL SOME KISSING THIS TIME,\u201d she said as her massive fingers reached down toward you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/cc24e0f711c36defd4b9368f4583863b/tumblr_mz0hn5cjdN1r7xljwo1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://40.media.tumblr.com/cc24e0f711c36...</a>)\u2026. You watched as the giantess\u2019 foot slowly began to retract, leaving you stapled to the sole of Demi\u2019s sandal. Her massive nails tried to get under the metal bar, digging slightly into your stomach. Your flesh tore and a small scream escaped your mouth as you were sure Demi would scoop out your stomach along with the staple. Just as you were about to pass out from the pain though, Demi yanked the staple out and you were given a brief second to catch your breath. Or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly blacked out from pain as the giantess\u2019 fingers pinched around your waist, shifting your snapped ribs. Everything seemed to shift in and out of focus as Demi shifted you back across the black plain of her sandal\u2019s sole until you were dropped haphazardly onto the imprint left by the giantess\u2019 heel. Still hazy from the rough handling, you gasped for air as Demi gently flicked you onto your back\u2026 and applied a new staple which pressed right down onto where your ribs had snapped. As you screamed at the top of your lungs, the giantess merely smirked and stood back up to her full height. A chill ran down your spine as her bare foot once again lifted over you. It slowly began to descend toward your pathetic, broken body as the giantess giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cONE MORE CHANCE. IF YOU DON\u2019T START KISSING BY THE TIME I\u2019M EATING LUNCH, YOU\u2019RE GONNA GET SQUISHED,\u201d Demi said as her bare toes gave you  small press, coating you again in a small layer of salty sweat before they began to slide back into the sandal with no regard for the terrified bug stapled to her footwear\u2019s heel (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f7/6c/e3/f76ce30c87ab198fa6e697736ab5243a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a>). There was a small squeak that barely reached Demi\u2019s ears, muffled suddenly by the warm flesh of her heel. A small smile crept across her lips, knowing that your miniscule body was busy getting slowly crushed just by the sheer weight of her foot alone. The staple dug a little into her heel, but it wasn\u2019t too painful, she was careful to put it right across your chest so she didn\u2019t accidentally crush you before it was time to. But the fate of a single insect didn\u2019t matter too much to Demi as her stomach\u2019s growl took precedence. With her schedule today, Demi knew there wasn\u2019t a ton of time, and with the stress she\u2019d been under previously, today she was just craving something terrible for herself\u2026the local McDonalds sprung into her mind, and her stomach growled again in approval. You were already gone from her mind as the giantess began to get ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe crushing weight would have been bad enough by itself, the weight of Demi\u2019s body pressing down on you threatened to reduce you to a red paste across the giantess\u2019s heel at any second. You were drenched with sweat (both your and hers), forced to spit and sputter as the salty liquid seeped into your mouth, burned your nostrils, and seared your eyes. Every motion you tried to make was quashed by the weight of Demi\u2019s foot pressing down on you\u2026without even meaning to, the giant brunette had you completely under her control. Between the all-out assault Demi\u2019s sweat was waging on your senses of smell, taste, and sight, and the unbearable heat radiating off her foot, Demi had denied you of even the ability to think straight. It felt like you were dehydrated\u2026and getting constantly run down by a steamroller\u2026.and this was all just with Demi standing still. As the giantess decided where her cravings would take her for lunch, you were quickly introduced to the real reason getting stapled to her heel was going to suck\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemi took her first step and smirked as she felt the metal of the staple smack lightly against her heel along with a tiny squeak. Rolling forward onto her toes, she looked over her shoulder back down at you on her heel and stuck out her tongue. \u201cGET TO WORK, BITCH,\u201d she said, flipping you off before she resumed her gentle stroll (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/SUahzV9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/SUahzV9.jpg</a>). A small giggle escaped her lips as her flip-flop once again smacked the bottom of her heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou could feel the warm trickle and iron flavor of blood going down your face; the first slap of Demi\u2019s flip-flop had smashed your nose against her heel, breaking it. The next step sent a surge of pain through your face as you were once again slammed into the unyielding bottom of Demi\u2019s heel. As her flip-flop landed, you were only able to look up helplessly as the heel then came down to meet you again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Demi wasn\u2019t even paying any attention to the tiny soul getting pulverized by her peds. Her stomach growled again as she grabbed her pocket-book and began to head out the door. You were the furthest thing from her mind right now, all Demi wanted was to eat. If the bug underfoot learned its lesson and began to lick, then it would be lucky enough to serve her foot longer. If not\u2026well Demi could always get more of the little things if she wanted to find a proper pet (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Feet-2036721.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Fee...</a>). The car-ride was relatively uneventful; your body squirmed underfoot, but Demi had yet to feel your tongue or lips against her foot like she\u2019d commanded. Already, she was thinking of how best to get rid of you\u2026but as the McDonalds came into view, Demi forgot all about you once again. You were a bug. She\u2019d get rid of your like any other bug\u2026at her leisure... <br>\r\n\t </span></div></div>",

The cold A/C of the McDonalds woke you just in time to enjoy Demi\u2019s heel coming down on your body once again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce again, you were knocked out, the weight of her footfall actually bending the staple so it was now flush with your flesh. The metal band was cutting into your skin as you went limp under her foot, held in place only thanks to the staple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemi got to enjoy one of the perks of her celebrity as the crowd parted before her. Normally she didn\u2019t like stuff like that, but today was a special day; with one person already under her heel and the knowledge that everyone in the building could suffer the same fate if she wanted it to happen, Demi indulged a little in the power and prestige. As she placed the order for her burger, she stole a glance down at her foot and lifted her heel ever so slightly to check on you. Her eyes lit up a little when she saw your battered, bruised body hanging limp in the grip of the staple. A small chill ran down her spine as she thought of what she\u2019d promised. When it was time to begin her meal, you\u2019d be finished. Demi placed her foot back down on your fragile form, making sure not to accidentally crush you by mistake, she\u2019d hate it if she was denied the opportunity to watch as you learned what was coming your way. The smell of her meal wafted into her nostrils, making her mouth water. Part of Demi thought to leave you until she finished eating, but the staple was starting to get really annoying against her heel and she wanted it gone as soon as possible. Heading for the most secluded section of seating she could find, Demi crashed down into the plastic bench, she let her tray clatter on the table and slowly kicked off the flip-flop you\u2019d been stuck to\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWAKE UP BUG,\u201d you heard as what seemed like a small tub of icy water was dumped onto your head. Gasping for air, you almost sucked in a mouthful of water but managed to keep yourself from drowning. Coughing violently, you looked up to see a dark, long tunnel hanging over you, small droplets of water coming off of it. You didn\u2019t know what you were looking at for a second until the whole thing moved and the surreal scene fell into place. Demi had just used her straw to drop a little bit of condensation from her drink onto you\u2026that was how small you\u2019d become. A single droplet was enough to nearly drown you. Your relfection came to a quick end as the monolith that was Demi moved faster than you\u2019d expect something her size to be able to; the sound of her straw grinding against the plastic of the cup\u2019s lid hurt your ears\u2026as the cold shock faded, the pain sunk back in. Through a fog of absolute agony, you tried to speak, only to find your voice gravely and painful in your own throat. Somehow during the walk, Demi\u2019s footsteps had managed to partially crush your throat. You wheezed and tried your best to scream as the giantess popped a fry into her mouth and slowly began to chew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Demi\u2026P-Please\u2026\u201d you said, your voice unable to even reach her ears while she was sitting up. You tried to lift your head only for another wave of pain to crash through your body; your mouth opened and you tried to grasp only for the metal band of the staple to dig deeply into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you writhed on her flip-flop, Demi swallowed her single fry and mulled over how she\u2019d do this. Her eyes turned back down to you and, to your horror, the giantess just broke out into a small, playful smirk (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/eb587eb596f4ee98334ac264e4ccf8d1/tumblr_n05tjbkO8k1rhu5sgo1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://25.media.tumblr.com/eb587eb596f4e...</a>). Licking her lips, she slowly moved her foot forward, splaying her toes over you as she spoke, \u201cYOU HAD ONE LITTLE JOB, BUGGY. ONE TINY JOB AND YOU COULDN\u2019T EVEN DO THAT RIGHT\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrieked as Demi\u2019s toes pressed down into the soft foam of the flip-flop just a fraction of an inch from your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU WANNA LICK NOW, BUG? IF YOU DO, I MIGHT LET YOU GO,\u201d Demi teased, knowing that her foot was just out of reach. She felt a warm surge of euphoria run through her body as she watched you straining your neck, sticking out your tongue in a feeble attempt to earn some mercy. A small blush rose on cheeks as the scene unwinding before her played out. \u201cSTILL NO? OK, BUGGY\u2026IT\u2019S NOT MY FAULT THEN,\u201d Demi giggled as she bent over to pluck the staple out of the foam. As the metal bit came loose, Demi giggled and winked before she slowly began to slide her foot back into the flip-flop. \u201cBYE-BYE\u201d she said, sliding her foot in completely. She could feel your tiny body thrash against her heel. There was a small pause, Demi took a deep breath\u2026and shifted her weight onto your body (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Feet-1702849.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Demi-Lovato-Fee...</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA flood of warmth surged through Demi\u2019s body as your body was reduced to a mere smudge on the bottom of her heel; she squirmed a little in her seat, trying not to draw attention to herself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh God\u2026\u201d a terrified voice said from almost behind Demi, making the singer jump. \u201cD-Did you just? Was that\u2026Oh God! Was that a person?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemi turned and felt her heart sink as she saw that she might have been a little hasty in disposing of her toy here; she\u2019d been seen\u2026by a horrified, gangly young woman who seemed to work here and had been cleaning the bathrooms. The singer felt a brief surge of panic rise in her chest. Not only had she been seen, this fucking college student also seemed to have seen what Demi had been messing with: how the hell had she not noticed her watching for so long?! As Demi was about to run, something clicked in her head\u2026a smile began to grow on the singer\u2019s lips as she relaxed and cocked her head at the employee. Her right hand slipped into her pocketbook as she spoke, \u201cYou ok? You\u2019re not making sense\u2026.\u201d  \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe red-head screamed and leaped back, her body slamming into the threshold of the bathroom as she shook her head. \u201cN-No! I saw! T-There was a person! There was a person on your flip-flop a-and you\u2026 Oh God\u2026\u201d the young woman turned a little green as she seemed pained by the words leaving her throat, \u201cOh God\u2026Y-You killed him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemi\u2019s hands found her keychain and a small bit of relief spread through her. \u201cSeriously, you sound a little\u2026excited. Do you wanna take a seat? Something to drink maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cN-No!\u201d the girl said, her voice rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomething to eat? You can share with me,\u201d Demi said, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl\u2019s face went pale, and just as she opened her mouth to scream at the top of her lungs for health, Demi\u2019s hand shot forward and there was a small flash of light\u2026and the girl was gone. Instead, there was a tiny bug on the floor; Demi slowly strode forward, the familiar feeling of power surging through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOM! BABOOOOM! BABOOOOOOOM! BABOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD FEEL LUCKY, LIL ONE. A LOT OF MY FANS WOULD KILL TO HAVE LUNCH WITH ME\u2026\u201d Demi cooed, looming over the terrified red-head now between her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo! Nononono! P-Please! Please let me go! Stop! S-Someone help me! Save me!\u201d the red-head screamed at the top of her lungs, her voice barely loud enough to reach Demi\u2019s ears as she squatted down over the tiny thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemi giggled and pursed her lips as she spoke in that overly-sweet tone people used when talking to babies, \u201cAWWWWW, IS SOMETHING WRONG? DID THE WITTLE ONE GET SCAWED?\u201d The giantess cocked her head to the side and struck an adorable pose over the bug before reaching down for her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/21/Demi-slammed-by-MC-fans-647x395.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/up...</a>)\u2026. Demi watched the tiny bug get only a few steps before she was able to snatch her up. Another warm wave of euphoria flooded through the singer as the tiny young woman began to wriggle in between Demi\u2019s finger. An idea was swirling in her mind, and while Demi might have been hesitant before\u2026well she couldn\u2019t let this little thing go and tell people about what she\u2019d done, now could she? Walking back to the table and her meal, Demi dropped the tiny young woman onto her tray before grabbing her burger and taking a huge bite out of it (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/42/e1/7b/42e17b59d393463e2c4ca64cb935896e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236...</a>). \u201cMMMMMM,\u201d Demi said, licking her lips as she smirked, \u201cBUT\u2026I THINK IT\u2019S MISSING A LITTLE SOMETHING\u2026.\u201d The giantess couldn\u2019t help but begin to giggle as she snapped the tiny girl up again and\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last thing you remember was you were helping to escort someone to their bus... wait...bus? What kind of bus driver would need an escort? Hold on.... tour bus! That was it! You were part of a security detail that was assigned to some kind of singer during a concert. But who?... Why was the tune of \"Hips don't lie\" playing in your head. And why was the ground slightly vibrating. And why could you hear an engine, voices and why could you hear a Spanish sounding song playing on a radio. Wait... hips don't lie...Spanish? You were protecting Shakira! Now you remembered! You opened the door for her when exiting the building and walked into the bus with her. But you remember feeling a sting in your neck on the way through the cheering crowd that caused you discomfort, but you wanted to keep your stone cold composure around Shakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling in your body seemed to return. So you rose to your feet and noticed that they sunk into the ground you stood on. Speaking of the ground... it was quite unusual for that reason and others. It was tan like skin, and come to think of it... had the details of skin. It was warm like skin, soft like skin... what the hell is this? Suddenly, the light was blocked before suddenly reappearing again, likea massive shadow just passes behind you. You spin around, and notice what looks like a... a couch.. directly ahead of you. But it was ginormous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attention is grabbed by something else though. Moving pillars! They passed a ways in front of you, casting another momentary shadow over you before vanishing out of sight behind the tan wall. You were petrified. They looked they were covered in denim! This was some twilight zone shit! You take a moment to look at the opening of the strange tan structure around you. The opening seemed to be a type of oval shape. You carefully step over to the edge of this strange flesh like floor and peer over the side in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, there was a tall expanse of the same tanned skin like material, with some kind of black cloth draping just in front of it, but it didn't lower down enough to cover the area you were in. To each side, there was some kind of corridor, with what looked like massive seats and couch's lining the walls. The walls also looked to be steel, with huge windows running along it. Looked like it was just dawning outside. Below you, there was two of the same looking pillars you saw earlier, but this time they were covered in black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to put the pieces together. The massive objects, the \"pillars\", the skin like material that surrounded you. The realization hits you hard... you were shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for where you currently where. You remembered what Shakira was wearing the night of the concert. You had even snuck some booty pics when you were walking behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2011/07/12/gerard-pique-blames-shakira-for-white-water-rafting-wipeout-74462/\" target=\"_blank\">http://metro.co.uk/2011/07/12/gerard-piq...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must be standing inside her belly button!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to sit down and process what you had just deduced, when...</span></div></div>",

That realization stung worse than the burning pain in your legs from running yourself raged to not end up crushed to someone\u2019s merchandise. <br>\r\n\u201c<b>THANK YOU! THANK YOU SO MUCH!</b>\u201d the teen gushed as she grabbed her phone and devoured Ashley\u2019s signature with her eyes. She might as well have just given the girl a new family heirloom from the excitement on her face. The ground rumbled under you once more as the girl turned and walked away, clearing a spot in line for the next person. Now it was a kinda heavy guy, sweating in the heat with a concert t-shirt on and a poster in his hand waiting to be signed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck this!\u201d you hissed, pushing yourself to your feet so you could once again run around the table aimlessly. No\u2026not aimlessly this time; you\u2019d run straight to Ashley and get the giantess\u2019 attention one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>WHO DO I MAKE THIS OUT TO?</b>\u201d her voice boomed again, the shadow of her extended arm carving out the path before you to her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>M-MAKE IT OUT TO- SHIT! S-SORRY</b>\u201d the guy stuttered, bending down to grab the poster he just dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>YOU GOT IT?</b>\u201d Ashley said, sitting up slightly and leaning forward. You hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the exchange going on overhead. If you had, then you\u2019d have notice the giantess\u2019 hand coming down right so she could lean over the edge of the table\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly fuck!\u201d you screamed as you were knocked clean on your ass when the pale wall of Ashley\u2019s hand slammed down in front of you. It was like a pale, fleshy barricade had fallen out of the sky. Before you now stood the steep slope of slight webbing between the giantess\u2019 fingers\u2026 Yes, the steep, insurmountable walls flanking either side of you were really just Ashley Costello\u2019s slender fingers. Forget the early estimate, you couldn\u2019t even guess how tiny you\u2019d become. Though, you got a good benchmark as you looked to your  right and found yourself staring at the massive silhouette of Mickey Mouse\u2019s head that you knew Ash had tattooed on the inside of her right hand\u2019s pointer-finger (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.prettydesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ash-Costellos-Tattoos-Cute-Small-Mickey-Mouse-Silhousette-Tattoo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.prettydesigns.com/wp-content/...</a>). You didn\u2019t even come up to the base of his ears. Suddenly, the idea of getting Ashley\u2019s attention seemed laughable. At this rate, you\u2019d count yourself lucky if you could make it closer to her chest without getting killed in the process. The giantess didn\u2019t give you long to think as the chubby fan retrieved his poster and placed it down before her. Thankfully, the wall of skin disappeared as Ashley grabbed a pen to sign; you had maybe a few seconds to close more of the distance before her hand came back to take a second shot at you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ahead, you could see the twin mounds of Ashley\u2019s chest hanging overhead; if you got too close to the edge of the table, you\u2019d have to worry about getting crushed under them as well. It seemed like everything on the table existed now for the sole purpose of making your journey difficult, or was flat-out there to kill you. Your focus had stayed on Ashley\u2019s chest for too long and you once again lost your footing. You smashed the back of your head into the hard table-top as your legs flew out from under you. Try as you might to get up, it seemed like your limbs weren\u2019t responding. On top of having to contend with surviving at a fraction of an inch tall, now you had to deal with a concussion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>WHO\u2019S NEXT?</b>\u201d Ashley asked, pulling her arms back as the large guy walked away, blushing bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOOOOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d you screamed, pressing yourself flat against the table as Ashley\u2019s massive arms soared by overhead. Her tattooed arm had nearly crushed you under it when Ashley dragged it back, now as you stood up and looked at it, you could only feel your heart leap into your throat. Towering in front of you was the back of Ashley\u2019s gargantuan right hand\u2026and the ominous tattoo carved into her pale skin. Like a pale billboard, you found yourself staring at one of Ashley\u2019s most noteworthy tattoos\u2026the word \u201cDead\u201d was scrawled in artistic script on her silky smooth skin (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ash-costello-dead-hand-tattoo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>). Your stomach began to knot up painfully\u2026 you had never been one to take things like \u2018signs\u2019 too seriously in the past, but this one was too much to just brush off. This entire day was one big fucking joke after another\u2026this couldn\u2019t be real. \u201cI\u2019m dreaming\u2026that\u2019s gotta be it, I\u2019m just dreaming\u2026\u201d you muttered, trying to deny the world around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>MY NAME IS TAYLOR, MY FRIENDS ARE GOING TO FREAK OUT WHEN THEY SEE THIS!</b>\u201d a young college-aged girl said as she passed over a newly purchased CD for Ash to sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOOOOOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to hit the deck again as Ashley\u2019s arm once again flew over you. Her chest! There was no time to waste as you once again ran toward the edge of the table closest to Ashley. Even though you\u2019d only been trying to survive for a little, it surprised you how easily you could not ignore the activities of the giants above you to focus on your job. It was a razor-sharp focus that couldn\u2019t be broken by anyth-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had crossed her arms again, having finished signing the CD while you were too engrossed in your own thoughts. You found yourself now pinned under the crushing weight of Ashley\u2019s arm was now weighing down on you. This definitely wasn\u2019t a dream! The giantess above hadn\u2019t even noticed you under her forearm as she began leaning forward, pressing down on your with increasingly painful pressure. As Ashley pulled her arm back the slightest bit, you found yourself totally buried in her flesh, smothered. Your bones felt like they were slowly bending under the weight of Ashley\u2019s arm\u2026your lungs were on fire\u2026you felt your consciousness begin to slip. Panicked, you tried pushing against the mound of flesh to no avail; in a haze of adrenaline you did the only thing you could in the situation\u2026bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHMMMM?</b>\u201d Ashley said, lifting her right arm as she felt like there was something sharp against it. Nothing was on the table\u2026looking at her arm she saw what looked like a few bits of dirt, but nothing all that sharp. Brushing against the itchy spot, she felt the sensation go away. \u201c<b>OK\u2026WEIRD</b>\u201d she said. Maybe it was dirt on the table? Well that would be easy to deal with at least\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\u201d you gasped as you slammed hard into the table-top. It was a miracle you were alive at all you thought. Staggering to your feet, you looked around to try and get your bearings. A small tremor threatened to knock you over again. Turning to your right, you saw what had caused it\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHMMMM\u2026GUESS IT WAS NOTHING,\u201d Ashley\u2019s voice boomed above you as her eyes scanned the table-top and failed to pick you out against the dark grain of the wood surface of the fold-out table. The ground rumbled under you as the giantess settled back into place and leaned forward to greet the new, nervous fan that approached. Once again you were cast in Ashley\u2019s shadow for the umpteenth time in this short, terrifying venture. It was like a small patch of night had swallowed you up as your gaze rose from the table\u2019s surface. You could see the gentle slopes of Ash\u2019s breasts clothes by her shirt\u2026though the soft glow of her pale skin reflecting the harsh artificial light eventually reached your eyes as her bare skin was revealed past the neck-line of her shirt. Your gaze rose still higher until you were staring at the long, slender cylindrical structure of Ashley\u2019s throat and then the underside of her perfectly shaped jaw. Her red and black lips shined and you could see her dark eyes focused on the fan as she chattered away amicably, unaware of her tiny audience (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/_hpw7WN0pM/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/_hpw7WN0pM/</a>). Entranced, you couldn\u2019t tear your eyes away from your idol. Even at a truly, terrifyingly colossal size, Ashely still seemed to have this gentle hypnotic quality that lulled you. Although that would be fine (and sort of cute) at your normal size\u2026it had some consequences in your current situation. One such consequence was moving toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG! THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH! I-I-I I LOVE YOU! OH GOD, I MEAN I LOVE THE BAND! OH WOW, SORRY! UM, BYE!\u201d the current fan gushed as her signed photograph was passed back to her and Ash flashed a smile at her. The college goth ran off, her face flushed red while Ashley brushed a lock of hair behind her ear and leaned back. You were suddenly subject to a blinding flash of light thanks, in part, to your trance-like stare at the sky. You yipped in pain and began rubbing your throbbing eyes\u2026all the while unaware of what Ashley was doing with the hand she\u2019d used to tame her hair\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were knocked flat on your ass, tossed back several yards from the impact. Flopping onto your back, you were stunned for a few seconds as your body tried to make sure everything was still working. It was frankly a miracle you hadn\u2019t snapped your neck on the hard wood surface, but you found it hard to be grateful since every inch of your body now screamed in pain. \u201cFuck,\u201d you groaned, rubbing the back of your neck as you tried to open your eyes, \u201cWhat the fuck\u2026was\u2026that\u2026.shit\u2026.\u201d You were speechless as you looked up at the mural that now loomed over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHO\u2019S NEXT?\u201d Ashley asked, unaware that her right hand had nearly crushed you. If you\u2019d been even an inch more to the right, your body would now be a red little splatter under the broken heart tattoo that graced the side of Ashley\u2019s right thumb (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ash-costello-heart-hand-tattoo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>). Now a sweaty, larger man was approaching and Ashley fought to keep herself from visibly reacting as the guy approached too quickly\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook under you as the man approached. Each tremor made you lose balance until finally you managed to grab hold of something to help you keep balance. It was only after you pulled yourself up that you noticed you were holding onto something warm\u2026and ridged\u2026and somewhat familiar feeling. Slowly, you turned and felt your cheeks flush. In the small series of quakes, your fumbling and falling had brought you to this point\u2026you were now holding hands with Ashley Costello\u2026at least in a way\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ash was busy dealing with the sweaty fan, you now had a choice to make. Either you could try to get Ashley\u2019s attention from her hand again and risk another dangerous duel with her hand\u2026or you could get the hell away from this wall of firm flesh before a twitch of Ashley\u2019s hand smeared you on the table. That second option seemed a lot more likely after everything you\u2019d been through today. You\u2019d be more than happy to get away and buy yourself a little time to think. You snuck another look at the fat guy pestering Ash and figured you\u2019d have a little time to make some distance away from Ash\u2019s hand. In one swift motion, you pushed away from her thumb and began running like mad toward her chest. If you could get just a few inches away from Ash\u2019s hand, there would be a chance to find a way out of this mess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHANK YOU SO MUCH!\u201d the man said, his voice booming loud enough to make you trip on your own feet. After a large tumble, you were on your back, watching as Ash\u2019s right hand passed the man his signed bit of gifts. Honestly, at this point you should have known what was about to happen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S NO PROBLEM! THANKS FOR COMING TO THE CONCERTS, YOU GUYS MAKE IT ALL WORTH IT,\u201d Ash said, putting on a good smile as her hand recoiled a little too quickly. You\u2019d just managed to get to your feet as Ashley gave the man his stuff; figuring you could use the few seconds to get a little more distance between you and Ash\u2019s hand. Ironically, it was because you stood up that this next thing happened\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you didn\u2019t know how the hell you survived without having your back broken and ending up as a paraplegic. Though, it turned out you were wrong before about your body screaming in pain\u2026NOW it was screaming in pain. To be honest, the only reason every bone in your body hadn\u2019t been crushed into dust by that last his was thanks to the low mass of your newly reduced body. Something to do with physics, but basically it was the same reason an ant could survive a huge fall. Still, just because you lived didn\u2019t mean you\u2019d come out unharmed. Your back was already starting to bruise and you were having trouble breathing\u2026much less moving. Gritting your teeth, you managed to flip over onto your back to see what the hell had hit you. It was a miracle you didn\u2019t shit yourself. You found yourself face-to-face with the massive tattoo of a skull on Ashley Costello\u2019s thumb\u2026the eyes of death were locked on you quite literally (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ash-costello-misfits-skull-thumb-tattoo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>). You quickly put together what happened. When Ash shied away from the creep, her hand came back and you were smashed into by her thumb like an unfortunate pedestrian on the train-tracks at the wrong time. Only, you were \u2018lucky\u2019 not to be reduced to meaty chunks like you would have if you weren\u2019t barely the size of a small ant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that did also mean Ashley didn\u2019t even feel her thumb ram into you. The giant Harley Quinn look-alike was busy dealing with the goosebumps breaking out over her body from that last \u2018fan\u2019 of hers. She balled up her hand in a fist and squeezed till she heard her knuckles crack (a sound that nearly made you piss yourself, by the way). One of the security guards she\u2019d become friends with gave a concerned look and she just smiled at him and shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to send in the next one?\u201d the built man asked.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Tell them I\u2019m in the bathroom or something,\u201d As the guard disappeared around the corner and conveyed her message, the giantess could hear the crowd groan and let out a small giggle. A few minutes was all she needed. Her lips were dry and her tongue parched. Reaching under the table, she grabbed the cold bottle of water that had been set up for her at the start and unscrewed the cap before bringing the plastic container to her lips. Taking a big first sip, Ashley closed her eyes and enjoyed the feeling of cool water running down her throat. The condensation on the bottle began to run down her hand and wrist\u2026and one or two droplets fell off. You were the one lucky enough to find those. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as though someone had decided to dump out an above-ground swimming pool overhead. The droplets were more than enough to wash you away if they landed on you. Fortunately, the first one missed. It landed a few inches away, but you still saw the surreal amount of water splash out against the table-top only to reform into smaller droplets thanks to the surface tension\u2026physics was weird at this size to witness. Maybe it was because of that extra second of mesmerisation that you failed to notice the oddly colored shadow that enveloped you. Yes\u2026the first droplet of water missed you\u2026the second one didn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was first pressed to the ground as the equivalent of several gallons of water suddenly crashed down on your frame. Prostrated, you thought for a moment that the weight of the droplet would be enough to break your bones in the way Ash\u2019s digits couldn\u2019t. As the orb began to break and deform though, your body was swallowed by the deluge. On one hand, the pressure had disappeared now that you were floating; on the other, you hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to take a breath and now were struggling not to drown as you swam to the surface of the shifting mass of water. You\u2019d expected the droplet to disperse just like you\u2019d seen buckets of water do an innumerable amount of time in your life. That was how water worked! It was supposed to fall and run away\u2026then your oxygen-starved brain remembered the brief glimpse you had of the other droplet. Another burst of energy surged in your body as your cells stole every bit of oxygen they could from your blood. One last burst of energy to save your life. You knew you had to swim up\u2026and with every muscle in your body screaming, you surged to the surface of the droplet and took in a deep breath. Gasping, coughing, and gagging, your head was crackling with pain as you looked to see your tiny body now wading on top of the curved slope of the water-droplet on the surface of Ash\u2019s table. Physics was a bitch, you decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHH,\u201d Ash sighed as she emptied nearly half the bottle, unaware of the drama in the droplets on the table. Licking her lips, she slowly lowered the bottle back to the table. Fate was against you it seemed. You looked up just in time to see the bottom of the bottle hover over you for a split-second before it slammed down on you and the water drop (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4051/4625610318_2a0b61e8f8_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4051/46256...</a>)....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her lips, Ash ran her tongue across them one last time and was about to tell her friend in security to let fans back in when she heard her phone buzz. She paused and looked at the hall where the security guard had left and then back at her buzzing jacket pocket\u2026she\u2019d bought a little more time to indulge, right? Reaching into her jacket, Ash pulled out her phone and rolled her eyes as she saw several messages and emails that were demanding her attention. She unlocked the phone and began scrolling through, unaware of your plight on the table-top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmmrgh!\u201d you howled under the water. No, you hadn\u2019t been crushed by the water bottle that came down on your head. You were, however, once again forced under thanks to the droplet conforming to the sea-star shaped groove on the bottom of the bottle. Your head was throbbing after you were hammered back into the droplet thanks to the plastic hammer of the bottle; concussed, dizzy, and running out of air, you began swimming in any direction you could. Again, the light began to fade as oxygen ran low, but this time you found air with a little more ease. Panting, you looked out and saw you were staring at the exact center of the bottom of the bottle. It was like being in one of those aquariums where people walked through glass tunnels and stared up at suspended water. Strangely, you found it kind of beautiful\u2026but like everything nice you\u2019d experienced since shrinking, the experience was fleeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were once again tumbling in the flowing water as the world around you shifted once more. Though you didn\u2019t know why. Ashley, on the other hand, did\u2026though she didn\u2019t know about the tiny person spiraling and flipping around in the drop of water like living backwash. All she wanted was to move the water bottle out of the way and to the side of the table. As the bottle shifted to the right, you were left in the thick streak of residual water that seemed to come up to your waist when you finally managed to get back to your feet. Looking up at Ashley, you felt the exhaustion truly weigh down on you. Her eyes seemed focused on you for a second\u2026then they flashed back to the phone you now saw in her left hand. For a moment, you could feel the anger rise up in your belly. You wanted to scream every curse in the book at Ashley for what she\u2019d done, but the complaint died in your throat. It looked like a trick of the light\u2026but Ashley\u2019s massive form was starting to lean backwards\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking up, you actually pissed yourself this time as you saw what was going on\u2026.Another shadow fell over you as you looked up and saw the heel of Ashley\u2019s boot hang over you for a second\u2026then it came down (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ash-costello-red-ribcage-tee.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!.....BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nA small wave pushed you over, but you quickly managed to surface from the river and looked around to see what the hell had happened while coughing up a lungful of water. This time, you found yourself in a much deeper shadow than the one that Ashley had cast when she leaned over you earlier. Looking around, you could see nothing but a deep black horizon before you. For a moment, you were terrified that maybe you\u2019d been blinded till you turned around and saw the rest of the room and the hallway the giant fans came from with perfect clarity behind you. A chill ran down your spine and your stomach knotted painfully as you turned back toward the darkness. Facing the black void, you let your eyes adjust this time\u2026though each passing second just revealed greater horrors to you. It wasn\u2019t darkness\u2026wasn\u2019t a shadow\u2026or even spontaneous blindness. The endless darkness before you was just a trick your eyes played on you. What you were staring at was VERY real. What you were staring at\u2026was the rubber sole of Ashley\u2019s right boot. Stepping backwards in the uneasy river, more detail began to become apparent as your eyes adjusted to the darkness bathing Ash\u2019s sole. Tiny details began to come to your attention: bits of dirt and tiny stone fragments embedded in the rubber, scars cut from weeks of walking in them, areas were rubbed nearly smooth from whatever surface Ash had dragged them through, mud was caked into some of the massive treads, and you could have sworn you saw a dead bug\u2019s corpse crushed flat into the unforgiving rubber. <br>\r\nYour stomach knotted even tighter as you saw the dead bug\u2026the insect was even bigger than you were. It was just luck that had let you survive the last few encounters; if you were stuck under her shoe, nothing would save you from ending up as the newest decorative smear on the bottom of Ashley\u2019s boot. Something primal in you was screaming that you needed to run. You were in mortal danger if you stayed here. Going closer would be crazy! Even so\u2026you took a step toward the massive black wall of rubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot\u2026you\u2019re a fucking idiot,\u201d you said under your breath to yourself as you made it out of the river and reached toward the rubber wall. Your hand brushed against it and you found it wasn\u2019t nearly as smooth as it looked from back at the river. In fact, the rubber was full of near-micro tatters and tears that someone of\u2026well your size\u2026could use as handholds. You let your eyes drift up further until you were craning your neck back to try and see the top of Ashley\u2019s boot to little avail. The zig-zag treads seemed to rise perpetually\u2026but you knew somewhere high above would be the tip of Ashley\u2019s boot\u2026and maybe your first real chance at getting noticed if you could make a big enough commotion (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://soldiersystems.net/blog1/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Leg-Boot.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://soldiersystems.net/blog1/wp-conte...</a>). Before you really knew what it was you were doing, your hands had pushed their way into the first hand-holds and your body lifted from the surface of the table. Although Ashley didn\u2019t know it yet, on the bottom of her boot, an epic struggle for survival was just starting. You pressed your body close to the bottom of Ashley\u2019s tread and began dragging your body up, shifting ever so slightly as you struggled to find handholds blindly in the uncaring rubber wall. When you were big, rubber would yield to your hands\u2026now you might as well have been grabbing onto a somewhat soft rock. Comfortable to grab, but unworkable in your grip. Looking up, you saw the indent of the first tread still high above you\u2026this was going to be a long climb\u2026.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nIn reality only a minute and a half had gone by, but to you it felt as though you\u2019d been climbing for hours. Sweat poured down your brow and body as you swung to the side and pushed yourself up, reaching for a dangling bit of rubber. Your hand just managed to catch hold of it, but your entire body\u2019s weight yanked down and threatened to make you fall back down to the table top. Looking down, you saw it would have been maybe 30 feet to the hard table-top\u2026it was a fall you\u2019d prefer to avoid. Finally, what you were looking for was in reach. You stretched and managed to grab onto the ridge and yanked your whole body up in one last go. Groaning in agony, your muscles strained to their limit\u2026but you managed to pull your body into the second tread indent. Gasping for air, you wiped your brow and looked down\u2026about half-way up her heel. From the sound of things, Ashley was still checking messages, but you didn\u2019t want to be on the bottom of her shoe any longer than you needed to\u2026there had to be a faster way! Checking your body out, you saw your clothes were already torn and tattered, the stitching was pulled out by rock fragments at\u2026the\u2026seams\u2026. Your head snapped to the side as you looked to the edge of the tread indent. Maybe\u2026just maybe you could crawl up the stitching on the side of Ashley\u2019s boot\u2026.<br>\r\n\t </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After another few seconds, you finally pulled yourself up, flopping onto the smooth slab of rubber that was the life of Ashley\u2019s boot\u2019s heel. It was the first time in what felt like forever that you were able to get a moment to rest. Walking along the flat surface, you tried to take your time to catch your breath\u2026until you heard Ashley sigh. The whole boot suddenly shifted and for a moment, you thought she was going to place her feet back down on the floor, and you would end up crushed beneath the heel like a bug. Steadying yourself against the rubber wall of her sole, you made your way toward the instep of her boot as quickly as possible, praying something kept Ash from readjusting before you could get onto the stitching! As you passed by the imprinted brand symbol in the middle of her sole, the ground was suddenly pulled out from under your feet. Tumbling down the rubber slope, you clawed at the black surface, trying to get some traction, anything to keep from plummeting off her heel. If you did\u2026then forget being crushed under her boot, you\u2019d be killed before her footwear even came down on your head. By the grace of some base god, you managed to slow your roll just in time\u2026until you slipped off the edge. Your hand shot up and you just managed to get a grip on the rubber ledge. Pulling hard, you yanked yourself back up and began to run for the edge of the boot. Leaping, you just managed to get your hand onto the side of Ashley\u2019s boot just in time as you heard her groan again and the whole thing began to shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBZZZZZZZZ!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOr not\u2026another email came in and Ashley straightened out her legs on the table as her eyes began to scan through the writing. You\u2019d take this chance though to climb as high as possible while Ashley decided not to move quite yet. Running the last distance of your sprint, you made it to the instep of her boot and swung around the side of the rubber surface to grab hold of the generous stitching that held her massive bit of footwear together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAshley, for her part, had just about had it with signing autographs for today. She\u2019d been at this for hours, and although she loved her fans, the creeps were starting to show up and she was in no mood to deal with them. The last thing she wanted was to play nice with one of the overenthusiastic fans that were about two seconds away from becoming a stalker\u2026seriously, it felt sometimes like she was constantly being watched. Even now, as she tried to focus on the email on the screen, Ash couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that someone was observing her\u2026. Ignoring the strange sensation, Ash once again looked at her phone\u2026and just missed seeing you as you grappled onto the side of her right boot and began to climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile the giant Harley Quinn look-alike was busy reading her phone, you were finally able to start climbing up her boot without the gnawing fear of getting crushed slowing your every move. Between that, the lack of mud to traverse, and the ladder-like stitching, you could finally begin making good time as you found yourself almost flying up the side of Ash\u2019s boot. Thankfully, these seemed to be one of her favorite pairs; they were well worn which meant that the stitching was loose or the strong frayed enough that you had several handholds to use while climbing. As you neared the toe end of her boot, you could see the scuffing on the leather surface. While ugly, you could at least see that the gashes in the thick leather surface would also work as good handholds. Taking one look over your shoulder at Ashley, you could see that she was still preoccupied with her phone. If she didn\u2019t move, then this might work\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLeaping, you grabbed tightly to the torn, near microscopic bits of leather that hung off the sides of the gashes. Holding tight, you pulled with all your might and soon found yourself on the toe of Ash\u2019s boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsh finally finished reading the text and put her phone down, rubbing her eyes. It was probably time to get people to come back in for the last round of signatures before she\u2019d finally be allowed to go home. Sending a quick text to her security, she could already hear the commotion outside as fans once again began to get organized\u2026maybe 5 minutes before she was flooded again. Yawning, Ash slowly began to draw her knees into her chest when something caught her eye. On her boot\u2026was that a bug?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWHAT THE HELL?\u201d Ashley\u2019s voice thundered as you managed to get to the very tip of her boot. Your heart leaped as you turned around and saw her dark eyes were locked on you\u2026and your voice faltered too. \u201cEEEW, IS THAT ANOTHER BUG?\u201d Ash groaned, raising her hand as though she were going to mash you into a pulp against the palm of her left hand. Your stomach dropped as you realized there was maybe five seconds separating you from death by splatter. A flood of adrenaline made it into your bloodstream as you rolled onto your back and put your hands up to protect yourself. Everything seemed to slow down as you saw Ashley\u2019s hand start to come down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo! H-Hey! Ashley! Please stop it! I\u2019m not a bug! P-Please!\u201d you screamed at the very top of your lungs, closing your eyes as you waited for the massive hand to crush you....</span></div></div>",

As Ash pinched you between her pointer-finger and thumb, you suddenly felt your body fly through the air. Everything came to a sudden stop as you suddenly found yourself hanging before Ashley\u2019s nose\u2026the giant eyes locked on you had gone wide as your captor realized she was holding onto an ant-sized human. \u201cH-Hi\u2026\u201d you squeaked nervously\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsh\u2019s eyes went wide as she instinctively dropped you in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cW-Wait! Help me! P-Please!\u201d you screamed as you began to plummet through the air. Flipping head over heels, you didn\u2019t know where you were going to land until you finally saw a blur of pale pink below you\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTHAT WAS CLOSE\u2026\u201d Ash whispered to herself as she just managed to get her hand under you before you plunged into her lap. Tiny or not\u2026there was no way the giant Harley-Quinn look-alike was going to let a random stranger get anywhere near her crotch. You were lucky for that\u2026had you landed on her lap, she most likely would have just slapped and splattered you under her palm. Instead, she was just glaring down at you with a mix of shock, wonder, and a hint of disgust\u2026or maybe some cruel amusement. You didn\u2019t know which of those would have been worse for you yet as you suddenly were lifted so quickly that your ears popped. \u201cHOLY SHIT, IT\u2019S SERIOUSLY A FUCKING TINY PERSON!\u201d Ash said, her voice threatening to rupture your eardrums as her dark brown eyes locked onto you with an intensity that sent a chill down your spine. \u201cHOW\u2019D YOU GET LIKE THIS?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour voice caught in your throat even though you knew this question was a golden opportunity to explain yourself.

Throwing up was not an option while you were stuck between the giantess\u2019 fingers, but that didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t close to hurling. That also wasn\u2019t lost upon Ash who caught sight of your slightly green-tinged face and frowned, \u201cOK, IF YOU THROW UP ON ME, I\u2019M GOING TO MAKE YOU WISH I\u2019D JUST STEPPED ON YOU, GOT IT?\u201d she threatened. You wouldn\u2019t throw up\u2026but now you definitely felt like you might shit yourself if she threatened you like that again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cP-Please, I\u2019m a total fan of y-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHOLD ON,\u201d Ashley said, seeing your mouth move, but not hearing a single word that came out of it. It was just a consequence of being ant sized\u2026you\u2019d been spotted completely by luck and now it was up to Ashley whether or not you were even worth listening to. For now, it seemed she was more curious than anything as she began to bring you around to the right side of her head. As you passed by her inky-black died hair, you finally saw the pale tinge of her skin\u2026and then the gentle curve of her ear as you saw the large metal piercing and the broken-heart tattoo that all her fans knew about (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ash-costello-heart-behind-ear-tattoo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>).

Hold on, you can\u2019t be seri-\u201d you were cut off as your face was pressed into the warm, soft flesh of her earlobe. The tip of Ashley\u2019s pointer-finger ground you against her skin and shoved you deeper into her ear before it withdrew, leaving you coughing and coated in a bit of wax that hung on your like heavy, wet snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTHAT\u2019S MUCH BETTER,\u201d Ashley\u2019s voice boomed inside the ear-canal, threatening to deafen you at once. \u201cOK, NOW YOU\u2019VE GOT 10 SECONDS TO TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON OR ELSE I\u2019M GOING T-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNEXT!\u201d a different voice called.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d Ashley hissed under her breath.

Time seemed to slow down as you began to tumble through the air. Looking up, you could see your original target, Ashley\u2019s chest, just getting further away by the second. You were headed down\u2026any second now you were sure you\u2019d splatter against the floor and die\u2026if you were lucky. You watched the length of her shirt slowly go past you like the opening sequence of a Star Wars movie if they played it upside down (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=101435413\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.o...</a>). Wait\u2026her shirt? Her lap! You could land on her lap and be just fine! You struggled to flip yourself over, hoping to fall onto the soft surface of her thigh.

It was a miracle you hadn\u2019t broken every bone in your body, but you probably had your small stature to thank for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>NEXT?</b>\u201d Ashley asked, crossing her legs. She couldn\u2019t have done it at a worse time. You tried feebly to block her leg, but it ended just how you thought it would. Completely overwhelmed, you once again found yourself falling down the endless stretch of her pale legs. Her black socks then zipped past next; you were too winded to even try to struggle at this point. Spinning in mid-air, you saw a black bat-wing before your body slammed into the surface of Ashley\u2019s creeper shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything hurt. It was honestly a curse that you hadn\u2019t passed out by this point\u2026having to endure this kind of pain was hell. You tried to move only to find your body already slipping down. Panicked, you reached up and felt your fingers dig into some kind of sewn surface. You couldn\u2019t tell yet, but you\u2019re battered body had landed on the tongue of Ashley\u2019s creeper shoes\u2026the ones with bat wings coming off the sides (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ash-costello-super-sad-dress-500x500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>).

She loved talking with people who loved her music, but Ashley could feel it in her gut. If she didn\u2019t get to a bathroom quickly, she\u2019d have a lot of PR work to do to recover from pissing herself in a room full of people who admired her. Ashley walked slow enough while still in sight of everyone\u2026but the second she turned a corner, the musician suddenly began sprinting like the gunshot signaling the start of a race had gone off. It was laughable now that you\u2019d thought hanging onto her laces when she was slowly walking had been difficult; that might as well have been a warm-up compared to what you now endured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK! THWACK! THWACK! THWACK!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lace, it seemed, was not the best thing to hold onto if one wanted to survive a run while the size of a bug on Ashley\u2019s massive bat-winged creeper shoes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ash-costello-bat-wing-boots-500x500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>). The long laces flapped with each heavy step she took, your tiny body was getting whipped around, smacking against her ankle one second only to get slammed into the rubber lift of the shoe a moment later. Each impact knocked what little air you\u2019d managed to sneak into your lungs out. Deprived of oxygen, enduring several G-force, and beaten senselessly against Ashley\u2019s bony ankle and dense shoe sole, you were barely on the edge of consciousness as the giantess finally found a bathroom and raced in, slamming the door behind her. \u201cUGH!\u201d Ashley groaned, her stomach killing her as the giantess slowly shuffled to the toilet. Her entire body seemed to be rebelling against her at the moment\u2026but her slow gate was actually giving you the first chance you\u2019d had since this whole fiasco started to try and situate yourself better. Although you though it was a miracle that you hadn\u2019t passed out, you knew you had no time to stop and catch your breath. The flood of adrenaline flowing through your veins dulled the pain and gave you the boost of energy you needed to start climbing up the lace, hoping to make it off of the whip before Ashley tried her hand at another race. By the time you heard Ashley put down the toilet-seat and start wiping off the porcelain throne, you\u2019d already managed to make it almost halfway up her lace\u2026your good luck couldn\u2019t last forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>NO! SORRY, OCCUPIED!</b>\u201d Ashley shouted, leaping toward the door and flicking the lock she\u2019d neglected to deal with when she got in. It was a quick burst of speed on Ashley\u2019s part\u2026and that was exactly why it spelled disaster for you. You\u2019d been whipped around once again\u2026but instead of hitting Ashley\u2019s ankle, you hit just a bit below it. Exhausted, you lost your grip on the lace\u2026and fell inside the bat-winged shoes\u2026.<br>\r\nNow that she wasn\u2019t going to be interrupted, Ash went back and finally yanked down her pants and plopped down onto the toilet. Finally, the rock-star was given a moment to relieve the tension she\u2019d been building up all day as she let her stomach begin to work itself out. Pinned between Ash\u2019s sock-clad ankle and the leather wall of her boot, you were able to hear the devastation that her stomach must have been wreaking on her. Uncomfortable as it was to be stuck in her boot, you were suddenly grateful to be here rather than in the toilet bowl. Still though, you needed to find a way to get noticed before she began moving again and you \tended up somewhere dangerous\u2026like under her foot. Unfortunately, with her stomach still angry at her, Ash could only distract herself by fidgeting ever so slightly. The giantess\u2019 ankle pressed against you harder as her legs squeezed together. Your ribs began to bend and creak when Ash\u2019s bony ankle refused to stop its advance! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-H-Help me! P-Please!\u201d you wheezed; it seemed like your ribcage was going to collapse and turn your lungs into a pin-cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>OH GOD, SOMEONE KILL ME\u2026</b>\u201d Ashley moaned as she spread her legs a little bit to try and ease the pain in her tummy. The crushing hold her ankle had on you finally released. Falling down the boot, you finally came to a stop after slamming into the leather wall of the boot and crashing down on top of her massive sock-clad foot. High above, Ash groaned\u2026it felt like now she had to deal with a fucking rock in her boot. Looking at the floor of the bathroom, she decided to just deal with the stupid thing till she made it back to the bus. Flexing her toes, she began shifting her foot, hoping that the little thing would end up under her toes where it would hopefully be a LOT less annoying. You screamed as you began rolling down the slope of Ash\u2019s sock-clad foot, headed straight for her massive toes. The rough fibers of the sock were everywhere, begging for you to grab hold of them\u2026but every time you did, Ashley would wiggle her toes again and send you rolling once more. Before you could stop yourself, you finally rolled right over the edge of her toes and slammed into the front of her boot. Falling down into the bottom crevice, you looked around in the total darkness trying to find a way out\u2026 \u201c<b>UGH!</b>\u201d Ash grunted, pulling her legs in tightly thanks to a jolt of pain in her stomach. The ground shifted suddenly under you as she shifted without warning. Your head slammed backwards against the interior front of the boot before you were lurched forward. Ash\u2019s insole was suddenly pressed to your face after you fell flat onto it. Groaning, you tried to get up only to suddenly feel an incredible weight settle down on top of you\u2026Ash\u2019s toes were now resting on you while the giantess tried to endure her upset stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jolt of pain shot through your leg now\u2026Ashley\u2019s toes had pressed down and crunched your right femur like it was a dry toothpick. You couldn\u2019t even hear your own screaming over the sound of Ashley groaning and her stomach\u2019s assault on the toilet-bowl. The noxious chorus was interrupted as Ash\u2019s phone began to buzz in her pants pocket. With her pants around her ankles, it meant the tremors were going right through her shoe and shaking you along with your now shattered leg. You\u2019d have screamed if your mouth didn\u2019t immediately get stuffed with sock cotton the moment you opened it up\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the pain she was feeling, Ashley managed to fish the phone out of her pocket and answer it. From the conversation, you figured it was another band-member or maybe their manager. \u201c<b>GUH! H-HEY, LOOK I\u2019M GOING BACK TO THE BUS SOON, MY STOMACH IS KILLING ME. PLEASE JUST LET ME HAVE IT TONIGHT FOR MYSELF. I FEEL LIKE I\u2019M DYING HERE</b>,\u201d Ashely moaned, clutching her stomach as it finally seemed for the moment that she was going to be given a reprieve\u2026If she could make it to the bus then she could at least be miserable in privacy. There was a bottle of Jack Daniels just waiting for her to crack into\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait! Someone please! A-Ashley! Don-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gasping for air, you groped blindly in the darkness of her boot for a handhold only to latch on once more to her massive toes. Pushing against the terrifying digits, you hoped that you\u2019d be able to get far enough away to be safe before her foot came down on you aga-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM!.....CRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere went what was left of your right leg\u2019s shin. You nearly passed out from the pain alone before Ashely once again lifted her foot; the arch through the air threw you forward, sliding you back under her toes just in time to experience that single second of weightlessness\u2026then the footfall once more\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing broke this time, but that was probably because there was nothing really left to break in your right leg. Screaming in pain, you felt sick. If you couldn\u2019t get out of from under her foot in time, you were convinced you\u2019d die underneath Ashley Costello\u2019s foot without the giant Harley Quinn even knowing someone was trapped in the bat-winged boot. The rest of her panicked walk went much the same way. Her foot would lift and you\u2019d end up sliding down under her toes while trying your best to stay out from under them only to get caught on the way down and nearly crushed underneath her foot. Every time Ash\u2019s foot came down on you though, the giantess was aware that her foot was pulverizing something\u2026just she thought it was only a pebble: one she couldn\u2019t wait to get the hell out of her boot! Finally, the bus was in sight. Ashely ran nervously across the parking lot until she threw open the door and charged up the stairs. You thought it was a miracle you survived the damn walk as you continued clinging to Ashley\u2019s sock-clad toes. The boot finally began to shake violently; Ashley\u2019s fingers were assaulting the laces, desperate to take the shoe off and toss out the fucking rock that had been driving her crazy now. Pulling her heel out of the boot, she sighed and flexed her toes in their sock before looking into the boot. It looked like there was nothing but\u2026no\u2026 even turning it over nothing seemed to fall out. That left only one option as Ashley turned her gaze to her sock and her tired toes. What she saw made her drop the bat-winged creeper shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK?!\u201d Her voice thundered as her fingers slowly pinched either side of you and ripped you from the tip of her big toe. You felt a chill go down your spine\u2026under the gaze of her massive hazel eyes; you couldn\u2019t even manage a squeak even with the throbbing pain in your lame leg (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8oOuJjh4rFM/hqdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8oOuJjh4rFM/hqdef...</a>). \u201cHEY!

ARE YOU SOME KIND OF\u2026HOLY SHIT, YOU\u2019RE ONE OF THOSE FUCKING CREEPY STALKER\u2019S AREN\u2019T YOU?!\u201d Ashley accused, her eyes narrowing and turning your blood to ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait! No, Ms. Costello! I wasn-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHY WERE YOU IN MY BOOT?!\u201d She demanded, not interested in hearing anything other than the answers she demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please! My leg!\u201d you begged, motioning to your lame right leg\u2026What happened next was the single most painful experience of your life up to that point. Her powerful fingers pinched your leg, crunching what was left of your femur and sending shards of bone fragment into the muscle, cutting it apart in several places. Your ears began ringing as Ashley shook you back and forth by your destroyed leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTART TALKING OR ELSE I\u2019LL TEAR YOUR FUCKING LEG OFF!\u201d she growled, the air rumbling with her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Ah! F-Fuck! Please, my leg! Let go of my fucking leg!\u201d you yelled, trying your hardest to keep from throwing up or passing out while suspended in the air. In response, Ashley just pinched harder\u2026you passed out for a moment thanks to that one. Looking up, you were honestly surprised that your leg was still attached. Your ears were ringing loudly; even Ashley\u2019s interrogation was only a dull, muffled sound at this point. Another squeeze of her fingers brought you back into the moment though, riding in on a wave of excruciating pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTALK! OR DID YOU BECOME AS STUPID AS A BUG TOO? YOU MUST HAVE BEEN IF YOU THOUGHT I WOULDN\u2019T FEEL YOU FUCKING AROUND IN MY SHOE!\u201d Ashley hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No! That wasn\u2019t why!\u201d you cried out, terrified now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO? THEN YOU MUST JUST WANT TO BE WITH MY FEET, HUH YOU LITTLE PERV? FINE\u2026IF THAT\u2019S WHAT YOU WANT, I\u2019LL GIVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN HANDLE, BUG!\u201d Ashley growled as she reached down and grabbed something big and kinda\u2026furry? The pain haze finally began to clear as you realized what you were staring at\u2026Ashley Costello\u2019s massive slipper. Before you could even protest, you were suddenly whizzing through the air. You screamed as your broken leg slammed into the ground\u2026the momentum from getting tossed made you keep rolling until you finally came to a stop about halfway into the slipper. Outside, Ashley was slowly stripping off her other boot and socks. Flexing her bare toes, she looked down at the black and red polish, smiling brightly; the little bug was going to get crushed under her foot like it deserved (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Ashley-Costello-Feet-2075675.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Ashley-Costello...</a>). Slowly, she lowered her toes till they touched the heel edge of her slipper\u2026then began to insert them\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ground and air continued to shiver around her as the battered girl shakily rose to her feet, eyes trailing up the fallen figure before her. Shuttering, Julia\u2019s eyes slowly rose until they were staring up at a new fortress of blue, and then one of flesh. High above her was one of Julia\u2019s most praised idols\u2026 now the size of a mountain compared to her. Hayley\u2019s short blue hair was hanging disorderly around her face as glistening beads of sweat hung on them like raindrops clung to blades of grass after a big storm. A whole night on stage had left the lead singer drenched in pearls of perspiration as she stood in the wings, her face flushed (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/XezfDQL.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/XezfDQL.jpg</a>). Though what it was flushed from was another story all together, one Julia shuddered to ask. It was in fact, her fault that Hayley\u2019s microphone went dead in the middle of her set, making the singer have to quickly improvise as her show got a wrench thrown into it. The tiny woman shuddered, she felt sick down to the core of her stomach; and it wasn\u2019t just from being shrunken down to this size. Hayley had made sure to greet her before the show since it was Julia\u2019s birthday\u2026 and then she went and let her down during the show! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWHACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley\u2019s foot had shifted, slamming Julia with a black wall of rubber as the sole of her blue boot glided across the floor of the side-stage. The tiny technician was sent tumbling as Hayley continued staying against the wall (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hayley-williams-black-dress-outfit.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>). Lying still on the filthy stage floor, it was unclear if Julia had even survived the blind-side strike for a few minutes. A grumble from the crumpled body showed signs of life as the tiny woman began struggling to breathe normally once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGuh,\u201d Julia groaned as she slowly struggled to her feet. The wind had been knocked clear out of her by Hayley\u2019s foot, and her lungs still struggled to suck in the air they craved. Coughing, Julia swallowed hard as she looked back up at the tremendous woman towering over her. Guilt and fear wracked her whole body as Julia desperately began to look around for another person; for another way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley was all alone on stage at this point, her head heaped in her arms against the wall as she let the sound of silence buzz pleasantly in her ears. She was all alone\u2026 minus Julia of course. Hayley struggled to keep her face contorted in a kind of silent disappointment as her eyes continued following the tiny speck at her feet. The girl was pretty nice she remembered, and the microphone mess-up wasn\u2019t something particularly terrible. Errors happened, yet there was something that made Hayley mess with this girl at her feet. It was a kind of birthday gift to her, Hayley had convinced herself. This tiny girl was going to get closer to Hayley than any fan of hers ever had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm,\u201d Hayley moaned under her breath as she waited for the tiny thing to start moving again. She feared that she may have hit the tiny thing too hard; but her fears were erased as it once again began to move. Biting her lip, Hayley almost couldn\u2019t contain herself as she watched the tiny woman begin moving\u2026towards her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRNNNN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley gripped her hand tight around the tiny, metal, pen-like object in her hand. The thing she had used to shrink down Julia was nearly cutting into her skin as Hayley tried to control herself. She watched as the tiny speck of a woman disappeared for a moment under the treads of her foot. Carefully, Hayley held her foot still with near super-human effort until she saw the tiny speck surface once again; this time scaling the side of her blue boot. It was exhilarating seeing her down there, clinging to her foot like a mountain-climber! The blue-haired beauty couldn\u2019t control herself as she began making her way to the tour-bus. She hoped her tiny toy lasted till then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia screamed as Hayley\u2019s massive foot began to move. Her right hand was gripping onto a handle of stitching at the base of Hayley\u2019s boot when the giantess took her first step! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tiny woman was thankful that Hayley had stayed still until she got on; it was incredibly lucky, but now things were looking to be a bit more difficult. A burst of adrenaline was letting her hold on with only one hand for the moment, but that strength wasn\u2019t going to last forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley\u2019s foot crashed down as Julia was slammed into the blue wall of boot. Her free hand surged and grabbed onto another bundle of string. The grip was good as she clung tightly to the rubber wall as Hayley\u2019s foot once again began to lift. Her timing couldn\u2019t have been better as Julia started to feel the strength leave her body. Sliding her fingers into the loops of thread, Julia constructed a rudimentary support for herself as she began to feel the life drain from her body. Even the cool night air wasn\u2019t breathing any new energy into her as Hayley\u2019s tremendous feet continued to slam into the ground, shaking her down to the bones. It wasn\u2019t all for naught though as a welcoming sound rumbled through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBAM!...BOOM!...BOOM!....BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley was climbing the stairs to the tour bus as Julia almost felt like she was going to pass out, the stress of this trek finally over\u2026 or at least it was until Hayley spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHappy Birthday to you,\u201d Hayley whispered, her voice stabbing an icicle of fear into Julia\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ __________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley couldn\u2019t contain herself as she watched the tiny speck of a person fall off her boot. Bending down, she tried to get a better look at her, make sure she was alive and all. As her hair shrouded her face, Hayley imagined she must have looked like an ancient, mischievous goddess to the tiny thing at her feet (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.spin.com/sites/all/files/field/image/090813-paramore.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.spin.com/sites/all/files/fiel...</a>). The thought alone made her heart begin to race as she saw the tiny thing trembling. It was trying to mouth words at her, but being so tiny, its cries were silent to Hayley\u2019s ears. It was cute, Hayley thought as she let a smile curl across her lips. The tiny thing stopped for a moment and mimicked the smile, something Hayley also found to be cute\u2026 and somewhat sad given what was coming next. Slowly Hayley began to stand back up; straightening out as the tiny woman once again became nothing more than a speck to her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRawr!\u201d Hayley growled playfully as she raised her arms up to her chest and made claws with her hands. She slowly bent over and lifted her boot into the air as she growled again, looking like she was impersonating a strange blue dinosaur. Hayley smiled as she saw the speck begin to move away from her quickly\u2026 the game was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley stomped her boot-clad foot into the carpet just inches behind the speck. She watched as it bounced on the carpet, having been knocked down by the shockwave of Hayley\u2019 stomping. Slowly, Hayley raised her foot again as\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her arms were shaking as they pressed into the carpet, trying to muster what little strength was left in them as the tip of Hayley\u2019s boot loomed behind her menacingly. Looking over her shoulder, the tiny woman was shivering in fear as she looked up at the playful spark in Hayley\u2019s eyes, terrified of what the giantess would do next if she saw that the last stomp hadn\u2019t crushed her yet! With all her energy, Julia pushed herself up and began pathetically limping away from Hayley\u2019s foot. Her brain wasn\u2019t thinking straight as her body took over, making her go forward to escape the looming spectre of death that was staring down at her with a grin that threatened to stop Julia\u2019s heart from fear alone. The air around Julia shook as Hayley covered her mouth, stifling a giggle above. The blue-haired giantess closed her eyes for a second as she forced herself to look menacingly down at Julia. Slowly, Hayley lifted up her boot and let it hover in the air for a brief moment\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGrrrrrrrrr!\u201d Hayley growled as she stomped down next to the tiny girl and slowly began reaching to her, gnashing her teeth like a monster (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/Hayley-Williams-of-Paramore-female-lead-singers-28018497-1280-1024.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/Hayley...</a>). Julia froze as Hayley\u2019s hand crashed into the ground and soon surrounded her in a hot blanket of heavy flesh. It was choking her as she felt her body quickly become airborne! Julia\u2019s stomach churned as she suddenly felt the hand slowing down. Light pierced her eyes like daggers as she was suddenly released from the darkness\u2026right before Hayley\u2019s now unamused face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cH-help!\u201d Julia began to choke out, but stopped as she saw Hayley\u2019s face contort with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis isn\u2019t fun if you get caught that fast. You need to run faster next time\u2026or else I\u2019ll bake you into a cake or something. Oh! A birthday cake with you as the main ingredient might be good,\u201d Hayley said as she licked her full lips, slowly, sending shivered down the tiny woman\u2019s spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease! Please don\u2019t!\u201d Julia begged, tears now streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen, run faster next time. Hmmm\u2026.to make it fun\u2026.every time I catch you, this will happen,\u201d Hayley said as she pointed the pen at Julia and zapped her once again, watching as the woman became even smaller in the palm of her hand. The giantess giggled as she put the disheveled girl on the floor and rose back to her full height. As the, now smaller, speck froze on the floor, Hayley sighed and lifted a leg back\u2026then swung it forward at her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley giggled as she watched the tiny thing fly into her room. She figured that the girl must have been only about two inches high now as she slowly began to walk into her room after her. As she stood in the threshold, Hayley just smiled and looked around for the little speck. This time the girl must have decided to run faster as the blue-haired singer saw nothing. A smile spread across Hayley\u2019s lips, the game was finally getting fun.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\t\u201cHah\u2026hah\u2026.hah\u2026.hah\u2026.\u201d Julia was panting as she pressed her body against the rubber wall of one of Hayley\u2019s converse. Sneaking along the edge of the shoe, Julia peeked out to see Hayley standing ominously in the doorway. Julia\u2019s heart was beating in her ear like a bass drum as she waited for the giantess to make the next move\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRawr!\u201d Hayley growled as she stomped into the room and shook her head like she was imitating the main monster in a Japanese kaiju movie. Julia once again felt tears filling her eyes as she felt the ground rumble under her like an earthquake was taking place. As the tremors from Hayley\u2019s footsteps grew closer, Julia felt herself begin to hyperventilate. She felt her throat begin to close as the shadow of Hayley\u2019s tremendous body began to devour her. Soon, she was engulfed in the shadow cast by Hayley\u2019s torso\u2026then only her legs as the giantess began to draw closer. Pressing herself to Hayley\u2019s shoe as closely as she could, Julia closed her eyes and tried to block out the craziness that was going on all around her. She could feel the explosive shockwave of Hayley\u2019s steps as the giantess seemed to be slowing down. The thundering footfalls were the only things breaking the monotonous droning of Julia\u2019s terrified breathing\u2026then they went silent. Julia felt like she was going to asphyxiate as she kept her eyes pressed shut as tightly as she could\u2026she couldn\u2019t bear to look at what was before her. The anxiety was choking her as she began to feel lightheaded in the suffocating silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease just keep going\u2026please!\u201d Julia chanted, her eyes burning as tears forced their way out between her clamped eyelids\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s got you crying this time?\u201d Hayley said as her hot breath washed over Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulia\u2019s eyes popped open as she lost all strength in her legs and collapsed, looking straight into Hayley\u2019s smiling face as the pen-like object was pointed at her once again\u2026then a flash! As her eyes readjusted from the blast of light, Julia saw that Hayley was now twice as big as she had been before. The shoe she had been pressed against now cast her in its own massive shadow as it became a massive building over her. She shivered as Hayley stood up to her new, enormous height. Julia stared up at her blankly. Hayley was now as big a skyscraper to her as the giantess smiled down and slowly started lifting up her boot-clad foot once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTick-tock, better start running. Third strike and you\u2019re out!\u201d Hayley chirped as her foot began to lower slowly onto the sneaker Julia was now running away from at a full sprint (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users16/panicrebels/default/hayley--large-msg-117718061192.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users16/pa...</a>)....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFOOOOOOOOM!....GRRRRRNNNNNNNN\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulia screamed as she was slammed into by the shockwave of Hayley\u2019s falling foot which stomped down hard onto the vacant shoe in the end. Tumbling head over heels, Julia was almost knocked out as Hayley laughed at her from above. The tiny woman looked up to see that she was between Hayley\u2019s tower-like legs as the giantess waved down at her casually (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2rESnxYk7qE/U1QcRDq0WYI/AAAAAAAAAeY/6zYkYm34BLw/s640/blogger-image-1542025834.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2rESn...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m going to close my eyes and count to twenty, better start running birthday girl!\u201d Hayley said as she covered her eyes and took a deep breath\u2026then began counting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulia took off like an Olympic swimmer as she looked around desperately for somewhere to hide. She saw a mountain ahead of her, Hayley\u2019s discarded purse! Running towards it, Julia continued looking up at Hayley, checking to make sure the giantess wasn\u2019t cheating. She was. She could see Hayley\u2019s mischievous eyes tracking her between spread fingers as she counted agonizingly slow, dragging this game out for as long as she could. Julia didn\u2019t care, she just wanted to get away from Hayley as she got closer and closer to the purse\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe screamed as Hayley\u2019s now empty boot slammed down in front of her, discarded by the giantess who giggled and pointed the pen at her yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStrike three! Now it\u2019s time to have a lot more fun!\u201d Hayley said as her sock-clad foot slammed down next to Julia. The tiny woman now screamed as she could literally see between the threads that made up Hayley\u2019s sock. Each thread was now as thick as a grab-rail in the subway as Julia could see the slightly tan skin of Hayley\u2019s toes pressing against the woven wall. The massive movements of Hayley\u2019s toes as she flexed them menacingly scared the crap out of Julia, who turned and began running away again as fast as she could. She felt a surge of electricity go through her as Julia once again saw the world around her begin to grow\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley stepped over Julia, apparently taking a break as she headed for the kitchen. Looking down over her shoulder, Hayley winked down at the speck as she kicked a sneaker out of her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!....BOOM!....BOOM!....BOOM!....BOOM!........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Hayley thundered away, Julia looked around for a new place to hide\u2026only to see that she was in the middle of the floor. The only thing nearby where her discarded boots and the other converse that was now flipped over on its side after Hayley knocked it out of the way with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDoes Julia hide in?</span></div></div>",

Most of the writing was already wiped away from Hayley-only-knew-how-many months of abuse, but the half-worn out \u201c6\u201d in the sizes stood out eerily well preserved. Julia shivered as she realized her own shoes were a size \u201c10\u201d normally. Hayley was by no means a tall person normally\u2026but after all the zapping, even her small shoes were big enough to fit a city block into! Looking at the tremendous arching ceiling of the overturned shoe, Julia looking in awe at the tremendous imprint of Hayley\u2019s foot plastered along what felt like a mile of wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk, birthday girl, this was fun, but it\u2019s time to play a new game!\u201d Hayley said as she began walking back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulia quickly ran into the converse, pressing herself against the tongue of the shoe as she hoped she was now small enough for Hayley to not notice her. She felt the ground rumble now even rougher than ever as Hayley approached the shoes. The giantess smiled as she walked towards the overturned converse and settled her feet before it. She began to hum as she looked around, pretending to be looking. Sneaking glances back at the overturned shoe, Hayley began tapping her foot. Hayley hoped to knock the tiny girl out of hiding as each footfall must have been tremendous to someone that small (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lp0bpiZOax1qzhe6co1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lp0bpi...</a>). She smiled as after a few taps, the miniscule fleck of dust that was the tiny technician finally fell out of cover. Hayley giggled as she leaned down and reached for the girl. In a few minutes, she had reduced her from the size of a small doll to a small ant! Her fingers carefully wrapped around her as Hayley mused over where to put her while she got the last things ready for the next game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnjoy the break room,\u201d Hayley giggled as she dropped the super-tiny woman in\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were breathless as she appeared finally before you. Even dressed casually, Hayley Williams still managed to inspire a sense of awe in you when she appeared. Her concert that night had been amazing, but you had been waiting for this show all night long! As she strolled up to the couch, Hayley Williams towered over you; easily eclipsing the size of the stadium her show was held in tonight as she began to turn around slowly. Soon, you were cast in her gigantic shadow as the massive figure began to bend over\u2026 and lower itself onto you! Running, you were headed for the arm of the couch as Hayley\u2019s well-toned rear was hurtling down upon you like an apocalyptic meteor! This was not what you had planned for as you saw the shadow grow darker with each passing second. Looking up, you could see the two semi-spheres were about to impact! Leaping, you prayed to anyone who would listen as Hayley\u2019s butt made contact with the couch\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe couch began to slope down as Hayley\u2019s ass sank into the couch cushion! Scrapping your hands against the couch, you pried your fingers into the threaded floor, making a grapple point as the pull of the pit lessened. Looking down, you saw that if you hadn\u2019t grabbed on then, your plans for the night would have already ended under Hayley\u2019s ass! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley, on the other hand, flipped on the TV in her tour-bus for some back ground noise as she stretched. She was finally done with this leg of the tour and had a few hours to take a quick cat-nap before she needed to start preparing for the next concert. As the rumble of the bus shook her from her feet to her fore-head, the blue beauty lifted her legs and twisted around, her rear rubbing against the rough fabric of the couch cushions.  Pulling her legs to her chest, she shimmied backwards until her butt fell neatly into the crack between two cushions (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Hayley-Williams-Feet-177379.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Hayley-Williams...</a>). The 5\u20191\u201d artist knew she could fit snuggly on the couch like this a few weeks ago, and had enjoyed taking advantage of the couch ever since. Slowly, she began to stretch out, waiting for the feeling of her bare soles pressing into the arm of the couch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRNNNN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dove once more, this time avoiding the steam-engine of Hayley\u2019s heel instead of her ass. Even with your impressive dodge, you didn\u2019t make it far enough as you were caught mid-fall, by Hayley\u2019s heel! The powerful push launched you against the wall of the couch arm. You slumped against it for a moment and were about to fall once more when you were rammed into by Hayley\u2019s heel! Desperately, you pressed your hands into Hayley\u2019s heel, only finding that the skin was hard and semi-callused from walking and totally unyielding to your protests. It felt like you were being squeezed flat as Hayley\u2019s heel pressed harder, almost breaking your ribs! Cringing, you fought against the pressing mass of flesh when it suddenly retreated a bit. You started to fall down when you pushed off the wall and landed on the curve of Hayley\u2019s heel. Looking up at her towering sole, you could tell that the grooves and lines would be good enough to climb. Despite how this trip had started, the idea of climbing up the bottom of her foot was too tantalizing to resist. Your fingers clung to the grooves of Hayley\u2019s sole as you slowly began to make your way up it! It was a very comfortable climb for the most part; minus the smell. You had decided to climb her after a concert, so there was really no room to complain. The stale scent of sweat stung your nostrils as you finally reached the ball of her foot, Hayley\u2019s titanic toes looking down at you from above. As your fingers dug into her skin, you noticed her foot begin to sway. Suddenly, the toes above you scrunched down, making her skin bulge out as you were almost thrown clean off her foot. Incredibly, you managed to hang on as Hayley\u2019s toes relaxed once more, leaving you panting against her foot. Exhausted, you pulled yourself the rest of the way up, standing at the zenith of her foot; smack dab between her powerful toes. Not wanting to linger and risk being crushed, you took off running and leapt from between Hayley\u2019s toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sliding down the top of her foot like a kid at a carnival as you looked up at her dwindling toes. The chipped green polish made them seem almost like ancient castles in a fantasy story as they caught the florescent light of the bus. Looking ahead, you could see that the ground was going to quickly flatten as you neared her ankle! You were ready to walk\u2026but not for the speed bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were launched off of a miniature blemish in Hayley\u2019s skin as the giantess turned. Slamming into her ankle, you were sent spiraling across the tiny hill of bone. Landing flat out across Hayley\u2019s ankle, you groaned as you got up, looking to see the large tunnel of pant leg before you. The purple and black arch seemed to be calling to you. Stopping, you turned around and looked back up at the towering spire of her foot; her flaking green nail polish catching light as the giantess continued happily watching television. Slowly, you began your way under into the tunnel that lay before you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, as you crawled out from under the waistband of her pants (no need to recount the rest of that story yet), Hayley was already fast asleep. The flat plain of her stomach slowly rose and fell as the giantess enjoyed her sweet dreams (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs15/f/2007/038/4/6/stomach_II_by_NotSchockSchwere.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs15/f/2007/0...</a>). Tentatively, you began to take your first steps across the vast wasteland before you. Each step you took sunk in slightly, like you were walking across a vast trampoline. After a few uneasy steps, you got used to the sensation, and actually began almost skipping across her tremendous stomach. Each step then launched you forward like a circus performer! Despite your expedient progress, even after all the bouncing, you still only managed to make it to around Hayley\u2019s belly-button when the world began to shake under you. Looking up, you saw Hayley adjusting her bra in her sleep. You heaved a sigh of relief as you thought about how grateful you were that it wasn\u2019t you who had been noticed\u2026until Hayley\u2019s hand began soaring towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as you flailed in the air. Coming down, you saw where you were about to land, in the middle of Hayley\u2019s belly-button. Reaching out, you slammed into her skin as you struggled not to fall into the pit. You watched as her fingers arched over you, scratching at her stomach. Groaning, you began pulling yourself up out of the hole as her fingernail nearly took your head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze as you heard Hayley\u2019s stomach growl all around you. It occurred to you how easily you might manage to end up on the other side of this wall of flesh, being digested\u2026 the thought made you shudder as you pulled yourself the rest of the way up and began running, dodging her fingers as it scratched another path down her pale stomach\u2019s surface. Looking back at it, you marveled at how her once tiny, delicate hands were now big enough to encapsulate you effortlessly. You were marveling for so long that you got caught from behind by her thumb, sending her spiraling across the center of Hayley\u2019s stomach. Dizzy as hell, you tried to look around, only to get nauseas as you suddenly began to reel. Falling flat on your ass, you saw that her finger was coming back at you once again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying, you were sent spiraling again as Hayley continued to scratch her stomach, relieving the itches that you were causing as you ran across her stomach. This time you felt a little more beat up as you rested on the bottom of her rib cage. As you lay on Hayley\u2019s stomach, you could still hear the grumbling from below. You were suddenly terrified as you thought about the ocean of acid that must be stirring below you.  Looking up, you saw the two slight hills that were Hayley\u2019s breasts. Finally you were through the wilderness as you began heading towards them; like a dessert traveler finally nearing an oasis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the deck as Hayley\u2019s back cracked as she began to shift. Fearful, you gripped hold of her shirt fibers as Hayley suddenly began to flip over! As things began to move, you found that your grip was beginning to slip. Looking at your hands, you watched as the fistful of fibers quickly began to leave from your grasp. You saw in slow motion as you fell from between Hayley\u2019s breasts. You smacked into the soft hill of her left side as Hayley continued to flip. Landing hard on the couch, you looked up and saw her body coming down on top of you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprawled out against the bottom of her couch, you saw that her chest was now above you, hovering just a few inches above you. Staying under her was not worth it as you began doing a thing you never thought you would, heading away from Hayley\u2019s boobs. Surfacing, you looked up to see Hayley\u2019s neck hanging above you, a long tan lane of flesh floated above you, swallowing you in its shadow. Slowly, you emerged, looking up to see Hayley resting on her pillow (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://hollyrichmonddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/hayley-williams-pink-orange-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://hollyrichmonddotcom.files.wordpre...</a>). If you could climb up it, then you might have been able to get to her ear\u2026it was a bad plan, but it was a plan none the less. So, slowly you began making your way along the last stretch of couch. In the last hour, you had nearly been splattered on her sole, scratched to pieces, lost in her belly-button, crushed under her hand, and smashed under her breasts. The fact that you were almost done was fantastic, you felt like you were on top of the world as you continued to trek in the shadow of Hayley\u2019s stretching throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Hayley to see...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Instead, you saw something much worse\u2026 Hayley swallow in her sleep once more. You watched as her throat slowly seemed to slide up, heading for her suspended head. Then, you saw as the lump up top slowly began to move, like the start of an avalanche. A deep thumping sound echoed around you as the bulge began to slowly make its way down her throat, pulsing as her muscles guided the mass down. You saw as it wavered over you for a split second, like a hot air balloon had been hovering over you, before it was quickly pulled away. It quickly disappeared into Hayley\u2019s chest\u2026on its way to her stomach. It was a sobering reminder for you. It was the end of this trip, but also one of the most dangerous parts. You could easily end up being in there if you weren\u2019t careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer did you feel the need to take it slow as you began running with all your might to the base of Hayley\u2019s pillow. You shuddered as Hayley swallowed in her sleep a few more times, each strong \u201cTHUMP\u201d sound more disconcerting than the last (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://file033b.bebo.com/11/large/2007/05/20/13/2113769814a4432421119b86589576l.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://file033b.bebo.com/11/large/2007/0...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating from fear and physical exhaustion, you finally made it to the pillow. You took a second to catch your breath when you suddenly felt something wet splash on your back. Frozen for a second, you reached a hand around your back and touched the wet splotch to find it was sticky\u2026 like spit. Another dollop of saliva fell on you. Then another dollop fell after that. Looking up, you saw a veritable pool of saliva come crashing down on you, knocking you flat on your back. Hayley was drooling.

Looking up, you saw it was already too late to run as Hayley\u2019s teeth were coming together around you. Screaming, you hit the deck, diving into the puddle of saliva you had been trying to hide from. You shivered as you felt Hayley\u2019s front teeth grate gently above your back, pinching together around your shirt as her lips soon had you sandwiched between them! You\u2019d have continued screaming if you weren\u2019t still submerged in Hayley\u2019s spit as the giantess raised her head again, rolling back onto the couch as she licked her parched lips (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqnscbhMAf1qcbm5d.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqnscbhMA...</a>). As her serpentine tongue slithered underneath you, you feared that you\u2019d be sucked into her mouth as they slowly dragged your spit-soaked body along her sensual lips. As her crimson tongue snaked back into her mouth, you were left, nearly unconscious, in a dribble of spit that stretched from the corner of Hayley\u2019s mouth, to the couch below where her lips had snatched you up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmmm?\u201d Hayley groaned in her sleep as her she smacked her lips, apparently not pleased with your perch between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, you simply lay still against Hayley\u2019s tremendous lips. Even at your size, they were still soft like velvet and comfortably warm. It was like lying in a luxurious bed as you groaned from the unorthodox delivery method that had put you there. The rumble of Hayley\u2019s groan had shaken you to the core, but you paid it no mind. You figured she was just having a bad dream or something as you stayed still and collected your thoughts. As you did so though, Hayley was already moving to fix the \u201cproblem\u201d on her lips herself. Looking to your right as you pulled your face free from the pool of saliva you had been deposited in, you could see a wall of flesh slowly coming towards you. Your brain began firing, trying to figure out what it might be that was approaching as its shadow devoured you in a matter of seconds. Not even a sound of protest escaped your lips before Hayley\u2019s hand dragged you off of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly in free fall as Hayley\u2019s massive hand brushed you off effortlessly. Plummeting past the high walls of her cheeks, you could see as a tremendous ear was fast approaching. Terrified about what would happen if you should hit the couch down below, you found yourself trying to swim through the air to the forest of red hair that was all around you! Reaching out a hand, you grabbed hold of a solid strand and began zipping down it like you were a member of a SWAT team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clutched both hands around the strand as it began burning your skin as you slid! Gripping hard, despite the pain, you finally slowed down and were left hanging right above Hayley\u2019s left ear (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://31.media.tumblr.com/f415e2c2c93304fbd38ad6e556ea9d69/tumblr_n2i987og4q1qipanco1_500.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://31.media.tumblr.com/f415e2c2c9330...</a>). It felt like your hands were on fire as you, ironically, clung onto Hayley\u2019s fiery-red hair. Swinging weakly, you looked over at the tremendous ear before you and thought of trying to leap onto it. Looking down though at the impressive fall below should you miss, you decided against it. Looking up, you saw that to climb all the way up Hayley\u2019s hair would take forever, and you were unsure if your hands could take it. So, you were left with one option as far as you could see. Staring into the dark tunnel of Hayley\u2019s ear, you took in a deep breath and thought about what you were going to scream\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAYLEY! PLEASE HELP ME!\u201d you yelled as your throat began to grow sore from the sudden volume shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmmmmmmm\u2026.\u201d Hayley mumbled in her sleep as she slowly began to shift around, threatening to throw you off her now dancing hair! You grew despondent as you thought Hayley had once again ignored you\u2026 but you did manage to get a reaction from her\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sent skywards as Hayley\u2019s hand reached up and swatted the hair at her ears, thinking your screams were the annoying buzzing of a bug. As you rocketed through the air, you kept your grip on Hayley\u2019s hair. It turned out to be a good move as you began arching through the sky, headed once again for the face of your idol! Bracing yourself for impact, you curled up like a ball and closed your eyes tightly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling down a small hill, you opened your eyes to see that you had somehow been painted in multiple colors! Swaths of inky black and bright colors made you look like a Renaissance clown as you tried to figure out where you had landed. Looking up the colorful hill before you, the peak of it was dotted with thin, sparse black trees. As you took a step forward, your foot sank slightly into the ground. Something twitched under you as you saw the colorful layer come up on the bottom of your foot, revealing Hayley\u2019s pale skin below. Looking behind you, it finally clicked as to where you had landed. The long bridge of Hayley\u2019s nose rose behind you. Turning forward, you figured that you must have landed on Hayley\u2019s eye and picked up some of her make-up on your way down (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/hayley-williams-makeup-dark-lips.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>). The thin veil of eyelid below your feet might just be thin enough to get some reaction from you figured as you began climbing up the colorful slopes you had rolled down. As you made it half-way up, you balled your fists and began bringing them down as hard as you could onto the canvas below you. Smacking her eyelid with all your might, you prayed that Hayley would do something more than brush you away this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a different reaction this time just like you wanted\u2026.it just still wasn\u2019t any good for you. For a brief moment, Hayley opened her eyes and blinked a few times, trying to get rid of the irritant. She was very successful at it too as you were thrown back by her eyelids, rolling helplessly back onto the bridge of her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod Damn it!\u201d You shouted as you lay still on Hayley\u2019s nose, exhausted from the lack of success you\u2019d been having with this whole adventure!<br>\r\nPulling yourself up, you had just about had it with this whole escapade! You needed to get your thoughts together and make a new plan. As you continued walking up the slope of Hayley\u2019s nose, you thought of what you could do to get her attention, but not get knocked away! It was being this tiny that was really an issue for you. You silently contemplated new strategies as you sat down on the very tip of Hayley\u2019s nose. From here, you could look out on her expansive body and see if there was perhaps a place better suited to getting attention. As your eyes wanted around her (and admittedly stayed on her chest for far too long) you once again failed to notice something important going on around you. If you had even bothered to notice the small rises up and down you\u2019d started to experience on your seat, you might have been ready for it when Hayley finally scrunched up her nose (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5209/5379628996_4fcff88061_z.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5209/53796...</a>).

You braced yourself for impact, but not for the sudden hurricane that came out of nowhere. Like a ball thrown up in the air, you hung motionless for a split-second before falling down\u2026or rather up! Hayley inhaled deeply through her nose, the massive twin tunnels were like tremendous vacuums to you as the maelstrom suddenly sucked you into the darkness. Your screams were drowned out in the wind as Hayley\u2019s lungs pulled you up her nose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, no, noooooooooo!\u201d you screamed as you tried in vain to get out of the windstorm. One second, you were looking down the length of Hayley\u2019s body\u2026 the next you were in total darkness, flying through the unknown interior of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou had been slammed into a wall of mucus so hard it knocked you out on the spot. Ironically, the same impact that took you down, also woke Hayley up! The giantess sprung straight up as she tensed up and began huffing\u2026and puffing\u2026until (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users16/miserybusiness7/default/hayley-williams--large-msg-121427673066.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users16/mi...</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cACHOOOO!\u201d Hayley sneezed as she reflexively looked at the ground. She groaned as she rubber her now raw nose, traces of mucus clinging to her hand. \u201cGross!\u201d she whined as she wiped her hand on the couch and put her head in her hands. She checked the clock and saw that she had only gotten a few hours of sleep. Sniffling, she sighed as she lay back down for a few seconds and tried her best to go back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMeanwhile, down on the floor, you were coated in a layer of goo as you slowly began to come too. As you took your first breath, you realized your head was submerged as you began drowning on Hayley\u2019s snot. Panicked, you began thrashing around until finally your face was free of the mucus surrounding it. Coughing and gagging, you finally took your first real breath as you realized you were once again on the floor. Confused, you looked at the weird, sticky substance on you and tried your best to get out of it. You thought it would be easy to get out of like the saliva, but it was far too viscous as you found yourself struggling in vain to make any kind of progress. The greenish sheen and small lumps of junk in it tickled the back of your mind as you thought you recognized this crap for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBEEP\u2026BEEP\u2026BEEP\u2026BEEP\u2026BEEP\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUgh!\u201d Hayley groaned from above as she stretched and hit turned off her phone\u2019s alarm. You watched as she slowly began to turn forward on the couch. Her tremendous feet hit the floor one by one. Their bone-shaking force scared you stiff as you realized there was nothing you could do to get away if her foot ever did come for you! Scared stiff, you watched as she stood up and began walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!....BOOM!...BOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer foot landed just a few inches away from you, but it was enough to breath easy. You weren\u2019t going to be squished this time around. Focusing back on getting free, you found that the areas around you were starting to get stiff for some reason. Whatever you were stuck in was drying as Hayley began to lay out her choices of what to wear for the show tonight (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.envishoes.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hayley-williams-tuk-shoes-radical-large-msg-134801326564.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.envishoes.com/wp/wp-content/u...</a>). As the jungle of outfits surrounded you, Hayley\u2019s inquisitive stare from above felt as strange as you imagined it would feel to be in Jurassic Park for the first time. You were in a land of giants\u2026and not in a very good position at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe this?\u201d Hayley said as you got a private show of her changing into multiple outfits. It was magical, but every time she tried on an outfit, she walked around in it\u2026which brought you ever closer to getting stepped on by her tremendous bare feet! As she settled on a final outfit, she gathered up her remaining clothes and tossed them away in her room. Slowly, she walked past you once more\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was the closest her foot had landed yet! This time, you could stare up at the ridges on her big toe and see under her nail. Your whole body was cast in the shadow of her foot as Hayley stood and looked around the room for where she had tossed her flip-flops in the frenzy. You could see cracks forming as her powerful toe pressed down into the dry sections. Crumbling flakes fluttered off as Hayley thought hard about where she could have last left her footwear for the evening. For you, it was a deadly stare-off with Hayley\u2019s big toe as the giantess continued to shift ever so slightly. Ever tiny inch forward by her foot left her that much closer to making you a smear on her sole! By now the substance covering you had dried up to your legs\u2026it was like cement as you tried to crack it with no luck. Watching how easily Hayley\u2019s toe was chipping into it was discouraging as you fought against the material with no luck at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh! Found \u2018em!\u201d Hayley chirped from above as her battle-ship sized foot was suddenly over-head in an instant! It magically glided over you as Hayley made her way to the other side of the couch, where her flip-flops were left messily between the couch and wall. You heaved a sigh of relief, thinking that finally things would be over. Yet again, you didn\u2019t notice how things were falling apart around you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!....CRUNCH!....SPLAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne of Hayley\u2019s flip-flops had been dropped directly on top of you as the giantess slowly slid her foot into it. You were bent low by the initial impact, but as Hayley\u2019s foot slid in and settled on top of you, the weight easily crushed the hardened gunk you had been anchored in. All at once, the liquid prison you had almost escaped from surrounded you again! As Hayley\u2019s foot lifted, you watched as green strands broke free from the crushed, hardened mass like caramel being ripped apart (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UaLWp72nij4/S84EzOydgJI/AAAAAAAAH9Y/5g-gHuwUdXU/s1600/hayley-williams-feet-3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UaLWp72nij4/S8...</a>)! You tried to push yourself free, but it was like being glued to Hayley\u2019s shoe as she stepped down again. The crushing weight from above shoved you neatly into a tread as dirt from the floor quickly began sticking to the sticky coat covering you. As Hayley bounded out the door, you found your life had been turned into a rollercoaster as the arching steps of Hayley\u2019s foot made your stomach do loops! Each step also jabbed you with a new rock, or grain of sand, or twig fragment as the debris stuck to your mucus coating. You looked like a patch of earth by the time Hayley reached the signing booth. Strangely enough, the ridiculous amount of things stuck to you had dried out the coating enough that when Hayley finally sat down and drew her legs up under her\u2026the shock made it start to fall apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait, wait no!\u201d you shouted as you were freed from your prison without any knowledge of where you\u2019d been let off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrashing onto the hard chair, you looked up to see two perfectly round masses hanging over you\u2026.it was Hayley\u2019s ass (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/cHaR1Fp.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/cHaR1Fp.jpg</a>). Mesmerized as you were, when it began to come down you started panicking. Unsure of where to go, you ran the only way you had open to you\u2026towards Hayley\u2019s feet! The massive rear was almost upon you as you leapt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoaring through the air\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you were suddenly in free fall, you tried to point yourself towards Hayley\u2019s descending foot before you became a splatter mark on the ground. From your point of view, it looked like you were the heroine in an action movie as you came closer and closer to Hayley\u2019s tremendous heel. Despite the tremendous size of Hayley\u2019s foot, the jump off the seat wasn\u2019t any good to you if Hayley stretched her legs out! You were suddenly flailing in mid-air, almost as if you were trying to swim through it. Hayley\u2019s tremendous heel was slowly drifting away from your reach! It was a do-or-die moment as you pointed yourself like a diver straight towards Hayley\u2019s foot like you saw in movies\u2026.surprisingly it worked! Zipping through the air, you reached out a hand and just barely got your fingers into one of the countless tiny ridges of Hayley\u2019s heel. You dug your hand in quickly as the rest of your body suddenly swung up, slamming into Hayley\u2019s heel painfully. Now you were in a different predicament\u2026stuck under Hayley\u2019s descending heel. You found yourself pressed into, what had to be, the only rough part of Hayley\u2019s foot! Her skin was like stone as you thought about how it made sense your bad luck would get you stuck to her heel. Pushing down as hard as you could, you tried to get free and move to a less dangerous part of Hayley\u2019s slowly descending foot only to find that your shirt was already caught up on some rough skin. Pulling, you heard your shirt tearing as you now felt a rush of adrenaline surge through you. Your shirt finally tore free\u2026but not soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley smiled as she quickly slid her foot forwards in her flip flop, the rubber spire of the thong pressed snuggly between her toes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Hayley-Williams-Feet-880360.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Hayley-Williams...</a>). She could feel the soft foam depress under the weight of her body as she pushed her feet against the ground to slide her butt back into the chair. It was a hot, stick, sweaty day in Dallas; just the way Hayley liked it. Hayley sometimes got to the studio a little early to just chill out back like she was today. The back lot was a great place to get some privacy and sun in the crowded city. <br>\r\nPulling out her phone, Hayley began thumbing through her apps, totally unaware of the tiny girl caught under her heel. Slowly, Hayley slid her feet forwards, her heels digging into the foam of the flip-flops as the thong pressed down powerfully against her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGaaaah!\u201d you screamed as you tried desperately clawing into the foam of the flip-flop, trying to crawl away. The rough skin from before was now pressing down on your legs like someone had parked a steamroller on them. Thrashing about, you thought that for a moment you were going to be crushed. As Hayley\u2019s feet continued to slowly creep forward, her heel began rolling back onto you\u2026. The weight you thought you had endured before was child\u2019s play you realized as Hayley\u2019s heel now pressed down on your back with almost her full force coming down upon you! You would have screamed if not for the fact that any air you had in your lungs was being pressed out of you like toothpaste from the tube. Eyes watering, you clawed ferociously at the foam footwear, trying to dig your way out from under before the worst happened. The foam floor was the only thing saving you as Hayley\u2019s hard heel pressed you into the unwilling material, you felt like you were going to get crushed at any moment. Miraculously you weren\u2019t, but things weren\u2019t getting better for you as Hayley\u2019s heel finally rolled on top of your head. You could hear creaking as you thought your brain was going to suddenly pop under the force of Hayley\u2019s foot. A sharp pain suddenly surged against your face as you felt a warm liquid suddenly trickling against your face. As it hit your tongue, the taste of iron made it clear\u2026you were bleeding. Quickly, your nosebleed began to fill what little space you had managed to find to breathe in as Hayley parker her heel on your head. No plan was coming to mind; the only way of getting out of this alive would be a miracle\u2026. Meanwhile, high above, your one redeemable miracle came through for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBZZZZZZZZZZ!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHello?\u201d Hayley said as she righted herself, wiggling her butt in the chair as she pushed herself back up off of the balls of her feet. She smiled as she slowly drew her legs back towards the base of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou felt the tremendous weight of Hayley\u2019s heel peel off of you as her weight transferred to the front of her foot. Slowly, you staggered up. Thanks to the surge of adrenaline still going through you, it didn\u2019t take forever to get back on your feet. Desperately, you began thinking of where you should go, what way you should run. You could have hopped off the flip-flop, but being alone on the ground by her feet seemed like it would be even more dangerous. The choices all paralyzed you; and then Hayley made the decision for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here already, just chilling out,\u201d Hayley\u2019s voice boomed from above as the world began to shift suddenly. In an instant you went from being the girl who survived under a mountain, to a passenger on the Titanic as the massive flip-flop suddenly began to point skywards. You failed to get your footing as you suddenly began tumbling, head over heel down the length of Hayley\u2019s flip-flop. Screaming, you tried to stop falling, your arms trying to get a hold of the foam slab you were spiraling down. It was futile though, you could catch her foot while falling, but you were going down the flat flip-flop way too quickly to even find a foothold; much less come to a complete stop\u2026 on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, you arched your back in pain as you slammed right into the bony ball of Hayley\u2019s foot. You screamed silently on empty lungs as the wind was knocked clean out of you, not that you had much left between almost being flattened under her heel and screaming down the slope of her flip-flop. Trying to get up, you slipped on the worn surface of her shoe, your leg disappearing\u2026right under the ball of Hayley\u2019s foot. It was like your leg had slipped down between seat cushions on a couch as you began trying to pull it loose, terrified of what would happen if you couldn\u2019t get it out. A few tugs and you found that it was actually your shoe that was caught here! Quickly, you tried digging your hands down between the flip-flop and her foot, searching desperately for your shoelaces. Your right hand found it and began fumbling with the fabric strands. Grabbing onto one, you pulled\u2026then cursed. The whole sky of Hayley\u2019s foot was starting to come back down on you, and here you were, pulling the lace incorrectly so your shoe got knotted up! Cursing like a sailor, you began yanking your foot out even harder as you felt the pressure begin come down from Hayley\u2019s foot. You pressed your other foot against Hayley\u2019s and pulled with all your might as\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Never before had you been so happy to lose a shoe as you saw your own socked foot; your sock might as well have been made of gold! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRRRRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you turned to run as you saw Hayley\u2019s foot slowly rolling back towards you! Flipping over, you got ready to sprint when suddenly the floor dropped out from under you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain you had the wind knocked out of you as your stomach was all butterflies from the fall. Rolling onto your back, you looked up to see slivers of sunlight streaming down between the mountainous, stretched toes of Hayley. Squinting, you saw she had slipped the flip-flops off for a second, the ball of her foot now resting on the arch of her sandal thong. As the tremendous toes flexed slightly above you, a small speck could be seen coming down towards you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFuck!\u201d you yelled grabbing your head in pain. Looking to the floor, you couldn\u2019t even believe your eyes\u2026your shoe had been returned to you. In sheer disbelief, you picked it up and looked back at the lofty sole floating almost like a cloud over your head. It was hard to even wrap your head around the fact that the shoe that just hit you in the face had disappeared underneath a tidal wave of Hayley\u2019s flesh just a second ago\u2026. This was crazy, you thought to yourself. It was about to get worse again. Slowly, you saw as Hayley\u2019s foot began retreating again; her titanic toes came together, pointed down ready to return to your level once again. Looking forward, you saw the base of the thong rising up like a thick tree. Running as fast as you could with only one shoe on, you made for the plastic pillar. The whole flip-flop shook as Hayley\u2019s big toe hit the arch of the flip-flop strap. You fell flat on your face and tumbled for a few feet before you finally came to stop\u2026right at the base of the thong. Pushing yourself up, you felt like your limbs were made of lead as you tried to get moving again; but your time was out. Hayley\u2019s foot hit into you like a train as you were slammed, first right between her toes, then directly into the thong of the flip-flop. It felt like you were once again going to be crushed as Hayley lifted her foot up, catching the thong between her outstretched toes as she let it try to settle comfortably between them once more (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UaLWp72nij4/S84EzOydgJI/AAAAAAAAH9Y/5g-gHuwUdXU/s1600/hayley-williams-feet-3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UaLWp72nij4/S...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, no, no; I\u2019m good,\u201d Hayley\u2019s voice echoed above like distant thunder as you felt your face getting pressed into the thong like how little kids pressed their faces against windows to make funny faces. Trying to breathe was impossible as you felt like you\u2019d been encased in cement. Actually, it was more like a boa constrictor as the squeezing got tighter and tighter every time you exhaled even the slightest bit. You waited for Hayley to put her foot down, to give you some slack\u2026but that wasn\u2019t in the cards for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHelp!\u201d you called out, almost reflexively as Hayley began to cross her legs. As her foot rose into the air, the thong of Hayley\u2019s flip-flop pressed down against you even more! Grunting, you tried to move only to find the plastic pillar pressing you into Hayley\u2019s flesh. This time, the softness of Hayley\u2019s skin was your undoing as you sank into it, struggling to get out like you\u2019d been caught in a suspended net. You were amazed how her skin could be so smooth and soft here after being nearly crushed under her unyielding heel! Crying out, you tried to push away the plastic pillar that was crushing against you; all you managed to do though was to sink further between Hayley\u2019s tremendous toes. As you struggled to keep Hayley\u2019s flip-flop from flattening you, the giantess unknowingly turned up the difficulty as she started shaking her leg. Quickly, the already difficult to deal with plastic pillar began to seesaw on top of you as the massive flip-flop you\u2019d been living on lately started to rock back and forth! Now, it had evolved into a herculean task to protect your already damaged face from the massive tower of the flip-flop thong that was rolling over your face mercilessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the swaying stopped as the walls came together, closing in from both sides as Hayley squeezed her toes together around the tilting thong! You imagined it must have felt like this when they crushed old cars into those neat little cubes as the once soft walls of flesh were now crushing you against the solid plastic thong. \tYou could hear a high-pitched buzzing in your hears as your body struggled to adjust to the tremendous change in pressure it was suddenly submitted to. As your body was nearly crushed between the massive toes, you thought for a moment that your luck had finally run out\u2026then they released!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGuh!\u201d you croaked as you fell onto your back and turned to your side instantly as you felt a wave a nausea surge in you. The constant pressure changes were killing your stomach as you failed to fight the urge to vomit. Turning over, you felt your body convulse as the contents of your stomach were unwillingly brought back up. Wiping your mouth and head, you noticed something\u2026your arm was unusually wet. Looking up slowly, you understood why almost instantly\u2026the hot Texan sun was beaming down from above. While you had been mostly in the shade of Hayley\u2019s foot, the singer herself had been soaking up the rays; now she was starting to sweat! As soon as you noticed the droplets forming on the slope of Hayley\u2019s foot above you, your gaze shot down to where you were crawling. Looking even at your own clothing, you could see it darkened with the salty, stale-smelling liquid that was slowly creating a bright sheen here between Hayley\u2019s toes. It looked like you had fallen into wet grass as you lifted your hands before your own eyes to see them shimmering with the giant woman\u2019s sweat. You didn\u2019t know what to do suddenly as you looked up from between the rising walls of flesh, up the unfathomably long length of Hayley\u2019s legs, all the way up to her tremendous knees. You couldn\u2019t even see her face as it dawned on you just how tiny you\u2019d really become here. Now, sitting in Hayley\u2019s rising sweat, you felt even sicker than when you vomited. Sitting still wasn\u2019t an option anymore. Rising instinctively, you began climbing up the slick slope between Hayley\u2019s toes like your life depended on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSWIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHeroic as your surge to action was, you were still powerless compared to the minute motions of Hayley\u2019s tremendous foot. As her toes drooped and relaxed, the whole path you had been climbing suddenly changed under your feet. In a second, your balance was thrown off as you quickly began sliding down Hayley\u2019s slick skin! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShit!\u201d you screamed as you slid down the slope of Hayley\u2019s toes\u2026headed right for the thong of her flip-flop! You tried to slow yourself down, but your sweat covered hands were practically frictionless as Hayley shifted her toes ever so slightly. As her toes rose, you felt your body begin to press into her skin like you were riding a sled down her foot! When they suddenly dropped again, you found yourself airborne\u2026 for a brief moment anyways.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as you....</span></div></div>",

Struggling like mad between them, you thought foolishly for a moment that as you sunk a little bit that you were making progress towards an escape. Then, suddenly, you sank a little more\u2026then a little more. Now you were panicking as you realized that as Hayley\u2019s toes relaxed their grip on you, your sweat-soaked body was now starting to slide down between the thong and toes. All lubed up, there was now not even a fraction of friction to keep you from taking the plunge between Hayley\u2019s toes and back under her foot! Remembering your near death experience underneath Hayley\u2019s heel, you were now frantically feeling for somewhere to grab onto; some way to keep your head above her toes\u2026 but there was none. Even as your fingers shoved themselves into ridges and grooves, the light coating of sweat on everything made it impossible to keep a grip strong enough to support your body. Soon, your hands were struggling to hold onto the last fold and wrinkles between Hayley\u2019s toes; your legs were already dangling in the dead space between Hayley\u2019s foot and the foam floor of the flip-flop! It figured that just as you were finally wishing for Hayley\u2019s toes to squeeze against you, she spread them to catch a cool breeze between them\u2026down you went!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tScreaming, you slid down the thong of Hayley\u2019s flip-flop like a fireman as you crashed into the foam floor. Again, the little friction on the way down meant you hit the bottom way faster than intended. Shocked, you let go of the thong for just a split second; it was a fatal mistake! Now you were sliding down Hayley\u2019s flip-flop towards her heel as the flat footwear now hung the opposite way as before. Screaming for mercy, you were begging for anything to keep you from ending up under Hayley\u2019s heel once again\u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSLAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDazed, confused, and now with a splitting headache, you could only look on in confusion as you found yourself looking at the flip-flop from a very different perspective\u2026a near bird\u2019s eyes view. Turning your head as best as you could, you realized what had happened! Hayley must have-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSLAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe thought was almost smacked out of your head as Hayley did it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSLAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley was now literally beating the crap out of you. While you wouldn\u2019t be going to her heel again like you wanted, your new situation wasn\u2019t exactly a step up. Thanks to Hayley flexing her toes, her flip-flop was now slapping her sole\u2026where you were now stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSLAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk, bye!\u201d Hayley chirped above as she hung up. Stretching, Hayley relaxed and slid down as she let her feet catch hold of the bottom rung of her chair (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Hayley-Williams-Feet-307567.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Hayley-Williams...</a>). Looking through her phone for a few more seconds, the giantess was still blissfully unaware of the fan underfoot. Shifting her butt around in the chair, Hayley swiped through her last few messages and checked the clock on her phone. Still way too early to go in! Looking up at the sun, she frowned\u2026clouds were still blocking it today.<br>\r\nIt was turning out to be a more boring rest that she thought as she reached for her bag, shifting through it to see if she brought what she needed. Yanking out a pair of headphones, the giantess smiled again; a little music would pass the time at least! Plugging in the headphones, she stuffed them into her ears and started shuffling through her song library\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe last thing you heard was the rush of wind around you as the pocket of air between Hayley\u2019s sole and her flip-flop was pushed out like a billow! You had seen the dirty sole of Hayley\u2019s flip-flop racing at you like a collapsing ceiling. One brief moment of pressure and pain as Hayley\u2019s foot slammed you into the soft foam floor\u2026 and now you were encapsulated in a tomb of flesh. As Hayley\u2019s foot pressed down onto the metal bar of the chair, you felt like you were going to be flattened at any moment. The only thing you could feel was the crushing force of Hayley\u2019s foot and the heat pouring off of it. The thick walls of flesh blocked out all sound and light as the pain coursing through you blocked out all other senses. Your body was desperately trying to find a way to live, but it was useless. As Hayley\u2019s weight settled down onto you, what little air left in your lungs was slowly getting pressed out of you! Chest burning, you struggled to take in a deep breath, only to find your jaw pressed shut as it was wedged between Hayley\u2019s soft flesh above, and the firm foam of her flip-flop below. Sniffing in tiny breathes, you were only prolonging the inevitable as your limited supply of air started to run low. Suffocating under Hayley\u2019s foot, you could only hear the sound of your own heart beating in your ears and the rushing of blood through the tiny capillaries in Hayley\u2019s foot as you started to get sleepy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou didn\u2019t know what was happening, but the flesh tomb suddenly lifted for moment as you rose slightly along with Hayley\u2019s sole. Coughing, you tried to gulp down air, tainted as it was with the smell of Hayley\u2019s foot! Gulping it down, you tried to think of something you could do to get off of Hayley\u2019s foot-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMmmmmmph!\u201d you screamed as your face was pressed into the foam floor of the massive flip-flop again. The weight of Hayley\u2019s foot was once again upon you as the whole process from before began anew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWHOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGah!\u201d you screamed as the front of Hayley\u2019s lifted up, stretching you painfully as your body was slowly peeled from the floor of Hayley\u2019s flip-flop. You felt like you were on a rack as you stared up the hill of foam and flesh to the beams of light that were slowly filtering in between the titanic toes of Hayley\u2019s foot. Hayley\u2019s flesh created a pale ceiling, as the cavern of foot and flip-flop echoed with the sounds of traffic in the distance. The brief moment of stillness alarmed you as your beaten body was powerless against Hayley\u2019s foot. You looked bleary-eyed into the blinding glare of sun as suddenly you saw her toes relax\u2026and the whole cave collapse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou once again had your face pressed into the foam floor of Hayley\u2019s flip-flop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNgh!\u201d you groaned as Hayley\u2019s foot rose once again, stretching you out\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGhhhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHelp m-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHigh above Hayley was leaning back in her chair, face up to the sun. A broad smile painted her face as she gently tapped her foot to the beat blasting in her ears. Each fierce strike of the drums in her ear signaled another fall of her powerful foot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lp0bpiZOax1qzhe6co1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lp0bpi...</a>).

Struggling wasn\u2019t even an option for you as the warm walls of soft skin slowly engulfed you, like you were falling into a pile of blankets. Or at least, it might have felt like that is not for the tremendous weight that was slowly smothering you in your flesh prison. Pressed tightly against Hayley\u2019s sole, you thought you were going to suffocate here like this as your lungs began to burn like a bonfire had been lit in each one. You could feel individual veins in your body light on fire as the painful process of suffocation below Hayley\u2019s notice was taking its toll on you. All the while, Hayley was still listening to her music, until a stroke of luck occurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRRRRRR!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA text message came in on her phone, interrupting the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmmmm,\u201d Hayley sighed as she slid her flip-flop clad feet off of the chair rung, stretching them out before her. As she did do, her skin pulled taunt across her sole. After being stuck there for what seemed like an eternity, you were finally free from Hayley\u2019s sole. And now you were in free-fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAaaaaaaaah!\u201d you screamed as you raced past the towering length of Hayley\u2019s sole and flip-flop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce again, Hayley slapped her flip-flops against her foot as she fidgeted in her chair. Once again, you had been slammed right into Hayley\u2019s foot by a massive wall of foam. Once again, you were now slammed into Hayley\u2019s heel. And once again, Hayley was placing her feet back down on the ground as she stretched up towards the aky (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th01.deviantart.net/fs13/300W/i/2007/111/e/3/Hayley_Williams_9__by_vampirefreak101.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://th01.deviantart.net/fs13/300W/i/2...</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGaaah!\u201d you screamed as Hayley\u2019s heel came down and crushed your right leg in and instant. The soft skin of Hayley\u2019s sole was no longer there to cushion you as the crushing weight of Hayley\u2019s body now came down on you in full force. Seething in pain, you tried to claw your way forwards, only to almost black out from their pain with every move you made. Once again, the crushing sensation of a tomb fell over you as Hayley\u2019s heel pressed your face directly into her flip-flop. You tried to move, but the unyielding force of Hayley\u2019s foot had you locked in place more securely now than ever. Every fiber of your being was kicking into overdrive, trying to desperately find a way to survive in this hellish environment\u2026and having no luck at that! As Hayley\u2019s weight settled down onto you, what little air left in your lungs was slowly getting pressed out of you!  Your chest burned as you struggled to take in a deep breath, only to find your jaw pressed shut as it was wedged between Hayley\u2019s hard heel above, and the firm foam of her flip-flop below. You found yourself again trying to breathe through your nose to save what limited supply of air you had. A partially crushed nose though was making this impossible as pooling blood closed off the only paths of air you had been using. Suffocating under Hayley\u2019s foot, you could only hear the sound of your own heart beating in your ears and the rushing of blood through the tiny capillaries in Hayley\u2019s foot as you started to get sleepy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTime to go in I guess,\u201d Hayley said as she shifted, lifting her feet for a second as she arched her back against the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou fell limply to the asphalt as Hayley\u2019s heel came off of you. Looking up, your battered body wasn\u2019t even in shape to scream out in terror as the tremendous sole of Hayley\u2019s flip-flop came back down upon you once more (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Hayley-Williams-Feet-93959.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Hayley-Williams...</a>).

Lifting her foot, she stuck out her tongue in disgust as she wiped her flip-flop clad foot against the ground, trying to get off whatever mess she had seen on the bottom of her foot.

A cold shiver ran down your spine as you imagined what it might be like to get pulled into there. Every so often, you noticed her nostrils flare as a stream of air passed into them, blowing tiny waves on your pool of saliva below. Swimming in the viscous substance was next to impossible you were quickly realizing as you tried to swim for Hayley\u2019s upper lip. Being suspended in limbo above both of them wasn\u2019t comforting as you considered what could go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmmmmm,\u201d moaned as she shifted in her sleep, her body snaking against the couch as her dreams seemed to be getting more turbulent (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://gingerparrot.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Paramore-Hayley-Williams-Ginger-Hair-Dye-Colour.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://gingerparrot.co.uk/wp/wp-content/...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking down, your heart almost stopped as you saw something big and red rising in your ocean of saliva.

The powerful updraft kicked you back up into the air as the giantess stretched in her sleep\u2026then the inhale gripped you like a vice as you were sucked into the dark moist cavern you feared most. Hayley\u2019s breath wrapped around you like a tornado as your ears began ringing; you were nearly deafened in the din as her tongue slowly settled back onto the floor of her mouth. Now you were left in a dangerous position as you clung onto the tip of Hayley\u2019s tongue like a word she could barely remember. Light shined down on you as Hayley slept with her mouth hanging open this time, air rushing over you like you were on the coast as you looked down nervously at the dark pit below. You swallowed hard, hoping that Hayley wouldn\u2019t do the same. Looking up, you saw that strands of Hayley\u2019s crimson hair were falling into her mouth, if you could reach one\u2026you just might be able to climb up to safety (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/105/2/7/02__hayley_williams_by_lovatoedittions-d3e1b8q.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/1...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRMMMMMMBLMMMMMM\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou broke out in a cold sweat as you looked down to the blackness of Hayley\u2019s throat once again\u2026the origin of the ungodly sound that had just filled the air around you. The almost minty air form before was now tainted with scents of meals past as your own stomach now churned nervously. Reaching up, you dug your hand into Hayley\u2019s tongue and pulled yourself up. Hoping to grab hold of the lone strand of scarlet hair that was hanging down directly above you, you began to stretch up towards it. You were fully extended, only the tips of your toes and the few fingers of your left hand were making contact with Hayley\u2019s tongue as the rest of you rose up to grab the singular life-line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes!\u201d you screamed as your hand grabbed hold of it.

It felt like trying to escape a pit of glue as the thick spit clung to you, but you were making it as you heard Hayley\u2019s tongue grate against her lips above, smacking them tiredly as the scarlet serpent dispensed some much needed moisture on them. The titanic head dipped to the side as Hayley\u2019s scarlet hair began falling down her forehead, creating an upside-down curtain of red before you as you finally took your last, struggling steps out of the pool of saliva. Up the pillow hill, you could see strands of hair thicker than rope dangling and sprawled out on the ground like it was the dock of a shipping yard. Looking up, you saw Hayley\u2019s eyes slowly fluttering awake as the dream came to an end (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://data1.whicdn.com/images/2782324/thumb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://data1.whicdn.com/images/2782324/t...</a>). It sounded like there was a typhoon behind you as Hayley\u2019s exhaled, the small pool of saliva you had bene stuck in shook like a tidal surge as you suddenly felt very grateful for being out of there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFive more minutes,\u201d Hayley exhaled, exhausted as she closed her eyes and snuggled into the pillow a little more, almost knocking you back down! Grabbing hold of one of the scarlet strands of hair though, you were saved from having to make the trek again as the giantess slowly fell back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDangling by a hair, you looked up and felt hopeful for the first time in a while as you saw your life-line lead right to Hayley\u2019s ear (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://data1.whicdn.com/images/5352837/thumb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://data1.whicdn.com/images/5352837/t...</a>). Tired as you were, this was the closest you had come all day to having a real plan of getting found since things went south! Grunting, you pulled yourself up and began collecting the hair in your hand like you were rock climbing as you scaled the pillow\u2026next stop, Hayley\u2019s ear! The thundercloud tattoo above you looked down ominously as, after a few tiresome minutes of travel, you finally made it to the base of Hayley\u2019s neck. Looking up at the pale wall of skin with red strands of hair dangling around, you felt like you were in a fantasy forest. Swallowed your fear, you placed a foot into the soft skin of Hayley\u2019s neck and began pulling yourself up, ready for the long climb ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmmmmm\u2026.\u201d Hayley groaned as she stirred, sending you flying as you held onto her dizzily-dancing hair! Reaching over, she turned off the alarm on her phone and got up. As she rose, you were nearly thrown off the hair, now dangling by one hand as the giantess got up and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRRRRRRRRRRRNNNMBLLLMMMM\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe deafening growl of Hayley\u2019s stomach even reached you as the singer\u2019s hand rubbed her belly. Quickly, Hayley began moving towards the kitchen, each thunderous footfall seeming like it was going to knock you off your life-line! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere did it all go?\u201d Hayley said under her breath as she began walking around the kitchen. Opening up cabinet after cabinet, Hayley finally stopped and smiled as she found what her stomach had been craving; cereal. Grabbing a bowl and some new milk from the fridge, Hayley brought her supplies back in front of the TV and began tossing it all together. Shaking the cereal in, Hayley licked her lips, her stomach offering another low growl of approval as you looked down in terror. Thanks to her leaning, you were now directly over a hard bowl of food for an unaware giantess. Watching, you saw the canyon suddenly become a lake as Hayley generously poured in milk, the mountain of cereal now forming tiny island communities. Slowly, Hayley dipped her spoon into the lake and pulled several islands out into the smaller sphere of her utensil. It was like watching a whole world be sculpted as cereal islands were suddenly pulled free form the ocean into the air. You watched, transfixed as the tiny sea of milk splashed overt the sides of the spoon and all over the cereal, battering it in white waves.  As the island finally passed by you, your vision turned up to see the massive dark tunnel of Hayley\u2019s mouth open. The spoon soon disappeared inside as her soft lips closed, only to reappear a few seconds later\u2026.empty (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.iknowtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/maxresdefault-660x330.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.iknowtoday.com/wp-content/upl...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou tried to cover your ears as the deafening sound of Hayley\u2019s chewing bombarded you. It was a fatal mistake though, as you tried to cover your ears, you lost your full grip on Hayley\u2019s strand of hair\u2026and fell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGroaning, you felt cold as you looked around and saw the worst had occurred. You had fallen into Hayley\u2019s descending spoon! Trying to get up, you realized that NOW the worst had occurred! The cold, wet, smooth metal surface of the spoon had you stuck like you had licked a lamp-post in winter\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLASH!...WHOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMilk flooded into your concave canyon as Hayley dipped it into the cereal bowl once again! The flood submerged you in an instant, and the hard pieces of cereal that poured in were nearly crushing you as you felt the spoon begin to rise. It all happened to so quickly, but to you it felt like to took forever. The milk had unstuck you from the floor of the spoon, and after wriggling out from the cereal, you surfaced just in time to stare down the back of Hayley\u2019s throat\u2026the spoon already in her closing mouth (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s129.photobucket.com/user/LikexBOOM/media/Hayley%20Williams/IMG_9635.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://s129.photobucket.com/user/LikexBO...</a>). You were speechless as Hayley emptied the spoon out into her mouth, dropping you onto her moist tongue. Looking back, you were suddenly in total darkness as her lips closed\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH!....GULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley continued eating, unaware of the tiny person dissolving in her stomach as she flipped through a few more channels. As she finished up the cereal and put the bowl on a side table, Hayley felt a wave of exhaustion roll over her again. Stretching, she yawned and leaned back as\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lifting up the cup, Hayley turned it over and dropped out four helpless, shivering, terrified, and most importantly tiny people onto the table. It was a rag-tag group that was now sprawled on her table. She had nabbed them last night after the concert, three fans and a stagehand. While tiny to her, Hayley had made sure not to make things too boring. The youngest in the group, a girl about 17 or 18 was the tallest at two-inches high. Meanwhile the oldest, a 30-something year old lights manager was just half an inch tall, coming up to the girl\u2019s shins. The other two were in the early 20\u2019s and about an inch or less each. She remembered the excited look on the girl\u2019s face, the devious look on the young-men, and the annoyed scowl on the stagehand\u2019s face right before each one was shrunken by her newest purchase. Giggling, Hayley placed down the cup as she got up quickly from the table and closed the door to the kitchen. It would be a real pain in the ass if someone interrupted her lunch before she had all her fun. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nDING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOoooh, ladies and gentlemen, it looks like our first round is about to start!\u201d Hayley said as she went over to the oven and pulled on her oven-mitts. Pulling open the door, Hayley was blasted by a hot wave of wind as a big smile spread across her face. Taking a deep whiff, she began humming the Jeopardy theme-song aloud as she pulled out the searing hot tray and making sly glances back to the table where she knew her players were eagerly warming up for the games. Hayley paused as she looked at the set of chicken-fingers she had just heated up, thinking of what would be good to use for the first event. Going to the fridge, Hayley continued humming game-show themes as she pulled out some condiments for her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley laughed as she let the bottles of ketchup and other toppings slam into the table along with the plate of chicken, steam rising off of it. Looking around the table, Hayley licked her lips. Hide and seek was always a good way to wake up her appetite, especially when the game was in her favor like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cContestant number one! How good of you to volunteer!\u201d Hayley chirped as she pulled one of the young men out from behind the salt shaker. The little thing struggled in her hand as Hayley hoisted him up in the air by his leg. Looking at her from upside-down, the guy was terrified as Hayley looked at him with hungry eyes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://data1.whicdn.com/images/10378138/thumb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://data1.whicdn.com/images/10378138/...</a>). \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked, licking her lips as she sat down and hovered the tiny man over her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease! Please, let me go!\u201d he yelled, too terrified of Hayley\u2019s presence to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe like to see that kind of enthusiasm, don\u2019t we folks?!\u201d Hayley said in her best announcer voice as she did what she was asked\u2026released the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGaaaaah! Help! Help! It\u2019s fucking burning!\u201d the man yelled as he landed on the searing chicken finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere goes his first life-line, and on the first challenge too! This not a good start folks,\u201d Hayley said as she grabbed the ketchup bottle and popped the top, squirting a cool blast of the thick red sauce all over the tiny man, nearly drowning him in the torrent. The tiny man sighed as he rose up in the nearly freezing liquid, happy to be off and out of the fiery surface of the chicken finger. Looking up at Hayley, he wondered what the hell she was doing\u2026right until her fingers grasped hold of his footing and began lifting it into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhoa! Hey, what the hell are you doing?!\u201d the first young man asked as Hayley lifted the chicken finger to her mouth and began to slowly open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh oh. Looks like our contestant is stuck on this problem. Hope he figures out something soon or else he\u2019ll be eliminated right off the bat,\u201d Hayley said as she took half the chicken finger into her mouth and chomped down (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=6957669\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.o...</a>)\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCLACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs her teeth smacked together, a chill went down the young man\u2019s spine. Instantly, he began fighting through the thick liquid to try and move away from Hayley\u2019s now enthusiastically working jaw. He could hear the crunching behind him as her teeth ground the massive hunk of chicken into a thick paste\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTimeout! I need a timeout here!\u201d the man yelled as Hayley\u2019s red tongue slid across her lips, slurping up the crumbs that clung to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAfraid you have used up all your life-lines for this round. Too bad,\u201d Hayley said as she then impersonated a stock \u2018awwww\u2019 noise before opening her mouth again. She didn\u2019t even give the little guy a chance as she stuffed the finger into her mouth and closed her lips behind him. Down below, everyone watched in horror as Hayley then slowly began to chew, laughing as it looked like her tongue was busy playing around with the little man inside like a tasty morsel. Their blood turned to ice as Hayley smiled and slowly began to lift up her head\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAwwww, looks like contestant number one has lost, let\u2019s see how contestant number two like our next challenge after this commercial break,\u201d Hayley said, hamming it up as she licked her lips and began chowing down on the rest of the chicken fingers. Her eyes darted around the table, looking for her next victim when they caught sight of the other young man looking up at her petrified from behind the cup they had been stored in. The young man hadn\u2019t noticed Hayley had spotted him yet, and she was sure to make good use of that. Looking around the table, Hayley giggled as she spotted the cookies they had received from a fan set up right behind him. Reaching slowly for them to make sure the little guy thought he was still safe, Hayley grabbed one of the large square cookies and then\u2026pulled it towards her as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe cup was knocked to the side as the little man was tossed forward, rolling right up to the base of Hayley\u2019s now empty plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWelcome back ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time to start with our second guest today!\u201d Hayley said as the little man began crying almost instantly under her gaze. Hayley licked her finger and stuck it to the tiny guy, plucking him up like a crumb before rubbing him face first into the square cookie, embedding him in frosting as she thought of how to make this game even more fun than the last round has been. Looking at the cookie, she giggled with her new idea (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/94/c5/b4/94c5b47374d32988fa6f26f67244428a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/9...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley bit off a corner of the cookie as she then balanced it flat on her finger-tips, chewing loudly so the little guy knew to get the hell up and not make this boring for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor our next game, our player has to pick a corner\u2026and hope it doesn\u2019t get eliminated! It\u2019s America\u2019s favorite game\u2026 Baker\u2019s Roulette!\u201d Hayley <br>\r\nchirped as she swallowed her first bite audaciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe little man wasted no time as Hayley closed her eyes and began to slowly spin the cookie around. Dizzy and scared, player two began running for the corner to the right of the missing one, thinking Hayley would try to go for a different part instead. As he got there and grabbed hold of the frosting like it was a railing, the spinning stopped. Looking up, he saw he was in luck, his old spot was now about to be crunched in half by Hayley\u2019s teeth. He felt sick as her teeth crunched through the thick floor effortlessly. Hayley\u2019s loud chewing played tricks on his mind as he imagined himself inside of her mouth\u2026being ground into paste between her powerful teeth like the cookie was. He had no time to think as Hayley began spinning the cookie again. Only two corners were left now as he looked at the opposite side of himself. As her fingers began to slow down, he took a chance and dove to the spot he had just been in one more time\u2026he got lucky again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWahoooo! I win!\u201d he began shouting, thinking the game was over\u2026until Hayley began to spin her fingers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFinal round, pick your corner,\u201d Hayley said as she licked her lips, a smile breaking out on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo fair! I won! I won that game!\u201d the little man shouted as it all suddenly stopped. He looked up into Hayley\u2019s mouth as it opened wide and her hot breath washed down on him. Her tongue crept out and sunk under the cookie as it suddenly rose, pulling the pastry to her mouth\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!.....GULP!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWe have this old-timer now competing for the prize!\u201d Hayley said as her fingers deftly plucked up the smallest of the group, the tiny light designer. She had seen him hiding behind a book on the table when she had grabbed the cookie. The tiny bug of a man struggled between her fingers; Hayley had to struggle not to squish him as she fiddled with the milk carton in her free hand. Pouring milk into her cereal bowl, Hayley giggled as she held the tiny guy over it\u2026then released her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSwim and seek is the name of this game,\u201d Hayley said as she dunked her spoon in immediately and took her first bite of cereal, chewing loudly so her little guest understood where he stood to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, life-line! I want to use a life-line!\u201d he yelled as a wave of milk nearly swallowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love this game,\u201d Hayley said as she sunk her spoon in again, this time trying to get her prey. He was too small to be heard\u2026that meant no help was coming from the giantess. Diving into the milk, the man tried to swim away from her, only to swim right into the spoon as it too sank into the bowl. Thankfully it was pulled away from him, but the currents spun the old man out until he was surfacing\u2026right in the middle of the cereal loop. Looking up, he saw a spoon coming down and dove once more as it took the loop he was just in on a ride for Hayley\u2019s mouth.  Breaking the surface of the milk, he watched as Hayley opened her mouth wide and let the spoon slowly come down on her tongue, her eyes darting across the surface of the spoon looking for her player. When she saw no one was on board, she shoved the spoon in and swallowed after a few powerful mastications. Licking her lips, Hayley once again plunged the spoon into the bowl, this time on the opposite side from the exhausted stage-hand\u2026or so her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh oh ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time for the real challenge. It\u2019s Jaws!\u201d Hayley shouted as she made a dramatic gasping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLady, this isn\u2019t funny anymore!\u201d the man shouted up as he clung onto a fragment of floating cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDun\u2026dun. Dun\u2026dun. Dun dun. Dun dun. Dun. Dun. Dun. Dun. Dun. Dun. Dun. Dun\u2026.\u201d Hayley said as she began dragging the spoon towards the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley lifted the spoon out of the milk for a second and swamped her shrunken guest in a small wave of liquid, knocking him off the cereal chunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI give up! I give the hell up!\u201d the tiny man shouted as he began having trouble keeping afloat, too tired from his ordeal. As he sank below the surface, Hayley\u2019s spoon dove as well. As it slowly broke the surface, a tiny body could be seen huddled against the boulders of bran as milk ran down his body. Panting for air, the tiny man looked up at Hayley and waved to her to show his thanks for the rescue. He was a little too soon to be thanking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooks like contestant number three is eliminated, say goodbye folks!\u201d Hayley announced as the spoon began following the path so many before it had\u2026right into her waiting mouth as her tongue reached out for its next morsel (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://spf.fotolog.com/photo/63/20/106/cheriecookies/1262737552817_f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://spf.fotolog.com/photo/63/20/106/c...</a>). The small man was shaken from his perch as Hayley\u2019s tongue made contact with the bottom of the spoon. Light was quickly blocked out as Hayley\u2019s massive lips closed on the end of the spoon and began to block exit of everything destined for digestion. As the monument of breakfast was slowly sliding off the front of the spoon, the lighting designer was ironically fumbling in the darkness. The warm winds of Hayley\u2019s breath wrapped around the tiny man, like miniature cyclones, as he heard the milk cascading off the front of a tilting spoon. Soon he felt his back pressed against the wall of Hayley\u2019s lips; the ground under him pressed close as it too tried to get out of the massive mouth\u2026but it was in vain. As the spoon was pulled free, everything went tumbling down onto Hayley\u2019s slithering tongue. Blindly landing square on the spongey ground below, the little man had no time to rest as a hunk of cereal fell on him. He knew from before that his spoonful was relatively empty save for him and a few pieces. He began wondering just what tooth he would be thrown onto and how he\u2019d get away in the dark\u2026 totally unaware that his death was about to be seen by the sole survivor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe young woman shivered as she watched the spoon appear clean form between Hayley\u2019s lips. Without a word of a bite, Hayley tilted her head back\u2026 and swallowed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe thump of her throat welcoming its third guest hit the shrunken girl dead in her gut as she feared what was going to happen to her next. Suddenly, she was seized from behind\u2026Hayley already had her where she wanted her. Slowly, she was dragged up into the air as she began to cry in frustration. She loved Hayley; she didn\u2019t want to die like this\u2026part of her meal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt looks like we have a winner, folks!\u201d Hayley exclaimed as she dropped the spoon into the empty bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWh-what?\u201d the girl asked, wiping tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou get to move onto the second round! And, especially for you, we have prepared this beautiful car to take you there,\u201d Hayley said as her other arm disappeared under the table for a brief moment\u2026only to return with her slipper. As Hayley dropped it on the table and began moving the tiny girl towards it, the little thing burst to life again. Struggling and pushing against Hayley\u2019s massive fingers, the girl wanted anything but to end up in there. Suddenly, she paused above it and looked up at Hayley pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t, please!\u201d she asked, sniffling as she began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh right, you haven\u2019t said goodbye to the other competitors from today yet, how rude of me!\u201d Hayley said as she pulled up her shirt and then pressed the shrunken woman, face-first, into her flat stomach (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs15/f/2007/038/4/6/stomach_II_by_NotSchockSchwere.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs15/f/2007/0...</a>). She struggled to breathe for the first few seconds, but the pressure kept up, increasing even as if to motion to her that being still was key here. So the tiny thing quieted down and shut her eyes, listening for any sounds on the other side of the fleshy wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRNNNNNN\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEELP!\u201d a voice roared in agony over the deafening hissing groan of Hayley\u2019s stomach. Hayley giggled as she pulled the little woman away from her stomach and licked her lips. Winking down at the tiny thing, Hayley\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could see ahead the bobbing scarlet head of the music sensation as she slowly walked away from the closing stage doors. The echoing sounds of your shoes hitting the asphalt sounded through the alley as you got closer and closer to the singer. As you neared her, out of breath, you saw the problem; she had plugged in some headphones. Taking a deep breath, you composed yourself as you tried to now gently walk up near her. Nervously, you extended an arm and gently tapped Hayley on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?!\u201d the red-head almost jumped out of her skin as she spun around frantically, taken by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d you said, holding up your hands to look as non-threatening as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Hayley asked nervously, trying to compose herself as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you, I was actually just hoping\u2026.that I could have an autograph?\u201d you said sheepishly as you recovered a photo of Hayley from your bag and offered it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Of course!!!\u201d Hayley chirped excitedly as she started looking for a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRRRRRN! BRRRRRN! BRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry! Can I just take this quickly?\u201d you said as you snatched your phone from your pocket and looked at the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Don\u2019t even worry about it,\u201d Hayley said, smiling as she took the photo and walked off a little to give you some privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you get it yet?\u201d his voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was trying to when you called!\u201d you said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hurry up, these things are selling for a killing!\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks jackass, like I didn\u2019t know that already! Her stupid fans pay hand over fist for this shit!\u201d I spat back venomously. He made it impossible to get things done quickly sometimes you thought\u2026. Unbeknownst to you, the conversation you were having was not as private as you thought it was.<br>\r\nHayley was fuming, not only had someone tried to take advantage of her, but she also just had her fans insulted behind her back. This girl must have been crazy if she thought that Hayley wasn\u2019t going to let her know how big a mistake she had just made. Reaching into her pocket, Hayley pulled out her own phone and began scrolling through her apps for the one she needed. Hayley had never gotten to use it before, but now was as good a time as any as she got the girl in her screen\u2019s sight. Pressing the button, a brilliant flash of light went off that almost blinded Hayley\u2026but as for you\u2026it did something a little more extreme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You had hung up on your call and turned around just in time to see Hayley pointing her phone at you. Before you could even understand what was going on, you were swallowed up in a blast of light. Your head felt like it was splitting open suddenly as you almost instantly passed out\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground was gently shaking under you as the thundering drum of\u2026what the hell was making that sound? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm?\u201d you groaned as you found yourself laying down on something oddly smooth. The glossy floor was slick under your palm as you tried to push yourself up, succeeding only in raising your head as you found yourself now struggling to understand what exactly you were seeing. It looked like a tan wall was lifting up for just a second before slamming back down into the ground again. You finally knew what the sound was, but what were you looking at? The tan pillar had a strangely shiny color band along the bottom of each of the four pillars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were blown back by a wall of wind as the pillars all suddenly lifted up and fell down together as one, massive, tan wall! Groaning, you found yourself rolling, prone, on your back as you attempted to get your bearings once again. Straining on your miraculously unbroken back, you looked up and froze like a deer in headlights. You finally knew what the weird world around you was\u2026as you found yourself staring up at the tremendous, bored faced of Hayley Williams (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/I2r7G.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/I2r7G.jpg</a>). To say that you were terrified would be making, perhaps, the biggest understatement of your life. Your heart was hammering so hard in your chest; you thought it would burst out at any second. As a hundred questions about the situation you found yourself in flooded your mind, the worst thing possible took place\u2026 Hayley noticed that you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>HMMMMMMMM? WELL GOOD MORNING LITTLE ONE!</b>\u201d Hayley boomed as her tremendous hands pulled back and her massive face drew closer. You began backing away instinctively, trying your best to scuttle on the shimmering floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley\u2019s hand slammed down behind you, a gust of wind blowing you forwards onto your face as Hayley\u2019s disposition suddenly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>DON\u2019T TRY TO RUN AWAY! COME ON, DIDN\u2019T YOU WANT MY AUTOGRAPH? THE ONE ALL MY \u2018STUPID\u2019 FANS ARE AFTER?!</b>\u201d Hayley said as your heart sank into your stomach (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://data2.whicdn.com/images/49580544/original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://data2.whicdn.com/images/49580544/...</a>).<br>\r\nTrying to get up, you found yourself stammering once again, pleading for mercy from the giantess saying, \u201cWait! Please, I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>WHAT WAS THAT? I CAN\u2019T HEAR YOU DOWN THERE, HAHA! HOLD ON A SECOND!</b>\u201d Hayley\u2019s voice boomed painfully as her massive head slowly swung to the side, her tremendous arm reaching out for something. Your heart was hammering once again as you saw what Hayley was retrieving\u2026a magnifying glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now shivered as Hayley\u2019s pale green eye was now magnified above you. It looked like you were staring into the stadium-sized black hole of her pupil (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://favim.com/orig/201105/26/green-eyes-hayley-williams-magnifying-glass-pink-hair-playing-god-Favim.com-55593.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://favim.com/orig/201105/26/green-ey...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou felt your stomach almost leap into your throat as you realized you must have been even smaller than you thought if Hayley needed a magnifying glass to see you\u2026. What was worse was that you didn\u2019t even know the half of it. Hayley actually had to squint as she looked through the magnifying glass. The app had a scaling system to it, but with the first use it was always set to one of the lowest settings. She hadn\u2019t expected to, but for her first shrinking, Hayley had left the woman at barely the size of a crumb when the bright flash of the phone finally faded from her eyes in the alleyway. Now, as she got the tiny woman back in her sight through the magnifying glass, she giggled (which of course made you cover your ears as Hayley\u2019s booming voice assaulted you) and thought about how best to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDown on the photo, you felt like you were trying to run across a field of ice as the mountain-sized head of Hayley began to shift again. As the magnifying glass slammed down, the tremor across the field sent you spinning across the field once again. You were making hardly any progress as you finally took notice of what the giantess was doing. Hayley was grabbing hold of a massive cylinder\u2026a sharpie\u2026to sign the picture\u2026that you were on\u2026.shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HERE WE GO; I\u2019LL GIVE YOU MY NAME, NICE AND BIG!</b>\u201d Hayley said as she pulled the cap off the marker and pointed the fat tip of it down right towards where you were scuttling (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/6a/64/40/6a6440f6009519c78cbe54224d735dad.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the sharpie marker hit the surface, you saw a small ripple move across the floor and a splash of inky black liquid. Instantly, you saw a flood of liquid darkness ooze out from the massive point of the marker, sinking into the ground at an alarming rate. Turning, you began running away from the edge of the paper you\u2019d been heading for all this time. While you were moving as well as you could along the surface you couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was about to go terribly wrong, checking over your shoulder to see where the marker was going. For a moment, you thought it was going away from you\u2026until it turned around and began steaming right for you! As the thick marker tip slid towards you, your heart began hammering even harder as you tried to think of a way out of this situation. The ground behind you began to slowly tilt under you as the marker got closer. Looking over your shoulder again, you thought that you were staring into the night sky for a moment\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPainfully, you were run over by the marker and soon smothered in a pool of astringent, black ink. As the thick tip ran over your back, you reflexively gasped, swallowing a mouthful of (most likely toxic) ink. You\u2019d have screamed and begun to choke if not for your head being pressed into the ground by the marker as it continued to run over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HMMMM? WHERE\u2019D YOU GO NOW?</b>\u201d Hayley asked, giggling as she continued singing her name. She watched as the tiny, shimmering blob of black ink that was you tried to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBlegh!\u201d you retched as you vomited up black ink\u2026into the knee deep tide of black ink all around you. Looking up, you saw something odd; Hayley had pursed her lips above you for some odd reason (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/9e9ce344841da5da3e791d2aa0777394/tumblr_mn9qmtTIKl1qzy531o1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://40.media.tumblr.com/9e9ce344841da...</a>). You cocked your head to the side as you tried to figure out what the hell was going-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPFFFFF!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley smiled as she blew the ink dry on the photo. It was instinct, and she realized instantly that she had totally lost track of the shrunken bitch\u2026oh well. Leaning back in her chair, Hayley pulled out her phone and checked a few messages that she had let build up while she played with her tiny friend. Unknown to Hayley, you hadn\u2019t disappeared. You were now actually\u2026.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time was drifting slowly for you now as you found yourself flung back by the hurricane-like winds of Hayley\u2019s breath. Falling off the edge of the autographed photograph, you watched the mountainous face of Hayley Williams disappear slowly behind the white wall of the photograph you\u2019d been on only a few seconds beforehand. The waving strands of blonde hair flickered around the white edges of the photo\u2019s bottom, framing it in a white-gold cloud that looked like something out of a giantess-themed Rapture at the end of the world. Your premonition would be more accurate than you could have imagined at this point\u2026but that was yet to come. Zipping down the length of Hayley\u2019s torso, you watched her chest fly by in a matter of seconds. Flipping around, you saw right where you were headed: Hayley\u2019s belt. The slow passage of time began to fade as you raced towards the belt. Holding your arm out, you hoped that you\u2019d be able to grab hold of her belt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAaaargh!\u201d you screamed, grabbing hold of one of her belt loops. It seemed like your arm had been torn from its socket\u2026but you\u2019d managed to maintain your grip when it mattered most. Unfortunately, Hayley wasn\u2019t going to let you rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNNNNNBBBBLE\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUGH\u2026HOW LONG TILL LUNCH?\u201d the giant singer asked when her phone buzzed again, threatening to shatter your eardrums. It was an alarm going off, and while it would be enough to gently wake up someone building-sized like Hayley, to a bug-sized speck like you it might as well have been an eruption. \u201cBACK TO WORK,\u201d Hayley sighed as she began scooting forward in her chair, unaware of your presence on her pants\u2026not that you\u2019d be there for long anyway. As the singer launched herself forward and out of the chair, you lost your precarious grip and began the long plummet back toward the unforgiving ground and Hayley\u2019s checker-board Vans (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/paramoremusicom/photos/a.139684382720740.18091.139303379425507/1680610331961463/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/paramoremusicom...</a>). You braced for impact just in the nick of time as you slammed into what felt like solid earth. If you weren\u2019t a bug, the landing alone would have splattered you across one of the white squares decorating Hayley\u2019s shoes. Instead, your small size meant even the slight updraft caused by Hayley\u2019s leg swinging forward was enough to slow your descent and keep you from dying\u2026though it still hurt like hell to slam into the top of Hayley\u2019s foot. Being the petite little thing that she was, the giantess\u2019 foot was a little bonier than most, and a thin layer of canvas covering her foot was not enough to absorb the impact. Stunned, you found yourself sliding off the tip of Hayley\u2019s shoe as the giantess opened the door to backstage, ready to grab a bite to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cW-What?!\u201d You shouted as the ground under you began to shift again with the slow rise of Hayley\u2019s foot; the wind pressure at your back had you pressed down against the canvas as you swore you could feel one of the joints of her second toe pressing into your entire torso. Something in your head was screaming at you to hang on tight, but you didn\u2019t know why. You could see a little bit of frayed fabric ahead of you and struggled to crawl toward it as Hayley\u2019s foot hit the apex of its arch\u2026then it became clear why some primal part of your brain had been yelling at you to find something to hang onto. The ground dropped out from under you as Hayley\u2019s foot fell\u2026and you looked up just in time to see a wall of pale skin come at you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlammed against by the lowest part of Hayley\u2019s shin, you were catapulted at the tile floor and found yourself skidding across the ground thanks to a mix of fresh floor polish and your own light frame. After skidding, sliding, and spinning enough to turn your stomach into an acrobat, you finally came to a stop in a crumbled clump a good 6-8 feet away from Hayley\u2026though the distance quickly began to close\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM! BABOOOOM! BABOOOOOOOM! BABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braced for impact and grit your teeth tightly as the giantess\u2019 foot fell just a fraction of an inch in front of you, shaking the ground and you to the bone while the blonde was none the wiser (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/0f/ab/5c0fab5f6732d892c383c5e0ca29b1c9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/0f/ab/...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH MY GOD! IT\u2019S REALLY YOU!\u201d another voice called, threatening to burst your eardrums as a new round of tremors kept you from standing up. A real fan had found Hayley this time and had come bounding toward the blonde, unaware that her idol had just reduced a full-sized person to a fraction of an inch\u2026and that that person was laying, terrified, in the arch of Hayley\u2019s right shoe. \u201cPLEASE CAN I GET AN AUTOGRAPH?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above you, Hayley looked surprised for a moment before breaking out into a huge smile. Her mouth opened to say something, but you didn\u2019t catch it\u2026all sound disappeared as the massive blonde shifted and you found yourself staring at the checkerboard bottom of her Vans hanging overhead (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/karl-lagerfeld-vans-slip-on-release-date-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploa...</a>). You opened your mouth to scream, but there wasn\u2019t time as the plain of rubber suddenly came down\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOOM!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d thought that it was over. As Hayley\u2019s foot came down, you\u2019d curled up into the fetal position, closed your eyes, and braced for the painful impact\u2026but no pain came. There was a terrifying rush of air, a thunderous explosion and tremors to match\u2026but no pain! Opening up one eye anxiously, you saw\u2026nothing. Stuck in complete darkness, you thought for a moment that maybe you had died and gone to some other place, but as you reached out a hand and felt the rough wall of rubber in the inky darkness before you, reality settled back in. You\u2019d known that Hayley made you small when she shrank you\u2026but between getting blown off the autograph, to seeing the mountain Hayley had become, and now finding yourself safely tucked in one of the small diamonds that made up the tread of her Vans\u2026there were ants bigger than you were. Forget small, you were fucking miniscule! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were thinking of what you were going to do to escape from under Hayley\u2019s shoe alive, a small miracle was tossed your way. The inky darkness gave way to light as Hayley took a small step back while digging in her pockets for the pen she\u2019d used to sign the autograph you\u2019d been clinging to earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot hadn\u2019t moved far, but in the small instant it lifted, you\u2019d rolled out from under the second-to-last diamond and felt the gust of air hit your back as Hayley\u2019s foot came down again. You were less than a millimeter away from the wall of thick rubber\u2026if you\u2019d started rolling even a second later, you knew you\u2019d already be nothing more than red jam on her treads (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.smashpress.nl/wp-content/uploads/Paramore18.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i0.wp.com/www.smashpress.nl/wp-c...</a>). There was no time to sit and wait for Hayley to correct her mistake and squish you. Turning, you threw yourself against the wall of rubber and began scaling the instep of her shoe, desperately groping for some thread or fabric you could get a good handle on\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This time though, it didn\u2019t mean another monolithic shoe was going to fall out of the sky: the thick photostock paper acted as a passing cloud while the massive blonde listened to her energetic fan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSORRY, CAN WE TAKE A PICTURE TOGETHER AS WELL?\u201d the other voice thundered as you final managed to get over the rubber lip of Hayley\u2019s shoe. For the first time in what felt like ages, you\u2019d managed to get your hands back on the fabric that covered the top of Hayley\u2019s foot\u2026you were one step closer to your goal\u2026though, obviously things couldn\u2019t go that smoothly\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cABSOLUTELY! HOW\u2019S THIS?!\u201d Hayley asked, shifting to get closer to her fan and striking a silly pose for the picture. Her legs spread wide and she popped her hips to one side while her hear flew in a crazy main of blonde before the camera\u2019s lens\u2026and unknown to her and her fan, you were clinging on tight as the petite blonde\u2019s foot moved at mind-boggling speeds across the grimy tile floor (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/242775953/m%3D900_s%3D1_k%3D1_a%3D1/v2?webp=true&amp;v=0&amp;sig=c3c4c4a3dbb80e3bddaa7ad331a5b1eb7e96f320d31fedfa94823eea12d206a9\" target=\"_blank\">https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/242775953...</a>)! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smacked, face-first, into the wall of fabric that was the instep of Hayley\u2019s shoe as the giantess\u2019 foot met the ground again. Stunned from the sudden impact, you almost fell backwards off the rubber, but got your hand around a loose thread just in the nick of time. Hanging on tight, you yanked hard on your life-line and were once again flush with the canvas top of Hayley\u2019s slip-ons. Panting, you knew that you couldn\u2019t keep this up forever\u2026your heart would not last another few close calls like that. Your eyes shifted, looking at her bare ankle rise up and disappear into her pant-leg; a feeling of dread took hold of your heart as you realized the only person whose attention you could readily get was that of the woman who did this to you. No\u2026all you really had to do was hang on till you could get to someone else! Climbing up the instep of Hayley\u2019s foot, you just kept repeating in your head that you were not going to die while hanging onto the blonde\u2019s slip-ons. You could feel the heat radiating through the thin layer of fabric as you crawled along the massive black-and-white checkboard pattern of the shoes. Your ego was getting more and more bruised as it dawned on you that these squares were less than a square inch big and they still seemed like massive picnic blankets under you\u2026she\u2019d made you a speck\u2026maybe less than that. You\u2019d seen ants in your kitchen bigger than you were now. Before you could slip too deeply into that rabbit-hole though, Hayley\u2019s fan had managed to get her picture and thanked the blonde again before backing away and running excitedly down the hall\u2026and for some dumb reason, you hadn\u2019t grabbed onto any of the canvas\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM! BABOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\u2026BOOM!\u2026BOOM!\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUGH, I WASN\u2019T EXPECTING THAT,\u201d Hayley groaned, rubbing her stomach as it ached. She turned to head down the rest of the hall when her phone began to ring in her pocket. Rolling her eyes, Hayley retrieved the phone from her pocket and squatted down in the hallway, unaware of how just a little shift had nearly ended your life (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/paramore/photos/a.35246164962.16531.5388374962/10150897742939963/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/paramore/photos...</a>). While Hayley groaned and began going through the 5 emergency emails she\u2019d missed while dealing with her fan, you found yourself with your best chance to get some distance from the side of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClawing at the woven ground, you continued to drag yourself up the slight incline of the blonde\u2019s shoe while Hayley\u2019s frustrated sighs overhead boomed like angry thunder. You\u2019d dragged your body over three squares before you could finally afford to stand up on your own two legs\u2026though that didn\u2019t mean the ground under your feet was solid by any means. Each step you took had some slight give as fabric and flesh both bend, even under your meager weight\u2026though you had the feeling that if these shoes were a little less worn, or you were even a fraction smaller, the ground might as well have been concrete. Still, the give of the ground wasn\u2019t the really concerning thing about trying to walk on top of Hayley\u2019s foot\u2026the honor of Most Frustrating went to the rising tendons of Hayley\u2019s foot whenever her toes wiggled or scrunched. Fortunately, you realized that Hayley had a habit of flexing her toes after she\u2019d groan about something she read. Unfortunately, you didn\u2019t put two and two together until you\u2019d tripped five times and fallen flat on your face right in the middle of one of the white squares. True to form, your timing was terrible as Hayley sighed and looked away from her phone for a moment, casting her eyes downward as a thousand thoughts flew through her head. If you\u2019d stayed still, you might have gone overlooked as some dirt on her shoe\u2026but that\u2019s not how things worked out for you. Spooked that you\u2019d be seen on the white square, you began crawling toward one of the black tiles in desperation. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The little thing she\u2019d been unknowingly tormenting was now on the black square and looking up at her with wide, watering eyes. \u201cCOME ON LIL ONE~ OR ELSE THE BIG, BAD, HAYLEY-ZILLA\u2019S GONNA SQUISH YOU~\u201d Hayley said as she began dragging her finger toward you\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour heart jumped into your throat as you turned and saw the massive, pale pillar coming straight your way! Scrambling to your feet, you began running along the surface of the black square, aiming right toward the massive pale ankle of the singer before her toes scrunched\u2026a tendon raised\u2026and you tripped, falling head-over-heels. There was a sharp pain in your right leg as you looked down and saw your ankle looking a little red\u2026it was the perfect timing to sprain your ankle. Pushing past the pain, you attempted to get up and stumbled forward a few more steps before you fell again, landing on the next white square now. Flipping over onto your back, you almost pissed yourself as you saw the pale pillar was almost on top of you! You shut your eyes and waited for Hayley\u2019s finger to run over you, grinding you into the top of her shoe and turning you into a red smear\u2026but it didn\u2019t happen. Opening your eyes, you saw the finger had come to a stop just a few centimeters in front of you; following the pillar up, you saw the giant blonde frowning down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSERIOUSLY? I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE THIS AT LEAST A LITTLE FUN,\u201d the giantess sighed, seeming disappointed with your performance. Before she could say something else, her phone buzzed once more and the blonde\u2019s eyes shifted to the screen as her finger remained planted directly in front of you. While she was busy reading, you took the chance to try and get up and get the hell off her foot before her finger finished the job. You made it about three steps before the air shook with Hayley\u2019s groan, the giantess\u2019s voice booming, \u201cFOR FUCK\u2019S SAKE\u2026I\u2019M NEVER GOING TO GET A BREAK TODAY AM I?\u201d Her vision drifted back down to your tiny body, then back up into the long hallway as the giantess sighed, considering her next move (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/paramore/photos/a.35246164962.16531.5388374962/10150898730434963/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/paramore/photos...</a>)....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself flying forward with the same kind of force you\u2019d felt on rollercoasters in the past!

Dazed, you slowly began to slip off the tattooed ankle as the giant singer snicker from above, as she felt your tiny body smack lightly (to her) against her skin (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://data.whicdn.com/images/23945790/original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://data.whicdn.com/images/23945790/...</a>). Your foggy head began to grow a little clearer as you felt your body begin to peel off of Hayley\u2019s ankle! Looking down over your shoulder, you saw the dark shadows on top of the bare skin of Hayley\u2019s foot\u2026the entrance to her Vans was right below you! In what can only be described as the most athletic feat of your lifetime, you pushed off of the giantess\u2019 ankle, twisted in the air, and just managed to grab hold of the rim of her shoe\u2026though you almost pulled your shoulder out of the socket in the process. Now all you had to do was p-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOOOOH! VERY IMPRESSIVE!\u201d Hayley\u2019s voice thundered from above as you looked up to see the giantess lowering herself\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOM\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shuddered as Hayley\u2019s knee hit the ground; you were almost shaken loose from your perch, but just barely managed to maintain your grip. It wouldn\u2019t last for long though, you thought as you began to feel your right hand cramping! Pulling up with all you were worth, you thought that you might just be able to swing your arm up for a better grip when Hayley\u2019s chuckle rumbled all around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess hummed happily and put a hand to her forehead, brushing her blonde hair back as she smiled brightly down at you like she was enjoying a funny video on her phone (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gC4H7eu.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/gC4H7eu.png</a>). \u201cTHIS IS AMAZING\u2026DID YOU ACTUALLY THINK I WAS GOING TO JUST LET YOU CLIMB OUT OF THERE? HOOOOLY SHIT, I DIDN\u2019T THINK YOU\u2019D BE AS DUMB AS AN ANT WHEN I MADE YOU THE SIZE OF ONE!\u201d Her eyes flashed open, locking on you with a devious gleam while a bright smile spread across her lips. \u201cYOU DON\u2019T GET TO LEAVE THAT EASILY, YOU\u2019RE ABOUT TO GET THE VIP TOUR!\u201d Hayley said as the same finger that flicked you now hovered overhead once again. The giantess winked as she cooed, \u201cTHIS RIDE CAN GET A LITTLE BUMPY THOUGH\u2026SO KEEP YOUR HANDS AND FEET INSIDE THE VAN AT ALL TIMES~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait! Hayley please d-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything faded to black as the giantess smacked you in the head with a very light flick her of her fingernail and knocked you out cold. You sank into the darkness of her checker-board Vans. Giggling to herself as she focused and felt your little body rolling down the top of her foot, Hayley stood back up and began heading to deal with one of the new \u201cemergencies\u201d she\u2019d gotten an email about\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was a race against Hayley\u2019s impatience. If the giant blonde shifted even a little bit like before, you knew you were going to be thrown to the floor again and left at the mercy of her Vans\u2026and you knew you wouldn\u2019t get lucky like you did before. Your arms and legs burned as you continued pulling yourself up the rubber rampart while the massive blonde continued chatting happily with her friend. You\u2019d have thought at this point you\u2019d be small enough to get some good handholds, but now ever slight twitch and shift of Hayley\u2019s weight seemed like it was trying to buck you off. All you could do was dig your fingers even harder into the rubber in response; if Hayley was going to knock you off, she was going to have to do a lot more than just shift her weight around! With a final surge of adrenaline, you threw yourself up the last few feet and managed to grab hold of the woven canvas-top of her checkerboard Vans slip-ons. Panting, you looked toward her ankle and felt a lump form in your throat as the vast expanse of her show reminded you how pathetically tiny the blonde had made you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://shop.r10s.jp/sneaker-bouz/cabinet/product/vn000eyebww5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://shop.r10s.jp/sneaker-bouz/cabine...</a>). Pressed against the fabric, you could feel the heat of Hayley\u2019s foot radiating from within the woven confines of her footwear. The adrenaline began to fade and a wave of exhaustion rolled over you, threatening to make you fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh!\u201d you groaned as you willed yourself to hang on tight, fingers burning as the threads cut into your fingers\u2026. It hurt like hell\u2026but you managed to keep on the canvas portion of her shoe\u2026for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M SORRY!\u201d Hayley\u2019s voice thundered overhead, \u201cI\u2019D REALLY LOVE TO STAY AND TALK MORE, BUT I\u2019M LATE FOR A TECH ISSUE THEY WANTED ME AROUND TO SOLVE!\u201d The \u201cpetite\u201d blonde bounced on the balls of her feet as her fan nodded and gushed one more time about how happy she wat to meet Hayley before letting the star get back to her business. With a big smile, Hayley spun back in the direction of the hallway and started heading down it with long, energetic strides (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfNYeBYW4AARxE1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfNYeBYW4AAR...</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cF-Fuck me!\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs as the sudden lift off almost ripped your arms out of their sockets. As Hayley\u2019s foot hit the peak of its stride, you suddenly felt a moment of weightlessness\u2026and then the monolithic shoe began to crash down like the sky was falling. You\u2019d been on rollercoasters several times in the past\u2026but they all seemed like kiddie park shit as your found yourself clinging tightly to Hayley\u2019s shoe as it dropped from several dozen feet in the air\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOM!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou were honestly surprised you still had an arm after your body whipped forward as Hayley\u2019s shoe slammed into the unforgiving tile floor. If you\u2019d still been on the floor when that foot landed\u2026the thought made your stomach turn. There wouldn\u2019t have been anything left of you, much less\u2026much\u2026less\u2026 \u201cWow\u2026\u201d was all you could say as Hayley\u2019s other foot began to lift off the floor for her next step. Your ears rang with the groan and creak of old rubber getting pulled and stretched across the length of Hayley Williams\u2019 sole. Slowly, the massive structure lifted off the ground, defying everything your brain thought was possible. It looked like a small soccer stadium was levitating as Hayley\u2019s slip-on arched through the air, leaving you in darkness as it briefly passed in front of the artificial lights streaming down on you\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs her foot hit the ground, you got to feel the shockwave reverberate through the floor, up the rubber, and right across your bones! If you\u2019d been next to a collapsing building, you were sure it might have felt similarly. The impact left you feeling numb all over; before you could get any feeling back in your extremities, the slip-on you\u2019d been clinging to began to raise off the ground once again\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!...BABOOOOOOOOOOOOM!...BABOOOOOOOOOOOOM!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile each of her steps seemed to bring about a new injury for you, Hayley seemed just a bubbly as she weaved her way through several hallways in search of whatever her phone had asked her to attend. You had planned to scale your way onto the football field-like plain of checkerboard\u2026but after two steps it was clear that wasn\u2019t going to happen! Each impact threatened to tear apart your body in new and inventive way. In the course of a few minutes, Hayley\u2019s footsteps had hyper-extended your shoulders, pulled several muscles, threatened to tear tendons, and left your chest black-and-blue after slamming into the fabric wall several times. It looked like you\u2019d been in a car accident\u2026and all of that was just from the tiny blonde bouncing down a few hallways! While it had been helish for you, it was just a short walk for the blonde as she made it down the end of the hallways and saw she\u2019d apparently gone the wrong way. After talking with her fan, the blonde had gotten all turned around and had managed to end up going away from the stage where she\u2019d been called.  \u201cShit\u2026you\u2019re not going to make it if I have to go all the way back across are you?\u201d the blonde asked, her head still looking around to see if she was really as deserted as she thought she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer words hit you like a ton of bricks as the aching you\u2019d felt all the way to your bones went numd. Your ears were suddenly ringing and you swore you could hear the blood rushing through your veins as the wall of fabric you\u2019d been hanging on to began to groan with Hayley\u2019s shifting weight\u2026instead of taking another step forward though, it looked like the blonde was bending down (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/35114048_227178677872026_3148994872384421888_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&amp;oh=c567137cc0abbc27a912a81a5a73542c&amp;oe=5BBC5FE1\" target=\"_blank\">https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t...</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDAAAAAAAAMN\u2026I DIDN\u2019T THINK YOU WERE GONNA LAST WITH HOW TINY I LEFT YA\u201d the giantess cooed, smirking as her eyes slowly locked on your position. \u201cDON\u2019T BOTHER TRYING TO TALK, I CAN\u2019T HEAR YOU ANYWAY~ LOOK, I WAS PLANNING TO JUST MESS WITH YOU TILL WE GOT BACK TOWARD MY DRESSING ROOM AND THEN I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU A BREAK\u2026BUUUUT\u2026\u201d Slowly, Hayley\u2019s fingers seemed to be moving toward you! For a moment, you thought she was going to scrape you off her shoe and pick you up\u2026but to your horror, her fingers slowly seemed to bend and curl as her real intentions became clear\u2026. \u201cI DON\u2019T REALLY THINK YOU\u2019RE GOING TO BE THAT FUN TO PLAY WITH ANYMORE. I\u2019LL MAKE SURE I LEAVE THE NEXT BUG A LITTLE BIGGER SO IT DOESN\u2019T BREAK THAT EASILY~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a sudden rush of wind as the polished tip of Hayley\u2019s nail came racing toward you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSEE YOU, BUG,\u201d the giantess taunted, sticking out her tongue as her light flick caught you dead on (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/d2/5b/3b/d25b3b9137d03030fb1acebfc46c9ae7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/d2/5b/3b/d25b3...</a>)\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tile wasn\u2019t any more forgiving than you\u2019d imagined it would be\u2026as your battered body slammed into it, you thought you could hear something crack as another wave of pain stole your breath away. Gasping and flailing on the ground, your eyes darted in the direction of Hayley as the blonde slowly began to rise up to her full height again. Between the pain, the adrenaline, and the absolute pants-shitting levels of fear you were feeling right now, your mind was struggling to come up with an escape plan. Inside your body was screaming for you to run, begging for rest, cursing you for getting stuck in this situation in the first place! All you could do was manage to squeak out a pitiful plea, \u201cP-Please\u2026D-Don\u2019t h-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSORRY BUGGY, YOU\u2019VE GOT NO ONE TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF FOR THIS,\u201d the giantess said as she stretched up to the ceiling, her whole body popping and cracking as little bits of tension were released. As her heels hit the ground, another shockwave blasted you, sending you rolling across the white tile. You were laid out, face flat against the grimy floor as you struggled to get up. Flopping haphazardly onto your back, you looked up and felt your heart leap into your chest. Hovering above you was the checkerboard sole of Hayley\u2019s shoe\u2026but just for a split second as the giantess leaned her weight forward\u2026and the sky began to fall (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/45/eb/8d/45eb8db8870a96f6f4a0f3eef8fbbb54.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/45/eb/8d/45eb8...</a>)\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!....CRUNCH!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHayley didn\u2019t even bother to pause or look back over her shoulder as she started walking to her real destination\u2026. There wouldn\u2019t have been much to see even if she had. Down on the floor, in the middle of a worn-out, off-white tile was a small smudge of red. Later, what remained of your body would be cleaned up by a janitor\u2026your disappearance would be noticed two weeks later\u2026and the case would eventually be let go of, forgotten along with you\u2026the crud stuck in Hayley\u2019s treads\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The plan was simple, and in your own mind, fullproof. However you would soon learn that your own confidence would be your downfall and lead to a series of events which, if they did not end it, would permanently alter your life for the worse. Though the consequences where not what you thought about, as you stood there in the muggy night air, trying to act as natural as possible. You were currently standing next to the home of your target, a sizeable tour bus that was home to the famed singer, Hayley Williams during her long concert trips. As a reporter who had worked with a number of celebrity magazines, you felt you knew what you were doing, even if this was a rather unusual method to your normal operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround your neck was your trusty camera, a high power device that probably could've taken a picture of Miss Williams from several blocks away. But you weren't here for the normal paparazzi longshots, you were here for something much closer and far more personal, hence the next item you carried. It was an amazing device and one you could hardly believe your publisher had gotten her hands on, but you trusted that it worked after a brief demonstration. It was a small machine worn around the wrist, no bigger than a watch, but it had an amazing power. Through some form of science, which you hardly even begun to understand, the device was able to shrink a person and whatever they were carrying down to up to 1/12 their original size, essentially making them several inches tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in a deep breath before making preparations to sneak into the tour bus. You checked your camera to make sure the battery was charged and the film was still there. You checked the device to make sure it was active. And lastly you checked your entry point and were happy to see what you hoped to see. Thanks to the summer heat, Hayley had the tour bus's windows cracked open to let some fresh air flow through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent that everything was ready, you out your plan into action. A quick button tap on the shrinking machine caused it to whirl to life and your body to begin to feel strange as a cold sweat broke out. With only a few seconds to spare, you latched your fingers onto the open window and shut your eyes just as tightly as you grasped the ledge. In a few seconds, the cold sweat and sickness vanished and you felt a tingling sense of vertigo in the tips of your fingers as you observed the rocked pavement, now seeking to be several miles down. You didn't give yourself a chance to visualize yourself splatting down against that ground as you hoisted yourself up onto the window's ledge and felt the cool air-conditioned environment inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to look around,  through the shutter I your camera of course, snapping a few pictures of Hayley's personal living space. A rather nice place for a tour bus, it was clearly built to house only one person. In one corner towards the front, was a kitchenette, housing only a minifrigde, several cupboards, and a handful of discarded pizza boxes and drink cans. Towards the back of the bus was what served as Hayley's bedroom, a queen sized bed, flanked by two small closets. The ground around the bed was littered with discarded clothes. Zooming in, you managed to take a few good shots of Hayley's lacy unmentionables, including a tiny thong that perfectly matched the singer's hair. Moving on you lowered your camera on the center of the room, where you found a TV on the wall opposite of you, a bit to the right of you was a couch with a coffee table in front of it, and immediately below you was a variety of Hayley's discarded shoes, not that they really mattered or where of interest. In fact, the one thing that interested you most was not here, Hayley herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned at yourself that you had failed to check for the star of your voyeuristic escapades before you entered. Regardless, you were prepared to wait as long as it would take. Unfortunately, as you settled down to wait, the first of your many misfortunes, hit you like a ton of bricks. Now normally, a cool breeze on a hot summer night like this, was a pleasant feeling. However when you are about an inch tall, such a breeze is not so pleasant. You discovered this as you leaned over the ledge to get a better look at the room and such a \"breeze\" pushed you with hurricane force. Suddenly, the ground wasn't below you, you instead found yourself falling towards what you thought was your death. As you tumbled you saw the flash of an object which would soon cushion your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat object was this?</span></div></div>",

When you hit the sole you were surprised when your light mass meant you slightly bounced off the insole, something which you were rather grateful for as you pulled yourself to your feet and checked your equipment was still working (it was)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the lack of a strong odour you guessed the shoes were new, as do the gel insoles you were currently standing on. You were glad not to end up in an old worn pair, at your size it would have been deeply unpleasant. The problem came from when you hear the door open and her voice high above you causing you to swear, if you'd waited a couple of minutes you'd have pictures of Hayley in the bus as well as all the others you'd taken anyway. You needed to get out of her sneaker, the entire reason for you being her was right outside it and due to your unfortunate luck you didn't land in one of her open toed shoes, meaning you would need to climb your way out before you got anything worth shooting, besides the interior of her shoes obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the shuffling as you climbed wasn't exactly comforting as it sounded like something out of a monster movie, crashes and bangs which most likely were Hayley searching through the quite messy bus for whatever she was looking for, but from your perspective it just made you realise how much of a difference in scale there was between you both, if things went badly she could crush you like a bug. You needed to ensure that didn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when you reach the lip of her shoe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)You get out of her shoe, just in time to see her stripping down to her bra and panties, giving you a brilliant first snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) You almost make it when she moves to put them on, her toes shoving you down back into the insole, whether she is curious as to the small thing under her foot and decides to take a look, or just assumes it's a pebble or something and ignores it is up to the chapter writer.</span></div></div>",

Pushing against the resilient strands of straw that barred your path, you could hear the rumble of her working her pocketbook above you. It had only been a few seconds since you\u2019d been catapulted from your precarious perch into the middle of the endless expanses of Cristina Scabbia\u2019s welcome mat, but you knew it was not wise to linger where you landed. Jumping over a tight bundle before you once again heard the jangle of her keys above you, like the playing of a deadly wind chime. High above, you heard the hollow \u201cthunk\u201d as they landed inside her handbag. You only had a few seconds left to hop over the next barrier when you felt the ground rumble under you once again as her foot began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGuh!\u201d You groaned as a quick tremor knocked you flat on your face. It felt like you had collapsed on felled trees as you tried to push yourself up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA powerful gust of wind came from you right as you looked suddenly and felt your stomach drop. You were parallel with Cristina\u2019s right foot as you heard the rubber sole groan against the movements of the powerful toes it contained (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/71/69/d5/7169d5d814307e9639d72955b74babfc.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236...</a>). The tremendous black boot towered over you like an obsidian spire as you noticed a shadow start to engulf you. Flipping around on your back, you nearly swallowed your tongue as you looked up to see the deep trenches of her boot slowly drifting over you like a malevolent cloud. You began scurrying back across the rippling bundles of straw as the sky was slowly devoured by the bottom of Scabbia\u2019s boot. Everything moved in slow motion as Cristina began to lower her foot onto the mat. As the giant boot\u2019s heel touched down onto the welcome mat, a shockwave knocked you back over onto your stomach. All around you, small rainstorms of dust and dirt fell from clumps crammed between the massive rubber treads overhead. Grabbing hold of a bundle of straw in your hand, you saw that the world around you was growing darker by the second. Looking up again, you saw the ceiling was much closer than before. The roar of wind around you was deafening as you closed your eyes and tensed up; waiting to get crushed under the thick rubber treads of Scabbia\u2019s foot\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCristina smiled as she felt the crunch of the straw mat under her boot as she began to slowly twist her boot like she was crushing a cigarette (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s125.photobucket.com/user/brookis69/media/item6.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://s125.photobucket.com/user/brookis...</a>). The cold gust of AC hit her face brining a sigh from her lips as she began to slowly strip off the leather jacket she\u2019d been sporting. She tossed it onto the couch as she ran her free hand through her thick hair. Looking down at her boots, she frowned as she saw her mat was already speckled with dirt after just being put down three days ago. Groaning, she dragged her right foot across the straw mat, kicking up small clumps of mud and dirt that had been accumulating. Going back and forth, Cristina began to kick off what little dirt her foot could get off of the mat. Planting her right foot back on the ground, the giantess slowly lifted the foot you had disappeared under\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the harsh light once again poured down on you, you were still in the middle of a panic attack. Hyperventilating, you looked back and forth as you watched the dust from the floor mat swell in the gust of wind that came under her boot. Your eyes couldn\u2019t adjust to the lights around you as you heard the thunder of Cristina\u2019s sigh high above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WHAT IS THAT DOWN THERE?</b>\u201d Scabbia\u2019s voice echoed from above as you felt the rush of wind across your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTerrified, you turned over and curled up, another small cloud of dust rolling over you like a building had been demolished. Tentatively, you tried to open your eyes, squinting through the dust to see the awe-inspiring image of Cristina leaning down. The dark eyes of the giantess pierced through the creamy complexion of her skin; her raven hair swirled around her face like a living forest as her lips pursed. For a moment, you laid prone, heaving labored breaths as you though the giantess\u2019s eyes shone with a spark of recognition\u2026you were mistaken. Slowly, Scabbia smiled as her lips slowly moved forward, her eyebrow arching (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://metalholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cristina-Scabbia-by-Tim-Tronckoe.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://metalholic.com/wp-content/uploads...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>GROSS</b>\u201d her voice boomed as you suddenly saw a pool-sized, shimmering ball of saliva expelled from between Cristina\u2019s lips\u2026the giantess was spitting on a \u201cbug\u201d from her point of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLOOOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou were chocking as suddenly you found yourself under several hundred gallons of Scabbia\u2019s saliva! Swimming through the super-thick liquid, you saw the light above you begin to disappear again as you started panicking. You hoped to god Cristina wasn\u2019t about to do what you thought she would\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSQUELCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCristina ground her foot back and forth again after stomping on the saliva-suspended bug (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://36.media.tumblr.com/2bdd0ff107ca4ebb5b609b1aa33d1ade/tumblr_mt5wyd68RE1ry66jso1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://36.media.tumblr.com/2bdd0ff107ca4...</a>).

From the way the staff-person she spoke to phrased it, Lacey\u2019s interviewer had apparently gotten here an hour and a half early to set up. To Lacey though, it looked like she was the first person here\u2026 \u201cWeird.\u201d She said as she moved toward the table and pulled out one of the chairs.

Ms. Strum! L-Lacey, please down here!\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs as the world around you continued to shake violently with tremors of biblical proportions. It only made sense though\u2026after all, before you was one of the creatures from myth, the Behemoth\u2026or at least, that was how Lacey looked to someone in your position. You still didn\u2019t know what had happened to you, why you were now the size of a tiny ant on the floor of the dressing room. The only thing you knew for certain was that your sole hope for survival lay with the 5\u20190\u201d mountain of rock-star who didn\u2019t even know you were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCOME ON\u2026COME ON\u2026SHIT, I\u2019VE GOT TO GET THIS THING LOOKED AT,\u201d Lacey\u2019s voice thundered from above, threatening to pop your eardrums. You cowered, ducking low like you were in a bomb shelter and Lacey\u2019s words were the exploding shells. \u201cDAMN IT\u2026\u201d her voice boomed as you were suddenly cast in a dark shadow. Looking up, you were at a loss for words\u2026hovering over you was the checkered sole of Lacey\u2019s converse\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou skid across the thick, rough fibers of the carpet, burning your side\u2026but you were alive. Panting, you looked at the imposing tip of Lacey\u2019s shoe and tried to keep your shit together. Your bottom lip quivered and your body was drenched in a cold sweat; it made sense, you HAD just avoided getting crushed under Lacey\u2019s shoe\u2026but seeing how big her converse was let it sink in for you. Unless you got a miracle granted\u2026you were fucked (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4054/4399119974_aebc148cfd_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4054/43991...</a>). \u201cFuck\u2026how do I do this?!\u201d you cursed under your breath, trying your best to figure out what you should do to survive this crazy situation. First things first, you needed to get the hell off the floor\u2026but how? You thought that, possibly, you could climb up the front of Lacey\u2019s converse and get spotted on the wide expanse of white that was the tip of her shoe\u2026at the very least you weren\u2019t sure what other options you might have, and waiting was just asking to get crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a deep, slow breath through your nose, you tried your best to calm down and think through how you were going to do this. The inside of your nostrils burned with the sharp smell of rubber mixed with the earthy scent of dust and dirt that had managed to get caught in Lacey\u2019s treads. You could feel your chest beginning to feel less tight\u2026taking another look at the large wall of dirty white rubbing in front of you, a small surge of hope ignited in your chest. Crouching down, you stretched for a few seconds\u2026got into position\u2026and took off toward the tip of Lacey\u2019s converse like an Olympic sprinter. Thinking back to track in high-school, you took two smaller jumps, then vaulted forward, throwing all your weight toward the rubber expanse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUNK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air, the wind was knocked clean out of you\u2026but you\u2019d done it! Clinging to the front of Lacey\u2019s converse, you tried your best to scuttle the rest of the way up. You\u2019d made it maybe a few centimeters up before the world began to shift under you. \u201cW-What the fuck is going on?!\u201d you screamed, trying not to wet yourself as you began to fly up through the air. Squinting thanks to the wind whipping at your face, you looked up to see Lacey\u2019s hand moving toward you and thought she might have finally seen you! \u201cL-Lacey! P-Please! Down h-h-here! Help m-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSERIOUSLY\u2026THIS IS JUST FUCKING UNPROFESSIONAL\u201d Lacey\u2019s voice boomed as you regained consciousness and quickly re-established your grip on the tip of Lacey\u2019s shoe. Dizzy and confused, you tried to figure out what the hell had happened when you craned your neck up and saw Lacey\u2019s massive hand hanging over you\u2026. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t because she was saving you like you\u2019d hoped\u2026the giantess was just hugging her knee closer to her chest. All that had happened was Lacey lifting the foot you\u2019d gripped onto up on the chair (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/R8HpD5u.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/R8HpD5u.jpg</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me\u2026\u201d you groaned, trying to move only for a wave of soreness to shoot through your body. It was apparently already a miracle you could crane your neck up\u2026moving would take a little longer. If you couldn\u2019t move, you could at least plan out your next steps to get the giantess\u2019 attention. With her fingers so close, the obvious choice was to hike up the front of Lacey\u2019s foot and then make the small climb onto her fingertips. A small tickle or bite might be enough to warrant at least a glance from the rocker, and that was all you thought you needed. \u201cCome on\u2026so fucking close,\u201d you groaned, forcing yourself to move even if every fiber of your being was yelling at you to rest. You\u2019d just managed to get up when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRRRRRRRN\u2026.BRRRRRRRRN\u2026.BRRRRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your ears tightly, you looked around to find source of the thunder\u2026Lacey found it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHIS HIM?\u201d she said, her head turning toward her phone on the table. You watched as Lacey\u2019s fingers released their grip on her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRRRRRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rubber sole of Lacey\u2019s shoe groaned as her toes pressed down on the interior of the shoe and began to move forward, dragging across the seat\u2019s cushion. You struggled to keep your balance, but it didn\u2019t help when Lacey pointed her foot straight down\u2026 Suddenly, you found yourself in free-fall. \u201cLacey! Help! F-Fuck, noooooooooo\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting the ground hard, you looked up in time to see Lacey\u2019s bent leg hover over you for a second (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/rarasfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/RARAs-Farm-Lacey-Sturm-01-1024x683-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683\" target=\"_blank\">https://i0.wp.com/rarasfarm.com/wp-conte...</a>).

By some miracle, Lacey\u2019s foot landed in such a way that the tip of it didn\u2019t come down on you and crush you like the bug you were now. Instinct took over as you cried and began crawling toward the light, desperate to get out before a twitch of Lacey\u2019s foot reduced you to a smear on the tile floor. In a blur of limbs and terror, you managed to roll out from under the front of the massive converse sneaker just in time as Lacey leaned forward and the rubber met the floor. If you hadn\u2019t moved it would all be over\u2026you\u2019d have been bisected by the rubber hexagon\u2026. You needed to get away. You needed to get far, far away from Lacey\u2019s toe now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed away from the toe of her converse, looking for some way you could get up and away when your eyes fell on it. \u201cOh, come on\u2026\u201d you groaned, trying desperately to think of anything else you could do. \u201cThis is some bullshit\u2026this is bullshit!\u201d you griped as you began heading to the only safety line you could see\u2026Lacey\u2019s shoelaces\u2026instead of going under her foot, you were going to go over it. <br>\r\nWalking around the tip of her shoe, you began running for the long strip of fabric that would save you from the floor. Meanwhile, high above you, the 5 ft. titan was trying her best to get through a ridiculously complex email chain to figure out if she\u2019d gotten the time for this interview right. It looked like she had it right\u2026but there was nothing saying her interviewer would be late either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUGH, THIS IS GETTING STUPID,\u201d Lacey\u2019s voice thundered from high above as she grabbed her phone and began writing a text to her manager. Hopefully she could get the phone number for the interviewer, or at the very least get a little more information. Unknown to her though, her frustrated muttering was coming through to the intended target loud and clear. You felt your cheeks flush red as you flopped against the wall of black canvas that was against the main part of her foot. In the time you\u2019d been climbing her shoelace, the giantess had apparently become too frustrated to wait much longer. Your heart began to hammer\u2026it meant you were running out of time to get Lacey\u2019s attention before she began to move. Once this giantess began to walk, there was no telling what would happen to you\u2026only that it would be painful. With your fingers dug deeply into the dirty fibers of her shoelace, you looked up at the rest of your climb and swallowed nervously. Sure\u2026she\u2019d undone the laces completely\u2026and sure, she apparently wasn\u2019t wearing socks\u2026BUT that still mean you\u2019d need to get close to the mouth of her shoe. If you were going to get her attention, you were going to risk falling into her shoe. The thought of that happening sent a chill down your spine\u2026 Dying as lint between her toes wasn\u2019t on the top of your list, but you didn\u2019t have a lot of option\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d managed to get a little higher on her lace by the time Lacey\u2019s phone buzzed and almost scared you death\u2026the damn thing sounded like a hive of bees\u2026from Jurassic Park. Wincing, you dared to peek up and saw Lacey still paying attention to her computer. There wasn\u2019t a lot you could think to do but keep climbing closer to the pale wall of flesh that was just below Lacey\u2019s ankle. In a minute at most, you\u2019d be at the end of her shoelace\u2026salvation was so close, you could almost taste it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHERE? NO\u2026SHIT, DO I GOTTA SPELL IT OUT?\u201d Lacey groaned, grabbing her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you knew there wasn\u2019t a lot of time left to get noticed. If Lacey called her manager and reported that you were missing, then there would be literally nothing keeping her seated\u2026and the chance you\u2019d be able to hang onto her foot while she walked were laughable! Your fingers dug into the white weave of fabric that was her shoelace; you thought back to being a kid in gym-class trying to climb the rope. Part of you wished you\u2019d taken that a bit more seriously now that your life was literally hanging by thread. Her skin was so close now! Two more body-lengths and you\u2019d be there! As you approached the mouth of her shoe, the atmosphere began to change\u2026before, you were chocking on the smell of rubber and wet earth that had been caught in Lacey\u2019s treads. Now that you were this close to her bare skin, you could feel the heat radiating off of her body wash over you like a wave. The air was also tinged with a strange mix of aromas\u2026the slight sting of sweat, but the gentle sweet fragrance of her body wash. With one last exertion, you forced yourself from the end of the lace and flopped onto the edge of her shoe, right next to the tongue of her shoe. In front of you was a wall of white flesh. \u201cPlease work\u2026\u201d you whined, reaching out and digging your fingers into the warm skin\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Lacey was waiting impatiently for her manager to get back to her when she felt a tiny tickle on the side of her right foot. She tried to ignore it at first, but when it kept going she groaned and flexed her toes, giving her foot a gentle tap to try and knock the irritant loose. Still the itch was there. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she groaned, breaking her eyes away from the laptop as she leaned down to examine her ankle (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LaceySturm81/photos/a.297219620387709.65061.297200780389593/1300730020036659/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/LaceySturm81/ph...</a>). \u201cHmmm?\u201d Lacey said, moving her foot out and planting her toes on the ground like she was crushing a cig. She moved her ankle around, but she couldn\u2019t see anything on her foot. Placing her foot back down, she waited a second\u2026even going so far as to lean in closer for another peek at her exposed skin\u2026but nothing was there. At least, not anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuh!\u201d you cried out as your tumble into the dark depths of Lacey\u2019s shoe finally ended with you wedged between the unyielding fabric and her formidable foot. Pounding against the wall of cool flesh, you could feel the shifting of Lacey\u2019s heel bone under the thin layer of skin and muscle. It was your worst fear. Surrounded by dark canvas and flesh, all you could think of was Lacey feeling you and twitching\u2026all that would be left of you would be a red smear. Your chest began to feel tight and the panic was starting to set in. You tried desperately to pull your legs free, but only managed to confirm that you were stuck firmly thanks to the curve of Lacey\u2019s heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWEIRD\u2026\u201d Lacey\u2019s voice thundered as the world began to shift around you again\u2026Lacey\u2019s voice was louder, closer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and began to scream at the top of your lungs, \u201cL-Lacey! Down here! Please, I\u2019m the one you\u2019re supposed to interview! I\u2019m down here! I-I fell in your shoe! Help me! Please, save me damn it! S-Save me!\u201d The world began to shift as you realized Lacey was lowering her heel; the pressure on your legs began to dissipate quickly, leaving you with room to move\u2026 There was something about skin and cloth contact though\u2026not a lot of friction. It started with one jerk, then a second, then you were in free fall! Your ass slammed into the spongy ground\u2026then a moment later, there was a massive weight that fell down on you\u2026 \u201cLacey! N-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Lacey sighed and flexed her bare toes in her converse as she planted both feet firmly on the floor. Still no word from her manager. Still alone in this room. Any longer and she was just going to leave\u2026it didn\u2019t leave a good taste in her mouth, but this was ridiculous. Unknown to Lacey though, the person she\u2019d been waiting for was closer to her than she knew\u2026in fact, what Lacey thought might have been a little pebble in her shoe was actually\u2026well\u2026you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d have screamed; you certainly wanted to. The fall had been terrifying and the pressure on your body made you feel like you were going to pop at any second. Anyone would have wanted to scream out at this point, to beg for mercy, or help, or at least a swift death. There was just one problem\u2026your mouth was stuck open\u2026filled with flesh from the bottom of Lacey\u2019s somewhat sweaty heel. Your tongue was forced to play along her sole, you could taste the somewhat salty grime on the bottom of her foot; to make matters worse, you had basically been forced to suck on one of the ridges that would have made up her footprint thanks to your size. Essentially, without even realizing it, Lacey had made you her foot\u2019s little bitch. You were face-up, buried in her flesh, and unable to do anything but lick at the bottom of her foot whenever you opened your mouth\u2026 Tears began to form in your eyes as you realized that even an ant would have been afforded more dignity. At least an ant would have been crushed in your situation\u2026you were small enough that the worn-down imprint of Lacey\u2019s heel still provided enough bounce to keep you from getting crushed. Just barely. If you didn\u2019t find a way out from under Lacey\u2019s heel though, there was no way your luck would continue to be this good. The only question was\u2026how do you get out from under a mountainous heel? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHIS IS RIDICULOUS, I\u2019M JUST WASTING MY TIME HERE,\u201d Lacey said, pushing away from the table and getting ready to stand up. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the singer\u2019s heel came down, you\u2019d tried your best to push back out of the way. You would have made it too if the damp insole hadn\u2019t stuck to your shirt where your body had been laying down. It took you scarcely more than a second to peel your shirt free from the floor of Lacey\u2019s converse, but it was more than enough to seal your fate. Your ears were filled with the sound of skin rubbing on fabric as the darkness that had surrounded you seemed to grow exponentially darker. You looked up to see the wall of pale heel barely two feet from your face\u2026before you could even scream, Lacey\u2019s foot had slammed your body into her insole and began to shift all of her body weight onto you as she pushed her chair back from the table. Her heel hit you like a semi-truck, knocking all the air out of your body. The insole had just enough give to keep your bones from breaking, but the weight on your lower stomach was making it impossible to breathe! Pressing your hands against Lacey\u2019s skin, you could feel as your fingers dug into the ridges that made of the print of her heel\u2026and the slight bit of perspiration that covered it. You pushed against the bony heel with all your might, but the weight didn\u2019t seem to lessen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, pained, \u201cP-Please! H-H-Help me! Lacey! St-\u201d The end of the sentence couldn\u2019t even leave your mouth before her weight pressed down more, squeezing the air from your lungs. Your lungs were on fire, your head splitting, and as the light began to fade, all you could remember was pounding against Lacey\u2019s heel as her voice muttered something high above, the noise cascading like thunder\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWHERE THE FUCK IS EVERYONE?!\u201d a voice thundered, snapping you back to reality. You were terrified, drentched in a cold sweat, and panting like a dog\u2026you\u2019d thought for sure that you were dead. Lacey\u2019s foot came down on you for fuck\u2019s sake! \u201cDAMN IT\u2026PHEW\u2026OK, SOMEONE WILL GET BACK TO ME EVENTUALLY,\u201d Lacey\u2019s voice boomed, closer than when her foot had come down on you. \u201cMAYBE THE STORM IS SCREWING WITH SERVICE OR SOMETHING,\u201d she chimed again, a long sigh rumbling in the air up above. The sound alone was driving you crazy, but you couldn\u2019t figure out for the life of her where Lacey was! You tried to sit up, only to feel resistance along the length of your body! For a moment, you were terrified that you might be paralyzed, but the sensation of heat along your frame helped you confirm that you hadn\u2019t been made a vegetable by her heel. While not being paralyzed was great, it didn\u2019t change the fact that you couldn\u2019t move and that you had no idea where you were. All you could see was a wall of black material in front of you; and since you couldn\u2019t move your head, you only managed to strain your eyes looking up as far as possible. For a moment, you saw nothing but the weird black all, but just when the strain was becoming too much to bear, the wall shifted backwards and you caught a glimpse of some white\u2026wait\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA lump formed in your throat as you closed your eyes for a second and tried to take another look, praying that you\u2019d just seen wrong. When your eyes opened again, a low groan escaped from your lips involuntarily. The wall was familiar\u2026especially the small crater in the middle of it. You had one of them too\u2026as did everyone on the planet. Staring at Lacey\u2019s navel, you quickly understood why her voice was so close, why the wall behind you was so warm, and why you couldn\u2019t move. At some point while you were knocked out, you must have gotten turned around\u2026and stuck to her heel like any other bit of filth that she\u2019d stepped on. To make matters worse, judging by the size of Lacey\u2019s belly-button, you\u2019d somehow gotten even smaller! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHigh above, the singer tossed her phone aside and turned on the TV, flexing her bare toes as she waited for something to catch her eye. She felt something tingle on her left heel and looked down toward her crotch. With her legs crossed on the couch, Lacey looked at her heel, but couldn\u2019t see anything visibly wrong (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Lacey-Mosley-Feet-3278605.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Lacey-Mosley-F...</a>). Shrugging, the giantess reached down and scratched around where she\u2019d felt the itch, thinking that would be the end of it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHelp! F-For fuck\u2019s sake, Lacey, please help me!\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs as the singer\u2019s fingernail came racing toward your body! You knew you must have gotten smaller because the nail of her finger along looked to be about as thick as you were tall\u2026was it getting\u2026bigger?! The slight perspiration on her skin had you held firmly in place no matter how hard you tried to push off against her skin. What was worse, you almost swore you could feel the ridges you\u2019d been pressed against rubbing against you and getting thicker as you quickly shed micrometers. It seemed whatever had shrunken you in the first place still wasn\u2019t done stealing your height, but that seemed like the least of your problems as Lacey\u2019s nail raced toward you. You closed your eyes, waiting for the massive thing to ram into you!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo pain\u2026no crushing sensation like when her heel came down on you. Had Lacey\u2019s nail killed you in one swift go? When you opened your eyes, would you be seeing if you\u2019d ended up in the Good Place or not? Slowly, you let the light come back to your vision to discover that you were very much alive\u2026and strangely, thanks to that last bit of shrinking, Lacey\u2019s nails had avoided crushing your ankles and now dug into the skin just below where you hung like a family portrait on the white wall of her heel. Just as you breathed a sigh of relief, Lacey\u2019s heel seemed to shudder. A moment later, you could feel your feet touching the solid ground of Lacey\u2019s nail\u2026but the rising didn\u2019t stop. For a moment, you\u2019d thought you might be growing back, but it quickly became clear what was going on: you were an itch that Lacey had to scratch! Her nail dragged up her skin, peeling you loose with an ease that reminded you just how powerless you were against her at this size. To make matters worse, the sudden rise of her nail caused you to lose your footing\u2026you slid down the underside of Lacey\u2019s nail, and a moment later (as her nail dug in deep to a particularly itchy spot of skin), you were mashed mercilessly into the pad of her finger. By the time Lacey\u2019s digit retracted, you had been reduced to dirt under her nail\u2026and the giantess seemed none the wiser as her hand continued to rise in the air\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLacey reclined back on the couch, stretching out as she grabbed her phone one more time just to make sure she hadn\u2019t accidentally missed a message (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://scontent.fbed1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/42044283_1328555273942275_2659326320982360064_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&amp;oh=5e3434c22f1fe77cc58b4b2a742d93d5&amp;oe=5C32B4FB\" target=\"_blank\">https://scontent.fbed1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v...</a>). But, when no one answered, the blue/blonde giantess tossed her phone aside and let out an exhausted sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf no one was going to come back to the bus, I would have gotten a drink or something,\u201d Lacey groaned, trying to remember if they\u2019d restocked the bus since last time. If no one got back to her within the hour, then she was absolutely going to chew them out tomorrow when they all met to review the performance tonight. Now, Lacey just had to shake off the stress; turning on the TV, the giantess ran her hands through her hair and just worked on getting comfortable (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fa/5e/6f/fa5e6ffb673c19de2035c0ab425ce031.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fa/5e/6f/...</a>). Scratching her head a little bit, Lacey had no idea of the shrinking passenger she\u2019d just stranded in the blue and blonde jungle of her scalp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou couldn\u2019t move while crammed under Lacey\u2019s nail\u2026but this wasn\u2019t exactly the way you\u2019d wanted to get out from your temporary prison. The ground under you was warmer than Lacey\u2019s heel, but maybe a bit cooler than her fingertips\u2026one thing was certain though, after a whole concert and beaming lights beating down for several hours on stage, the forest of blonde and blue stalks felt like a tropical forest! You struggled to get your footing in the dense undergrowth as the mix of natural oils, sweat, and silky hair continually threatened to knock you flat on your ass. The ground suddenly shifted under your feet and you found yourself falling backwards\u2026until the thick brush of blue and blonde hair supported your weight. It felt like you\u2019d been in the middle of a corn maze and tripped against one of the walls\u2026it bent, but there was enough resistance to keep you from slamming stupidly onto your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first thing you noticed as your body hit the ground was the sheer amount of heat Lacey\u2019s skin was still giving off. After baking under the lights and giving a killer performance for hours on end, the giantess\u2019 scalp wasn\u2019t only slick with the remnants of sweat, but heavy with humidity. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d swear that you were in the tropics of some unexplored island. The second thing you noticed was the sheer girth of each strand of blue and pale hair that surrounded you and prevented you from seeing more than a few steps in any given direction. Something was wrong\u2026something was terribly wrong here! You\u2019d been small enough before to use her treads as handholds and footholds, but now even the width of Lacey\u2019s hair seemed to be about the same as the width of your arm. It didn\u2019t make sense unless Lacey had either grown\u2026or\u2026you\u2026. A sudden wave of nausea washed over you as you looked around, desperate to disprove the thought that had popped into your head. Placing your foot down next to the base of one of the strands you\u2019d just fallen against and watched for any change. Your eyes went wide as you noticed the hair seemed to be moving; it was slow, but the blonde root was absolutely growing thicker as the seconds ticked by. No\u2026that was wrong. \u201cI-I\u2019m still shrinking?!\u201d you whimpered, terrified at what that meant for you. If you were just an any before, how long would it be until you were the size of a lice clinging to Lacey\u2019s scalp?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOOOOOH~ I DIDN\u2019T KNOW WE RECORDED THIS,\u201d Lacey\u2019s voice thundered from behind you as she finally found something on the bus\u2019s TV that piqued her interest. She leaned back into the couch a little more and felt a tired chill run through her body. After the day she had, just getting to cool off in the bus was a luxury in and of itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tremor finally stopped as Lacey settled down once more. You let go of the stalks of hair you\u2019d nabbed hold of, noting how they seemed to have gotten a bit bigger when your heartrate spiked. Now wasn\u2019t the time to think about that though; if Lacey\u2019s voice had appeared directly behind you, then that meant you knew where her face was. If you knew where her face was, then you could find one of her ears. \u201cAnd, if I can find an ear, I might actually get noticed,\u201d you exhaled, running through your new plan a few times along with some alternatives. Yanking on her hair might get you noticed, but if she tried to scratch you off, then that could be a disaster like with her foot! Right now, it looked like you\u2019d have to climb down her hair in order to reach Lacey\u2019s ear\u2026you just hoped that by the time you got to it, that a single hair could still fit in your grasp. Pushing through the thickening forest, you had no idea how much distance separated you from your goal, but waiting to shrink more would just make the journey harder. Without the luxury to wait things out, all you could do was force a path to the side of Lacey\u2019s head\u2026. Unfortunately for you though, the more hairs you pushed out of your way to clear your path, the more of a presence you created on the sweaty scalp of the exhausted giantess. It was like picking your way through a minefield, never sure of what hairs might trigger the nerves just below the pale fleshy floor. You\u2019d done fairly well avoiding them, but with how your luck had gone today, you should have known it couldn\u2019t last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe ground under you shifted once more as Lacey groaned, \u201cI DON\u2019T WANNA SHOWER YET THOUGH\u2026\u201d For a moment, that phrase was a mystery to you\u2026until a dark shadow fell across the forest. Looking up, you saw one of Lacey\u2019s fingers aiming in your direction once more. Apparently, you\u2019d tickled the giantess more than you thought, and Lacey had mistaken you for a tiny itch that resulted from her sweaty hair finally starting to dry. You took off running for your life as the digit (which now looked even larger than when you\u2019d gotten stuck under her nail) began to descend to dish out the divine judgement of Lacey Strum....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was the feeling she\u2019d been craving; a chill ran down Kehlani\u2019s spine as she watched her fucking cheat of a dealer staring back at her dumbfounded. \u201cWell Chels? Something you wanna say to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What\u2026What the fuck is WRONG with you?!\u201d Chelsea screamed, her vision going red as Sarah pulled on her arm desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite brunette was in tears as she clung tightly to her friend\u2019s arm, \u201cPlease Chelsea! S-Stop! Yelling isn\u2019t going to make this better!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter?!\u201d Chelsea roared, turning on her friend, \u201cYou wanna tell me how the hell this could get any fucking worse?!\u201d The punk, tattooed, redhead was a flaming ball of anger that was ready to explode at any second. Or at least, she was until Kehlani chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH,\u201d her voice boomed, threatening to burst Chelsea\u2019s and Sarah\u2019s eardrums, \u201cYOU THINK THAT THIS IS ALL I\u2019M GONNA DO WITH YOU, BITCH? NO, NO, NO\u2026WE\u2019RE JUST GETTING STARTED\u2026\u201d Chelsea felt the white-hot anger in her stomach quickly cool as she turned to look at Kehlani. Well, not quite at Kehlani\u2026Chelsea felt a third rush of adrenaline pump in her veins as the dealer stared at the wall of black rubber\u2026the five tan, rounded structures that cast long shadows\u2026and the absolute forest of moss-green fur stalks that created a mane to crown the structures. Swallowing nervously, Chelsea still had trouble accepting the reality before her\u2026that she and Sarah had been shrunken down to the size of insignificant ants before the titanic, sandal-clad feet of her client (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Kehlani-Parrish-Feet-2764813.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Kehlani-Parris...</a>)\u2026. \u201cHEH\u2026YOUR FRIEND LOOKS LIKE SHE\u2019S GONNA PISS HERSELF, CHELS~ YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HER BEING MY BIGGEST FAN? NOT SO BIG NOW, ARE YOU?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea felt some of the fire return as Kehlani mocked her friend, \u201cHey! People are going to notice if we\u2019re gone! They\u2019ll find us eventually! S-So, you better let us go!\u201d Sarah looked at her friend like she was crazy. To be fair, picking a fight with a woman whose pinkie toe alone dwarfed them was not going to go down as the smartest move in History. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU\u2019RE NOT VERY SMART, ARE YA CHELS? WHO\u2019S GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR TWO BUGS? THIS ISN\u2019T THE FIRST TIME I\u2019VE DONE THIS\u2026YOU\u2019LL BE REPORTED AS TWO MISSING \u2018PEOPLE\u2019 NOT TWO MISSING PETS\u2026OOPS\u2026I MEAN PESTS\u2026\u201d Kehlani purred, her voice dripping with venom. \u201cTHIS IS WHY I TOLD YOU NOT TO TRY AND CHEAT ME WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT FROM YOU CHELSEA\u2026AND YOU JUST HAD TO BE A GREEDY LITTLE CUNT AND TRY TO PASS OFF THIS WEAK ASS CRAP TO ME\u2026 BIG MISTAKE\u2026\u201d Kehlani had been sitting on the couch, looking down at the two young women who she\u2019d invited inside. Next to the couch was a small table\u2026and with a swipe of her hand, Kehlani sent a massive plastic bag of weed tumbling down; Sarah and Chels split up, running in different directions to avoid the green meteor hurtling at them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChels pushed herself up off the floor and turned to see the baggie she\u2019d given Kehlani last week\u2026she thought that the rapper had gone through the thing a little too quickly when she\u2019d gotten the call for today. Now she knew why her client was so insistent that she come. Swallowing nervously, Chels\u2019 eyes examined the bag and saw exactly what had the tan titaness so upset\u2026this was shit quality weed\u2026the imperfections were clear to anyone with two eyes\u2026and if they missed it, then smoking would have given them a hint that they might as well be rolling basil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL?\u201d Kehlani asked menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It was one time! My supplier had a shit week and this was all I got! Look at the shit I brought you today, it\u2019s WAY better than what I normally have!\u201d Chels shouted, hoping to earn some brownie points. Those hopes faded when she saw no smile curling across Kehlani\u2019s lip\u2026and a chill ran down her spine when she noticed the giantess\u2019 eyes slowly transition to her friend. \u201cS-Sarah! Run!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUH UH UH, NO ONE GETS TO LEAVE UNLESS I SAY SO~\u201d Kehlani purred, smirking down at the tiny brunette before her sandals. \u201cCOME UP HERE LITTLE THING, IF YOU\u2019RE REALLY MY FAN THEN THIS SHOULD BE A FUCKING DREAM-COME-TRUE,\u201d the giantess chuckled as she extended her hand down to scoop up the tiny bug that was now running away from her. Sarah\u2019s attempt to flee only made Kehlani scoff as she leaned over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her shoulder, Sarah saw the most terrifying scene of her life\u2026the giant woman\u2019s tan hand was reaching for her\u2026the black nails looked just like talons\u2026and Kehlani looked almost bored with the situation (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/30/f4/ae/30f4ae0e7beb849fab860b072fdd90a2--kehlani-parrish-toronto.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/30/f4/ae/30f4a...</a>). Sarah was fighting for her life with everything she had\u2026and it was all rendered useless as Kehlani\u2019s nails struck the ground on all sides creating a cage of enclosing fingers\u2026 Sarah screamed at the top of her lungs as she was scooped up and found herself in the underside of a long fingernail lifting into the air. \u201cP-Please! Just turn me big again! I-I\u2019m really a huge fan! I-I mean it! Please don\u2019t h-h-hurt me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHURT YOU?\u201d Kehlani asked, looking almost surprised. \u201cBITCH, CALM YOUR ASS. IF I WANTED TO HURT YOU, YOU\u2019D BE A FUCKING STAIN RIGHT NOW\u2026I\u2019M TRYIN\u2019 TO GIVE YOU SOME FACE TIME. THAT\u2019S WHY YOU CAME WITH CHELS RIGHT? FOR A LITTLE FACETIME WITH ME?\u201d The giantess smirked and lifted her hand, cradling the little thing in her nail while Chelsea screamed from down below, trying her best to dissuade the giant woman from grabbing hold of Sarah. That went over about as well as one would suspect. Kehlani paid about as much attention to Chelsea\u2019s protests as she would to a real ant yelling at her\u2026there\u2019d be time to acknowledge Chelsea, but for now the giantess\u2019 attention was focused on Sarah. Lifting her finger to eye-level, Kehlani took her time examining the quivering brunette clinging to the fingernail. \u201cDAMN\u2026YOU\u2019RE SO TINY I CAN\u2019T EVEN FEEL YOU! SHIT, I BET I\u2019VE GOTTA BE FUCKIN\u2019 HUGE FROM YOUR ANGLE,\u201d she said, smirking wickedly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The little red-head was trying her best to get her friend\u2019s attention, to try and tell Sarah what the brunette could not see from her perspective. Sitting in the curve of Kehlani\u2019s fingernail, Sarah had no way of seeing Kehlani\u2019s other hand was pressing on her lip teasingly (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3c/a1/5c/3ca15c8571480da2a2f675921ce6917a--kehlani-parrish-tsunami.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3c/a1/5c/3ca15...</a>).

IT\u2019S ITCHY LIKE CRAZY TODAY,\u201d Kehlani said, moving a very energetic Sarah under her right nostril while Chelsea scream futilely from below (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/44/d9/67/44d9671d170498d1b7dda086ff4d822e--tsunami.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/44/d9/67/44d96...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Can you lift me a little higher? O-Or tilt your head back, it\u2019s hard to see,\u201d Sarah said, climbing onto the fleshy tip of Kehlani\u2019s finger from the underside of her fingernail and craning her neck up to see into the dark cavern. Her eyes went wide as she saw the tunnel disappear into pure inky blackness\u2026further up were nearly endless stalks of hair that spread out like tree roots that had broken through the rock of a cavern from above. Clinging to the countless tiny hairs was a shiny, clear liquid that Sarah knew was mucus. She swallowed nervously, not wanting to get much closer if she could help it. The massive structure overhead slowly began to tilt back as a blast of warm air came down from above, threatening for a moment to blow her off the nail\u2026. \u201cK-Kehlani?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDON\u2019T LOSE YOUR SHIT BITCH, I WAS JUST LAUGHING A LITTLE\u2026\u201d the giantess replied, her voice echoing overhead in the fleshy, brown cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah could feel her ears ringing from the blast of sound, but did her best to keep friendly with the titaness. \u201cOh..S-Something funny happen?\u201d She asked, feeling another warm gust of wind blow down on her as Kehlani exhaled through her nose. Something thick and wet smacked her in the top of the head, almost knocking her off the digit. Something thick and warm was running down Sarah\u2019s back; the tiny woman whimpered and slowly reached up only to feel her hand sink into a thick, warm, sticky liquid\u2026pulling her hand back, she saw a strand of mucus the thickness of her arm connecting her right hand to her head. \u201cEeeeew! Ew, ew, ew, ew! G-Gross! So fucking gross!\u201d Sarah screamed, trying her best to get the goo out of her hair as Kehlani just chuckled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSOMETHING WRONG DOWN THERE? YOU FIND THE PROBLEM YET?\u201d Kehlani asked, moving her finger back ever-so-slightly and breaking out into the biggest smile when she saw Sarah already struggling with just a bit of mucus in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea screamed at the top of her lungs, \u201cSarah! Get the fuck out of there!\u201d Her heart was hammering in her chest! This giant bitch was messing with Sarah and her stupid, terrified friend was fucking walking right into it! \u201cSarah! For fuck\u2019s sake just jump! She\u2019s a fucking crazy bitch, get off of her finger!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Help, please?\u201d Sarah asked, shivering as she fought the urge to throw up. \u201cT-There\u2019s n-no problem Miss!\u2026Y-your nose dripped on me a little is all\u2026i-it\u2019s not that bad!\u201d Sarah didn\u2019t know why, but something in the pit of her stomach said that she needed to finish this job as quickly as possible\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAWWWWWWW~ SORRY LITTLE THING, DIDN\u2019T MEAN TO DO THAT TO YOU YET, HANG ON\u2026\u201d Kehlani said as she slowly shifted her head and rubbed her nose off on her arm to keep any more mucus from falling down on the tiny woman balancing on her finger (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/d7/74/2ed77448223e5af29202d5527065e5c3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/d7/74/...</a>). The giantess giggled as she moved her head away from her arm and saw the terrified look on Sarah\u2019s face. \u201cWHAT\u2019S WRONG?\u201d she asked, coking her head to the side a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah swallowed nervously and stammered, \u201cW-W-What did y-you mean by\u2026Y-You said it w-w-wasn\u2019t t-t-time yet\u2026T-T-T-Time f-f-for what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKehlani looked shocked for a moment before she began to giggle uncontrollably, drowning out Chelsea\u2019s screaming from the floor. \u201cDID I SAY THAT?\u201d she asked, biting on her lower lip playfully. \u201cI DIDN\u2019T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING BY THAT\u2026\u201d Kehlani said, slowly moving her hand back toward her face. A shivering Sarah soon found herself staring up Kehlani\u2019s nose as the giantess cooed, \u201cJUST THIS~\u201d Sarah\u2019s eyes went wide as the tunnel above her slowly began to flare and open wider\u2026another warm gust of air blasting her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait! H-Hang on, please! I-I don\u2019t know what I did wrong, b-but we can talk about this!\u201d Sarah shouted up at the giantess only to see Kehlani\u2019s other hand rising. Terrified at what the giantess has in mind, Sarah turned and tried to run only to find herself on the very front edge of Kehlani\u2019s fingernail with a thousand-foot drop below! A chill ran down Sarah\u2019s spine as the tiny woman slowly turned and saw the pointer-finger from Kehlani\u2019s free hand extend and start moving toward the opposite nostril from the one she was under. \u201cNo! Please! Y-You can\u2019t do t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was deafened by the sudden explosion of activity around her as she found herself rocketing upwards faster than she could comprehend! The stalks zipped past, some leaving bright red lines and lashes across her skin like the cracks of countless whips! She wanted to scream only to find her lungs burning as all the air in them had been sucked clean out by whatever was lifting her higher\u2026higher\u2026higher\u2026the darkness quickly surrounded her as the tiny thing slammed into a wall and a thick coating of sticky liquid that was quickly flowing down. Her eyes bugged out and she opened her mouth to scream, only taking the thick slog into her mouth instead\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKehlani laughed as she released the hold on her left nostril and shook her head a bit, a chill running down her body (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/bd/7c/95bd7cb758f97394168a6be532d231a0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/bd/7c/...</a>). \u201cDAMN! I SHOULDA DONE THAT MONTHS AGO!\u201d she said, laughing and brushing her fingers across her nose as she sniffled a little, feeling the sting somewhere in the back of her head before slowly looking down to see a stunned Chelsea at her feet. There was a deep burning from the back of her nasal cavity and Kehlani could have sworn she felt something small wiggling there. A warm rush ran through her body, drawing a small moan from the giantess\u2019 lips that brought a blush to her cheeks. For all the times she\u2019d shrunken down little shits like Chelsea and her friend, this felt different\u2026just a sniffle and she\u2019d taken a person\u2019s life. Even bugs in her bus had a more deliberate method of execution. They were at least worth her attention\u2026. Still wiping her nose, Kehlani giggled, \u201cOOPS\u2026SORRY, THAT WAS YOUR FRIEND RIGHT?\u201d she cooed (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/06/a8/0906a84ecf1f37b4d342ae3790e11936.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/06/a8/...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChelsea fell to her knees, grabbed her stomach, and keeled over, retching\u2026her best friend in the world had just been snorted by the giant monster looming overhead\u2026. She\u2019d gotten Sarah killed\u2026a thousand thoughts screamed in Chelsea\u2019s head as she looked back up at Kehlani and was overtaken by nausea\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDON\u2019T WORRY,\u201d Kehlani purred, \u201cHOW ABOUT THIS?

Without breaking her stride, the musician walked right to the edge of the road, reached out a hand\u2026and met nothing but air. Surprised, her foot hit the asphalt and Kehlani found herself looking around to see literally no car even coming her way. \u201cThe hell? Why\u2019d he fucking text me then?\u201d she asked, checking her phone again as she slightly squatted down (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/56/ee/0c56ee88557dd1689056d36875542f7b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/56/ee/...</a>). Rolling backwards on her heels, Kehlani\u2019s ass met the curb as she began texting the driver, wondering where the hell her manager had found this person. \u201cFirst tells me to come to a meet-and-greet I don\u2019t know about\u2026then hires this bitch-ass driver who didn\u2019t even show up\u2026\u201d she muttered as she sent a third text to the driver asking him if he was close or had the right address. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Kehlani didn\u2019t know was that her driver had already arrived\u2026in fact, you\u2019d been there for the last 10 minutes waiting for the musician to come out. About a minute before Kehlani left her front door, you were getting the destination entered into your GPS when there was a bright flash of light that managed to break through even the tinted windows of the limo! The next thing you knew, the sky was falling\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d honestly thought that you were dead when the black sky fell on top of you\u2026the metal of the limo had made a terrible whining sound when you were plunged into the darkness\u2026but that seemed to be the worst of it. When you were fairly certain that you hadn\u2019t died, you found that you couldn\u2019t really see anything in front of you but inky blackness. You thought it would be a good idea to turn on the headlights. You thought wrong. As the light flared to life, you watched the beam shoot forward until it suddenly disappeared around a corner\u2026somehow, somewhere, you\u2019d managed to get the limousine stuck in seemingly endless corridor. Panic began to take hold as you did the only thing you could think to do in that insane situation\u2026you began to blare on the horn with all of your might\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSon of a bitch, why isn\u2019t aren\u2019t they answering?\u201d Kehlani asked as she put down her phone after sending her fifth text message only to get silence back. She was about to get up when something caught her attention. It was a small sound\u2026something somewhat high-pitched, but it sounded close, though muffled. Looking down, it didn\u2019t take Kehlani long to realize that the weird noise was coming from under her right foot. \u201cThe fuck is this?\u201d she asked as she crossed her leg and examined the sole of her shoe (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0b/8a/85/0b8a8581d18c727265591e0864c9deed--red-tattoos-kehlani-parrish.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0b/8a/85/0b8a8...</a>). The sound had stopped, but Kehlani\u2019s dark eyes caught sight of the anomaly under her foot\u2026it was a small, dark, shiny thing stuck in the treads of her sneaker\u2019s sole\u2026 slowly, she reached forward and dug her nail into the treads to try and wrench it free\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou screamed as the airbag went off, smashing you in the face and almost knocking you out when it threw your head back. Your ears were ringing and the air around you was filled with the high-pitched whining of stressed metal! Looking out the front window, your eyes went wide as you saw something thick and dark tan in front of your car\u2026a thick, dark sheet of strange material seemed to be digging into the passage that held your car. An involuntary whine rose from your throat as the alien object began to warp the top of the limo! \u201cW-What the hell is going on?!\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs\u2026. The limo suddenly lurched\u2026and a second later you were in free fall until the vehicle found itself pressed between two new walls. Before you could begin to even identify the grooved wall that was pressing into the roof and undercarriage of the limo, you found yourself thrown to the side as the car took off like a rocket lifting off on a trip to the stratosphere\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWHAT THE HELL?\u201d Kehlani\u2019s voice thundered around you as the limo still continued to do a perpetual barrel roll between the two brown walls. You recognized the voice from the music videos you\u2019d watched of her before this job got thrown to you, but for the life of you, you could not figure out why it was so deafeningly loud\u2026at least, not until the car suddenly came to a stop. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nYour jaw fell open as you stared through the tinted windshield and saw the singer looking down at you and smirking. There was just one thing wrong\u2026instead of the petite girl you\u2019d been expecting, Kehlani looked like she was a fucking kaiju as she grinned down (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/88/c8/bd/88c8bdd88da69aeb6fd6ca7020ebd634--kehlani-parrish-tsunami.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/236x/88/c8/bd/88c8b...</a>). The dark tunnel and the brown walls pressing in on you suddenly made sense. You felt sick as the realization sunk in that somehow\u2026you\u2019d shrunken down\u2026that dark tunnel had been the treads of her sneaker, and now you were being held between her fingers like some small toy! You quickly slammed on the horn, trying to get her to take a closer look\u2026but no sound came out. \u201cOh you\u2019ve got to be kidding me!\u201d you shouted as you realized that while she was trying to scrape you out from her treads, Kehlani\u2019s nail had crushed the hood ever-so-slightly\u2026and killed your horn in the process. She didn\u2019t give you long to bemoan your fate though as you suddenly began rising toward her face at a break-taking pace!<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

FUCK, THEY TOTALLY GOT ME!\u201d Your heart sank as you realized that Kehlani apparently wasn\u2019t in on your plight. As far as the giant woman holding your limo between her fingers was concerned\u2026this was just a toy car someone dropped off as a joke\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf the horn wasn\u2019t working, then you could just roll down the window! Or at least, that was what you though until you found that the electric motor wasn\u2019t working there either\u2026. \u201cFuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!\u201d you screamed as you thought of kicking out one of the windows when you remembered being told that since this limo was used for VIP clients, the glass was extra thick. No! You weren\u2019t just going to give up! You unbuckled and turned in your seat to ram your heel into the window\u2026when suddenly you were reminded why roller-coasters always had you strapped in. Kehlani rolled the limo around absent-mindedly between her fingers like a thin pencil as she looked around to see if anyone would come out and claim their \u201ctoy\u201d limo. When no one revealed themselves, she shrugged and brought the tiny thing to eye-level for a closer examination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAWWWW\u2026DAMN, IT GOT ALL WRECKED UNDER MY FOOT\u2026\u201d her voice boomed as you found yourself laid out on the dashboard, dazed and on the verge of passing out. \u201cHEHE\u2026HELLO? ANYONE IN THERE?\u201d Kehlani asked, giggling at her own joke as the limo continued to rise\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBattered and bruised, you lifted your head from the dashboard and felt your heart jump into your throat as you came eye to giant-fucking-eye with Kehlani who was now trying her best to peer in through the tinted windshield (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.clashmusic.com/sites/default/files/field/image/Clash100%20WebsiteKehlani.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.clashmusic.com/sites/default/...</a>). For a moment, you thought that she might have actually seen you as you started waving and shouted at the massive deep-brown orb that took up your entire view. Those hopes were dashed when the massive eye suddenly rolled and the whole limo began to lower\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor her part, Kehlani was taking this \u201cjoke\u201d in stride as she examined the tiny model between her fingers. She wished someone had warned her about this a little earlier, the tiny toy was badly beat up after it ended up under her foot. Turning on the ball of her foot, Kehlani began to head back into her house as she sighed, \u201cI hope whoever left this here wasn\u2019t expecting it back in one piece\u2026fuck, I\u2019d have kept this if it wasn\u2019t this beat up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe unaware giantess found herself examining the scratches her nails had left on the roof of the tiny limo. Everything shifted and you were suddenly pressed against the windshield, looking out to see the singer\u2019s painted lips parting to reveal her bared teeth\u2026her mouth was twisted into a sneer as she examined the ugly scratches on the roof and seemed to decide that she wasn\u2019t going to hang onto this thing for long after all (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nappyafro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CRZY-Front-360x240.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nappyafro.com/wp-content/uplo...</a>). \u201cI\u2019LL ASK ABOUT THIS LATER\u2026BUUUT I GUESS THAT MEANS I\u2019VE GOT THE DAY OFF~\u201d Kehlani said as she turned on the ball of her foot and started strutting back inside\u2026. With each step Kehlani took, you found yourself flying around the interior of the car like you were a tennis ball. Suddenly, the limo was shifting under you, the nose pointing straight down as you found yourself looking down at the ground. For a split-second, you thought Kehlani was just going to drop you, discarding the limo on the walk to her front-door like a piece of trash; instead, you found yourself heading for the back pocket of her baggy jeans, ready to share some space with her tight butt (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/307722587032380018/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/30772258...</a>). The free-fall made your stomach jump into your throat, but thankfully the drop didn\u2019t last for long as the front of the limo soon was jammed between the wall of fabric and the unyielding curve of Kehlani\u2019s ass\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKehlani stretched up onto the balls of her feet as she walked in and shut the door behind her, unaware that her left cheek was currently compressing the limo you were still trapped in. She lazily kicked off her shoes and stripped off her socks, flexing her toes in the cool air of her home. Now that Kehlani figured she had an entire day to herself with no big events to go to, there was really only one thing she wanted to do today. Heading to the living room, she drew the blinds on the front window and flicked on the soft overhead lights before turning her music up. Well, not HER music per-se, she never listened to her own stuff when she smoked. Still, as the playlist began pumping through her stereo-system, Kehlani reached into her back pockets, searching for her lighter when her fingers curled around the second small, semi-cylindrical object she\u2019s shoved back there\u2026your limo. She didn\u2019t know it, but you watched her smirk and roll her eyes before she bent over and placed the \u2018toy\u2019 down on the table. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite how beat up you felt, you knew it was actually a stroke of miraculous luck that Kehlani had checked her back pockets before doing anything\u2026if even her stretching had been enough force to crunch the limo, you were sure that if she sat on you, then that would have been game over\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOM!...BABOOM!......BABOOM!......BABOOM!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like she was leaving, but you didn\u2019t know for how long. You knew one thing though, if you couldn\u2019t get out, you were screwed! Crawling along the roof of the limo, you first tried for the driver-side door. \u201cJammed,\u201d you groaned before painfully turning around only to find that the passenger-side door was stuck as well! Just as you were dragging yourself back toward the divider in hopes of getting back to the main compartment, the ground began to shake with the giantess\u2019 footfalls once more\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM!...BABOOM!...BABOOOOM!....BABOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally!\u201d Kehlani said as she crashed onto the couch and grabbed one of her papers, spreading it out next to the small toy she\u2019s retrieved from in front of her house. Thankfully, she\u2019d found her grinder with a pre-done job waiting for her. Twisting the small metal container a few more times to make sure it was nice and smooth, Kehlani undid the two halves and gently tapped them on the thin paper so the green landslide made a perfect pile in the middle of her paper. \u201cThis better be as good as she said it was\u2026bitch charged enough for it,\u201d Kehlani mused under her breath as she began spreading out the pile into a long, thin line. She was just about to start rolling when her eyes drifted back to the broken, tiny toy she\u2019d found\u2026and a small, funny idea sprang up in her mind as she reached forward for it\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d you yelled as you were thrown against the side of the limo, then against the seats as it flipped over once again. Bruised and with your eyes swimming, you looked out the windshield to once again see Kehlani smiling at you\u2026or, the \u2018toy\u2019 anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing her pointer finger up against her lips, Kehlani stared at you for a few moments of quiet contemplation before the air around you shook with her voice, booming, \u201cI DON\u2019T THINK I\u2019M GONNA FIT IN THERE FOR A RIDE TO THE CONCERT\u2026BUT I\u2019VE GOT A DIFFERENT RIDE IN MIND FOR YOU,\u201d she said, giggling as you began to descend (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cf/00/d9/cf00d98f83f15c4c7db23cec14e3d678--the-purple-purple-hair.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cf/00/d9/cf00d...</a>). The whole world seemed to shake with the sound of Kehlani\u2019s laughter as your limo suddenly crashed into a semi-solid ground. For a moment, you wondered what the hell was going on when a very familiar smell met your nose\u2026and a small avalanche of green plant bits spilled over the top of your windshield. Your heart stopped. Kehlani was about to roll your limo\u2026in her blunt\u2026to smoke it\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed at the top of your lungs and began beating on the front of the limousine\u2019s window, screaming at the top of your lungs, \u201cHey! H-Hey! Stop! I\u2019m here! T-There\u2019s a real person in here! S-Stop it!\u201d Of course she couldn\u2019t hear you\u2026she hadn\u2019t even noticed your shrunken ass in the windshield when it was held up in front of her face, there was no way she was going to hear the sound of your screams over her playlist when the car was down on the table, muffled under the ground weed. One thing was for certain, you couldn\u2019t stay there! With time running out, you planted your ass in the passenger seat, braced your heels against the windshield, pulled back, and kicked forward with all your might! There was a crack\u2026but the window was still in place, though you\u2019d felt something give\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHIT\u2026WHERE\u2019D I PUT THE FILTERS?\u201d Kehlani\u2019s voice thundered somewhere ahead of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was not on your side\u2026as soon as she got a filter in, this whole thing was going to rolled up and you\u2019d be as good as burned to a crisp. Beaten and bruised as you were, you had the strength in you for one last struggle. Drawing your legs back, you kicked a second time\u2026no movement. A third kick slammed into the windshield, changing nothing! You could feel the sweat dripping down your brow as your heart was beating a million miles an hour in your chest, desperately trying to give you whatever energy your body had left for one\u2026last\u2026kick\u2026<br>\r\nCRACK\u2026THUNK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe windshield came off in the same way a scab would\u2026slowly, and leaving an ugly scar across the front of the car. Still, it was an exit! You were drained however, and could only slowly crawl out into the literal hillside of weed whe-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white cylinder fell down in front of you, obscuring what would have been your clear-line of sight to Kehlani as the giantess\u2019 voice rang out, \u201cTHERE WE GO~\u201d You\u2019d been a second too late. Before you could even slide off the hood of the limp, your world was flipped upside down! Right before you were swallowed by a dark green, dank avalanche, you managed to scream out, \u201cKehlani! St-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the tiny life she was now cradling between her fingers, Kehlani made sure to pack her blunt tightly before lifting it to her lips for a quick few swipes of her tongue to get the paper sealed perfectly in place (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dazedprod.blob.core.windows.net/dazed-prod/1110/9/1119368.gif\" target=\"_blank\">https://dazedprod.blob.core.windows.net/...</a>). She examined her handiwork a few times and inhaled deeply through her nose, letting out a small, satisfied moan before she leaned back on the couch, propped her feet up on the coffee table, and grabbed her lighter\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had dove back into the limo just in time to keep from getting crushed under the avalanche of bud, but there wasn\u2019t time to gawk at the tons of weed that now surrounded you. Smoke had quickly begun to fill the cabin, burning your lungs, stinging your eyes, and singing the inside of your nose. Coughing, you began to claw at the green wall when a you were overtaken from behind by a cloud of smoke so thick you couldn\u2019t see your hands in front of your eyes\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm~ Shit that\u2019s good\u201d Kehlani sighed, letting the smoke escape her lips before bringing her blunt up to her mouth for another drag (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://hw-static.worldstarhiphop.com/u/pic/2016/12/hmQCagi5NOMa.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://hw-static.worldstarhiphop.com/u/p...</a>).

Seeing as she was clearly not going to be moving anytime soon far as you could tell you made a dash for her shoes, going for her heel as it was the most effective way up as well as avoided having to trek over her shoe after climbing onto it, and instead just go straight up to her ankle and then continue up her leg. Your nose crinkles as you get closer, the smell coming for the footwear telling you they were well worn and often used, probably her favourites. Still your desire to be found and not under the sole of her shoe managed to outweight your nose's complaints and you began to climb, wishing you'd done more physically intensive work before now as you were not in a good place right now and you'd only just begun. When you reached the lip of her shoe you have to grab her leg to avoid falling into the crevice, the heat and smell causing more twitches, but after a few minutes you managed to pull yourself together and continue the trek<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) You've just climbed over her ankle when she fidgets, causing you to lose your grip and slip between the side of her foot and the lip of the runner, now trapped in the humid prison of her worn sneaker, though at least you're just against the side of her foot (for now)<br>\r\n2) As you pulled yourself up Kehlani's leg she feels something itch and moves to investigate, spotting a little critter and grabbing it.</span></div></div>",

WELL SHIT\u2026WHERE THE HELL DID SHE GO?\u201d Mallika\u2019s voice blasted, threatening to burst your eardrums as though you were standing directly in front of Abnormality\u2019s speakers during the concert! Clutching your ears, you tried your best to get your feet under you as the metal music playing in this bar seemed to shake you down to your very bones. Stumbling, it wouldn\u2019t have been surprising if anyone looking at you thought you\u2019d had way too much to drink\u2026if not for one small detail\u2026. Despite having sat next to Mallika at the bar for the last twenty minutes as the metal artist got hammered, no a single person noticed when you suddenly shrank in the blink of an eye and fell onto the bar\u2019s countertop. To make matters worse, as you looked up at the giantess who\u2019s shadow engulfed you like a curtain of night, you realized that Mallika had been too busy trying to get the bartender\u2019s attention and too many drinks in to know where her fan-turned-flea had gone (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMpFBTcgNpM/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BMpFBTcgNpM/...</a>). \u201cHEY! TWO MORE!\u201d Mallika shouted, waving at the bartender as she leaned forward, her chest pressing against the bar counter like two slowly collapsing pale domes. For a moment, a small flash of hope flared in your heart\u2026Mallika apparently thought you\u2019d just gone to the bathroom or something. If the singer wasn\u2019t going anywhere for a bit, then you might be able to grab her attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, you didn\u2019t have to work that hard at it. The bartender motioned that he got the order and Mallika leaned back to plop her tight butt on the stool. Sighing, she looked around the bar one more time before her eyes drifted down to the beat-up wooden counter and the two coasters with water-marks already imbedded from the several drinks now swirling in the giantess\u2019 stomach. Her dark eyes lingered on the circle for a moment before a bit of movement drew their attention. You felt Mallika\u2019s gaze fall on you, but as you looked up hopefully, you saw that there was a problem. The giant woman smirked and slowly began to lift a hand\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrieked as Mallika slapped the table and just barely missed you thanks to the growing buzz she had going on. Laid out on your back and in a puddle of your own piss, you saw that you\u2019d ended up between the giantess\u2019 fingers as she giggled up above, \u201cYOU\u2019RE A PRETTY FAST LITTLE BUG, AIN\u2019T YA?....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mallika! Stop! It\u2019s me! P-P-Please!\u201d you sobbed, waving one arm weakly as you tried to stand up only to fall back on your ass in the puddle. The ground around you began to rumble when the massive pale walls began to drag backwards. Was she going for another slap?! You whimpered weakly and tried to crawl away when the wooden floor groaned and the fleshy walls pressed harder to the counter-top. A brief moment of confusion fell over you until your gaze shifted from Mallika\u2019s fingers up to the giantess\u2019 face. Your would-be executioner furrowed her brow and leaned in while she apparently tried to figure out what insect she\u2019d almost smushed. Terrified as you were, you prayed that Mallika could focus on you long enough to figure out it wasn\u2019t a bug before the webbing of her fingers. \u201cH-Hey!\u201d you shouted up one more time, unsure if your voice could even be heard with the blasting music. Mallika\u2019s dark eyes narrowed as she leaned down closer\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallika could feel her lip curling a bit as she leaned her head in closer toward her right hand and the tiny insect that had gotten super lucky a moment ago. Gritty as this bar was, Mallika normally didn\u2019t see bugs or other shit on the bar with how anal Kenny was about his work station. She couldn\u2019t explain it, but something made her want to lean in closer\u2026where had she seen that color before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a bar normally smelled of beer, the hot wind buffeting you smelled like it came straight from inside a barrel! You\u2019d known Mallika had been drinking already when you\u2019d gotten enough courage to sit next to her, but the thick scent of liquor and beer on her breath threatened to knock you out. It was like you could get drunk on the air itself as the giantess leaned in. Every cell in your body was begging you to run as the sneering giantess leaned in closer and gave you a frightening view of just how tiny you were. Even with her lips curled into a confused sneer, there was more than enough room to let you slide into the slick, warm cavern of Mallika\u2019s mouth\u2026. \u201cM-Mallika,\u201d you whimpered, trying to keep still as the dark eyes struggled to focus on your form. Everywhere you looked was just more Mallika! The metal singer had become your whole world as her nostrils flared, her nose ring caught a light from overhead and shimmered blindingly, her eyes slowly blinked and seemed to be swimming, and her mouth continued to exude the reeking smell of a brewery (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pictame.com/media/1782082233042457828_4118909890\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pictame.com/media/1782082233...</a>). \u201cP-Please! Mallika it\u2019s me! Come on! P-Please notice!\u201d you shouted, unaware that your voice hadn\u2019t even come close to reaching your unknowing goddess\u2019 ears. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a pair of long black socks and the shoes she was wearing were a pair of black trainers that looked very worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said goodbye to the person and started walking in your direction, so you quickly hid back under the seat.

You had brought the stupid thing only because your friend told you it might keep you safe; the moron never said anything about how to turn it off! You hadn\u2019t even known that clicking it would turn it on, but the buzzing sound was the same you had heard when she had given you the explanation you were only half-paying attention to. Now you wished you had been more attentive. As panic began to set in on you, the exact function of the damn pen had slipped your mind; but you remembered being on the receiving end of it wasn\u2019t a good place to be! You counted down in your head, as the buzzing grew louder. Three seconds left to find some cover! Looking around, you were brokenhearted\u2026the interior of the tour bus provided no such cover. Turning around, you looked at the metallic cylinder on the ground and cursed under your breath at what you knew was going to happen next\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tZAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA small beam of light struck you in the leg as you felt an almost electric surge go up your body. Your mind went fuzzy as you blacked out, slamming into the floor as the glimmer of silver burned itself into your memory\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBANG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour eyes shot open as a wave of wind sent you spiraling forward. Landing once again on the hard floor of the bus, you couldn\u2019t tell if your head was spinning from the pen, or the odd hurricane you just experienced. As you tried to get the world to stop moving, you tried to get a grip on where you were. Looking around made you nauseas, but you couldn\u2019t help it as the alien world around you began to come into focus. For a brief moment, you were terribly confused, it seemed like while you were knocked out someone had moved you into a replica of the bus\u2026one made on a much larger scale. Trying to steady yourself, you slowly turned around to see where the wind wall had come from. Your brain began to hurt as all you saw was a purple pillar flanked by walls of light\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove it guys, I want the hell out of here yesterday!\u201d Rena yelled as she turned and shouted down the stairs of the tour bus at her fellow band members. The young rock-star was clueless that a shrunken fan of hers was now perilously close to being crushed down between her massive sneakers like a bug (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cherribombofficial.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10360395_4291881192142_5482415442959402784_n.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cherribombofficial.com/wp-con...</a>).You began to remember what your friend had told you that pen did\u2026size reduction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground under you shook like Jell-O as the other members of Cherri Bomb began to climb the stairs. In just a few seconds, you were surrounded by not just one giantess\u2026but four (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/les%20goupes/C/Cherri%20Bomb/pics/7bcf_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/les%20gou...</a>). Now your body finally began to get into it as you began to run away from the collection of giantesses\u2026only to have yet another barrier fall down before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shockwave from Julia\u2019s foot landing knocked you over once again as you were left staring up at the girl in terror, unsure of how to escape from someone whose very footsteps brought you to your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s up your ass?\u201d Julia said as she began to walk away, her massive feet sending shivers up your spine as you saw them press into the ground. Her bare-skin could be seen as her well-worn Toms slammed into the ground unremorsefully. As the raven-haired giantess walked away from the pantheon positioned above you, the others seemed to follow suit, except for the original giantess, Rena, who still towered above you menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing is up my ass!\u201d Rena yelled, stomping her foot in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis time you couldn\u2019t avoid it as the massive foot landed on top of you. Screaming, you tried to get away, but instead found yourself trapped in a maze of rubber walls\u2026the inside of her tread. Things got intense quickly as Rena swiveled, launching you sideways\u2026into a thing of mud that was trapped in there as well. Groaning, you tried to pry yourself off as Rena began to walk away from Julia in a huff. As her foot slammed back down once more, you became unstuck from the mud and fell onto the floor, freed just in time to see that it was now Nia standing over you. Trapped between her massive boots, you looked up the long legs of the drummer as she looked back and forth between Rena and Julia with amusement (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://data1.whicdn.com/images/46211254/large.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://data1.whicdn.com/images/46211254/...</a>).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLeave her alone Julia, she\u2019s just pissed because her secret admirer never showed up!\u201d Nia cooed as she began to take off the vest she\u2019d been wearing all day for this concert (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.clashmusic.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_feature/public/legacy/files/TITP2011-Sunday-2058.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.clashmusic.com/sites/default/...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSecret admirer?

She had no idea that her admirer was actually running away from her sister\u2019s massive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou were clouded in darkness as the vest discarded by Nia fully covered you. Confused, you began wandering around in the darkness as Miranda sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNia, don\u2019t just leave your crap lying around,\u201d she said as she reached for the vest. Grabbing it, Miranda paused as she saw\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as Miranda\u2019s thumb hovered over one, Julia decided to open her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShit, if you aren\u2019t going to clean then why are you even here?\u201d Julia joked as Miranda shoved the pen in her pocket.

Rolling over, you looked around. It was still pitch-black all around you in the cloth cavern. Nia\u2019s vest was like a cave system, and if you didn\u2019t know the way out before, you certainly couldn\u2019t now. Slowly, you picked a direction and began walking towards it, arms outreached to find a wall. As your hands suddenly pressed into the thick, unyielding fabric of Nia\u2019s vest, you slowly began to walk along it, hoping that it would work out like the mazes you had gone through as a kid. It was almost nauseating how afraid you were as you began following the twists and turns of the vest maze. Your fingers gently pressed against the thick threads, it was mind-boggling that you had actually been made this small\u2026. Everything moved so quickly before that you hadn\u2019t really gotten a chance to have things sink in, but now in the still darkness with your hand on thick, rope-sized threads it was finally dawning on you\u2026. you were really tiny here. Maybe only as big as an ant, if that! You stopped for a second to breathe; you\u2019d been running around uselessly in circles it seemed. As you held onto the vest-wall, you noticed something deeply concerning. It was slow, but you could feel the thread in your grasp getting bigger; you were still shrinking! Now you were almost hyperventilating as you thought about the consequences of this when you finally caught some good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShit, where\u2019s the pick\u2026.here!\u201d Julia\u2019s voice echoed within your threaded thoroughfare as she struggled with her guitar on the couch.   As she lay back on the couch, Julia took a first strum of the guitar for tuning. The sound was awful and out of pitch. Groaning, Julia placed the pick down and began trying to get her instrument back in tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs for you, the discordant strum was music to your ears. Turning towards the sound, you finally got your break. Following the strums that came out in short bursts, you began lifting up the fabric walls, barreling through as quickly as possible before your musical compass was gone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe light was suddenly blinding as you found yourself covering your eyes, shielding them as the initial sting started to slowly fade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShit!\u201d you screamed as you suddenly were sent flying head-over-heels backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUgh, this is fucking awful!\u201d Julia\u2019s voice echoed above, nearly making you deaf as you cringed and finally looked up. For a moment, all you saw was a pale wall marked with crisscrossing lines. You saw the wall slowly begin to lift. Following it up into the air, you almost swallowed your tongue in shock as you saw the tremendous form of Julia working hard on her guitar (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/32100000/-Julia-Pierce-rock-guitar-legends-32151615-400-483.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/3...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d you said reflexively as you stared up at the skyscraper-sized musician. Your heart began to hammer in fear as the shadow of her hand now engulfed you\u2026it was coming down on you! Charging ahead, you hoped to get out from under Julia\u2019s hand in time as it began to descend on you. Looking up as you sprinted across the couch, you could see the dark wrinkles of the palm of Julia\u2019s palm, each one big enough to swallow you easily. Taking a deep breath, you put out an extra burst of speed and sprinted with all your might, the roar of air getting louder as Julia\u2019s hand was now mere inches from landing. In a last-ditch effort, you leapt with all your might!.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGroaning, you were in incredible pain as you found yourself, literally, under the thumb of Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDamn it,\u201d Julia said as she slid her hand on the couch towards the pick she had placed down. Of course, this meant you were along for the ride as well. Screaming, you were dragged across the couch, the rough fabric rubbing you raw as Julia\u2019s hand moved towards her plastic pick. Within seconds, you were suddenly coming up towards the plastic monolith, the tiny pick now easily the size of a large SUV! As Julia\u2019s thumb finally lifted off the couch, you came up with it, your clothing stuck to her skin as you began to struggle in mid-air like an idiot. You tried to brace yourself as you were suddenly coming towards the clear plastic surface, arms up in front of your face. Seconds before impact, you saw your own terrified reflection in the plastic plate of the pick, and then you made contact. It was incredibly painful as you were pressed against the hard plastic. Julia\u2019s thumb threatened to break you in half as it pressed down on it, her other fingers now scrapping against the couch to get under it and pick up the pick. You felt the world tilt as Julia finally lifted the plastic piece into the air, bringing it towards her guitar once again. Gritting your teeth, you tried to brace yourself as the pick finally hit against the metal strings. You would have screamed as the extra pressure from the strings almost squashed you, but the force of Julia\u2019s finger let you only squeak like a mouse as what little air you had left was forced from your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShit!\u201d Julia said as one of the strings snapped and the pick fell from her hand to her feet (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7178/6968771924_af74fbbeba_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7178/69687...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou felt like you had just survived a plane crash as you laid still on the alien, rough surface. Rolling over, you tried to get up, but your body felt like jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFuck this!\u201d Julia\u2019s voice boomed from above as you felt the ground shutter shortly afterwards. In a few seconds, the roar of the TV echoed in your ears, her practice time had come to an end. A moment later, you felt like you were flying as the ground under you moved. Your eyes shot open as you rolled over onto your stomach, clutching the ground in fear of being thrown off your perch. Suddenly you realized, you were on Julia\u2019s shoe! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs her foot pressed into the ground, you saw the whole terrain before you flatten out. You understood that you were right in the middle of Julia\u2019s toms, but you needed to get her attention, now. Quickly, you began scurrying forwards, your legs getting caught in miniscule threads as you headed for the pale plains of flesh before you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.journeys.com/images/products/1_232941_FS.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.journeys.com/images/products/...</a>). Running now, you raised your legs high, trying to get through the canvas as Julia settled down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJulia!\u201d Nia\u2019s voice rang from across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat?!\u201d Julia shouted back, not moving as you finally made it to her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome here!!!!\u201d Nia shouted, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo way!\u201d Julia responded as she turned the volume on the TV up. The thundering cascade of noise had you cringing in fear, but you had at least made it to Julia\u2019s exposed foot. Tentatively, you began walking on her skin, your foot sinking into her flesh with each step. Looking up, you saw the giantess still engrossed in her show. This wasn\u2019t working; you needed to get her attention! You began running around and jumping on the vast sea of pale flesh, hoping that Julia would notice. A ripple of flesh knocked you over as Julia flexed her toes in her toms, knocking you over. Getting up, you tried again, making sure to avoid the wave of flesh as Julia wiggled her toes once again. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nHigh above, Julia was going nuts. Something was going on with Nia and Miranda, Rena was pouty, and her damn shoes were doing something weird. Leaning down, Julia started to reach for her foot when she froze as\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Broken instruments, feedback, lighting mishaps, and an innumerable list of further complications weighed on the minds of every artist and their support team. Sometimes though, there exist technical \u201cquirks\u201d which baffle the understanding of even the keenest mind. The equipment of Eyes Set to Kill now began to exhibit one of these unique problems\u2026 an exceedingly unique one at that. A fan was currently grappling with the consequences of this malfunction back on the steps of Alexia\u2019s bus.<br>\r\n\t\u201cFuck me!\u201d you yelled as you collapsed on the floor of your private plateau. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been working for over an hour now to get down the tremendous staircase of the tour bus. Sweat poured down your head as you took a rest in the middle of the trek from one end of the stair to the other. Looking up at the rays of sunlight entering through the window of the front door, you mused on how just a few hours ago you could have easily looked through it! It had all happened in an instant. One moment, you were dropping off a pile of fan letters in the bus\u2026the next you were looking up at the table you had just placed the envelopes down on. You still didn\u2019t quite get how it happened, but the fact remained\u2026you had been reduced to less than the size of a bug! Being on the floor was too dangerous, hence your new tactic of going down the stairs. So long as you got through this relatively soon, you\u2019d at the very least survive the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP\u2026.THUMP\u2026.THUMP\u2026.THUMP\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whirlwind blasted you onto your back as Alexia swung the door to the bus open in a hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwwwwwww! What the hell?\u201d Alexia groaned as you looked up from your prone position to see her turning around very slowly. Soon, you were cast in the shadow of her rear as she began to lower herself down\u2026right onto the seat you were on! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\u201d You screamed as you ran to the side and jumped into a long tread that had been carved into the step to help wet boots keep traction when ascending. Now it had become your private bunker as you hit the deck and curled up in the fetal position. Closing your eyes tight, you waited for the inevitable impact. The air above you roared as it was pushed away by the descending, delicate ass. It sounded like a jet was taking off over your head as Alexia\u2019s rear came down onto it. The din grew greater and greater\u2026until her ass made contact. It was standing next to the speakers in her concert\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears were ringing as you looked up to see a ceiling of denim above you, barely suspended over your tiny body (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i392.photobucket.com/albums/pp6/xXx-LOVE--H-I-M-xXx/aasisters.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i392.photobucket.com/albums/pp6/x...</a>). If the ditch had been a little more shallow, or Alexia not in as great shape, or even just in different pants\u2026you\u2019d have been a smear on her bottom by now. Slowly, you began to crawl on your belly towards the light at one end of your tunnel as Alexia fumbled around unawares above you.  As you grit your teeth and continued the crawl for freedom, ominous gurgling noises echoed from somewhere above you. Staying under such a dangerous part of Alexia wasn\u2019t good for any longer than necessary you were reminded as you redoubled your efforts to escape from the trench. The light was growing brighter as you heard a different rumbling ahead of you\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmmmmmmmMMMMMmmmmm,\u201d Alexia was busy humming one of her songs as she messed around with her phone. Finally clearing from under her ass, you could break out in a full run for the edge of the stair! Your lungs were once again burning as your shaky legs carried you closer and closer to the sheer cliff before you. Looking up every so often, you prayed that Alexia wouldn\u2019t get up before you got a chance to grab hold of her. Your mind was going a mile a minute. Her legs were close, but getting on them would definitely result in being crushed the second she got up! That didn\u2019t leave you with many options to pick from. As you reached the edge of the stair, you looked down the deep ravine to the alternative you had selected for your great escape. Swallowing hard, you looked down at the shifting, sandal-clad feet of Alexia below. You stood right at the edge and looked down, fighting off the doubts in your head as you made your way back into the trench you had crawled out of. Turning, you crouched down and took a deep breath\u2026then exploded forward. Your arms pumped powerfully as you pointed yourself forward like a dart. You felt your right foot dig into the edge of the step as you launched yourself off, now free-falling towards Alexia\u2019s titanic heel below. Pushing them forward, your arms braced themselves for the approaching wall of tan flesh\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were aching and sore\u2026but you had made it. Like a true bug, you were latched onto Alexia\u2019s heel, the first leg of your journey now thankfully behind you\u2026.or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d Alexia said as she felt something tickle her heel. Without looking down, she reached a hand down to her foot and dug her nails into her skin; scraping and scratching till she was satisfied the itch had been obliterated. Indeed it had. Her nails had knocked you clean off of her heel\u2026and down onto her sandal below. You shivered as you saw her sharp, massive nails digging into the mountain of flesh above you. Alexia\u2019s fingers could have easily ended you, but instead they had offered you to the tan mass of heel above, which now came down to devour you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were going to pop as Alexia put her foot down, her bare heel coming to rest on top of you as the giantess started to get up, her butt sore from the hard stairs she\u2019d been perched on. It felt like your body as going to break any moment, and most likely a rib or two was cracked as Alexia stood up. The bulk of her weight hadn\u2019t come down on you\u2026if it had you\u2019d have been a stain already at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giantess began to walk your weary body stuck to the bottom of her heel like pre-chewed gum on a sidewalk. You struggled to get free whenever she lifted her heel to take the next step, pushing against the great wall of flesh behind you. Slowly, you began to get the timing down for the push off. With every failure, your body was pounded into the soft bottom of her sandal, but you still refused to give up. Just as she reached the top of the stairs, you finally popped off... only to begin plummeting deeper into the sandal\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou found yourself pressed face first into Alexia\u2019s sole as your body was now pressed into the arch of her foot. The weight was thankfully much less here, but still it was unpleasant to say the least. Once again, you began trying to pry yourself free; but there was much less time here to get loose between steps, and it seemed like you\u2019d be doomed under her foot till you were finally squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlighting the steps, Alexia headed right for the couch. Crashing down on it, the musician flipped on the TV and began scrolling through her phone again. As she leaned over to the side, Alexia reached a hand down and began prying her sandals off, wanting her feet to be free up on the couch with her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/61060413@N05/6173520115/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/61060413@N...</a>). As the pressed her bare soles into the arm of the couch, she let her toes grip into the material, loving the sensation of it on her tired feet. Alexia had no idea that right now a tiny person was\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m not gonna\u2026I\u2019m not going to go out like this!\u201d you groaned as you tried your best to remove yourself from between Alexia\u2019s tremendous toes. As Alexia pressed her toes into the couch arm, you had hoped that you\u2019d just pop right off her foot, but the pressure that had almost killed you before had left you plastered to the wall like a bug to a windshield. You could feel the residue of her sweat drying on you as the air conditioning blew comfortably between her toes. The musty aroma abundant between her digits was giving you a headache as you continued trying to peel even an arm off of Alexia\u2019s foot before she moved yet again. You were not doing well to say the very least. Every time you got unstuck even a little, it tickled Alexia\u2019s foot and caused her to scrunch her toes together, plastering you to the wall of warm, soft skin yet again. Your own sweat was stinging your eyes as, after a half-hour of struggling, you\u2019d made no progress in escaping from between the titanic toes of Alexia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour first glimmer of hope at escape came when the loud yawning of Alexia trumpeted in your ears. Finally, you stopped struggling. Getting free would be a lot easier after the giantess fell asleep you figured, so you waited for the fateful moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt wasn\u2019t an easy wait either. As Alexia stretched out, her toes splayed, stretching you out painfully like you were on a medieval rack. You thought, for a moment, that your back had been broken but it was just a false alarm as Alexia\u2019s toes finally settled back together. For the next few minutes, you were stretched and squished repeatedly as Alexia shifted and twisted, struggling to get comfortable on the couch. You almost thought that you wouldn\u2019t get the chance to escape when Alexia\u2019s toes were pressing together so much that you were touching your own toes. As her toes pressed into you harder and harder, your head swelled with blood like a cherry tomato threatening to pop at any second. A faint buzzing could be heard in your ears as you began to black-out between her toes. Just as you were about to lose consciousness completely, the death-grip released and you could finally pull in the air your lungs had been craving (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://chittybentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/189850_156176857774237_5668859_n.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://chittybentertainment.com/wp-cont...</a>). You spent a few minutes just grateful to be breathing at all, even if it was the fumes of Alexia\u2019s foot. Turning your head towards her, you wondered what the hell she was up to. A wide grin spread across your face for the first time in a while, Alexia was asleep. Finally, you could start taking your time as you began peeling yourself off of Alexia\u2019s big toe. It felt like you were trying to peel a name-tag sticker off as your arm slowly began to come loose from the warm bed of Alexia\u2019s flesh. As you got your right arm back, you reached over and began digging your fingers under your left arm, trying to pry it loose as well. After a few minutes, both your arms were returned to you, just leaving your legs to free. Pressing your hands into the soft skin of Alexia, you began pushing away from her toe with all your might. Your fingers dug into the grooves of her skin as you slowly began to unpeel. Arms burning, you gave one final push and floated in air for a brief second before plummeting, landing right on the bridge of skin between Alexia\u2019s big and second toe\u2026you were free! Now you just needed to get noticed down here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGah!\u201d you shouted as you sunk a punch into Alexia\u2019s toe, hoping to get some sort of reaction from her. Nothing. Frustrated, you paced back a few steps and began running. Leaping in the air, you slammed into the toe\u2019s base and collapsed back down\u2026still not a thing. You were getting annoyed by this, when you had tried to escape earlier it seemed she could feel everything, not she was unresponsive as a rock! Leaning against her foot, you thought of a different approach as you began rubbing her big toe, thinking that maybe a longer pressure would do the trick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmmmm?\u201d Alexia moaned as she stirred in her sleep. After a few seconds, the giantess\u2019 eyes fluttered open as she stared down at her foot curiously. Quickly, you got up and began shouting, jumping, and waving while Alexia leaned forward to get a better view of her foot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alexia-Rodriguez-Feet-690050.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alexia-Rodrigue...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlexia! Down here!\u201d you called desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEeeew!\u201d Alexia whined as your world suddenly began flipping over. You were falling now, where you didn\u2019t know. It all happened it seemed in chunks. One second you were spotted, the next you were flying, now you were laying in the middle of a slip-on shoe while Alexia shakily got up and looked in your general direction, a sense of panic in her eyes. You recognized these from a concert a few days ago (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/soso-anissa-201x300.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uplo...</a>). They belonged to Anissa, and were just as foul smelling as Alexia\u2019s bare feet had been. Staggering to your feet, you began looking for a way to climb out as Alexia thundered around, her steps causing the ground to shake below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere did that bug go?! Eeeew, it was all over me while I was asleep?!\u201d Alexia said, as her eyes finally landed on you and froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlexia wait\u2026\u201d you began to say before her foot quickly kicked the flats and sent you flying. Groaning, you were now fully exposed on the floor with a disgusted Alexia now towering above you like a vengeful goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGross!\u201d she said as she lifted up her foot and let it hover over you for a second. You wanted to scream, but there wasn\u2019t enough time as Alexia\u2019s foot slammed down on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou wished you were dead. The fact that you weren\u2019t could have been viewed as a miracle, but right now it felt like a curse. Alexia\u2019s foot had fallen on you with the same weight as a building, yet you were not dead. Your ribs had been cracked and your right arm and leg were shattered, yet you weren\u2019t dead. You were in the worst pain you\u2019d ever experienced in your whole life, yet you were not dead! Alexia\u2019s sole continued pressing down on you as your face was literally stuffed into her skin. As her weight squeezed the air from your lungs, it seemed like you were going to suffocate. It felt like your lungs were on fire as you began to struggle underneath Alexia\u2019s sole, begging for air. Luckily, or maybe unluckily in this situation, Alexia lifted her foot off of you expecting to see a red smear where you once had been. When she saw that her foot had failed to kill off the \u201cbug\u201d it was hanging over you once again\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!...CRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlexia made sure to twist her foot this time as she pressed it down on the bug one more time. She could see her tri-force tattoo stretched against her skin as she ground her sole back and forth. It was like putting out a cigarette, and this time she definitely felt something crack underneath her. Slowly, Alexia lifted her foot up again; this time sure there would be a red smear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat the fuck, what is this thing made out of?!\u201d Alexia roared as she saw the bug was still wriggling around in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou were by no means fine though. The last step had broken a few ribs, but overall hadn\u2019t been too bad for you\u2026until she twisted her foot. Your tiny body was suddenly rolled roughly around over and over again. Your broken limbs were twisted painfully, and those that had been ok before were now bent at odd angles as they fractured under the might of Alexia\u2019s foot. For some reason, you still didn\u2019t pass out even with the excruciating pain you were experiencing as Alexia\u2019s foot seemed to want to roll you up like Play-Doh. When Alexi\u2019s foot finally stopped moving, you were in a bloody pulp, but still somehow alive. It wasn\u2019t like you would have lasted for long like that, but when Alexia\u2019s foot came off of you, some part of your instinct still told you to try and escape. Your tattered limbs moved futilely as your bloody body now stuck to the floor. Your senses were dulling now, the excruciating pain from before was now numb, and the world around you had gone silent. You could now barely see, but still persisted to look for a way out of this mess. Looking up through bleary, bleeding eyes, you saw that Alexia\u2019s heel was now hovering over you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOM!...SPLAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis time your body offered no resistance as the hard heel of Alexia cracked down on you. You only saw a split second of darkness and experienced a brief fraction of intense pain\u2026then you were free. Slowing it all down, it would have looked like this. Alexia\u2019s heel slowly compressed your body like it was forcing it into 2D. Your shoulders were crushed in on themselves, caving in your chest as you seemed to depress like a cardboard box being crumpled up. Next her heel came down on your head and squeezed it until it as ovular. A brief second later, it began to crack like an egg before it too collapsed into a bloody pulp. Whatever was left was quickly ground into a red paste as the weight of her heel crushed every fiber of your being in a brief moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEeeeew,\u201d Alexia whined as she saw a red splatter squirt out from under her heel. It was like she had crushed a tiny ketchup packet as she pressed down, making sure she really got the damn this this time. Sliding her heel forward, she smiled as she left a red streak. The bug was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRRRRRNNNNNMMMBLLLL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlexia jumped a little at the sound of her own stomach growling so viciously. Clutching it, she felt the first pains stab her gut as she began heading for the kitchen. Her nose carried her in as she saw there was already _______ set out for her to snack on. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLucky!\u201d Alexia chirped as she grabbed the plate of nachos and went back to the couch, flipping through the channels once more for something good to watch while she ate. Placing the plate down on the arm-rest, Alexia started flicking through channels as she grabbed her first chip. The nachos were fresh, the hot cheese stretched as Alexi slowly brought the steaming treat to her mouth and began opening her lips wide, welcoming it inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHot, hot, hot!\u201d Alexia screamed as she stuck out her tongue and got up, heading for the kitchen to grab something to drink as she dropped the chip back onto the plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Alexia was busy trying to soothe her burning tongue, the chip she had failed to finish began teeming once again with life. Secured to the chip in a fortress of cheese and beef was the small circular dome of the concert venue Alexia had performed in tonight. For some reason, the entire arena and all the fans who had been inside now found themselves too small to be noticed on a plate of nachos that seemed destined for Alexia\u2019s stomach! Some patrons had already tried to escape, only to find themselves stuck in hot cheese. Those who had managed to get past that obstacle were now where the others feared of ending up, inside Alexia\u2019s stomach. They had traveled so far on their journey just to be unlucky and end up in her first bite! As Alexia returned to the couch and collapsed with a can of Sprite in her hand, the entire stadium once again began to grown panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRRRRRNNNNMMMMMMBBBLMMMMM\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe deafening roar of Alexia\u2019s stomach shook the stadium as the giantess\u2019s massive fingers once again reached down for a chip. This time the stadium was mostly spared as Alexia picked up the chip just above theirs, but not everyone was safe. A glob of hot cheese had fallen into the stadium when Alexia had left, and several desperate fans had tried climbing up it to a different chip. Despite the burning temperature of their escape path, they figured it was better than waiting to be finished off when Alexia returned. Now, as Alexia picked up her next bite, their life-line became a death-trap! People in the arena watched helplessly as dozens of people were yanked into the air, screaming for help from their tiny comrades below. It was useless. The thick cables of cheese that had anchored them to the stadium snapped or pulled up the ground, letting them fly up into the air, until they found themselves dangling over a pit deeper and darker than anything they could imagine. They cried and stared silently as their whole world was replaced by Alexia\u2019s face and her opening mouth (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/50102614574411760/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pinterest.com/pin/50102614574...</a>). A powerful gust of wind blasted them as Alexia slowly began to lower the string of cheese they clung onto into her mouth first. It looked like they were being dropped into an ocean of darkness as Alexia\u2019s mountain-sized lips flanked them on either side. As they were submerged into the inky, humid darkness of Alexia\u2019s mouth, the crying began. People shouted and begged for mercy. They pleaded for their lives, offering anything and everything they could think of in return for safety. Every god they knew of was prayed to and begged upon\u2026but the only goddess that mattered now was Alexia\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe group that had prayed so hard for divine intervention was now a human sacrifice as Alexia\u2019s teeth ground up the chip into a thick paste, and then ushered it down to her awaiting stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDown in the stadium, people sat and watched, horrified of the show Alexia was unknowingly putting on for them. All those faces and voices from a few moments ago were now traveling down Alexia\u2019s throat in a tiny bulge, destined to end up in a sea of acid and suffer burning alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShit, these are good!\u201d Alexia said, wiping some crumbs from around her lips before taking a small sip of Sprite and reaching down for another chip. This one was thankfully far away from the stadium, but everyone still watched as the city-sized snack was lifted into the air only to disappear a second later into the darkness of Alexia\u2019s mouth. The sheer size of the objects in play made people in the stadium feel dizzy, but the real nausea kicked in every time a sickening crunch echoed from Alexia\u2019s lips or the deep thrum of her swallowing shook them to their bones. As the shadow of Alexia\u2019s hand once again swallowed the stadium, everyone looked up, expecting her fingers to select them once again and finish the job. Instead, they were barely spared as Alexia picked up a heavily loaded chip right above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone winced as the chip above them began to fracture under its own weight. A thick line of cheese was pulling the chip back down to the plate as Alexia\u2019s fingers struggled to free it from the mess (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/469218854897019727/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pinterest.com/pin/46921885489...</a>)....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSNAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople began fleeing to the inside of the stadium as their worst fear came true, the chip above them snapped and now it was raining chunks of steaming meat and sharp shards of broken chip down onto the tiny fans! Tiny fans ran as chunks of meat the size of minivans crushed several. The sharp edges of chips cut people to ribbons as it fell like glass upon them. As the other chip covered the stadium, everyone was shrouded in darkness, only hearing the moans of the injured and the deafening crunching of Alexia\u2019s jaws above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUUUUUURP! Haha, excuse me!\u201d Alexia said as she rubbed her stomach and took another swig of Sprite.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCries echoed out in the darkness as the entire stadium seemed to shift. There was a moment of stillness before everyone suddenly felt like they were on an express elevator. As the chip covering the stadium slid off, it was revealed why\u2026Alexia had selected them for her next bite. Rising into the air like they were in the Rapture, the audience of Alexia\u2019s concert was now getting uncomfortably close to her mouth. Soon their sky was replaced with Alexia\u2019s face as they began to pass her chin. Finally, the motion stopped as they hovered right outside Alexia\u2019s massive lips. Slowly, the gateway to her stomach began to open as the crowd was suddenly swimming in her humid air. People coughed and collapsed as her breath smothered them in the heavy smells of nachos and whatever other aromas had been brought up from her stomach by that belch. People trembled as they saw strands of saliva longer than the Amazon River flowing from roof to floor of Alexia\u2019s mouth. Pearly white teeth the size of whole cities shined sinisterly as Alexia\u2019s serpentine tongue twitched in the background. From deep in the confines of her stomach, the gurgling sounds of digestion floated up the dark tunnel of Alexia\u2019s esophagus to frighten all those in the stadium. Alexia\u2019s lips loomed over them as they slowly began to move towards them. The supple mountains of her lips lifted to reveal their first stop on the final trip to the afterlife, Alexia\u2019s mouth (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/art/mouth-32933818\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.deviantart.com/art/mouth-3293...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhhh,\u201d Alexia said as she slowly placed the heavily loaded chip onto her tongue. As her lips slowly closed around her fingers, the singer\u2019s tongue pressed the chip up against the roof of her mouth before flinging it onto her molars. Fingers now safely removed from her mouth, Alexia brought down her teeth onto the chip, feeling them smoosh the tender meat and cheese and crunch the tortilla. She moaned as the flavors flowed in her mouth and she began to salivate heavily, flooding hundreds of people. Fans were drowning in her spit and being smeared along her teeth with every bite, but Alexia was none the wiser. All Alexia knew was this this bite was delicious, and as she swirled it around her mouth and chewed slowly, the thick flavors seeped into her tongue. After a few more deliberate bites, the thick paste of nachos was ready. Alexia\u2019s tongue swept around her mouth collecting the debris into one large pile of paste, ready for consumption. Slowly, she tilted her head back and then\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of lives plummeted down Alexia\u2019s throat to the acidic ocean below as the singer took another swig of Sprite to wash them all down. Reclining, Alexia\u2019s tongue poked around her mouth for a second to remove any missed fragments as\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something else has to be the matter here, is everything ok?\u201d Anissa asked as you sat shivering in the confines of your circular prison. There was another similar sized room right next to yours, but you hadn\u2019t dared try to escape to the middle passage for fear of\u2026punishment from above. The smooth, tall walls provided no means of egress as you continued pacing around in vain. For the last twenty minutes you\u2019d been struggling to find a way to get out of this situation alive, and as the clock began to run down till you reached your destination, your odds grew slimmer. Shadows occasionally eclipsed you as the thunderous voices engaged in short snippets of conversation. The voice of Anissa echoed in your chamber like an approaching monsoon, and as much as you wanted to respond with a resounding \u201cNO!\u201d you knew the question was not yours to answer. It was posed instead to your new mistress, Alexia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI just don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d she responded, her voice booming loudly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell if you\u2019re not going to talk then fine. But at least do something about that thing in there,\u201d Anissa\u2019s voice echoed as you felt chill run down your spine. You were the thing in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust deal with it, I am not done with him yet\u201d Alexia responded as her massive face looked into your prison, a slight smirk on it. The only sign of happiness Alexia had shown in this whole trip had all been directed towards you, but none of it made you happy. The smile wasn\u2019t an innocent one, but one hiding devious intentions\u2026 your stomach knotted up as she looked in at you this time as well (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1602145959/alexia.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/160...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell cover the thing or something, I feel creeped out when it stares at me!\u201d Anissa protested, shooting a glare down at you that made you even more frightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine,\u201d Alexia sighed as she began moving her arm towards you. Staring up, you screamed as you realized what was happening\u2026 she was about to trap you under a soda-cup! Running around in a panic, you looked all around your circular chamber for a place of refuge, but saw only smooth walls with no cover (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://c1552172.r72.cf0.rackcdn.com/527691_x800.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://c1552172.r72.cf0.rackcdn.com/5276...</a>). Looking up, you could see the recycling instructions printed on the bottom of the cup as well as a few droplets of condensation that had already been forming on the paper surface. The cup\u2019s sweating began falling into the holder, making large puddles with each droplet as the sky was suddenly blotted out by the encroaching specter. Ducking, you closed your eyes and braced yourself as the falling cup created a small typhoon in the cup holder, forcing air out as it came close to touching down\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHappy?\u201d you heard Alexia\u2019s voice saying, muffled from above. Anissa responded with something, but you couldn\u2019t tell what as the engine of the car hummed loudly now in your enclosed capsule beneath the cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnderneath the cup, the situation was quickly devolving. It was absolute darkness down there, and as you stood up, you smacked your head into the bottom of the cup. Rubbing your aching head, you found your hair already matted down with water that was condensing on the surface of the drink. You always remembered the ring of water from where you had placed a cup down and shivered as you imagined now being stuck in there at your new size. Wandering around in total darkness though, you weren\u2019t able to find out whether or not such a watery prison awaited you in the next step or not. And so, you began to blindly crawl along under the cup\u2026afraid of what every inch would bring with it. Terrified, you kept searching for something to get your bearings on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou groaned as you ran face-first into a wall. Rubbing your nose, you felt around the wall, hoping to find some way of escape. Instead you got blind-sided by a water droplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInstantly, you were swept up in the water and confined in your floating prison, the surface tension of the droplet too great to escape as you now really began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, get him ready,\u201d Anissa said as she made a turn at a green-light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHehe, this is going to be fun,\u201d Alexia said as she picked up her cup and looked into the cupholder. Her eyes scanned the bottom of the ring only to find no trace of her toy for the day. Confused, she looked up at Anissa for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook under the cup dummy,\u201d Anissa said not taking her eyes off the road. Holding the cup up in the air, Alexia finally broke a grin as she saw her tiny toy struggling to breathe inside a small condesned drop of water under the cup. Sliding her finger around the rim of the bottom, she freed her tiny toy, bringing it up to her face as it lay soaked on her finger-tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, hello there!\u201d Alexia said as she held you up over her face. You hadn\u2019t fully recovered from almost drowning yet and felt deathly ill as you looked down from the tallest tower you\u2019d ever been on\u2026 the massive thumb of Alexia. As her tired expression began sinking back, Alexia examined you somewhat coldly, like she was looking at a bug and not a real, living person! Her eyes seemed to say it all, you had lost your humanity a while ago to her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img005.lazygirls.info/people/alexia_rodriguez/alexia_rodriguez_tumblr_m2c9tcylrd1r90qruo1_1280_edeDQet.sized.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img005.lazygirls.info/people/alex...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy do you treat it so nicely when you\u2019re just going to kill it anyway?\u201d Anissa asked as she pulled the car around a corner, looking for the entrance to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, they are fun to play with,\u201d Alexia answered as she lowered you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHide it for now, we\u2019re here,\u201d Anissa said as she turned the car off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine,\u201d Alexia sighed as she looked down at you and broke out in a weird grin again. Suddenly you weren\u2019t staring at Alexia, but your own reflection in her polished fingernail. Your mind struggled to think of what was going on as a strange sense of familiarity ached in the depths of your brain. Looking up at it, you saw it arched back the tip digging into the skin of her thumb, almost like it was trying to stop itself from moving forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour reflection body-slammed you as Alexia\u2019s finger flew forwards, flicking you off her thumb in an instant like a booger! Aching, you blacked out for a second as you made impact\u2026right against Alexia\u2019s foot. As your vision went blurry, you could hear her giggling as the ground under your suddenly came to life, making you fall slowly down the gradual slope of her foot. When your sight finally came back into focus, you saw that you were under the long, arching strap of her studded sandals\u2026and dangerously close to her toes! Looking at her tan skin, you could feel the heat of her foot under you, very different compared to your still wet clothing. The mountain of flesh you were on began to shake back and forth and up and down, causing you to begin to slide down her foot. As Alexia continued to shake her foot, you saw her smiling evilly down at you from above. Sliding slowly down her skin, you saw where she wanted you...right between her big and second toe, against the thong of her sandal (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.raggedmag.com/images/uploads/AmRagTop2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.raggedmag.com/images/uploads/...</a>). You began slowly whimpering as you realized you no longer had the strength to stop form sliding. Slowly, you felt your body begin to dip\u2026then it plummeted between her toes. Upside down now, your neck was bent at a terribly uncomfortable angle as you attempted to right yourself, but you weren\u2019t given the chance as Alexia\u2019s foot slammed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe thong of the sandal slapped against you, grinding into your back as your face was pressed directly into Alexia\u2019s skin, the slight taste of salt clinging to your lips as her sweat began to penetrate your mouth and nose. As you heard the loud clunking of the car door open, you were scorched by the blazing air and direct sunlight. A hot summer day was not the time to be stuck between a girl\u2019s toes you noticed as Alexia\u2019s foot suddenly began sweating much more than before. Now droplets fell on you as you strangely felt like you were under the cup again. As you tried to move, Alexia would take a step and grind the thong of her sandal into your back, pressing you into her foot and rubbing you raw all at the same time. You were still too exhausted to struggle, and as Alexia wiggled her powerful toes around you, your body was slowly slid under the ball of her foot. With each step Alexia took, your body was consumed more and more by her foot. The ball of her foot nearly crushed you flat as it rolled over you like construction equipment. By the time they had entered the store, you were already plastered to her arch like a piece of chewed gum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what are we getting?\u201d Anissa asked Alexia casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s go for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCan I get you anything while you wait?\u201d the waitress asked, looking back and forth between Alexia and Anissa. The two young women who sat down seemed like there was an inside joke going on. She didn\u2019t know what, but the pair was incredibly entertained by something. Even the order was given weirdly, at least by the one in sandals. She seemed to be suppressing a giggle when she ordered tacos and for the life of her, the waitress couldn\u2019t understand why. Some part of her was afraid that they were the kind of people who invented a problem in a restaurant to get free food. She made a mental note to warn her manager beforehand when she got the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re ok for now, just water when you get a chance?\u201d Anissa said, passing over her and Alexia\u2019s menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll be right back with that then,\u201d the waitress said before she disappeared into the kitchen. The girls let the silence hang in the air for a moment before looking around to see if the coast was clear. It looked like there was an old couple a few booths away, but they were lucky. Thanks to their time playing with their tiny captive earlier, they\u2019d missed the lunch rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, seriously, what are you going to do with it?\u201d Anissa asked, leaning across the table eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking\u2026\u201d Alexia began coyly, scrunching her toes as she felt another wriggle of her tiny prisoner against her sole. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that I should enjoy a little snack is all,\u201d Alexia giggled, pressing her foot down just slightly on the trapped tiny to bring out another sessions of struggles. Looking down at her feet, the giantess couldn\u2019t help but giggle before she pulled her knees closer to her, letting her heels rest on the edge of the booth\u2019s cushion (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4793072609_6e3a133b24.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4793...</a>). She leaned her chin against her knees and spoke again, slower this time so that her future food knew what was coming. \u201cI thought about it before\u2026now I just want to know what it would feel like to swallow it\u2026\u201d Alexia burst out in giggles; her tiny friend really didn\u2019t like the idea of ending up in her stomach it seemed. Neither did Anissa.  <br>\r\n\t\u201cWait, you can\u2019t just eat it!\u201d Anissa hissed, looking a little hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy not?\u201d Alexia replied, looking defensive. This one was supposed to be hers to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you eat it, then what am I supposed to do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou broke the last one! Nissa, you said I could do anything I wanted with the next one we got. So I\u2019m eating it,\u201d Alexia stated, an air of finality to her voice as she spoke. She set her feet back on the floor with a little more force than she\u2019d intended. Worried for a moment that she might have crushed her future snack, Alexia smirked when she saw that she\u2019d actually given her tiny treat a brief respite. It had been knocked loose from her foot and was trying its best now to flee from her, apparently intent on not ending up in her stomach. Anissa looked under the table too and couldn\u2019t help but giggle a little as she saw the tiny thing trying to run away into the aisle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour snack is running away,\u201d Anissa teased, not taking her eyes off the fleeing tiny person. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok\u2026\u201d Alexia said as she slowly lifted her foot and swung it over the terrified shrunken toy. Wiggling her toes in her sandal, she began to lower it before her little friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou screamed and fell flat on your ass when Alexia\u2019s foot suddenly slammed down right in front of you, a sudden wall of tan flesh blocking your path. Looking up, a shiver went down your spine as Alexia\u2019s grinning face looked down at you with the bemused smirk of a predator in total control of the situation. Flipping onto your stomach, you started sprinting the other way, hoping to maybe make it to the wall and find a crevice of something you could crawl into. Once again, Alexia\u2019s foot slammed down before you, her foot\u2019s arch staring down at you mockingly. You started to feel sick. Heading for the booth\u2019s seat, you yelped and leapt backwards as the giantess brought her heels together, cutting off your route to escape. Turning, you tried to run the opposite way toward Anissa\u2019s feet only to have Alexia\u2019s massive toes touch to box you in. Slowly, you looked back up at the giantess who could only wink at you before she slowly started to remove her left foot from its sandal\u2026 Her voice boomed in your ears, \u201c<b>I LIKE TO PLAY WITH MY FOOD</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlexia giggled as she placed her bare foot back down onto her tiny toy, pinning it under her toes. Looking down at her foot, the musician marveled at how it didn\u2019t even look like there was a bug-sized person squirming under her toes. All you could see was her smooth, tan skin (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alexia-Rodriguez-Feet-690050.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alexia-Rodrigue...</a>). Another bought of wiggling from her little friend only broadened the smile on Alexia\u2019s lips. The fact alone that it really thought its struggles would be enough to overpower her was comical. She almost would have felt bad about the futility of it all\u2026if not for the fact that she found it way more funny than pathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHere are your waters, the food should be out shortly,\u201d the waitress said, making Alexia almost jump out of her seat. She felt a tiny crunch under her foot and felt another burst of wriggling\u2026she\u2019d accidentally broken something on the little thing. Turning, she saw the waitress looking at her strangely. \u201cDid I scare you there?\u201d she asked, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust a little,\u201d Alexia replied politely, now a bit concerned that she might have accidentally ended her game a little early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry about that,\u201d the waitress said kindly, \u201cyour food should be out soon, I\u2019ll try not to scare you again!\u201d  Smirking playfully, the young woman quickly disappeared into the kitchen again. As soon as she was out of sight Alexia looked under the table and slowly lifted her foot from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Anissa asked, looking under the table as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI felt something crunch\u2026I think I might have broken it when she scared me. I mean seriously, what the hell? She should wear a bell or something\u2026\u201d Alexia mused under her breath. Slowly, she began to peel her bare foot from the floor, wincing as she felt it peel away from the laminated hardwood. Her foot finally came away from the floor and Alexia couldn\u2019t help but giggle a little as she saw the sorry state of her shrunken toy plastered to the ball of her foot. There was a tiny red splotch on her sole, it seemed like she\u2019d crushed the little things legs. Well\u2026at least it can\u2019t run now, she figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs it broken?\u201d Anissa asked anxiously. Alexia bit her lip, an idea for a fun little prank jumping into her head....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019d already been suffering under Alexia\u2019s massive toes when she just had you playfully trapped under them. When the ball of her foot came down on your legs though\u2026holy shit. You cursed whatever power at play had kept you from passing out at that moment. Now though, clamped between Alexia\u2019s massive fingers, you stared pleadingly into her soft brown eyes, trying to make a last plea only to find it impossible to take a breath while her hand squeezed your ribcage (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://static.starity.hu/images/celebs/200x300/alexia-rodriguez-0213.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.starity.hu/images/celebs/2...</a>). The soft eyes shimmered as they seemed to devour the image of your form between her fingers. A human being was literally in her hand. She couldn\u2019t not enjoy the feeling of power she had just handling you.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHide him, food is coming,\u201d Anissa said. Alexia smirked and closed her fingers around you, closing you off in the humid darkness of her full grasp. The waitress smiled and placed down the plates before the scheming sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlright, anything else I can do for you guys?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>NO\u2026I THINK WE HAVE IT ALL COVERED,</b>\u201d Alexia replied, a tight squeeze against your battered body. Your time was up it seemed. The gentle sound of the waitress\u2019 footsteps fading into the distance was the final countdown. When they disappeared into the kitchen, your world began shifting again. Flung blindly through the air, you suddenly found yourself in free fall, only to slam into a surprisingly soft surface. You almost thought it felt nice for a fraction of a second before it began burning your skin! Looking around, you saw the light tan walls lifting on either side of you like flaky parapets. Your gaze was dragged down by the horrific feeling of your skin burning only to see that you were half-submerged in what appeared to be a bright yellow mud. The smell wafting into your nose became immediately familiar. You felt sick. Alexia had dropped you on top of a taco\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDO YOU REALLY HAVE TO EAT IT?\u201d Anissa asked, leaning in to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I REALLY <i>WANT </i>TO EAT IT\u2026BESIDES, IT HAS NO LEGS ANYMORE</b>,\u201d Alexia replied happily. Her gaze turned back down towards you and she smiled sweetly. \u201c<b>SORRY LITTLE ONE, BUT YOU GET TO BE CLOSER TO ME THAN ANYONE ELSE HAS. THAT HAS TO MAKE UP FOR IT, RIGHT?</b>\u201d she said cutely before opening her mouth wide and bringing the taco to her lips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nYou screamed at the top of your lungs as Alexia\u2019s first bite tore away a massive chunk of the taco. The missing material started a small avalanche of shredded meat and cheese, sending you tumbling down into the crater her first bite had left. She only giggled and began to noisily chew above you, her scarlet tongue sliding across her lips to drag in whatever bits of meat and cheese stubbornly clung to her lips. Lifting her head just the slightest bit, Alexia let you watch as she swallowed, sending the bite bigger than a baseball field down to awaiting stomach. You couldn\u2019t tear your eyes away from the bulge slowly getting pushed down her throat\u2026until that it her open mouth was slowly coming towards you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img005.lazygirls.info/people/alexia_rodriguez/alexia_rodriguez_lexia_rodriguez_let_me_in_m79zSBH.sized.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img005.lazygirls.info/people/alex...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>BYE BUG</b>\u201d you heard Anissa whisper before the light was shut out. The air around you immediately turned humid as Alexia\u2019s lips closed down on the taco shell to form a perfect seal. In the total darkness, you couldn\u2019t see anything, but knew what was going to happen next\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was like an entire forest was being splintered when Alexia\u2019s teeth crushed the shell and began pulling away from the rest of the taco. Your world suddenly flipped as Alexia leaned back and straightened her head again. Falling, you slammed into the wet floor of her tongue just a split second before the mountain of beans, meat, cheese, lettuce, and tortilla shell came crashing down on top of you. Groaning, the weight of the food piled on top of you seemed more than enough to crush you before a quick flick of Alexia\u2019s tongue sent you flying through the darkness once again. It felt like your skull cracked when you smashed into one of her gigantic teeth, sliding slowly to the floor of her mouth only to be quickly scooped up on the tip of her tongue again. She flung you once more, this time making you land on a molar just as her teeth came down. A sharp shard of chip jammed into her gums, making her mouth open right before her molars mashed you up. Her tongue swept along her teeth, swirling you around with the rest of the debris before letting your settle against the wall of her teeth once more. The humid cavern echoed with the sound of her chewing exploding all around you. Broken chip fragments and chunks of cheese and meat started raining down on you with each deliberate bite. Alexia was waiting for a big taste of copper when her teeth came down on you. Its absence till now almost disappointed her\u2026until she realized how much scarier it be to send you to her stomach still alive. Unable to stop her giggling (which was nearly deafening to you), Alexia slowly dragged her tongue around her mouth, collecting every fragment she could find and piling them up in the middle of her tongue. Your whimpers echoed now within the still cave, the only other sounds were the deep gurgles and popping noises coming up from the tunnel before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cP-please\u2026.please don\u2019t do this\u2026.Please let me go!\u201d you begged, the words getting caught and distorted over your sobs. For a moment, you only heard the sounds of  her stomach hard at work digesting the other bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HMMMMMMMM</b>\u201d Alexia sighed, a hot wave of air rushing over you. It seemed like she was going to consider your begging after al-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlexia giggled and took a sip of water to wash down her bite. Very faintly, she could hear the sound of your screaming as you were slowly pushed down towards her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo\u2026.how was it?\u201d Anissa asked, slightly annoyed that their toy was gone, but also curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIncredible, I can still feel it wriggling,\u201d Alexia mused, tracing the bite\u2019s path to her stomach with her slender pointer finger. Anissa seemed to shift anxiously in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlright\u2026I really wanna try that,\u201d she whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlexia only giggled and leaned in, \u201cWell then, why don\u2019t you try\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David groaned; his body ached all over from the ordeal he\u2019d so far endured. He tried to just move even his right arm and was immediately met with a fiery wave of pain that made his eyes roll back into his head. This entire day had gone from one of the best of his live, to possibly the end of it. His breathing was short and labored, but the flood of adrenaline surging through his veins urged him to try and move just one more time; there was no telling how long he had till they returned. Gritting his teeth, he forced himself upward only to be met with a wave of pain that turned his stomach. He felt weak and dizzy, every move seemed to awaken a new surge of ache and pain as Dave willed his eyes to focus on the sight before him. Stretching out was nothing but darkness, but David at least knew going into it was better than staying on the plastic and steel slanted slab he was busy trying to pry himself off of. Rolling forward onto his feet, Dave stumbled and nearly began rolling down the slope\u2026but a large drop at the end warned him that would be a foolish idea. No\u2026he needed to find a safer route down and he needed to do it quickl-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLUNK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA metallic clicking sound sent David\u2019s heart right into his throat. Looking around frantically, he knew there were maybe a few more seconds before they came back and his ordeal recommenced. Actually, since he was trying to flee it might be even worse! The air rumbled with groaning as a metal doorway seemed to be grating open. There was no more time to hesitate, running down the slope, Dave decided to chance a jump\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOM!.....BABOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE DID NOT SAY THAT!\u201d A light voice thundered shaking the air with a giggle that seemed like it was pumped out from massive amps. David had been too slow; looking toward the source of the noise, distracted, he failed to pay attention to the odd ridges at his feet. His right leg caught a small ditch and he was flung forward, slamming face-first into the plastic and rubber surface of the slope\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES HE DID!\u201d another voice chided, laughing as several tremors began running through the ground one after the other. The seismic activity was too much for David to get up during, but that wasn\u2019t his biggest worry; quakes had become a regular occurrence, what worried him most was the source of them. Another surge of adrenaline flooded Dave, but this time it was of almost no help. He had no opportunity to even get off the slab, instead it just meant he was awake when the first of his tormentor\u2019s rounded the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold sweat broke out on Dave\u2019s body as it landed; the shiny black curved surface of it was all he could see, but it was enough. No, it wasn\u2019t anything like a pod or elevator that had come into his view\u2026Dave knew what he was looking at; the imposing tip of Alexia\u2019s black Doc Marten\u2019s had arrived back. Slowly, Dave looked up until the inky blackness that had stretched out before him gave way to two light tan pillars wrapped in the crisscrossed black ropes of a pair of fishnet stockings that seemed to go on forever. They too disappeared into the legs of a pair of black short-shorts\u2026a black shirt above those\u2026and further up still was Alexia\u2019s face wearing an amused smirk as she looked at Dave\u2019s pathetic, battered form on her gas pedal (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/9uWm9YzZvv/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/9uWm9YzZvv/</a>). Alexia crossed her arms and cocked her head to the side; Dave could feel his stomach knot up painfully\u2026he was fucked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEHE, UHHHH GOING SOMEWHERE, LITTLE GUY?\u201d Alexia\u2019s voice rung out as her massive feet slowly swung into view. First, her left foot glided before you, showing off the scuffed rubber sole a bit while the giantess positioned her butt where it needed to go. Another tremor shook Dave when the foot fell, though there wasn\u2019t time to process what was going on as Alexia\u2019s butt descended\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait! Please, I\u2019m sorry just let me g-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlexia giggled, her right foot was planted right on the gas pedal and she slowly pressed down to make sure her little fan was stuck to the surface where he belonged. It was just the right amount of force she put down, not enough to break him, but more than enough to make him so sore he couldn\u2019t move. Lifting her boot ever so slightly, she smirked and saw the tiny bug of a man was writhing on the small slope\u2026he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. <br>\r\nFlipping the keys, Lexi giggled as the bus roared to life. She bit her lip and slowly pressed her foot down on the pedal, though she heard a little crunch, the small squeaks and screams echoing from under her boot at least said that her and Anissa\u2019s toy was still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDavid couldn\u2019t move\u2026he\u2019d have cried more, but a shift of Alexia\u2019s boot had landed his face right into a clump of dirt that had been wedged between her treads. A small pebble stuck in it (which was a decent boulder to Dave) had been the cause of his now crushed left leg. He\u2019d already thrown up from the shock and was too dizzy to even know which way was up anymore. Dully, he clawed at the dirt threatening to bury him only to be shocked awake as Alexia pressed down on the pedal more, digging that rock into the smashed remains of his leg. \u201cF-Fuck! Help me! S-Someone help me!\u201d David screamed at the top of his lungs, another wave of pain threatening to knock him out completely. He fought to stay awake\u2026the two titans had already told him that they\u2019d kill him if he fell asleep on them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith the tiny, muffled screams coming from under the toe of her boot, Alexia\u2019s cheeks flushed a little red\u2026the feeling of power over the pathetic little bug beneath her was more\u2026stimulating than she\u2019d thought it would be. Clearing her throat, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi giggled and continued driving for a few more minutes before...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tinge of mint-flavor was already wearing thin as the movie star flipped through the pages of a magazine in her limo. She stared with silent anger at a scathing review of her latest appearance as she let her teeth gnash together fiercely on her gum. Aggravated, she threw the mag down on the seat as she pulled out her phone and wrote an angry text to her agent, asking for the writer\u2019s contact information. As the text flew, Megan reclined in her seat. The darkness of the limo\u2019s interior was soothing as the AC cooled her face. Megan continued slowly chewing on her gum until the flavor had run dry. Megan let the gum rest peacefully in her mouth as she closed her eyes and tilted her head back\u2026she felt the familiar tickle on her tongue that she had been waiting for. Jess was still alive in there it seemed\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few hours ago, Jess was the happiest she had been in months. She was standing happily in a huge crowd of people, ready to meet Megan Fox as she left the taping for an interview promoting her newest movie. Jess knew that people thought Megan was cold, but felt in her heart that the actress she idolized was a kind and caring person! The crowd ahead of her burst in cheers as Jess dove through them, pushing her way to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMegan! Megan please sign this!\u201d Jess shouted as she burst from the crowd and shoved her autograph book towards the stunned star. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess\u2019s smile dropped as Megan continued walking past her, without even giving her so much as a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMegan wait! Please!\u201d Jess shouted as she began pushing through the crowd, following Fox as she started to walk away even faster. As she jammed her way through the crowd, Jess made eye contact with Megan. She smiled and hoped that her idol would stop and sign\u2026instead Megan just turned around and kept walking. Jess was heartbroken and continued pushing through the crowd, hoping to catch up with Ms. Fox before she reached her limousine. <br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am please step back with the others,\u201d a large security guard said as he stepped in Jess\u2019 way. Jess barely noticed and began trying to move around the hulking man, screaming for Megan the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess sprawled back on the ground as the guard gave her a solid shove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what do you think you are doing?\u201d a familiar voice rang out as Jess looked up from the ground. She nearly screamed in joy as she saw Megan looking down at her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JwZ6mja0Ei8/ThdB7om4yiI/AAAAAAAACHk/AXGolcTu2-o/s1600/megan_fox_face_facebook_botox_plastic_surgery_3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JwZ6mja0Ei8/Th...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I just wanted your autograph!\u201d Jess responded, trying to pull herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is that all?\u201d Megan said, a sly smile sneaking across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Jess chirped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how about you ride with me in the limo then? I mean if you want to\u2026\u201d Megan began to say. Before she could finish the sentence, Jess was up and climbing into the limousine. Megan Fox chuckled to herself as she dismissed the body guard and followed her \u201cbiggest fan\u201d into the back of her limo.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nZAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess felt a tingle go through her body as the world around her went fuzzy. Her head was spinning like she had gotten up to fast, her body burning like she had spent a whole day in the sun! When she finally began to get her bearings again, she found that the seat of the limo was now tremendous compared to her. While her head was quickly overheating as it tried to make heads and tales of what was going on, two powerful pillars suddenly came down on either side of her before squeezing her between their unyielding walls. Jess screamed as she felt like she was about to pop. She was soon flying through the air so quickly she felt like it was a run-away roller coaster! The confused woman nearly passed out as she came to a quite sudden stop, her head snapping forward like she was in a car accident. Disoriented and dizzy, Jess tried to look forward, but couldn\u2019t believe what her eyes were showing her. It looked impossible\u2026 a giant Megan Fox looking at her with mock-concern (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://uk.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201168/300.Fox2.tg.070811.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://uk.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God! Are you ok?\u201d Megan said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d Jess said, staring in disbelief at the tremendous face below her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe, don\u2019t you worry,\u201d Megan said as she dropped the add and sneered at Jess with an evil grin. Before Jess could even respond, she had been deposited onto a strip of gum. She landed on the cardboard-like surface and tried to stand, only to be pinned down by Megan\u2019s powerful thumb. Then, in another second\u2026she was tossed into the darkness of Megan Fox\u2019s mouth\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan had been chewing carefully around Jess for the entire trip, but this game had become as dull as her gums flavor as she rolled it around her open mouth lazily. She pushed it to the side of her mouth with her powerful tongue, waiting for a new idea to strike (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.betcheslovethis.com/files/uploads/images/gum2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.betcheslovethis.com/files/upl...</a>). Yet nothing new seemed to tantalize her. As Megan reached her next stop, she wondered about what to do with Jess. Slipping out of the limo, Megan decided to _______ the tiny woman.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were screaming inside in joy as you followed her back to where the actors set up and kept their things for the event. You were busy for a moment just looking at the things left in the room, surprised the things some of the other actresses just left lying around, before turning back to Chloe, only to be blinded by a deep purple light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stir to life as you hear a loud and familiar voice saying 'Hm, 10 minutes exactly, first time instructions have been accurate at all' your eyes fly open and you see Chloe, her face taking up your entire field of view as she smiled 'Hey tiny, sorry I've forgotten your name already but oh well. Did you know some of the tech on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D is real? There's a size change arc next season and we got our hands on the device pre shooting. And you're it's first lucky victim' while she talks you get a better look at your surrounds, first you see Chloe has shrunk you to 4 inches tall, and that you're in the back of a limo, probably to get the actors from their hotel to the convention and back for the few days they're there. Chloe was leaning over you, giving you a nice look down her shirt as she was currently sitting on her feet in a kneeling position in order to get the best vantage over you, and you could see her shoes sitting beside the seats just off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ming and Liz can complain about it later, but I got 1st shot of the shrink ray' she grinned 'you're kind of a pain in the ass, but you're cute, which is why I'm not just smushing you plus you're a REALLY big... or I suppose small fan and I really like the idea of having something so obsessed with me hanging around' she smiled and poked you giggling when you fell onto your back 'Yep, you'd make a nice pet, be a good use for that kind of clingy nature I see about you. Plus maybe if you behave you could be an extra for the show, and Daisy could get her only little one to play with during and possibly after the arc' despite yourself you smiled brightly 'So cutie, you going to play nice or am I going to have to smush you and try the next fan?' You shake your head rapidly and she chuckles 'I knew you'd say that. I'm also glad you agreed, the shrink ray makes you extra durable, so it would take quite a bit of work to smush you, which is good, because that means I don't need to be 'made of glass' gentle with you later' she says as she picks you up and sits back on the balls of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe licks her lips in anticipation, trying to think of the best first thing to do to you when you hear a commotion 'Damn it' she hisses 'They're done already, I thought I had more time. Listen bud, I really don't want the complaining all the way back to the hotel, so for now nobody can know you're shrunk' she says quietly before putting you...</span></div></div>",

You were also sure the shrinking process dulled your sense of pain as comparatively you should either be a bloody pulp between her toes, or be screaming in pain from the hydraulic press that was her muscles pressing down on and around you. This all ended when they got back to their hotel room, you having to endure her speed walking from the main lobby to her room she was in such a rush before she flopped onto her bed and began to undo her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe removing her shoe was not the immediate freedom you'd expect, her toes clenched tightly around you and due to movement while she was walking around you had rotated so your face was rubbed against her entire sole as she dragged her foot out of the shoe before resting it on her knee, grinning down at you as she released her foot's grip on your tiny form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey little bud, have fun?' she asks 'I sure did. I really hope the others find little people of their own, would hate to have to share you little one' you gulp, thinking a similar thought, that you didn't want to be shared either, Chloe was enough for you after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jess was terrified as she looked around in utter shock. On either side of her stood massive white walls, lined with some strange pink pattern above the main facade. It felt like she was flanked between ancient walls of two cities; the walls bearing the scars of years of sieges gone wrong. Scars marked up the wall with innumerable lines; smudges of dirt and earth were crammed into crevices like the walls had been raised from the earth themselves. There were just three problems with this picture. One: the walls looked like they were made of rubber, and Jess didn\u2019t know of any city with rubber walls. Two: the ground under her feet was hard\u2026and distinctly not earth; it looked like black rubber trenches had been dug farther than her eyes could see. Third: Jess had been on a bus to the city just a few seconds ago, not traveling to exotic cities.  That was when Jess encountered the mysterious fourth thing wrong with this picture\u2026 one of the walls had begun to move! She stared in confusion and fear as the wall to her right slowly began to rise. Jess watched, affixed with terror and struck with awe, as the massive wall dripped in earth, the shallow scars along its flanks losing their earthen passengers as it bent and warped under the yield of some unknown force. As Jess followed the lifting wall with her eyes, the nature of the powerful force moving them soon became apparent, though her mind was still struggling to deal with it as the massive structure that now floated over her began to fall\u2026 With the sky falling upon her, Jess could only stare blankly at the approaching blackness as a buzzing like a thousand cicadas filled her ears\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmmmmm,\u201d Sasha exhaled as she pressed her shoulders back into the seat of the bus. She had dozed off for a few seconds, only to be awoken by her phone buzzing. Looking at the seat ahead of hers carefully, Sasha smiled inwardly to see the obnoxious woman who had been there was gone (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://static1.demotix.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/a_scale_large/2100-7/photos/1372259857-sasha-grey-presents-la-sociedad-de-juliette-in-madrid_2196347.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://static1.demotix.com/sites/default...</a>). Maybe she got off the bus, or had gone to the bathroom, but whatever the reason, Sasha was glad to be free of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone buzzed once again, a text message was waiting for review. Sasha looked down at her phone quickly to see that it was just a text from her manager, it could wait for later. Slowly closing her eyes again, Sasha pressed the front of her left shoe into the heel of her right as she slowly began to pry it off. A quick nap was in order, and comfort was something she refused to concede on. After all, she already had to settle for a nine hour bus ride with obnoxious passengers; no one was going to tell her she couldn\u2019t slide off her stuffy shoes and rest. Not even that bitch who had been sitting in front of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess screamed and jumped just in time as the colossal converse above her finally slammed into the ground. Panting, she turned around to see that if she had been even a second slower she\u2019d have been splattered underneath the massive thing. Looking up, Jess still couldn\u2019t believe what was happening was real as a titanic sock-clad foot slowly drifted over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other converse clattered to the floor, Jess\u2019s heart nearly jumped out of her chest. She looked back and forth as the twin cities, now seeing them overturned and overpowered by the feet of the woman who had been sitting behind her. Jess\u2019s mind was racing as she tried to figure out what had happened to her to leave her stranded between two shoes big enough to be cruise liners! Standing between them made her feel remarkably small as she guessed she must have only been about as big as a small ant next to these things (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ee_ouG5ksx4/UyCEZpTY1MI/AAAAAAAASlc/5ipV1Leadls/s1600/pink+blazer+outfit+\" target=\"_blank\">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ee_ouG5ksx4/Uy...</a>(2+of+5).jpg). Looking up, Jess felt her stomach churn as she saw her sky blotted out by the white clouds of Sasha\u2019s socks. Between the two monolithic feet, she could see Sasha reclining in her seat\u2026asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d Jess moaned under her breath as she collapsed next to the massive shoe that had nearly crushed her. Looking around, she saw the next closest pair of feet seemed to be miles away, it would be a pointless struggle to get to them. If she wanted to be found, she\u2019d have to find a way to get this sleeping giant to notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was tossed in the air as one of Sasha\u2019s sock-clad feet slipped off the footrest and landed square on top of the shoe she was next to. Terrified, Jess looked up to see that she had already been cast under the shadow of Sasha\u2019s foot, a cliff of cotton now casting her in shadow as the monolithic toes inside slowly wiggled once before lying dormant again. As the massive mountain of foot hung over her head, Jess\u2019 brain finally came up with an escape plan, though she wasn\u2019t happy about it. Staying under this massive woman\u2019s foot was only going to get her killed, but if Jess could somehow get onto it, then maybe she could climb Sasha, or get her attention when she woke up somehow. Either way\u2026getting closer to the titanic foot over her was going to be necessary. Slinking out from under the shadow of the colossal mass, Jess began making her way around the base of the converse, hoping to find a badly beaten up area she could use to climb. As she made it to the insole, she found just what she was looking for. A pock-marked wall of scratches and grooves made a ladder easy enough for Jess to climb. Right above it even sat the super-sized sock, which would act as another good ladder if Jess made it that far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping into the rubber wall of the converse, Jess looked up at the endless legs of Sasha Grey and felt a tingle of excitement. The situation she was in was not ideal\u2026but it was kind of like an adventure you dreamed of as a kid. This was her beanstalk, and the giantess above would hear her; Jess just hoped that this one would be kinder than the one in the storybook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRRRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha woke with a start as her phone buzzed again. Rubbing her eyes, she looked out the window and saw that they had come to a pit-stop. Her stomach rumbled as she threw the phone in her pocketbook and stretched once again. A quick snack would help; she figured as she looked down at her feet and began reaching for her converse (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://johnrieber.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sasha-grey-in-eureka-tower.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://johnrieber.files.wordpress.com/20...</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess nearly got thrown off the top of Sasha\u2019s foot when the giantess awoke. She had made wonderful progress while Sasha was asleep and had climbed all the way to the top of her foot, though now she was resting on the slope of Sasha\u2019s toes after losing her grip. Looking up at the giantess she\u2019s been clinging onto for the last hour, Jess finally began to swell with hope. As Sasha\u2019s hands reached for their shoes, Jess began to wave and scream up at her. She pushed herself up from the sea of white sock and made as much noise and motion as she could to capture the attention of the sleepy-eyes giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha looked down at her foot as she got ready to slide them back into her converse when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You couldn't see much of the stunning body but it did appear that she was dressed in a white ceremonial robe like in the movie. It also looked like you were miles away from the hotel. Your current room looked like a golden chamber with decorations that would've dwarfed you at any measure: a sacrificial pit for the 150ft Egyptian princess. Was this the studio?

Sofia cleared her throat and brought you closer to the white hems of her robe, so that you could stand atop the ridges of her mighty shoulder. If she is really into the movie, maybe you could keep role playing.

It wasn't too filthy at the glance of someone who wasn't almost the size of an insect. But for you, the clumps of dirt, dust, and things you didn't want to even think about were lodged in the rubbery outsole. Gross! Time passes slowly but no matter how demeaning the task seems, you can't stop cleaning the bottom of your shoe. It almost feels like your new purpose and you can't imagine what would happen if you disappoint the owner of the humongous shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\nIt all started when you found out you were the winner of the <i>\"Hang Out with Sofia Boutella\"</i> contest, you were excited beyond belief! Hang out, sure! It didn't matter what you did, you were a huge fan of all her movies, from her villainous role on Kingsman to her role in Atomic Blonde. You'd sign up just to watch Sofia sip a latte and barely pay attention to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... which would've been better than what actually happened. You checked in at the winner's desk in the front desk of a fancy hotel. After your identity was confirmed, two men in black suit and sunglasses dragged you into a backroom where you signed a bunch of documents and chugged what was not a shot, but a bitter liquid from a vial. One of the men whispered good luck as your vision became hazy and when you woke up, you were inside what was definitely one of the luxury suites. Except for all its furnishings and elegance, you had to be the size of a thumbtack and there was no sign of Sofia just yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HMMM WHAT IS THIS...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/q4lxDzM\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/a/q4lxDzM</a></div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I got you your coffee, sorry it took a while, I swear to God the people at the counter were fucking braindead,\u201d Hannah said as she kicked open the door to the dressing room, a cup of coffee in one hand and a phone in the other as the itinerary for the day came up on her phone. \u201cSofia?\u201d Hanna asked, not hearing an answer, \u201cSofia? You in here?...Guess not\u2026\u201d Closing the door behind her, Hannah sighed and walked over to the well-lit make-up station to place down Sophia\u2019s cup. It seemed the actress was still finishing up a shot for \u201cThe Mummy\u201d which gave Hannah time to kill. She dropped her phone on the table and hopped onto the counter, rubbing her stomach. \u201cUgh\u2026knew I shouldn\u2019t have had that stupid burrito last night\u2026stomach\u2019s killing me\u2026\u201d Hannah\u2019s stomach growled angrily and a jolt of pain went through the assistant\u2019s body. She felt for a moment that she should maybe leave a note for Sofia, call her assistant, and call it a day, but she wouldn\u2019t get the chance. She grabbed the coffee cup and took a quick sip from it to make sure it was right before leaving the dressing room when it happened. Right as she was about to push off the make-up counter, Hannah felt a wave of dizziness wash over her. Her eyes grew incredibly heavy\u2026and before she could even open her mouth to call for help\u2026she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt could have been seconds later, minutes later, or hours later\u2026Hannah didn\u2019t know. Her eyes slowly opened and she could feel her stomach was still killing her. Groaning, she looked down and saw that the floor of the dressing room looked different. \u201cDid I black out and go to the bathroom?\u201d she wondered aloud as she slowly tried to at least sit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHannah fell back on her butt, unseated by the tremor that ran through the ground. Her heart leaped into her throat as her head began going a mile a minute. \u201cAn earthquake?! But there aren\u2019t earthquakes here\u2026oh shit is it a bomb?! I have t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother, stronger tremor ran through the ground, knocking Hannah off her feet again before the young woman could get her bearings. Her head slammed against the hard ground, sending a wave of pain through her whole body that threatened to make her black out. Hannah\u2019s whole body writhed on the floor as she attempted in vain to get her limbs to listen to her; she was like a machine that needed a reset, everything was moving out of order\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis time she bounced off the floor, smacking into it again...which turned out to be just what she needed. Her whole body felt like shit, but Hannah at least could move. With a groan, she flipped onto her stomach and tried to lift herself up. She looked forward and saw a curved white wall in front of her; she didn\u2019t have time to wonder what she was looking at as she crawled forward. Another quake could be coming at any second and Hannah needed to find out where she was and where to run for shelter. The wall was strange, with several odd pockets and handholds on it and an intense heat radiating through. Weird design, but good for standing up. Hannah quickly grabbed onto the wall and struggled to right herself, she looked up and felt her stomach turn in knots\u2026she knew there was something familiar about the odd wall, but it seemed impossible. Hannah felt like she was going to throw up as she slowly backed away from the wall to take it in. There was some weird writing on it in a deep black. A few more steps back confirmed her deepest fears\u2026the name \u201cSofia\u201d was written across the curved wall\u2026only it wasn\u2019t just a wall\u2026it was the coffee cup she\u2019d brought in\u2026only now it was the size of a grain silo (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://drinks.seriouseats.com/images/2013/08/20130108-loneliness.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://drinks.seriouseats.com/images/201...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUGH, HANNAH, I NEED MY COFFEE\u2026HANNAH?\u201d a voice thundered from behind the assistant. Hannah wanted to cry as she turned around and saw something that made her piss herself\u2026Sophia\u2026sky-scraper sized\u2026Still dressed for on set, Sofia looked like a real monster now: something like if the Mummy and Godzilla had a baby that got real cranky when she didn\u2019t get her caffeine fix. \u201cFUUUUCK, SHE SAID SHE\u2019D BE HERE BY NOW!\u201d Sofia groaned as she took another step into the dressing room\u2026Hannah watched the cloth-wrapped foot raise into the air\u2026and then slam down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe source of the earthquakes was found at the very least\u2026not that it helped Hannah. The tiny assistant struggled to her feet just to be knocked down by the next footfall from her gigantic boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cS-S-Sofia! Down here!\u201d Hannah screamed after falling painfully on her tailbone. Tears had begun to brim in her eyes as it became readily apparent that she was far too small to be heard by the giantess stomping in her direction. Still, some part of her thought if she just shouted loud enough then she\u2019d get help! \u201cPlease! Sofia look down here at me! P-Please!\u201d Her mind felt like it was fracturing as another footstep shook her down to her bones. Unable to stand, she did the only thing she could\u2026crawl away while screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHannah felt her heart lighten for a second as the door shut and Sofia seemed to be looking in her direction inquisitively. \u201cHMMMM? WHAT\u2019S THAT?\u201d Sofia mused under her breath as Hannah took the chance to start running in her direction, jumping, waving, and shouting wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cS-Sofia! It\u2019s me! It\u2019s Hannah! D-Down here! Yes! Help me!\u201d she cried, smiling bright at the thought that she was about to be saved in this crazy nightmare\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMY COFFEE? WHY\u2019D SHE LEAVE IT ON THE GROUND?\u201d Sofia groaned as her foot lifted again and slammed down\u2026unknowingly crushing Hannah\u2019s hopes in the process. Sofia hadn\u2019t seen her assistant at all, just the coffee she\u2019d been balancing against\u2026and now, Hannah wasn\u2019t even next to the cup. She was out in the open\u2026with a giantess coming closer. \u201cSERIOUSLY? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH HER TODAY?\u201d Sofia groaned as her sandal-clad feet padded against the tile floor (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn3-www.superherohype.com/assets/uploads/gallery/the-mummy-set/mummy0024.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn3-www.superherohype.com/assets...</a>). With two simple steps, Sofia had no clue that her assistant was fleeing in the shadow of her right foot\u2026<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSofia stop! Look! It\u2019s me! Pl-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t \u201cSERIOUSLY? STILL WARM AT LEAST...\u201d Sofia grumbled as she grabbed the cup off the floor and brought it to her lips for her first sip. The hot liquid ran down her tired throat and she could feel it pool in her belly; the warmth radiated throughout her body and for the first time in hours, Sofia actually felt relaxed for a brief moment. She checked the clock on the wall of the dressing room and saw that for once she had a little time till they needed her back on set\u2026no so much that she could get out of make-up, but enough to kick back and enjoy some TV before she got called back for some touch-ups on the Sanskrit writing scrawled across her body. Sofia felt a little bubblier as the coffee was introduced into her system. A smirk grew across her lips as she turned on the ball of her right foot and began strolling to the couch (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://electroshadow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MummySet-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://electroshadow.com/wp-content/uplo...</a>)\u2026She was completely oblivious that her foot dragging across the floor with her pivot has rubbed Hannah\u2019s back raw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHanna screamed\u2026or she would have if her face wasn\u2019t literally mashed into the sole of her boss\u2019 thin sandal. Tears streamed down Hannah\u2019s bruising cheeks while the tiny woman was convinced all the flesh on her back must have been ripped clean off her bones thanks to the twist of Sofia\u2019s foot. The giantess\u2019s weight shifted forward as she began walking again\u2026the force rolled over Hannah\u2019s fragile form and she could swear she heard her skull bending under the pressure\u2026but thankfully it hadn\u2019t decided to give out just yet.  Unfortunately for Hannah, it wouldn\u2019t be just one step she\u2019d have to endure though. To the tiny assistant\u2019s horror, she felt her body bend and stick to the sole of Sofia\u2019s sandal as the unaware star began strolling to the couch with her employee underfoot like a crushed ant. Hannah wasn\u2019t bug-juice just yet\u2026but it sure as hell wasn\u2019t because of a lack of effort. Unsure if it was a miracle or a curse, whatever had shrunk Hannah down to size apparently made her more durable than an average bug. She wasn\u2019t dead, but the aching coursing through her body more than made her wish she was. The first step had left Hannah feeling like her back had been ripped open; the second step had left her with her ears ringing after Sofia\u2019s weight came down a little harder on her head; the third step made breathing harder as Sofia\u2019s weight finally cracked a few of Hannah\u2019s ribs; the fourth step made Hannah throw up as a tiny pebble (to Sofia) dug into her stomach and forced her lunch up. By the fifth step, when Sofia finally made it to the couch and crashed down on her perky ass, Hannah was a weeping mess who was all but broken mentally and physically. She was lapping at the sole of Sofia\u2019s sandal, begging her boss to \u2018forgive her\u2019 for whatever transgression had placed her in this position; Hannah could taste iron in her mouth after the rough treatment she\u2019d endured underfoot had left three teeth cracked and the licking had made small cuts in her mouth as debris dragged against the soft interior of her mouth\u2026 Hannah was a sobbing mess as she muttered between licks, \u201cP-Please S-S-Sofia\u2026P-Please just let me go\u2026I-I\u2019m sorry! P-Please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sofia had placed the coffee cup on the table and propped her sandal-clad feet on either side of the drink while pulling out her phone. Though she didn\u2019t even know Hannah was down there in the first place, the impact of heel-on-table was enough of a shock to shake the battered bug-sized woman loose. Again, the durability boost had allowed Hannah to survive the fall from a comparative +20 ft in the air as the tiny woman plummeted from the arch of Sofia\u2019s sandal. She crumpled to the table-top like a marionette with its strings cut, but after a few moments Hannah began to shakily rise to her feet in the shadow of Sofia\u2019s right foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe giant mummy had no clue that there was a little bug in the shadow of her right foot, much less that the shadow was her AWOL assistant. Sofia groaned and grabbed the remote on the side, table, flipping on the TV and cranking up the volume while scrolling through her phone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cS-Sofia! Sofia down here! It\u2019s Hannah! Sofiaaaaaa! P-Please look at me!\u201d Hannah screamed as she tried to support herself against the thick leather heel of Sofia\u2019s thin sandals. The tiny, desperate woman quickly realized that it was no use getting her attention like this. Even if the TV wasn\u2019t so loud that it was drowning out her own thoughts, Hannah doubted here miniscule voice could reach the +100 ft that separated her from Sofia\u2019s ears. She needed something better\u2026something to help her stand out\u2026Slowly, Hannah turned around and craned her neck up at the towering cylinder she\u2019d brought in here. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me\u2026\u201d she said to herself as she thought about if it was really even worth it to try climbing up there. Almost as if on cue, Hannah heard Sofia\u2019s stiff toes crack like thunder as the giantess flexed them in her sandals. That was all the convincing she needed. Taking off at a jog, the itty-bitty bug-sized assistant pressed herself to the pressed wood pulp surface of the coffee cup, and slowly began her ascent while Sofia\u2019s feet flanked her sides (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Sofia-Boutella-Feet-2805802.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Sofia-Boutella...</a>).\u2026</span></div></div>",

A dark shadow began to fall over you as the woman you\u2019d been speaking to not even forty second ago was wandering in your direction like a clueless skyscraper in boots\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though you knew there was no way she could hear you, your brain was running out of things you could do as you cupped your hands around your mouth and screamed up once again, \u201cAlicia! Down here! P-Please, look down here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was closer now, her shadow engulfed you completely as her combat boots mercilessly pounded the ground! Some primal part of your brain told you that you should run, but it was too late. Your eyes locked on her left foot as it rose up over you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201717/rs_1024x821-170207085732-1024.Alicia-Vikander-Tomb-Raider-JR-020717.jpg?fit=inside%7C900:auto&amp;output-quality=90\" target=\"_blank\">https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_imag...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh\u2026Fuck, fuck, fuck! Alicia n-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDarkness\u2026nothing but darkness surrounded you. You could feel your body bent down and cramped together like you\u2019d just been shoved into a suitcase. The thought that this might be what the afterlife was like vanished from your mind as your nose suddenly began to burn with the smell of rubber and the aching started pulsing from your bones. You must have had the devil\u2019s luck\u2026because instead of getting crushed like a bug on Alicia\u2019s rug, you found yourself in the tight embrace of her boot\u2019s rubber treads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlicia made her way past the vanity mirror, but slowed her pace as she reached a certain point in the room. When her foot had come down, she hadn\u2019t felt the satisfying \u2018crunch\u2019 that she\u2019d gotten with the last three people that had made themselves a nuisance to her. She was sure the props assistant had been shrunken\u2026the girl was nowhere in sight and no one had been in or out of the room since she\u2019d barged in unannounced. For a moment, Alicia thought of just grinding her foot back and forth, but a thought occurred to her. Last time she\u2019d done this, she had been wearing flip-flops. The boots she had on for Laura\u2019s costume though\u2026. Slowly, the actress took another step forward and peeked over her shoulder (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/65/e6/a3/65e6a3cee9409cb68c2faa968f943227.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/65/e6/a3/65e6a...</a>). A sinister smirk grew across her lips when Alicia saw no smear or crushed remains on her carpet. \u201cThat\u2019s just perfect,\u201d she purred, feeling a tingle run through her body. There was a knock at the door as someone called Alicia to get ready to start filming again. Biting her bottom lip, Alicia wondered how long you\u2019d last as dirt in Laura Croft\u2019s treads\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she walked out of the room and made her way to the set, Alicia couldn\u2019t help but smile as she saw the first shot they were going to be working on today. \u201cLet\u2019s see how she likes a little rock-climbing~\u201d the actress purred as she took off at a slight jog toward the rock wall they\u2019d prepared for this. The day had just gotten a lot more fun than Alicia had thought it would be when she came to work this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou once again felt the urge to throw up as the roller-coaster of Alicia\u2019s footsteps had stirred your stomach up once more. When you first realized where you were, you thought that trying to wriggle your way out would be your best bet. It had only taken another three of Alicia\u2019s steps for her foot to land on an ant that had wandered into her room\u2026the front half had been crushed and jammed into the tread with you for a few steps before it fell out somewhere in the hallway. Now, there was only one thing you wanted to do and that was stay crammed inside these rubber walls. Each of Alicia\u2019s steps threatened to knock you lose and leave you on the floor. There was no way in hell you were going to get lucky and end up in treads again\u2026if you fell out, you were fucked. It was for that very reason you felt like crying when the muffled, thunderous voices around you started to become clear whenever the foot you were trapped under lifted up. It was just one phrase that you\u2019d caught, but it crushed your spirit. Rock-Wall. Before you could even wrap your head around what you about to go through, the rubber walls around you groaned as Alicia crouched low\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHngh!\u201d she grunted as she threw herself up and managed to get one hand on the proper hold. The film started rolling and Alicia looked at the well-crafted wall of rough stone in front of her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://gamehorizon.gr/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gfsdgffgdgffd.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://gamehorizon.gr/wp-content/uploads...</a>). She laid her eyes on the next foothold and tried to hide the grin on her face; her little friend was the first one up it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour eyes went wide as the grey mass screamed toward you! \u201cS-Shit!\u201d you shouted, trying to brace yourself for the impact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Alexandra Nevaro and, until today, I was employed as a soccer referee. Currently though, my position had changed somewhat. I was chocking uncontrollably as I felt my fingers gripping tightly into the cloth wall to my left. Hands trembling, I tried to cover my mouth as I felt my stomach lurch for my throat. Painfully, I felt the bubbling sear of acid in my throat as I swallowed\u2026things smelled bad enough here without adding vomit to the mix. My head was throbbing like some asshole with a jackhammer had gotten inside as I wiped my mouth with my sleeve. It was a miracle I had made it this far, but looking up I began to doubt if I was going to get any further than this\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking up, I could see past the rocking wall of off-white to the tan tower that ran up almost endlessly. High, high above me sat Hope Solo, typing away on her I-phone, completely oblivious to me down here. Pushing down my stomach once again, I looked around. I\u2019d been clinging onto her sock for a while now, but still I had no idea how I was going to get out of this mess. The rumble of the bus under me was a constant reminder that this peaceful pace had a time-limit on it. If Hope began moving again like before though\u2026 there would be no way of getting noticed without getting killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope! Catch!\u201d someone yelled as Hope shifted above\u2026.it was a bad move for me.<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lost my grip on the sock wall in an instant as the hell of Hope\u2019s other foot slammed into the sandal I\u2019d been clinging onto (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/hopebrunette.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://prettytough.com/wp-content/upload...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!\u201d I yelled as I felt my fingers come loose from the bundles of fibers they held onto. I inhaled sharply as I prepared to tumble off the tall pedestal of her sandal to the cold, hard floor of the bus. Instead I lost my breath as I fell flat on my back on the familiar soft floor of\u2026another sandal? Looking around, I began laughing as I saw that by some stroke of luck, I fell onto Hope\u2019s other sandal! I felt like tears were welling up in my eyes as I tried to wipe my eyes, tears coming in faster than I could get rid of them. Inhaling sharply again, I tasted the stale, acrid flavor of Hope\u2019s sweaty feet again. Sitting up, I rubbed my eyes again and began looking around again. Where was I? It was definitely Hope\u2019s sandal, but where was her foot? A chill went down my spine as a thought sprang to mind. Slowly, I began looking up and felt my bowels try to drop out through my pants instead of spring through my mouth\u2026.. I was under Hope\u2019s raised heel. The dark shadow on the bottom of Hope\u2019s foot clearly outlined the stains of sweat she had imprinted on them throughout the game from today. It was like a dark grey footprint hung over your head as Hope fiddled with whatever had been thrown at her. My breathing got faster and faster as the adrenaline began flowing once again today. I needed out. I needed to move. I wanted to run. I wanted to freeze. I wanted to live. I couldn\u2019t think. It was all a buzz in my head as I heard a buzzing noise increasing in my ears as I started to flip over and try to get up. My body reacted a little too fast as I moved with too much force, falling flat on my face instead of sprinting away. In a frantic fancy of limbs, I failed getting up a few more times before finally getting to my feet properly and running. After just two steps, I suddenly felt a rush of wind behind me. For reasons I still don\u2019t get, I stopped and turned, looking over my shoulder for the source of the breeze. I brought myself face to foot with Hope\u2019s heel\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt like I was going to be crushed as her heel came down on me! The thick sock that nearly smothered me now seemed to be the only reason I wasn\u2019t reduced to a stain on the sock\u2026but that might not have been a blessing. Silently, the smell of sweat that was clinging to Hope\u2019s heel was slipping into my lungs. I\u2019d have been chocking if I could get enough breath to do so. The crushing pressure of Hope\u2019s heel kept me from doing so, leaving me to just deal with the rancid smell of her foot. With her incredible weight resting on me, I tried to move or struggle only to find my body now stuck into the foam sandal I was pressed against this whole time. It was like a trench, but also a tomb as Hope\u2019s heel continued to come down incrementally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuh!\u201d I screamed as Hope shifted her weight, almost crushing my legs as the pressure increased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fingers dug once again into her sock, groping blindly for some kind of miracle. Slowly, my fingers clawed and crawled forward along the thick bottom of Hope\u2019s sock\u2026.until I found a thin patch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d I grunted as I plunged my fingers into the sparser sewing, nails cutting tiny fibers and reaching\u2026till I finally hit the skin of Hope\u2019s heel. I dug my fingers into her skin as I prayed to God she\u2019d feel something. For what felt like hours I dug and scrapped my fingers along Hope\u2019s heel with nothing happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRRNNNN\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed suddenly as the sandal around me groaned, slowly Hope\u2019s heel began to lift! Unfortunately, I was now stuck to Hope\u2019s heel thanks to a slow seeping of sweat that seemed to fuse her clothes to mine. Suddenly, I felt a powerful force along my back, nearly breaking it! Turning, I wanted to scream and smile as Hope\u2019s nail dragged down my back; itching her heel fervently. Her sharp nail tore up my back, but as it ran down my leg it struck the sock just right. Falling back, I turned around just in time to grab hold of Hope\u2019s fingernail as it rubbed around the massive heel. I pressed myself close to the nail, hoping to be whisked away, but it was a short lived hope (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/001/307/348/600full-hope-solo_display_image.jpg?1316101778\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_roo...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope flexed her powerful toes as Hope\u2019s nail was quickly sent around to the front of her massive foot and I was plunged down under her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a blessing in disguise that Hope had itched between her big and second toe. Although I was now under the thick blanket of sock wrapping them, I wasn\u2019t under her crushing heel. A new way out was needed now as I slowly got up, hands pressing up against the thick sock to give myself some room. It was then I noticed the problem of this new place\u2026it was impossible to know where I was going. I started wandering, hoping that if I ran into a toe, I could try to rub it and get Hope\u2019s attention once again. Pushing forward, I began wondering how the hell I would even go about finding a toe in what was a sock-based fog that I\u2019d never be able to penetrate. Stopping, I picked a direction and began taking slow, pointed steps, counting aloud so I could find my way back\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForty-seven, Forty-eight, Forty-\u201dI was counting when I finally ran face-first into a massive wall! I\u2019d never been so thankfully to hit a wall as I began pulling against the sock to get closer to the enclosed toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slammed into the thing with all my might!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran into it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hit the toe as hard as I could\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRNNNNN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like magic as the sky began to lift again. The thick fabric-fog was gone as I looked out down the isle of the bus where Hope\u2019s foot was resting (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media2.whosaystatic.com/208508/208508_602x602.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media2.whosaystatic.com/208508/20...</a>). I tensed up, ready to leap for the finger when it came down to itch. Instead, I suddenly found myself face-first in the sandal once again\u2026. Now I was pinned under her big toe. It was like having a car parked on top of me as I began thrashing, terrified about the titanic toe pressing down on me before I got out! Gasping for air, Hope\u2019s toe drummed on me, nearly breaking my back. Clawing at the sandal, I tried to get forward when suddenly the toe lifted off\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping onto my back, I saw the sock-clad foot high above me. Hope had removed it from the sandal as she\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two of them were incredible on and off the field. Talented and beautiful, no one could deny that Alex Morgan and Hope Solo were incredible women in their own right; but being next to both of them was almost like a narcotic high. Now, this also could have been due to the drug cocktail you had to take in order to shrink yourself, but that was neither here nor there. Between the beautiful women you were between, the magical fluid running through your veins, and the wad of cash you received for this job. You were on cloud nine as you began fiddling with your camera. You just had to take one snapshot of them candidly, but there was no reason you couldn\u2019t enjoy the ride. As you took your camera out of your bag, you failed to notice something important\u2026Hope\u2019s cleat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were knocked down as Hope\u2019s cleat landed on top of you. The only thing that spared you was the cleat\u2019s bottom; the pillars surrounding you had spared you from being a stain on her sole. Getting up, you shook your head. The thundering now made your head spin. Clutching it, you tried to stop the ringing and spinning, but as you opened your eyes you noticed something worse\u2026 much worse. While your camera was mostly intact, the bag you had pulled it out from was stuck under one of the black pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!\u201d you yelled as you ran to your bag and began pulling on it, trying to remove it from under Hope\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hope\u2019s foot moved once again, you heard the sound you had been dreading. Wet ooze came out of your bag as the high quickly disappeared. The drug to return you to normal was now oozing all over the floor, the syringe needed for it was also most likely broken. Your headache from the stomp was now a mini-migraine as you realized you needed to go with your back-up, back-up plan. Running out from under her cleat, you turned around and got the idea of what there was to deal with. It was depressing. Hope\u2019s normally big foot was now massive as you saw it stretch out even longer than you had seen some stadiums! Her foot was about as big as the stadium they had been playing in today you realized as Hope was busy working on her phone high above. Looking around, you needed a way to get up\u2026when you finally saw her dangling lace (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.eastbay.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/hope-solo2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://blog.eastbay.com/wp-content/uploa...</a>). It was a well-used pair of cleats you realized as you saw how tattered and frayed her lace was. Slowly approaching it, you wondered about how easy it would be to get up it as the bus hit a bump in the road. You were tossed up in the air\u2026as was Hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now horrified as you realized you had now come close to being crushed under Hope\u2019s foot twice now. Her lace, fortunately, was now a lot closer as it lay on top of you. Grunting, you pushed yourself out from under it and grabbed hold of the coarse fibers. Quickly, you began pulling yourself up it, like you were climbing for gym class. As you finally made it to the real meat of her cleat, you could put your own feet against the leather side of her shoe. Now you were climbing even better than before as you were now like a mountain climber scaling a menacing hill. As Hope shifted through the ride, you began to think that maybe climbing up her cleat wasn\u2019t such a good idea. Making it to the top of her cleat, you finally jumped into the ditch before you, the tongue of Hope\u2019s cleat. Now you were moving forward, ducking under the thick wires of lace that lined your path. The mountain of her foot was growing steeper as you neared your destination, the tip of the tongue of Hope\u2019s cleat. Standing at the base of it, you began climbing the stitches, holding yourself to the logo as you mantled the mosaic of patterns above you. As you reached the top of her cleat and expected to see a way up\u2026only to see that there was a twenty foot gulf between the tongue of Hope\u2019s cleat and her foot! You were exhausted and aggravated by the time it dawned on you that this was no longer an option for you. Looking down into the valley below, you saw that Hope\u2019s foot was shifting ever so slightly! An updraft of scent washed over you like a reverse waterfall as Hope shifted again. The powerful, musky smell nearly knocked you out, making you stagger as your vision began to go hazy. Nausea began to run through you as you covered your mouth to fight back the rising bile. Unfortunately, your now unanchored feet were unprepared for the sudden shift Hope took\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned as Hope tilted her cleat to the side, sliding it across the floor of the bus. Falling against the rough roof of the tongue of her cleat, you watched as Alex\u2019s bare foot was suddenly growing closer at an alarming rate (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alex-Morgan-Feet-1125160.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alex-Morgan-Fee...</a>)! Just as you thought the sudden increase in G-Force from Hope\u2019s movements was going to knock you out, her foot suddenly stopped! You were launched forwards towards the tan towering mountain of flesh that was Alex\u2019s flip-flop clad foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTumbling through the air, you feared that you would miss her foot completely and hurtle into the cold, hard floor! Fortunately, you landed on the soft, warm, if not slick surface of Alex\u2019s foot, just even with her ankle. Quickly, you began sliding down like you were on a waterslide! All around you were droplets of sweat clinging to Alex\u2019s foot, making it look like a veritable sea. As you slid quickly down the length of Alex\u2019s foot, you splashed through dozens of these droplets, soaking yourself to the marrow as you went. To make matters even worse\u2026 you weren\u2019t sliding straight down her foot. You were headed sharply to the side!!! Flipping onto your stomach, you dug your fingers into Alex\u2019s skin, hoping to slow yourself down. It was too little, too late as you suddenly began to plummet off the side of Alex\u2019s bare foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, you free-fell off the side of Alex\u2019s foot, landed with a small splash in a tiny puddle of sweat that had collected in the depressions made by her foot. As you lay there for a moment, exhausted and on the verge of passing out\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking up, you tried to find out where you were on the damn thing, but your head was still spinning after the fall from Hope\u2019s sneaker. As you tried to stand up, you felt like you were on violent seas as you instantly fell on your ass. Closing your eyes, you tried to make things stand still as quickly as possible, before the worst could happen. You didn\u2019t make it in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou had just gone from trying to make the world stand still, to having the sky fall on you as Alex planted her foot down flat on her flip-flops. High above, Alex was busy checking her phone as she leaned back in the seat of the bus. She pressed her toes into her flip-flops unconsciously as she scrolled through endless updates and messages on her screen. Down under her foot, your head had finally stopped spinning, but now you were busy pressing against the unyielding ceiling that kept coming down on you bit-by-bit. Your hands sunk into her skin only a little bit before they hit into resistance\u2026like a huge plate was underneath the mass of flesh above you. Looking around in the dim light that seeped through, you realized quickly the reason for this sensation; you were under Alex\u2019s heel. Your attempt to push her foot off of you finally came to an end as your hands slipped on her sweat-soaked sole! It felt like you were hit by a heavy-weight champion as Alex\u2019s heel finally settled down on you fully (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alex-Morgan-Feet-1241539.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alex-Morgan-Fee...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou see what they said about our next game?\u201d Alex said as she thrust her phone in Hope\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot when you put the screen that close to me,\u201d Hope said as she pushed Alex\u2019s hand back playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey say you\u2019re going to be in trouble if you don\u2019t step it up. See? It\u2019s not just me that rides your ass,\u201d Alex chirped as she went back to her phone, not giving any heed to the anger that flashed across Hope\u2019s face for a moment. Annoyed, Hope began looking for where she left her water bottle on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally, Alex\u2019s heel lifted off of you as you slowly stood for the first time in a while. Looking around, you tried to figure out a way off of Alex\u2019s flip-flop, but got distracted as something tremendous blocked out the sun that was shining in. Hope was scanning the ground near you as your body suddenly had live breathed back into it. Quickly, you began shouting, waving, and jumping like a maniac in order to get Hope\u2019s attention. As her massive eyes finally traced over your area, you saw them grow wide and pause as you made direct eye contact with a goddess\u2026at least briefly before Alex\u2019s heel came down on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Alex said as she leaned forward in her seat, pressing the tiny person Hope thought she just saw under her heel mercilessly. Rubbing her eyes, Hope looked up at Alex blankly and weighed the options of telling her what she thought she just witnessed\u2026.then decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust looking for my water,\u201d Hope said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, alright,\u201d Alex said as she leaned back and plugged in her headphones before tuning out to music\u2026.her feet sliding out of their flip-flops and leaving behind the tiny person. He hadn\u2019t been a hallucination after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGroggily, you pushed yourself up once more after getting blindsided by Alex\u2019s foot. Looking back up at Hope, you felt a wave of relief wash over you as you saw the most beautiful thing you\u2019d seen all day\u2026her waving at you and smiling (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hope-solo-chest-tattoo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/u...</a>). You were about to begin walking towards her when once again Alex\u2019s foot decided that it wasn\u2019t done with you yet\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis time, her foot ran you over from behind as it rushed forward to the thong of the flip flop. For a second, as you were crammed between Alex\u2019s big and second toe, you thought that you\u2019d be crushed against the thick plastic pillar\u2026 but you were saved (for lack of a better word) as you were quickly pulled under the advancing foot. This time, you were left half-buried under the ball of Alex\u2019s foot, your upper torso exposed as her feet arched up over you like tan titans. You struggle to crawl out from under her hulking foot, but find the pressure is too great on your waist to get loose. Looking around, you saw that there was still easily more than a football field worth of space left of Alex\u2019s flip flop as Hope giggled from above (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alex-Morgan-Feet-842555.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alex-Morgan-Fee...</a>). Looking up at her pitifully, you waited for her to offer you some kind of help\u2026instead she just waved at you\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlex once again lowered her foot on you, crushing your face flat into the insole of her flip-flop. Hope laughed as she watched you get helplessly get manhandled by Alex\u2019s foot for a few more minutes. When Alex finally kicked the flip-flops off again, Hope quickly reached down for you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thesportsbank.net/core/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/hope-solo-hat.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thesportsbank.net/core/wp-con...</a>). In one swift move, she snagged you and her water bottle as she looked around to make sure no one was listening. Alex had thankfully fallen asleep as Hope lifted you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk, so spill. How did you get like this?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou paused for a second before\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The little thing looked deeply conflicted as Hope began to lose patience with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I really shouldn\u2019t say\u2026\u201d he replied meekly as Hope dropped the nice-act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I found you under Alex\u2019s foot and I will be more than happy to put you back there if you\u2019re going to be unhelpful like this,\u201d Hope warned, her tone growing more severe with each passing word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bathroom!

Slowly, Hope\u2019s smile grew bigger as she began to lower the shrunken one back towards the ground! He thought Hope was just going to put him in her lap or something\u2026 until he suddenly found he was passing Hope\u2019s knees. Looking up at her, the shrunken man nearly pissed himself as he saw Hope now smiling down at him almost manically. He began trying to get free, but Hope\u2019s fingers held onto him too tightly\u2026he was trapped. As he continued to wriggle between her fingers, the tiny man kept trying to figure out what had gone wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you what you wanted, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you down there dude, just hold still,\u201d Hope said as she lightly flicked him in the forehead, making him go limp as he was briefly knocked out. The giant goalie giggled as she put him back where she found him\u2026at Alex\u2019s feet. Hope couldn\u2019t stop smiling as she pushed him gently under Alex\u2019s flip-flop. She watched in anticipation, wondering if he would wake up before Alex crushed him\u2026. It was her own personal game show at the moment\u2026and the contestant was just getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man woke up with a splitting headache as he once again found himself in darkness. Trying to stand up, he smacked his head into something soft above him. Looking up, he saw a flat sloping ceiling towered over him. The slight grooves in the roof held what looked like suspended boulders and clumps of earth. Bright shafts of sunlight seeping in from the cracks in the side made his eyes sting as his throbbing head seemed to be trying to work something out. This place was oddly familiar, but he couldn\u2019t place why\u2026actually, he couldn\u2019t remember the last few minutes either if he was being honest. Rubbing his head, the little man didn\u2019t notice that for the last few minutes the ceiling above him was slowly lowering! Getting up, he tried to crouch, but found that there was still no space to move. Crawling on his stomach then, the tiny man began to make his way to the side of this odd cave. As he kept crawling, the little man finally noticed his misfortune\u2026the room was becoming smaller and smaller by the second. Frantic now, he began crawling as quickly as he could to the entrance! Breaching the open air, he tried to make the final pull\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a shrill scream as his leg broke under the weight of the still-falling ceiling. Looking around, he finally remembered where he was\u2026on the floor of a bus. His eyes shot up as he saw he was being slowly crushed under Alex\u2019s foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you almost made it too,\u201d Hope mused from above as his eyes darted to her. He stared at her speechless until another surge of pain went through him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis leg was gone; he was screaming bloody-murder as he looked to see his entire lower-body was pinned under Alex\u2019s advancing foot! A warm pool of crimson began to form under him as he desperately struggled to get out\u2026but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!\u201d he screamed as he began to get dizzy and fell face-first down. Looking up, he could only see Hope waving goodbye to him as she smiled cruelly (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5zlu1UTxj1r2wnvjo2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5zlu1...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQUISH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope watched as Alex\u2019s foot cleanly bisected him. The tiny top-half laid bare on the bus floor, twitching as it tried to pathetically crawl away. It made it about half an inch before Alex\u2019s foot moved once again\u2026engulfing the little man completely. As the foot came down, Hope giggled as she saw a small spurt of crimson spray out, painting the side of Alex\u2019s foot as she finally rested her weight down on it (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alexandra-Morgan-Feet-842954.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Alexandra-Morga...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the bus came to a halt and the players began to file out, Hope slipped into the bathroom and found the shrinking serum the tiny man had told her about. Slipping the vials into her bag, Hope smiled as she got off the bus. Turning a vial of it over in her hands, she wondered who she could use it on\u2026until she spotted exactly what she wanted. A perfect guinea pig appeared before her; a lone player from the other team, who was slipping into the women\u2019s bathroom. Hope looked to be sure no one was following her as she slipped into the bathroom and locked the door behind her. Just as Hope walked in, the other girl exited the stall. She froze as Hope suddenly lurched at her, pressing her against the wall. Popping the stopper off the vial, Hope shoved it into the struggling girls mouth and watched the liquid drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope suddenly fell right into the stall door as nothing but air stood between it and her. Looking down in excitement, Hope began laughing as she saw a tiny speck moving around by her feet. Lifting her cleat up, Hope slammed it down on the dot\u2026only to see it still running away from her! She stomped a few more times and checked the bottom of her cleats to find no splatters (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.topdrawersoccer.com/the91stminute/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Hope2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.topdrawersoccer.com/the91stmi...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re too tiny to crush in cleats\u2026how unlucky for you,\u201d Hope said as she found the speck on the floor and reached for it happily. Plucking it up, she made her way out of the bathroom and was on her way to the locker-rooms when she saw members of the other team unpacking their things from the bus. Hope smiled broadly as she saw two water-coolers getting filled by an unattended hose on the side. Slipping over to them, Hope looked down at her \u201clittle friend\u201d and smiled as she dropped another few vials of serum into the water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Get away from there,\u201d someone on the team shouted as Hope quickly dashed away to her own teams locker-room. She now couldn\u2019t wait for the start of the game!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside the German team\u2019s locker room, players were getting to a fever pitch. The players were all pouring in after a long warm-up on the field. A problem with their stadium at home had resulted in a few days off from practice, and the coach was not going to let her team lose to the Americans because her girls weren\u2019t properly warmed up. Wiping sweat from innumerable brows, players lined up and pushed past each other to get at the water jugs. Most had already gone through their own water bottles during the warm up, and after the last round of drills, the ladies were dying as they gulped down cup after cup of the cool water. Looks passed back and forth between players; there was a lot riding on this match and the nerves were making the girls thirstier than normal. Within only a few minutes, all the water Hope had tainted was sloshing around in the stomach of one player or another\u2026even in the coach\u2019s belly. None of the woman in that room knew that by the end of the day, their lives as they knew them would never be the same\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeine Damen, es ist Zeit zu beginnen. Bitte machen Sie sich bereit.\u201d A stadium attendant said, letting the German team know that the game would begin soon. The girls quickly poured what little water was left into their bottles and began sipping as they headed out onto the field. The bright sunlight struck the players as they spied the American\u2019s across the field. Anna, a new striker, saw Hope Solo smiling at them smugly\u2026they couldn\u2019t afford to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGewinnen!\u201d the girls shouted as they ran out onto the field, breaking their huddle. The team quickly took possession of the ball and began charging down the field, looking for a hole in the American team\u2019s defense to charge through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, across the field, Hope couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing\u2026namely a full-sized German team. Hope knew the stuff worked\u2026maybe they had dumped out the water? Maybe no one had drank yet? Either way, the goalie was not happy that her fun prank had essentially been ruined. Now she had to play a real game as a German striker was poised to charge down the field. Shaking off her disappointment, Hope saw the striker side-step their defense and start heading towards her. Frustrated still from her prank gone wrong, Hope decided to start off the game with a bang as she too started running out of the goal. The striker wouldn\u2019t move Hope didn\u2019t have to worry about a feint; it was just going to be a flat out contest of speed. Pushing her legs into the semi-soft ground as hard as she could, Hope jumped and prepared to dive for the ball as the striker wound up her leg, well inside the goalie box\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope was laying on the floor, looking up at the roof of the stadium as the crowd was screaming in apparent disbelief. Slowly sitting up, Hope let the soccer ball fall into her lap as she then felt another tiny object strike her stomach softly. Looking down, Hope couldn\u2019t contain her smile\u2026 a tiny, crumpled; bloody hunk of German striker was collapsed in her lap (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8016/7647829826_8345cfbe66_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8016/76478...</a>). The stuff had worked wonders! Getting up, Hope let the Barbie-doll sized body land in the mud before planting her cleat on it and pressing down as she bent over and brushed dirt off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope stood up and tossed the ball to her teammates, no one quite sure of what they had just seen. Now in a footprint in the mud, even the dying German striker\u2019s mind was replaying those final moments over and over again in her head\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna had been running down the field, a lucky break as the defender marking her moved a little too slowly and Anna broke past. Now she had only one opponent left, the damn goalie. Anna saw as her last obstacle stood her ground, crouching forward as if she was going to get ready to run. <br>\r\nThe fresh striker knew the strategy was to try and pull Hope away from goal and then side-step with a clear shot\u2026but as the goalie started coming at her, Anna just gave way to her own frustration. She wanted to see the look of awe on that bitch\u2019s face when she shot on goal right under her! They were just a hair\u2019s breadth apart when Anna rose her leg up into the air for a full-strength shot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna swung her leg into thin air as she suddenly saw the soccer ball towering over her like a small greenhouse\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas zur H\u00f6lle?!\u201d Anna yelled as suddenly an even darker shadow was cast over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her right, Anna was bewildered as she saw a cleat the size of a minivan suddenly planted in the mud next to her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://kmpblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Nike-Plus-Hope-Solo_detail.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://kmpblog.com/wp-content/uploads/20...</a>). Dumbstruck, Anna was motionless as she was suddenly slammed into by the ball she had been dribbling down field so well. It was like getting hit by a truck as she found herself suddenly airborne, tumbling around the ball like she was a satellite in orbit. For a brief second, Anna saw a flash of a very familiar face before suddenly slamming into another, somewhat softer wall! As she was flattened against it, Anna looked forward and screamed as a very familiar object was racing towards her\u2026the soccer ball. It crashed into her even harder than before as the soft wall behind her suddenly tensed up like steel, grinding her into what felt like a sloping slab of cement! Stuck now between the ball and a hard place, Anna struggled to breathe, inhaling only the stale, acrid smell she recognized all too well as sweat! Thrashing now in a panic, Anna tried to press the ball away from her only to have it come crashing down harder as it was suddenly pressed even closer to her. With sickening snaps, Anna began screaming at the searing pain going up her now shattered arms. Her cries of protest were cut short though as the ball suddenly pressed against her face. A mix of earth and leather now forced itself into Anna\u2019s mouth as the crushing pressure grew even more unbearable. The last few moments seemed to go by incredibly slowly as Anna\u2019s body struggled to find a way out of this mess\u2026but to no avail. It just turned into excruciating seconds with the only sound in Anna\u2019s ears being her own ragger breathing as her body was flattened\u2026and a deep gurgling noise from behind the steely wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nearly passed out as the final press of pressure broke more bones than she cared to think about. Then, almost cruelly, instead of finishing her off, the ball removed itself, leaving Anna stuck to the wall for a few seconds before she ultimately peeled off and tumbled into a soft hammock of fabric. Just like when they entered the field, the sun was blinding as Anna knew she must have been going nuts. It looked like she was now cradled in Hope Solo\u2019s lap (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5duvqqB211qgqsks.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5duvqqB2...</a>). To Anna\u2019s horror though, it wasn\u2019t a dream\u2026which was reinforced when Hope stood up, letting her limp body crash painfully into the field! Anna began to cry and shout for help as Hope looked down at her and smirked; her massive cleat now hanging above her\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna\u2019s head was crushed instantly underneath one of the spikes on Hope\u2019s cleat\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the field, Hope bit her lip as one by one the members of the German team started to dwindle in size. It wasn\u2019t uniform, leaving players ranging from a little over a foot tall to below and inch littering the field as the American players looked on in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScore already!\u201d Hope yelled, spurring her team to action as the diminished Germans began to panic, either trying to play the game normally still or running in horror as the wave of giantesses charged towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the worst massacres on the field happened to  German player who was\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The field which had been littered with, stereotypically angry, German players has now been replaced with what looked like a few garden ornaments slowly shuffling towards her as her own legs glided past them. Alex gracefully wound her leg up and let it rip; Alex\u2019s cleat connected beautifully with the ball, sending it flying as it went soaring into the air right into a\u2026well empty goal (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www4.pictures.stylebistro.com/gi/Alex+Morgan+Athletic+Shoes+Cleats+l2ChoBfeo1Ql.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www4.pictures.stylebistro.com/gi/...</a>). Her feet planted powerfully in the muddy field, Alex looked behind her and saw that of the whole German team, only three of them were left above a foot tall, the others must have been lost in the grass. Wiping a bead of sweat from her brow, Alex went into the goal and grabbed the ball, walking it back to the center of the field to begin the next step in what was sure to be an easy game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOM!.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNadine covered her ears as a wave of dust and dirt washed over her like a wave. Coughing, she looked up at the towering wall of leather above her as Alex Morgan\u2019s cleat now loomed menacingly over her. Staring up in disbelief, the shrunken goalie shielded her eyes from the blinding sun shining down on her, which left her dreadfully unaware of the object falling towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNadine screamed as a thick length of cable crashed not even a few feet away from her. Swallowing the heart that had leapt into her throat, Nadine\u2019s head was spinning as she realized she was actually staring at one of Alex Morgan\u2019s cleat laces (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://365.worldsoccershop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/UA-ClutchFit-laces-closeup.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://365.worldsoccershop.com/wp-conten...</a>). The glaring sun suddenly disappeared behind Alex\u2019s torso as she bent down to retrieve the ball. Out of what could only be called pure animal instinct, Nadine jumped and grabbed onto the closest thing to a life-line she had been presented with\u2026the thick lace of her giant opponent\u2019s cleat. Nadine\u2019s fingers clutched into the thick ropes that made up the lace as Alex began to take her next step. For the tiny German goalie, it was like a rollercoaster had just launched off as she was quickly racing through the air faster than she had gone in her entire life. As the air whipped her face, Nadine was terrified that her fingers would lose their grip at any moment and leave her tumbling off into the tall jungle of grass. Her eyes were tearing just as the foot began to fall, the lace hit the ground first\u2026unfortunately it was below Alex\u2019s approaching foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tScreaming, Nadine found herself suddenly between two colossal treads as Alex\u2019s foot began to sink into the wet mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHolt mich hier raus!\u201d Nadine shouted as the ceiling began to rumble, dirt falling onto her as it came loose from the treads. Nadine began frantically climbing forwards as the brief lull in activity under Alex\u2019s foot scared the \u201cSchei\u00dfe\u201d out of her. Inching forward, Nadine made only a little progress as Alex\u2019s tremendous foot began to lift once again\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlex placed the ball down in the center of the field as the American team formed up. The referee looked around with incredible confusion as she saw only some toddler sized players stumbling through, what was to them, waist high grass to try and get ready. Unable to see the other players, the ref just waited until these players were in position. A grueling twelve minutes later, the referee reluctantly started the next point\u2026 While the players on the American side of the field were bored, the long break was a god-send for Nadine who had made it all the way up to the tongue of Alex\u2019s cleat when the whistle blast nearly deafened her. What was worse was the sudden burst of power as Alex\u2019s foot moved forward to go for the ball (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://coolspotters.com/files/photos/709063/alex-morgan-and-us-home-away-and-goalkeeper-womens-white-soccer-socks-gallery.jpg?1357435805\" target=\"_blank\">http://coolspotters.com/files/photos/709...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNadine\u2019s body was killing her as she fell down into the canyon that now existed to her between the inner wall of Alex\u2019s cleat and her incredibly massive sock-clad foot. After falling what seemed like 50ft into the abyss, Nadine found herself pressed into the surprisingly plush surface of Alex\u2019s thick socks. The problem with that was that trying to get off of them was like trying to get up in deep snow\u2026utterly impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Alex\u2019s foot hit the ground once more, Nadine bounced off her cotton canopy and began to plummet into the abyss once more. Grabbing for anything, Nadine gripped tightly into the sock only to have it ripped out of her hands as Alex\u2019s foot lifted up in the air again. Over and over again this happened until finally, Nadine found herself where she least wanted to be: on the floor of Alex\u2019s cleat. Getting up, Nadine pushed herself to the wall of Alex\u2019s cleat as she looked up at the monolithic mountain of cotton that was the American\u2019s foot. The entrance to the cleat that Nadine had fallen into now looked like it was at the top of a skyscraper\u2026. Totally depressed, Nadine began to cry and scream for help, right until Alex\u2019s foot lifted into the air again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNadine was suffocating below Alex\u2019s sock as it was now planted on top of her. It was like being in a cotton coffin, the weight of Alex\u2019s body only sparing her thanks to the cushion of sock that was coincidently killing Nadine much more slowly. High above, Alex didn\u2019t even notice the tiny woman dying under her foot as she got another goal on the diminutive team of Germans (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b0/4d/b8/b04db8648eab172bdd585d1259696001.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a>).\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe ref had had enough, the game was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWalking off the field\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t dare move a muscle as her right foot tensed up uncomfortably. It was like she was trying to balance on one foot as she slowly began to lift her foot off the ground and shift it back, her eyes scanning the ground with a mix of excitement and apprehension. Slowly, she moved her cleat out of the fresh footprint she made in the damp grass and began bending down. Her mind was flying at a mile a minute. Any other day, she wouldn\u2019t have even noticed the tiny sensation of something stiff under her foot, but today was a very special day. Already, all around the field, Nahomi saw her teammates each plucking from the grass their own individual German player. The American team was supposed to see them all \u201csafely\u201d back until something could be figured out for them. From the instant the German players shrunk down, Nahomi couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how much fun it would be to have one of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind of a tom-boy growing up, Nahomi thought the idea of messing around with a shrunken player who could literally do nothing against her was so fucking cool! While most of the easy to find players were snatched up, Nahomi was now carefully searching the grass for, what she hoped, would be her first bullying victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCringing in the grass below, Abi was clutching her leg as hot tears ran down her face. The canopy of grass above her had shielded her from the worst of the giant woman\u2019s forceful footstep, but her leg (while not broken) was certainly sprained or fractured somewhere. The spike of the cleat had nearly crushed Abi who had been running from the thunderous footfall of Nahomi to no avail. Now looking up at the giantess\u2019s smiling face through the thick blades of grass, Abi just hoped she would remain hidden long enough for Nahomi to get bored and leave her to her own devices. Closing her eyes as the fingers began probing through the thick canopy, Abi prayed that the giantess would give up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\u201d Abi screamed as she felt something massive against her hurting leg. Eyes shooting up, she was terrified as she saw two, tree-trunk sized fingers pinching her leg painfully between them. In an instant she was yanked up through the grass and before the amused eyes of Nahomi. Screaming in shock and in pain, the tiny player looked into the enthusiastic eyes of Nahomi like the American was some kind of monster (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://d13uygpm1enfng.cloudfront.net/article-imgs/en/2012/07/14/AJ201207140035/AJ201207140036M.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://d13uygpm1enfng.cloudfront.net/ar...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d Nahomi chirped, her voice booming in Abi\u2019s sensitive ears as the little woman hung from her now broken leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaaaaaaah!\u201d Abi shouted as she gripped her leg, her fingers digging into herself as though they wanted to physically rip out the pain she was experiencing. Nahomi just frowned as she got up and looked at the leg she was grasping critically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck, I got a broken one? Figures,\u201d the giantess said as she stuffed the screaming woman into her waistband and began walking towards the benches to retrieve her water bottle. Nahomi was already grumbling by the time she began swigging from her water bottle. Of all the tinies on the field, she just HAD to get the broken one! Taking another long swig, Nahomi felt her guest wriggling a little too much. Annoyed, she grabbed it by the broken leg again and yanked it into the air before enatly dropping it into her water bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi was nearly drowning as she fell into the tumultuous waters, with only one leg to kick; she sank below the surface several times as the unflinching eyes of Nahomi stared at her, a smile breaking on the giantess\u2019s face once again.  As Abi tried desperately to keep her head above the water, Nahomi giggled, her booming voice echoing inside the bottle like thunder. Apparently, this was just the sort of thing Nahomi had in mind when she found the tiny woman, maybe a broken tiny wasn\u2019t a broken toy after all; Nahomi decided it was time to have a little more fun with her new find. For Abi though, things went from bad to worse as Nahomi slowly began to tilt the bottle back\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of the bottle soon became a waterfall as Abi saw cascading currents running right into Nahomi\u2019s open mouth. With the bottle suspended in the air, Nahomi didn\u2019t so much sip as swallow the current immediately, letting the long river of liquid run directly to her awaiting stomach below (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Nahomi+Kawasumi+South+Korea+v+Japan+Women+1Ps4-rmPNJnl.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Nahom...</a>). Screaming, Abi watched as she came closer and closer to the waterfall at the top of the bottle. She was terrified as she heard the never-ending series of swallows that allowed pools of water down the throat of the giantess. Finally, as she entered the top of the bottle, she looked over her shoulder at the drop below. Terrified, she tried desperately to make herself bigger, to get stuck in the top of the bottle. Her hands clawed at the smooth plastic walls, hoping to get stuck, but they slipped on the wet walls\u2026then she went over the edge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\u201d Abi screamed as she fell towards what she thought would be her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrashing hard onto the enamel surface of Nahomi\u2019s teeth, Abi looked in confusion as the water drained between the pearly white walls. A second later, the giant woman\u2019s fingers were around her again as she was suddenly lifted off just in time to get hit with a blast of AC and the familiar smell of old sweat\u2026they had made it to the locker room. Quickly, Abi was dangling at Nahomi\u2019s side as the empty water bottle she had been prisoner of was tossed in the trash. Shivering now, Abi looked around at the titans filling the locker room\u2026and all her teammates at their mercy! The shrunken player saw as girls she had trained and played with were underfoot, or carried like toys, some were tossed in the air; others were fleeing from overly excited Americans who chased like a cat playing with a mouse. Apparently, her teams \u201ccaretakers\u201d were all of the same mind-set as her captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNahomi catch!\u201d another player said as a small vial of water was thrown at the forward. Catching it, Nahomi looked at her teammate with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell is this?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope said if you pour it on them, they get smaller. Lots of girls have been doing it, shit\u2019s great!\u201d the player said as she walked away, a tiny German player struggling to get out of her waistband as her hips gently swayed with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I found our next game,\u201d Nahomi said smiling as she looked down at her broken toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLANG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahomi whipped her locker open as she gently tossed Abi inside, letting her land on her bag while she began to take off her cleats. Looking up at the tiny German player, Nahomi smiled and quickly reached under her, shifting the mountain of fabric the tiny woman was upon. In a second, a thick pair of sports flip-flops were pulled out and unceremoniously dropped on the cold tile floor. Giggling, Nahomi pointed up at Abi and back down to the flip-flops commandingly. Abi just looked at her dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNein!\u201d Abi protested as Nahomi pointed at the footwear again, motioning to her broken leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, you\u2019re going to make me do all the work?\u201d Nahomi sighed as she reached into the locker and snatched a defiant Abi from her bag. Giggling, Nahomi let Abi struggle for a second, enjoying the feel of her tiny fists pounding uselessly on her hand before she allowed her fingers to uncurl, letting the doll-sized woman fall flat on her flip-flops. As the tiny thing writhed in pain from its leg, Nahomi stopped fiddling with her laces and grabbed the vial of water she\u2019d been given. Uncorking it, she gave it a quick sniff. The giantess shrugged as she positioned the glass tube above the tiny woman\u2019s head and began tilting it over\u2026 a few droplets fell out soaking her. Gasping, Nahomi couldn\u2019t stop the exuberant smile from spreading over her lips as the tiny woman on her flip flop began to get even smaller! If it was a doll before, now she had a bug sitting in the imprint her big toe had left on the well-worn, post-game shoes. Re-corking the vial, Nahomi was now beaming down at her bug-sized toy as she hastily undid the laces of her cleat and began pulling her massive sock-clad feet free! As they burst from their shoes, even Nahomi\u2019s nostrils were assaulted by the smell. Smiling, she slowly placed a foot on either side of the flip-flops and watched as the little bug below scuttled around trying to escape\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Giggling Nahomi....</span></div></div>",

Still soaking in whatever that liquid was, the German player looked up at the now mountain-sized American with tears brimming in her eyes. She watched in agony as the giantess giggled (her voice booming like thunder) as her titanic hand waved in front of her nose, reacting to the smell that had totally polluted the air down on these massive flip-flops in a matter of seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDamn! I need a shower huh?\u201d Nahomi said as she reached down and did the one thing Abi feared most in this situation; the giantess began to remove her socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was like a blast of fetid wind as the first sock was slowly stripped off of Nahomi\u2019s foot. If the smell from before had been bad, the one now assaulting Abi made it seem like nothing. The overpowering odor of Nahomi\u2019s bare foot was literally suffocating Abi as the tiny woman struggled to breathe without throwing up. Chocking back bile, Abi pinched her nose and tried breathing through her mouth; but the thick must of the giantess\u2019s feet still left a rancid taste in her mouth as the shadow of her colossal foot hovered over the flip flop for a second before once again being put down on the side (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5341/7051038877_68cedac014_z.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5341/70510...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbi looked up in confusion as her stomach continued to revolt against the horrific atmosphere. High above, and safe from the smell below, Nahomi was once again pulling off the cap of the vial. If she wasn\u2019t so busy already fighting the urge to vomit, Abi would be feeling sick from fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow small can this shit make you anyway?\u201d Nahomi wondered aloud as she bent down, her nostrils flaring as they were greeted by the powerful smell of her feet. Pushing through it, the vial was once again hovered over Abi as the tiny, bug-sized woman laid prone in the imprint of Nahomi;s big toe. Carefully, Nahomi stifled a giggle as she dripped a few more tiny (to her anyway) droplets of the potent poison onto her flip flop. Soon, the imprint of her big toe looked more like a shallow, glimmering pool than its usual appearance as a grimy shadow on Nahomi\u2019s flip-flop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNahomi\u2019s toes thundered as they \u201clightly\u201d tapped next to the flip-flop. The water had done a number on Abi, who now appeared to be only a speck in the lake of water she was suspended in. A few seconds ago, she would have considered herself a giant as she saw that the vomit she had let loose before next to the lake of shrinking water would have easily filled a private pool! Looking up, she could no longer even comprehend the giantess above her. Everything seemed to move in slow motion as Nahomi began to lean down. The American was the largest thing her eyes had ever seen as the approaching face now seemed to be twice the size of the stadium she had been playing in. It was like a divine intervention as the colossal face now hovered over her. Every exhale that passed between Nahomi\u2019s lips was like a typhoon as it created surges of water in the lake of her big toe. Titanic eyes the size of parking lots scanned the waters looking for Abi without any luck. And while all of this was terrifying for Abi, the shrunken woman was not ignorant of the canyon-sized smile plastered on Nahomi\u2019s face. As the giantess\u2019s mouth opened to speak, the words just sounded like thunder, incomprehensible as their sheer force shook her bones while she struggled to not slip below the surface of the lake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBahahahaha! I guess I overdid it, huh shrimp?\u201d Nahomi said as she looked everywhere for the little woman in the water droplets. All she could see where dozens of tiny specks of dirt. Nahomi sat back up and began laughing hysterically as she thought about the tiny doll-sized woman from before clinging onto one of those specks as a life-raft, or maybe even climbing on it like an island!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny this time?\u201d a familiar voice said from behind Nahomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis shit is great!\u201d Nahomi said as she turned around to look at Hope Solo and Alex Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Hope said, amused as she saw her teammates all playing with the German team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou get a player?\u201d Alex asked curiously peeking around Hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYup!\u201d Nahomi said, giggling as she pulled off her other sock and shoved it in her locker while she grabbed her shower-gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell where is she?\u201d Hope asked curiously while Nahomi continued being buried in her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHere,\u201d Nahomi said as she placed the flip-flop on the bench and returned to her locker for a few more things she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHope and Alex exchanged looked as they examined what looked to be\u2026 an empty flip-flop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think you\u2019re person got away from ya,\u201d Alex said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo you dumbasses, see how it\u2019s wet by the toe?\u201d Nahomi said as she placed her bare foot up on the bench next to the flip-flop and motioned for the other players to get closer. As Alex and Hope leaned in, they soon had the same exact reaction that Abi had had not too long ago. Pulling away both pinched their noses and coughed as they looked at Nahomi shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShit! What the hell is wrong with your feet?!\u201d Alex said laughing as she thought they had just been made the butt end of a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook closer! She\u2019s too small to see, but if you look by the toe, you\u2019ll see where I poured some of this,\u201d Nahomi said shaking her vial of tainted water. \u201cThe little bitch is one of those specks!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo fucking way!\u201d Hope said as she leaned in and began examining the flip-flop despite the off-putting smell. Alex braved the smell too as both examined where Nahomi had told them too. The two began to smile and look at each other as they saw what Nahomi had promised, a tiny pool of water with tiny bits of dirt floating in it. From that pool, Abi now looked up at the incomprehensibly large faces as they smiled down at her knowingly (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zvtb_fFcOyY/maxresdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zvtb_fFcOyY/maxres...</a>). Hope chocked back a gag as her and Alex smiled and laughed down at the pool. Giggling voices created waves that broke over Abi in the pool. Some more tainted water rushed into her mouth as Abi unwillingly swallowed the sweat-scented water. Chocking, Abi watched as the world began to grow again. Every drop of water that went down her throat reduced her as the tiny German floated in the most dangerous lake in the world. Looking up, the giant faces were now even larger than before as their warm breathe felt more like a summer typhoon than a breeze like before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUGH!\u201d Hope\u2019s voice boomed as she gagged on the smell once again. Her tremendous voice boomed so loudly, Abi thought a bomb had gone off next to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThese things are rank! The smell might have killed this girl already!\u201d Alex\u2019s voice thundered as she looked at a smiling Nahomi. Their voices shook the waters of the small pool as Nahomi tapped them both on the shoulder. It was time she put her shoe on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe whole pool turned into a violent sea as Nahomi\u2019s toes tapped the end of the flip-flop. It looked like Mount Everest was slowly advancing as Abi was thrown onto the side of the pool, the waters braking on her as each individual groove, grain of dirt, strand of sock fiber, clump of lint, and blemish was borne bare for her to see. As more water made its way into Abi\u2019s mouth, the mountain continues to grow taller while it slowly advances. The impossibly high arch of the sandal strap bent as Nahomi\u2019s toes pressed under them. Looking up into the countless grooves, Abi thought that she was looking into WWI trenches she\u2019d visited as a kid. Another mouthful of water now made them look like valleys as the tremendous foot grew even larger than before. It was like dusk had settled as Nahomi\u2019s flesh blocked out the light as it advances. The titanic toe gently padded the floor of the flip-flop as it landed in the water, but for the little woman it was a world-shaking movement. A violent quake as the toe inched forward tossed Abi forward\u2026landing her in one of the grooves of Nahomi\u2019s toe. Grabbing hold of the canal of flesh, Abi tried to hold herself in as her world view changed from the life she had lived this morning to clinging onto the groove on the toe of one of the smallest American players\u2026. The lake of water she\u2019d been nearly drowning in was now slowly climbing into the grooves she was lost in, threatening to drown her if she didn\u2019t keep moving away from the flood of shrink-inducing water!<br>\r\nHigh above, Nahomi stood up and grabbed her stuff, now on the lookout for a new toy as she held tightly onto her vial of tainted water.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cMove ladies, I need to go,\u201d Nahomi said as\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a night of binge drinking thanks to the incessant requests of Misty, the volleyball duo was now running ten minutes late to the warm-up before their match. As if the throbbing headache were not enough to deal with, now Kerri had no idea where Misty\u2019s directions had gotten them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis IS the right way!\u201d Misty protested, stamping her foot. The volleyball champion then proceeded to clutch her stomach as it refused to sit still. She hadn\u2019t intended to go that nuts last night, but after some pretty intense victories and a ton of media attention, Misty had decided they needed to celebrate a little. She groaned as her own head felt like it was being pounded on by an enthusiastic percussionist as Kerri\u2019s whining stung like hell. Besides, she was right, this was the way they\u2019d been told to go last night! Now with her head throbbing, Misty just stood still and buried her face in her hands as she took a deep breath, her head still pounding. Ok, they were lost, but they were near the beach. The stadium had to be somewhere; a crowd for the Olympic Games just can\u2019t disappear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was silent as they stared up at the imposing figures of the women they had traveled so far to see now towering above them out of nowhere (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Misty-May-Treanor-Feet-763706.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Misty-May-Trean...</a>). Jaws hung open and eyes looked up in disbelief as two giant women argued over their adoring fans. Men and women alike who had made banners, had brought cardboard cut-outs, megaphones, air-horns, and every other device of sport-based debauchery were blanketed in shadow as these women eclipsed the sun completely. Misty was already as tall as a skyscraper as she massaged her temples, the vexed Kerri was even bigger\u2026. The massive sandal-clad foot of Misty shifted a bit, entering the parking lot as its landing shook everyone who was standing there to the ground. Car alarms began to go off as people suddenly realized the scope of the situation they were in. Panicked, they began running for the beaches, mothers grabbing children and vacationers instinctively clutching onto whatever they were holding as the argument of the two goddesses above began to grow more heated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what do you expect me to do?! This is where they said we should be so I\u2019m going to go for a walk till they figure out how to get us there!\u201d Misty shouted back at Kerri before she stormed away, fuming mad and head splitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Misty, wait!\u201d Kerri yelled as she began walking after her tempest-tempered teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!...CRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty thought her feet were already on the beach as they sank slightly into the ground. She was mistaken. Her massive size had caused her feet to sink a solid ten feet into the parking lot as her sandal sole flattened anything that had been under it. As her foot lifted from its quick-cast crater, the paper-thin remains of cars and trucks could be seen splattered against the asphalt like flattened pennies on a train rail. People looked down into the hole and became ill as they saw the other decoration besides the newly minted Misty May Treanor collectable coins\u2026 large, wet red puddles. You couldn\u2019t even call them bodies; the sheer force that had flattened them had erased anything resembling a human except for the clothing now drenched in liquid human that coated the bottom of the foot print. Just one step and Misty had already destroyed a huge portion of the parking-lot under her massive foot. As her other one crashed down on the far end of the lot, a similar scene could be seen unfolding\u2026only something was different\u2026Misty seemed to be even bigger than before. The new footprint from the sky was easily about an extra half-length long compared to the first crater. While no one at the time had noticed this growth-spurt, those on the ground would soon find out the real consequences of the giantesses\u2019 unchecked \u201cdevelopment\u201d first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMisty, stop walking away from me!\u201d Kerri said as she took a step and felt a sharp pain in her foo. Lifting it up, she brushed off what she thought was dirt as collapsed car coins rained down on fleeing fans below her tremendous feet. Many tried to run, but Kerri\u2019s feet also sank into the parking-lot, creating casualties as her toes dug viscously into the ground, propelling her tremendous frame forward as she reached out for Misty\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off! I\u2019m doing this to cool my head, I walk this way, and you go that way!\u201d Misty roared, indicating two different directions along the small strip of sand they were perched upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.Ok, meet back here in five?\u201d Kerri asked, still a little hurt by Misty\u2019s outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Misty said as she stormed off (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s173589.gridserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Misty-May-Treanor-218x300.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s173589.gridserver.com/wp-content...</a>). Misty\u2019s sandals left footprints in the sand that even the waves didn\u2019t seem to want to come in and wash away, or so it seemed to Kerri as the blonde player sighed and strolled away in the other direction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She let it fall to the floor as she kicked it away, preferring her bikini underneath all the sweat-wear for the beach (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2563724053/q23p8jic27xmc0u2f9w7.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/256...</a>). Stretching, Kerri still felt the sting of her hangover as she bent down and closed her eyes, the bright sun spilling over her sunglasses. If she hadn\u2019t she might have seen the crowds at her toes, trying desperately to pull loved ones out from under them while others just wailed. Crowds had already gathers on the edges, crying either at a loss for words or having just witnessed loved ones disappear under the tan wall of Kerri\u2019s foot. Standing up, Kerri threw back her hair as she continued walking down the strip of beach, her feet digging into the sand as she felt their individual grains scraping against her skin. <br>\r\nIn reality, down at Kerri\u2019s feet, people were screaming and clawing against her foot as their half-crushed bodies put up one last effort to survive. Under her foot things were even worse\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose unlucky enough to be under Kerri\u2019s foot when it came down would experience the following\u2026 First, they would feel like the sky was falling down on them as the cold, sand-coated and blood-splattered sole of Kerri\u2019s foot came down on them. Second, they would be pressed down to the sand in whatever ungodly angle Kerri\u2019s foot decided to bend them in. If they were lucky they got pressed down on their back or stomach like they were lying on towel\u2026 but some were bent like pretzels as they snapped in half under the pressure of Kerri\u2019s sole. Their bodies were folded unnaturally as the intense weight snapped their spines like dry straw. Third\u2026 the weight began to come down on them. It was like a rolling wave above them as the force grew exponentially. The weight would crush bones if one was unlucky enough to have something hard under them. Those bent oddly were instantly crushed to a pulp on their own deformed bodies. Truly, the worst fate came to those who had been deemed \u201clucky\u201d to get through the initial contact. As Kerri\u2019s foot weighted down on them, the air was forced from their lungs like balloons being squeezed; but as the pressure increased, sand or dead skin from Kerri\u2019s foot was forced into their mouth, stuffed down their broken jaws if need be. A final crushing weight would force them to try to breathe\u2026and then they\u2019d drown on sand or suffocate on a mouthful of foot before their corpses flaked off into the footprint left 15feet in the sand\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh,\u201d Kerri exhaled as she pointed her toe and began drawing a smiley-face in the sand, unaware that even now she was blotting out lives with each brush-stroke of her big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty\u2019s sandal sank deeper into the sand as she stomped, fueled by a mixture of anger at Kerri and pain from her hangover. As she stood still and rubbed her head, she had no idea about the dozens of people who had just been tossed onto her ever-increasing sandal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck all of them,\u201d Misty proclaimed as she stomped her foot again, gaining more passengers as another tremendous growth spurt overtook her unawares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of people fell to the plastic floor of Misty\u2019s sport\u2019s sandal as the giantess continued her one-sided rant. Looking up, they found themselves in a forest that was literally growing around them as the tall plastic trees were quickly becoming plastic buildings\u2026. The ceiling supported by the pillars was the grimy bottom of Misty\u2019s sole, still dirty from last night. Having gotten out of bed straight into a hang-over, the volleyball start hadn\u2019t done the best job at hygiene this morning unfortunately for those who now stared up at the Russian roulette-esque hanging dirt from above that threatened to fall at any moment. A few groups had already been crushed when blocks of sand that had been packed in the wrinkles of Misty\u2019s moving sole had come loose, leaving more red splatters on the floor as Misty\u2019s massive toes wiggled uncomfortably in her sandal (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Misty-May-Treanor-Feet-763240.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Misty-May-Trean...</a>). There were a hundred ways to die under Misty\u2019s foot in the prison of her sandal, and none of them were pleasant. If you weren\u2019t crushed from falling debris above, then being around the edges of the sandal was almost begging to be buried by the avalanches of sand that poured in whenever Misty\u2019s foot sunk into the beach. Running away from those would drive you inland, under the arching ceiling of Misty\u2019s sole, still not a safe place. At least a dozen people could be seen suspended in droplets of sweat bigger than aquarium tanks, floating lifelessly having drowned in the salty spheres. If one really got deep under Misty\u2019s foot then suffocation was a risk, fresh air didn\u2019t reach that far in and the funk of Misty\u2019s foot at this size was enough to poison a normal person lost in the forest of growing pillars. Some had tried to climb the pillars at the start, and if they weren\u2019t already holding on inside the grooves of Misty\u2019s sole, then they were most likely either splattered atop the peak of a plastic pillar, or sprayed across the floor of the sandal from a bad fall. These were just some of the ways dozens were drying in Misty\u2019s sandal, all with most never coming into direct contact with Misty\u2019s sole. Between under her feet and Kerri\u2019s\u2026the team was once again setting new records and stunning the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stadium went silent when the first shockwaves hit them. Now the air was unnaturally still as they found themselves staring up at the crotch of Kerri, situated between her imposing, impossibly tall legs (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Kerri-Walsh-Feet-86891.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Kerri-Walsh-Fee...</a>). Kerri\u2019s continually growing form was dwarfing the stadium more and more each second. As her feet alone now bathed the stadium in shadows, everyone below wondered what would come next. Soon, Kerri shifted, creating a tidal wave of sand that slammed into the outer wall of the stadium as Kerri\u2019s big toe now looked down on the terrified crowd, bathing them in darkness as the giantess now clutched her stomach. Kerri felt like she was going to throw up as her stomach tossed and turned. She closed her eyes and kneeled down, her ass bouncing above the crowds as Kerri groaned in pain. Down below, everyone waited for their judgment. High above, Kerri\u2026.</span></div></div>",

The beat blasting in her ears changed from pop to rock to jazz to hip-hop, where it stayed as she looked around the bus, pulling her gym back snuggly to her lap. Bouncing her foot up and down to the beat, the boxer bit her lip in annoyance as she waited for the traffic to start moving again. Looking out the window at the people passing by, Marlen had had enough. Getting up, she moved to the front of the bus and told the driver to let her off there. As the doors to the bus swung open begrudgingly, Marlen jumped out and swerved gracefully through the cars to the sidewalk. It was a beautiful, if not a little nippy, fall morning and Marlen was already late to get to the gym. Stretching, she shook her head and took off; she\u2019d get her cardio done on the way to practice. Looking down at her shoes she smiled and bounced on the balls of her feet a few times (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2012/stylewatch/blog/120416/cover-girl-1-300x400.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2012/st...</a>). She was off like a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSMACK!...SMACK!...SMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn the bottom of Marlen\u2019s right sneaker, a tiny strip of tape was barely holding something to the sole of the boxer\u2019s sneaker. Well not just something: you to be exact. Already you were badly beaten from the trip to the bus, but this jog was a whole other trip to hell in a hand basket. You thought it was a miracle that you weren\u2019t dead already as Marlen began weaving between people on the street. The bruises along your face were already swelling as you braced for the next impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMarlen landed hard on her right foot as she jumped past a businessman absorbed in some pointless conversation on his phone. Twirling between a startled pair of tourists, Marlen looked up; two blocks left. Looking down at her feet, she lifted her right foot for a second. Seeing the shine on the strip of tape, and more importantly no blood splatter, she knew her guest was still holding up. Giggling, Marlen stomped her foot down and pushed herself forward, as the light turned. It was going to be a great day of training with her new partner to help her out. Turning the last corner, Marlen smiled as she saw the familiar double doors of her gym. It wasn\u2019t really a glamourous building, but it was what she had considered her home-away-from-home for a while now\u2026and where she\u2019d experience a whole new set of fun games today with her \u201cguest.\u201d Pushing through the doors, a cool blast of AC hit Marlen in her face, cooling off her sweat-soaked body as she tried to slip past her couch and get to the locker-room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarlen!\u201d a familiar voice rang out, she froze. Busted. Time to execute the escape plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChanging!\u201d she shouted as she slipped inside the locker-room, giggling to herself. She\u2019d get chewed out later, but for now she was good. Taking a sweep of the locker-room, Marlen was relieved to see that she was alone in here\u2026or almost alone anyway. Tossing her bag onto the bench, Marlen sat down and took out her earphones, she was going to want to hear this well. Slowly, she crossed her legs so her right foot was facing the ceiling, her tiny guest still snuggly between her treads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you like the ride?\u201d Marlen said, snickering as she fumbled trying to take off the tape on the sole of her sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cf\u2026\u2026\u201d your voice died out as Marlen\u2019s finger jabbed you in the gut as she tried to fish you out from her treads. Breathless, you were pulled loose, your front side already turning purple from the innumerable bruises you\u2019d endured. A nail was quickly dug into your adhesive-covered gut as Marlen scratched you free. Exhausted, you clung onto the pad of her pointer-finger like a life-raft as you were quickly brought up to her face. The smiling expression had been replaced with a stony gaze that sent shivers down your miraculously unbroken spine (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.quinceanera.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/marlen-esparza-interview-2012.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.quinceanera.com/wp-content/up...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked, titling her head as her free hand began prying her sneaker off of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou were smarter this time and remained silent as Marlen lowered her sock-clad foot to the floor and looked you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought. But I\u2019m not a total bitch. If you didn\u2019t like being under my sneaker, I\u2019ll be nice and put you inside. That\u2019s what you want right?\u201d Marlen teased, breaking out in a big smile as she started to lift the sneaker up towards you. You both got hit with a whiff of what lay inside the sneaker inside. Anyone else watching would have seen a powerful boxer and shrunken woman recoil in disgust almost in synchronization as the sneaker made it to about Marlen\u2019s chest. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re a freak wanting to go in there!\u201d Marlen laughed as she set the sneaker down in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t say I wanted to- Aaaaah!\u201d you squeaked like a mouse as Marlen\u2019s thumb came down onto you and squeezed you between her massive fingers. Bending down, Marlen inhaled deeply and pulled her head up sharply, her eyes sealed shut and mouth pointed in sharp disgust as she shook her head vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat reeks! You sure you want in there?\u201d Marlen sneered, waving her free hand before her nose as tears literally brimmed at her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo!\u201d you squeaked before gasping for air between clenched fingers once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnjoy freak,\u201d Marlen giggled as she hovered her hand over the entrance to the sneaker flicked you off. She bit her lip in excitement as she saw your tiny speck of a body plummet into her sneaker. Giggling, Marlen slowly placed her sneaker down by her sock-clad foot. Standing up, she smiled down at the sneaker and slowly lifted her foot, letting her toes grip and rest on the edge of the entrance before slowly tilting them in and starting to insert it. She paused, better to give her toy some time to hide or else she\u2019d need to find a way to get a new one way sooner than she wanted. After a few seconds, Marlen inserted her foot fully, giving her foot a few stomps before going through her bag. She found her water bottle and\u2026aha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPulling out a protein bar, Marlen smiled and ripped it free before taking a first big bite. As she chewed the thick bar thoroughly, she thought that it was missing something\u2026just a little something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the darkness of Marlen\u2019s sneaker, you were quickly yearning to be under her sneaker on a jog once again. Pressed into the damp wall of sock-clad foot, you tried desperately not to slip under her arch as the massive monstrosity of an extremity shifted ever-so-slightly. Already you wanted to vomit just from the saturation of smell from the boxer\u2019s foot.  You were fighting to keep conscious so that you didn\u2019t slip under and end up as a stain on the massive sock. Clinging onto it like a cargo-net, you were really surprised when the foot suddenly began to pull out from the total darkness. It was a blinding flash of light as you were suddenly freed from the prison that you had been dumped into. Looking up, you saw the crushing fingers coming for you once again. Painful pressure came on you from the sides as you were ripped from the sock and quickly dropped into something\u2026mushy? Lifting your hands, you saw they were coated in a thick brown paste. For a moment, you got incredibly worried before you recognized the smell around you\u2026as chocolate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour whole world shook as you fell flat on your face into the chocolate road. Pushing yourself up, you gasped for air as you looked up to see Marlen smiling at you as she carefully chewed what you assumed was a mouthful of whatever you were on (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SquBb_nlcR4/0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SquBb_nlcR4/0.jpg</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAhhhh!\u201d Marlen said aloud as she opened her mouth, revealing a wasteland of chocolate chunks on her shimmering tongue as you were quickly approaching. Turning, you looked to escape only to see something disheartening. Marlen had taken no chances. She took you out for the very last bite. You watched, in slow-motion, as her fingers released the hunk of chocolate. It was like a rollercoaster\u2019s first drop as you screamed. Free-falling, you turned just in time to see Marlen\u2019s shiny tongue\u2026then you landed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGuh!\u201d you gasped as you nearly drowned in the thick layer of saliva coating the massive tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou were shut in total darkness as Marlen\u2019s teeth came down on a hunk of the protein bar you rode in on, reducing it to rubble as her molars came down on it mercilessly. The weird thing was the tongue you had landed on. You expected to be thrust onto a tooth or into the roof of Marlen\u2019s mouth; instead, you were pressed to her lips as though it was desperately trying to get rid of you! Suddenly, you were surrounded in saliva\u2026and expelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPTEOOOW!\u201d Marlen spat desperately. Sticking her tongue out as your spit-soaked body landed between her legs among some bandages and, of course, her sneakers (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.htexas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Marlen_Esparza2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.htexas.com/wp-content/uploads...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly, you began crawling away, hoping to free yourself from the thick saliva. Unfortunately, you only made it a few steps before\u2026well\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMarlen\u2019s foot slammed down in front of you.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYou taste like feet!\u201d she complained as she once again plucked you up from the floor. As you struggled between her powerful fingers, Marlen thought it would maybe be fun to instead try\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A cold sweat had already broken out over your body as you tried to make sense of the alien environment you\u2019d been dragged into. Nausea squirmed in your stomach like a live snake as you felt your knees begin to go weak. It felt like someone was pushing you down as your legs gave out under you. Crashing onto the floor, your knees ached as you desperately tried to keep form passing out. The varnished surface of the floor felt smooth against your hands as you felt like you were going into a tunnel. Each breath caused your lungs to burn as it seemed like your ribcage was tightening up. Your whole body seemed to be made of steel for a moment. As a high pitched whining filled your ears, it seemed like you were going to suffocate right there on the ground\u2026until a strong hand clapped you on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, you alright?\u201d a young man asked as you gasped for air and looked up at him. His hair was a chocolate brown and disheveled as all hell. Grabbing hold of the hand he offered, you got to your shaky feet as quickly as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you quickly tried to gulp down mouthfuls of air, the world around you began to clear up from the panic attack you\u2019d suffered. Looking up, you felt the crushing weight of your predicament coming down on you. You\u2019d come here today for a dance class taught by Marie \u201cPandora\u201d Medina. At home, in front of the mirror, you\u2019d tried practicing on your own, trying your best to imitate her\u2026with little success. When you\u2019d learned you\u2019d gotten into the class, you almost hit the ceiling from jumping so high. Now, looking up at the ceiling, you felt like you might as well be trying to see the night sky. Not that the room was all that big\u2026before anyway. It was a standard rehearsal room. Long mirrored walls, ballet poles, shining polished wood floors, kind of cramped. With the numerous other people who had been flooding into the room for the class, you had thought there would be no room for anyone to move. A sharp stinging pain rocked through your head like you\u2019d been stabbed by someone with an icepick and the asshole was twisting it around. You couldn\u2019t remember what had caused it, but the cramped room was now unimaginably huge\u2026or rather, you\u2019d all become unbelievably small. Trying to clench a fist, you yelped a little as you realized you were still holding onto the young man\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks\u201d you said blushing as you hurriedly let go of him and tried to brush yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo problem, my name is David\u201d he said as he tried smiling at you. The beads of sweat running down his face gave him away; he seemed to be just as afraid of this situation as you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy name is-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe ground suddenly shook as David and your gaze snapped to the monolithic door. A colossal shadow seemed to stir beyond it as the light that seeped in under the threshold was obstructed by what you imagined could only be the titanic feet of someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRRRRRNNNNNNNNN\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the door opened, the panic began to set back in. Feeling like you wanted to vomit, you found yourself staring up as Pandora herself blocked out the light in the doorway (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/cBNUw59XUVCR0TGMHdFLsXU5Uh6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/cBNUw59XU...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WHAT THE HELL?</b>\u201d Her voice thundered, making you clutch your ears as they rang in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPandora\u2019s massive foot stuck the ground like a meteor. The tremors from one single step had already toppled you and David. Fighting off the panic attack as best you could, your body was screaming at you to run with every ounce of strength you had. Unfortunately, with your legs acting like they were made of jelly, you could only stumble and fall back to the ground like a wounded animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo fucking way\u201d David said as he slowly looked up at Pandora. Slowly, the giantess\u2019s other foot began to raise again as Pandora started to slowly walk into the practice room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGrunting in terror as another shockwave rippled through your body, you looked to see\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh no way, really?\u201d Paige said as she began scrolling through her email on her phone. Taking a quick sip of her coffee, the WWE Diva was surprised to see her e-mail flooded with notices on changing challenges and upcoming matches that were being shuffled around. For some reason, several Divas and upcoming fighters that had been planned to debut were cancelling matches. In some cases, there were rumors of some future-Divas just disappearing. It was weird, that much was for sure, but it didn\u2019t really worry Paige. So long as she could still appear and beat someone, it didn\u2019t really matter who it was. Looking up from her phone Paige looked around the crowded caf\u00e9 for a free table to park herself at. This place always got crowded around this time of day\u2026but Paige couldn\u2019t keep away. It was a nice place where you could be by yourself even if the whole place was full; it had that kind of feel to it. In her life, you needed a place like that. Squeezing past a packed table, Paige saw her target, an empty place down in the side of the main room, perfect for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby held on with all her might as Paige\u2019s tremendous foot crashed down on the cold tile floor once again. She gasped as the impact nearly shook her off of Paige\u2019s big toe. The grimy floor was as good as a death sentence to her if she fell off now with all the giants surrounding her.  Looking up, she saw the impossibly tall spires of Paige\u2019s legs rising into the air and shuddered in awe of her size (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Britani-Knight-Feet-1176594.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Britani-Knight-...</a>). For over a week, Abby had been noticing that she had been losing weight, she thought it was just a consequence of her flu\u2026but she had been somewhat wrong. Today she had come into the caf\u00e9 early, hoping to grab a quick coffee before work. Yes she had taken most of the week off, but she was out of sick leave and needed to come in for at least a little bit. To her disappointment, no one even seemed to be working at the cafe when she came in. The only thing keeping her going was the ticket in her bag for a WWE match tonight staring Paige. She was slightly embarrassed to be a fan, no one at work knew, but still it was a guilty pleasure and she\u2019d be damned if a little cold kept her away.  Abby remembered holding her head as a particularly painful headache came over her along with a wave of nausea. She was about to turn around and just go home when Abby felt a chill go through her body. As she gasped in pain, she felt dizzy and saw as the world around her seemed to be growing at an alarming rate! She had spent hours cowering under the counter as endless guests had arrived. Abby couldn\u2019t even believe it herself when she had found herself before Paige\u2019s tremendous sandals. She didn\u2019t know what had possessed her to grab onto one of them\u2026but she couldn\u2019t go back now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby flinched again as Paige\u2019s tremendous foot slammed into the ground once more. She looked up once again to see Paige had already made it to the chair and was about to sit down. To Abby, the whole world might as well have shaken as Paige\u2019s butt met the seat. This was her chance, if she couldn\u2019t get the giantess\u2019 attention now\u2026she never would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm,\u201d the Diva sighed as she made herself comfortable in her seat. Reclining, Paige stretched out at the caf\u00e9 table and continued to scroll through her emails, the same type of message appearing a few dozen times. She sighed and switched off the app, going instead to a game. She had a match later today against some newbie, might as well waste some time relaxing while she could. So long as her opponent didn\u2019t \u201cdisappear\u201d like the others, Paige was going to finally have a blast and blow off some steam in the ring tonight. Taking another long sip of her drink, the wrester almost melted into her chair, her toes wiggling absentmindedly in her sandals as she tapped away on a colorful screen of moving pixels. Her schedule had been crazy lately, but for the afternoon at least, Paige finally got some time to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAAAAAAH!\u201d Abby screamed as Paige\u2019s big toe came down on her legs, pressing her tightly against the leather floor of the super-sized sandal (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Britani-Knight-Feet-918675.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Britani-Knight-...</a>). Beating against the fleshy wall that was now crushing her, Abby could only look up at the pale toe pleadingly. Her fists almost seemed to bounce off of the thick skin without effect as every tiny movement of the digit threatened to crush half of the woman into nothing more than a fine paste\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>MIND IF WE SIT WITH YOU</b>?\u201d another voice boomed as the world around Abby began to shift suddenly all around her. In an instant, she went from being almost crushed to a pulp under Paige\u2019s big toe to landing on the cold, lonely ground of the caf\u00e9. Looking around, desperately, she wondered what the hell had just happened to turn her luck around\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d Abby yelled in fear as she crouched down, the floor rumbling under her like a trampoline as she started looking around desperately to find out what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>DAMN, YOU CAN ACTUALLY DRINK THAT CRAP?</b>\u201d Another tremendous voice echoed as the ground trembled once more. Abby fell to her knees and looked up just in time to see Paige\u2019s tremendous feet withdrawing at a breakneck speed. The Diva seemed to cement her feet to the floor like she was ready for a fight as the tiny woman felt a chill go down her spine. Slowly, she looked over her shoulder and saw exactly what she should be afraid of\u2026 Paige was no longer alone at this table. She had been joined by....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Scrambling back as quickly as she could, the tiny fan watched as the dirt-encrusted treads of the sneaker began to descend upon her slowly. Screaming, Abby flipped back over and began running as she saw the shadow of the giant sneaker growing darker and darker around her. Looking up, she could see the tip of the thing just about to crush her if she paused for just a single moment. Abby\u2019s legs felt suddenly like they were going to explode with energy as the tiny woman sprang forwards with all her might just in time. A gust of wind whipped up behind Abby, flinging her forward against the tile floor like a ragdoll in a hurricane as the ground continued to tremble under her. Rolling violently, Abby finally slid to a halt a few feet away from the gigantic foot. Weakly, she got to her hands and knees and looked up to see who it was that had almost stepped on her. The tiny woman nearly swallowed her tongue as she found herself looking up the impossibly long legs\u2026of Nikki Bella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRRRRRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>LOOK, I HAVE TO MAKE A CALL. IF YOU\u2019RE GOING TO STAY HERE\u2026AT LEAST WATCH MY BAG OR SOMETHING, OK?</b>\u201d Paige\u2019s voice boomed as you turned around in time to see her sandal clad feet push her body away from the table. Abby\u2019s heart sank as her idol began to walk away, her tremendous feet making strides she could never hope to catch up to. She felt a deep pit in her stomach as she turned around to face the titanic sneaker of Nikki\u2019s\u2026 it looked like Abby\u2019s new job was cut out for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby flinched in apprehension as Nikki\u2019s sneaker began to gently tap away on the floor of the caf\u00e9. The titanic twins were talking away about something as she began to nervously approach Nikki\u2019s foot. Going for the other foot was useless, it was too far away and might move if she wasted the time to go for it. Despite the danger, the sneaker before her was the safer bet\u2026or at least that was what Abby hoped as she got close enough to feel the gust of wind on her face from every footfall. As the sneaker slowly lifted just a fraction of an inch from the ground, Abby felt her stomach begin to churn. Even with just a slight incline, the bottom of Nikki\u2019s sneaker was already well out of reach of her as it seemed almost to be staring down at her menacingly. Pebbles and pieces of garbage wedged into the treads of Nikki\u2019s sneaker dwarfed Abby as the tiny woman keeled over and threw up from the nervousness grasping her. It felt like her chest was going to collapse in on itself as Abby kept forcing herself to try and find some way to get onto Nikki\u2019s foot that wouldn\u2019t kill her. To the tiny woman, it was like staring down the barrel of a gun as she examined the grimy bottom of the titanic sneaker before her. Row after row of treads the size of large war trenches were carved into what seemed like a football field\u2019s worth of land. Slowly, the tremendous sneaker began to lower back to the ground once again\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>DID YOU SEE THE LAST EMAIL? OUR MATCH NEXT WEEK JUST GOT CANCELLED</b>,\u201d another voice, probably Brie\u2019s thundered as Abby nervously placed a hand on the rubber rim on the front of her sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby fell on her ass again as Nikki\u2019s other foot stomped in anger; suddenly she was happy to not have gone towards that one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>DON\u2019T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON IT</b>,\u201d Nikki said, her voice tinged with anger as her legs seemed to almost want to push the earth down under her strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was terrifying for Abby to see the walls of rubber and canvas bending out as though something inside was desperate to get out\u2026but it meant the rubber lip of the sole was finally low enough for Abby to reach. Running forwards, Abby leapt up the dropping wall and felt her hands grab onto the rubber lip, her fingers digging in now to small webs of thread that lashed the sole to the body of the sneaker. With all her strength, Abby pulled herself up, her own legs pushing and kicking against the rubber wall of the sneaker sole. Gasping for air, the tiny woman finally managed to drag herself up over the rubber wall as Nikki allowed herself to stretch out; her legs made it almost all the way to where Paige had been sitting when they finally came to a stop. Now, Abby found herself not sitting on the front steps of a large, canvas house, but on the slopes of a massive sneaker. Looking down at it, she could see there was a ton of \u201cland\u201d between her and the first patch of exposed skin at Nikki\u2019s ankle. It was a treacherous way down the slope, Abby found as she began trying to gain her footing on the shifting ground of the tongue of Nikki\u2019s outstretched sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>JESUS, DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE UP THE WHOLE PLACE WITH YOUR LEGS?</b>\u201d Brie complained as she crashed into Nikki\u2019s legs while trying to stretch out her own. Abby had nearly been thrown off as the whole damn sneaker shook violently upon impact. Quickly, the tiny woman grabbed hold of a cluster of fibers as Nikki began to draw her foot back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Abby suddenly felt very exposed as she saw Brie\u2019s massive body bending to look under the table. Almost instantaneously, the giant woman\u2019s eyes looked down at Abby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>HOLD ON</b>,\u201d Brie said as her hand grabbed hold of Nikki\u2019s thigh. The tiny woman could see the shockwave begin to go down her leg from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>WHAT? I\u2019M MOVING ALREADY!</b>\u201d Nikki responded, annoyed enough already from the emails today that anything else was going to set her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>SHHHH\u2026THERE\u2019S SOMETHING ON YOUR FOOT, JUST HOLD ON,</b>\u201d Brie said as she began to lean down under the table, her face coming closer and closer to a very distraught Abby. As Brie\u2019s face began to grow closer and closer, Abby could feel her heart beat exponentially louder in her chest. She feared her heart would pop if Brie\u2019s face came even a fraction of an inch closer to her. It was like watching a sci-fi mothership coming in for landing as Brie\u2019s sharp eyes kept perfect contact on the tiny woman clinging to her sister\u2019s sneaker (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cache.diva-dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/toutbrienattie.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://cache.diva-dirt.com/wp-content/up...</a>). Abby flinched as she felt the hot wind of Brie\u2019s breath on her face as she looked up into the critical eyes looking down at her. Slowly, she reached an arm up and began to weakly wave, hoping to see some sign of recognition; and for a brief moment, as the gigantic eyes of Brie Bella seemed to light up in realization, Abby thought she was finally going to be saved. She was wrong. In an instant, Brie\u2019s massive face pulled away; her colossal body seemed to spring back up, out from under the dark shadow of the table. Once again, Abby\u2019s chest seemed to be collapsing in on itself as she saw Brie lean over and whisper in Nikki\u2019s ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRNNNNNN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rumbled under her as Nikki placed her foot down flat on the ground and pushed her chair back so her own face could now gaze down under the table. Slowly, the giantess bent under the table; her face came as close as Brie\u2019s had as the woman, to whose foot Abby had been clinging, became aware of her existence for the first time. It was not the uplifting experience she\u2019d been hoping for\u2026in fact, it was downright terrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>STAY STILL</b>,\u201d Nikki said as all of a sudden her body pulled back out from under the table as Brie had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh God, oh God, oh God,\u201d Abby cried under her breath as she saw the titanic woman typing away on her phone. She had no idea what was going to become of her. Both women seemed to be entertained by her existence far more than concerned for her wellbeing. Soon, Abby looked up to see Nikki\u2019s arm reaching back down under the table, her massive I-phone clutched in her hand. Staring at the screen, Abby felt her stomach tie itself into a knot as she read the note that had been written for her eyes only...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

YOU HAVE 1 MINUTE, OR ELSE\u2019 the message read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe sneaker tapped once, the starting signal of sorts, as Nikki and Brie both causally stole glances under the table. Quickly, the phone disappeared, only to come back a few seconds later with the stopwatch app opened and counting down. As the seconds began to quickly disappear, Abby frantically began scrambling up as quickly as she could. With a frantic, almost manic energy, Abby tore up across the first lace like Spiderman as the digital countdown overhead refused to slow down. The thick fabric of the laces lay in front of her like an obstacle course of felled logs. Quickly surmounting the second lace, Abby looked up to see how much time she had left\u2026only to feel her heart sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201945.67\u2019 read the clock as Abby saw she still had what seemed like seven more laces to get across. She needed a new plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGrah!\u201d she shouted as she pulled herself up onto the third lace, her back straining to lift her as the adrenaline rush she\u2019d been riding for the last 15 minutes seemed to be wearing off. Swallowing a deep breath of air, Abby forced herself to keep moving as she ran across the length of the lace, hoping to get off the tongue and towards the flat side of the sneaker instead. Getting onto one of the ridges that rose above the tongue, Abby once again began taking off uphill towards the massive ankle of Nikki\u2019s foot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.solecollector.com/media/up/2013/11/images/nikki-bella-air-jordan-1-mid-gs-ion-pink.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.solecollector.com/media/up/20...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbby tumbled back into the trenches on the tongue of Nikki\u2019s sneaker as the giantess tapped her foot again. Groaning, Abby looked up and saw why\u2026less than 30 seconds remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>THINK SHE\u2019LL MAKE IT?</b>\u201d Brie\u2019s voice echoed from above as Abby desperately tried to get back on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>FOR HER SAKE, I HOPE SHE DOES</b>,\u201d Nikki replied, giggling. The threatening conversation that was being had so casually by the giantesses sent shivers down Abby\u2019s spine as the tiny woman found her body now giving out on her when she needed it most. Climbing over another lace, Abby could finally see the last stretch of sneaker before the ankle was before her. One more lace stood in her way as the tiny woman leapt off her perch, ready to make the final climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBEEP! BEEP! BEEP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>TIME\u2019S UP</b>,\u201d Nikki\u2019s voice echoed as Abby collapsed on the other side of the lace. She had only the last hill of fabric to climb before she\u2019d won\u2026but it was too late as the giantesses were already staring down at her, smiling menacingly. Looking up, Abby saw as Nikki pushed her chair out, swinging her leg (and Abby too) around so she landed right next to her pocket-book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants now leaned down, making it look like they were rooting through Nikki\u2019s bag as their delighted gazes fell on the tiny, quivering woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>AWWW, SHE LOOKS SO CUTE DOWN THERE!</b>\u201d Brie cooed as she leaned in closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEHE, LOOKS LIKE SHE DIDN\u2019T MAKE IT TO MY ANKLE THOUGH, UH-OH!</b>\u201d Nikki said, her voice dripping in sarcastic-sweetness. Terrified of them, Abby tried to sneak away, inching towards the crevice between the laces and tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>OOPS, I THINK SHE WANTS TO GET AWAY,</b>\u201d Brie said teasingly as she bent down more and reached out for the little woman, knocking her forwards with her fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>UH-OH, DID THE WITTLE GIRL WOOSE HER BAWANCE?</b>\u201d Nikki said in a soft baby talk as both girls broke out in a giggle. Abby quickly covered her ears as the bombastic barrage of sound assaulted her ears. Cringing in pain, the tiny woman looked up pleadingly at both giantesses to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I DON\u2019T KNOW, SHE MAY BE DIZZY FROM THE SMELL OF YOUR FEET, NIKKI,</b>\u201d Brie said was she waved a hand before her nose, sticking her tongue out in mocking disgust. With each swipe of Brie\u2019s hand across her face, a powerful wind blew down on Abby, threatening to toss her off her own feet and sweep her away if she wasn\u2019t careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b>\u201cAWWW, I THOUGHT YOU LIKED MY FEET THOUGH!</b>\u201d Nikki said as she made an overdramatic pouting face and leaned forwards. As she did, her nose scrunched up and the giantess recoiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>NO ONE LIKES THAT SMELL,</b>\u201d Brie retorted as both giantesses broke out into giggles again. Abby felt a strong gust of wind come at her head on as Nikki exhaled, waving her own hand before her nose as she pretended to almost choke on the \u201csmell\u201d that was around her. Trying to get up, Abby was blown over once again as Brie began to wave the air out of the way of her face. Sprawled on her back, Abby looked up to see Nikki looked at Brie from the corner of her eye as her fingers were pinched tightly over her nostrils. Suddenly, Abby found herself surrounded by a storm of giggled, gusts of exhaled air, and sharp winds from waving hands. Buffeted on all sides, the little woman had no choice but to curl up in the fetal position and try to outlast the storm caused by these massive sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WHAT\u2019S WRONG? DOES IT REALLY SMELL THAT BADLY TO YOU? HAHA!</b>\u201d Nikki asked as she began to reach down and scrape up the little bug from her sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbby shrieked as she was soon snapped up between Nikki\u2019s powerful fingers and found herself floating before the two delighted sisters (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/04/d3/ad/04d3ad74acb901d1b23bd304a424969c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a>). Suddenly, she was dangling before both giantesses as they examined her much closer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WELL, SHE DID LOSE\u2026SO WHAT DO WE DO WITH HER?</b>\u201d Brie asked, looking at Nikki. Abby shivered, from the gleam in Nikki\u2019s eye, it seemed the giantess already had an idea of what to do with their new tiny friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>GET MY BAG</b>\u201d Nikki said as she dropped Abby onto the table for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tiny woman fell down as Nikki quickly grabbed just what she needed from her bag and dropped it in front of her. Stumbling backwards, she saw what had nearly crushed her\u2026a pack of gum. Abby was confused, when all of a sudden she watched Nikki pull a stick from the pack and unwrap it. The single stick of gum was as big as a large SUV or small bus to her as it was placed down before her. In an instant, Nikki\u2019s fingernail dug out a tiny groove in the gum stick\u2026then her hand turned on Abby. The tiny woman turned to run, but was too slow as Nikki grabbed hold of Abby and lifted her up, pressing her down into the groove with no hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeeeelp!\u201d Abby screamed as she was pressed down tightly, the gum trench being bent down around her like a pink cage. In an instant, Nikki\u2019s thumb came down on the entrance to the trench, blocking out all the light as the giant woman\u2019s real target finally came into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEY, SORRY THAT TOOK SO LONG. THEY HAD TO CHANGE WHO I\u2019M FIGHTING TONIGHT, THE PERSON CHANGED AGAIN,</b>\u201d Paige said as the ground rumbled on her return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>NO PROBLEM, WANT SOME GUM?</b>\u201d Nikki asked, lifting up the stick that Abby had been crammed into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>SURE\u2026THANKS</b>,\u201d Paige said, a little on guard as she took the piece from Nikki\u2019s grasp. Abby was almost blinded by the light as it suddenly poured back into her pitch-black cavern. As the stick of gum was lifted into the air casually by Paige, Abby was getting slammed all around her chamber like a ragdoll as the Anti-Diva examined the stick for a second. Getting slammed against the thin slit of an entrance, Abby looked through just in time to see her idol looking at the stick of gum cautiously (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://scontent-b.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/10831735_1502713756684022_1426705752_n.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://scontent-b.cdninstagram.com/hphot...</a>). Sticking her arm out of the slit, Abby waved and screamed with all her might as the stick of gum was brought closer and closer to Paige\u2019s face. As she was engulfed in the shadow of Paige\u2019s face, Abby screamed for help one last time as\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Down her-\u201d Abby\u2019s screams were cut short as Paige\u2019s thumb accidentally slammed down on her lower body, forcing the air from her lungs with no effort. If she wasn\u2019t half-buried in gum, that press alone would have been enough to snuff Abby out, reducing her to a bloody thumbprint under Paige\u2019s hand. Then again, the was probably the easiest way out of this mess. Gasping for air that she couldn\u2019t receive, Abby writhed under Paige\u2019s thumb as the giant Diva looked nervously from it to the Bellas and back again. If not for her thumb being parked right on top of Abby, Paige might actually have seen her terrified little fan staring up at her pleadingly. Instead, the shrunken girl was obscured from view by Paige\u2019s shiny, black fingernail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WHAT\u2019S WRONG? DON\u2019T LIKE GUM NOW?</b>\u201d Nikki taunted, leaning in closer to Paige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe pale giantess shot a glare up at the others and slowly opened her mouth, licking her lips seductively before she started to bring the stick of gum towards her mouth (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dailywrestlingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Paige-RAW-gifs-0041.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://dailywrestlingnews.com/wp-content...</a>). Abby silently screamed only to have Paige once again pause right before her open mouth. Abby shivered as she felt Paige\u2019s hot, humid breath rolling over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TWO SMILING AT?</b>\u201d Paige\u2019s voice boomed, nearly bursting Abbi\u2019s eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>NOTHING, JUST YOU LOOK CUTE TODAY</b>\u201d Brie said, trying hard to stifle her own laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>OK\u2026THANKS?</b>\u201d Paige replied. Her eyes looked down at the piece of gum again. She felt like she was being set up, but wasn\u2019t quite sure how yet. Regardless, she wouldn\u2019t know what they had planned till she ate the stupid piece of gum anyway. Opening wide, she shoved the piece in her mouth, sealing it (and Abby) behind the stalwart walls of her white teeth, and her pink lips. Her tongue slowly began working the thing piece towards her teeth; she pressed it into her right cheek before bringing her molars down onto it for her first bite. Paige noticed Brie and Nikki staring at her a little too intently as her jaws slowly began working the gum into a sticky, sweet clump between her teeth. Paige\u2019s tongue prodded the pile, pressing it against the back of her front teeth before her lips slowly parted. She exhaled, enjoying the sight of a small pink bubble expanding before her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInside Paige\u2019s mouth, Abby wasn\u2019t having nearly as much fun as any of the three giantess\u2019s who had participated in her plight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHelp! Please! Paige, help m-\u201d her screaming was cut off; Paige\u2019s massive tongue folded the blob of gum over her, enveloping the tiny woman in a sugary sepulcher. Surrounded on all sides by the stick walls of what she assumed would be her tomb, Abby could just barely feel the crushing walls of her idol\u2019s teeth crashing down just a fraction an inch from her each time. It was a miracle that she\u2019d avoided being chewed on thus far, but her luck was about to run out. Flailing blindly in the darkness of the gummy prison, Abby felt the world flip once more thanks to a gentle flick of Paige\u2019s massive tongue. Everything stopped; the normal stillness that the tiny woman now knew preceded the next bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFuck! Oh God! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Help me\u2026shit, someone fucking help me!\u201d Abby screamed as her left arm became the first part of her body unlucky enough to get stuck between the crushing white walls of Paige\u2019s teeth. She tried pulling her arm back in, only to feel waves of fiery pain shoot up from the mangled remains of her hand that had been mixed in now with the greedy, sticky fibers of the gum. The minty mortuary once again spun in the air thanks to Paige\u2019s tongue. Now in tears and nearly passing out from the pain and lack of air, Abby thought that any moment now, the massive teeth of the Diva would reduce her to a pulp. Instead, she felt herself getting compressed against an immovable wall. A tremendous force at her back had her thinking that death was just a second away until the world seemed to be getting\u2026brighter? Abby\u2019s attention snapped forwards when she heard Brie\u2019s shocked gasp. To her horror, the twins that had gotten her into this mess were once again staring at her. Sinister smiles seemed to spread across their faces; sending a chill down the shrunken woman\u2019s spine. Anything that entertaining to them must have meant she was in a shit ton of trouble. Terrified, Abby began looking around only to see a thin, white membrane ballooning out all around her. She didn\u2019t know it\u2026but the Bella\u2019s could see; Abby was right in the middle of the bubble Paige was absentmindedly blowing. Taking this chance, Abby looked up at her arm and felt nauseous: her left arm was unrecognizable above the elbow\u2026only a red pulpy mess seemed to stick out against the white background. Attempts to move her fingers were only met with wave after wave of intense pain. Before she could try and think of a new way to get Paige\u2019s attention, the world seemed to flash before her like she\u2019d been on the end of a whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPaige giggled and slowly licked up the remains of the bubble that was clinging to her nose and lips. Her slender tongue passed along Abby, giving the giantess a nasty taste of iron. Frowning, she finished drawing the ball of gum into her mouth before gently reaching past her lips for it (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/art/Giantess-Paige-Vore-458318013\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.deviantart.com/art/Giantess-P...</a>).<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as the Anti-Diva was about to check out what she\u2019d been chewing on, a sharp pain went through her stomach. A painful wince flashed across her face; quickly, she pushed herself to her feet and headed for the bathroom, not bothering to exchange another word with the twisted twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe air seemed to shake around the Abby as the Bella\u2019s quickly couldn\u2019t get a lid on their laughter. Though to the twins, they\u2019d done a good job of keeping it to a low giggle, little Abby though her ears were going to pop as the gigantic sister\u2019s grabbed the napkin and drew it closer to them. Nikki and Brie\u2019s eyes sparkled with a mischievous shimmer that caused their little captive to shiver in fear under the weight of their gaze; with her arm throbbing and the giantesses staring down at her, Abby did all she could to try and swallow the sobs that were rising in her chest. Nikki leaned in closer and just smiled down coldly at her victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>AWWWW, DID THE WITTLE BABY GET A BOO-BOO?</b>\u201d Nikki teased, giving Abby and exaggerated frown as she sniffled for effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cP-p-please\u2026my arm, she-\u201d Abby began, only to be get cut off as Nikki\u2019s false frown burst again into smiles and badly suppressed giggling. Leaning back in her chair to cool off, Brie\u2019s face soon filled the sky above the injured Paige fan. Brie bit her bottom lip playfully as she held back the desire to just crush the little one right on the spot. That would be far too easy an out\u2026instead she had another plan in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>DIDN\u2019T YOU LIKE GETTING TO BE THAT CLOSE TO PAIGE THOUGH? I THOUGHT YOU REALLY LIKED HER</b>,\u201d Brie began, shooting a look back at Nikki who quickly leaned forwards to join in the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNikki frowned down at Abby, looking almost hurt, \u201c<b>WE THOUGHT WE WERE DOING YOU A FAVOR GETTING YOU THAT CLOSE TO HER\u2026</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b>\u201cI DON\u2019T THINK SHE APPRECIATED OUT GIFT, NIKKI</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I DON\u2019T EITHER\u2026I GUESS PAIGE\u2019S FANS ARE ALSO\u2026LITTLE LOSERS</b>\u201d Nikki said, having fun as the last two words spilled from her lips. Smirking, she and Brie exchanged a quick glance before both of them slowly raised a hand to their foreheads. Abby could only whine miserably as the towering twins both sported an \u2018L\u2019 on their foreheads, giggling as they flashed the injured fan their classic loser sign (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/gI7RY.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/gI7RY.jpg</a>). Abby could feel hot tears already rolling down her face, her brain was still firing off every hormone and command it could, but the sticky wad of gum kept her firmly in place\u2026she wasn\u2019t going anywhere unless one of the twins wanted it. To demonstrate that realization, Brie smirked and slowly lifted the napkin into the air, watching Abby like a cat eyeing a mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I THINK\u2026THAT MAYBE SHE NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT SOME MANNERS</b>,\u201d Brie said smirking as Abby looked down at the massive duo. The little one swallowed nervously as she was reminded just how tiny she was compared to everything. Even the coffee cups that she had drank from hundreds of times now looked like water-towers clasped in their grasp (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.christianpost.com/full/81605/bella-twins.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.christianpost.com/full/816...</a>). Nikki smiled pleasantly as she leaned in a little and poked the bottom of the napkin, making the world swing back and forth for their tiny captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HOW SHOULD SHE MAKE IT UP TO US THOUGH?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I HAVE AN IDEA\u2026</b>\u201d Brie said, biting her lip as she grabbed the napkin a little more firmly and began to lower it\u2026 Abby\u2019s sense of panic began to intensify once again when she found that Brie had already lowered her past the table-top. With an agonizing slowness she thought only happened in movies, Abby watched Brie slowly cross her legs, leaving the bottom of her tremendous sandal dangling before her face. Screaming at the top of her lungs, Paige\u2019s miniature fan thrashed and fought to break free of the gum in time\u2026but she wasn\u2019t nearly so lucky. Brie giggled as she felt the wad of gum, and the accompanying little bug of a girl, press into the sole of her sandal. Without waiting more than a few seconds, Brie began dragging the napkin along the bottom of her sandal once\u2026twice\u2026three times\u2026.over and over and over again, as though she were trying to polish it. Biting her lip to stifle her laughter, Brie roughly dug at the dirt and grime that had been caked onto the bottom of her sandals for the first time in weeks. Her finger felt the tiny outline of Abby\u2019s back poking against her skin, the wad of gum getting pushed to either side of the tiny woman with each new swipe Brie made along her shoe. After a few seconds of determined scraping, she pulled the napkin away and turned it up in her hand, her eyes looking down coldly at the tiny girl; Abby had lost her humanity to the Diva, the tiny woman was now just a tool, a screaming, crying toothpick meant to remove whatever debris Brie\u2019s finger bade her to (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fantimetv.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/nikki-bella-and-brie-bella.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://fantimetv.files.wordpress.com/20...</a>). \u201c<b>STICK OUT YOUR TONGUE, I WANT YOU TO GET THESE THINGS REALLY CLEAN FOR ME,</b>\u201d Brie commanded before she quickly shoved the tiny girl\u2019s head back into the bottom of her sandal. Abby\u2019s scream was stifled as the tiny woman once again found her face being ground into the rough treads of Brie\u2019s sandal. Her nose was broken almost instantly when the giantess rammed Paige\u2019s tiny fan\u2019s face into a small pebble that had been lodged in between the rubber walls. A warm torrent of crimson began running down Abby\u2019s face, the tiny woman coughed and tried to scream, only to feel like she was suffocating every time Brie rubbed her into her sandals\u2019 sole again. After a few more minutes, the tiny thing was brought back out from the shadow of Brie\u2019s footwear. The giantesses looked down, smiling brightly at the red streak smeared across her face and dribbling down onto her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>AWWWWWWWWW, IS THE WITTLE BABY GONNA CWY?</b>\u201d Nikki cooed, pouting as she leaned in closer to Abby\u2019s writhing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cP-p-please\u2026I can\u2019t *cough* I can\u2019t breathe like this!\u201d the tiny woman tried to say. Her words only brought a bigger smile to the giantesses\u2019 faces though\u2026the more desperate she looked, the more it seemed to amuse the Bellas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YOU DIDN\u2019T EVEN DO A GOOD JOB CLEANING MY SANDAL, AND NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE A BREAK?</b>\u201d Brie teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WELL\u2026IF THE LITTLE CRYBABY DOESN\u2019T LIKE YOUR SANDAL\u2026THEN SHE CAN CLEAN YOUR FOOT!</b>\u201d Nikki added, nudging Brie with her shoulder and laughing down at Abby. The tiny girl began screaming for her life, the tiny squeak of her voice reaching the Bellas\u2019 ears just barely. Brie giggled and began lowering Abby back towards her foot before the little thing could suggest an alternative. Spreading her toes wide, Brie just giggled as she looked down at the napkin one last time. She wanted to offer the bug-sized girl a final piece of advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>MAKE SURE TO USE YOUR TONGUE DOWN THERE. I DON\u2019T WANT TO FEEL SOMETHING ROUGH ON MY FEET</b>,\u201d she quipped right before she pressed the napkin against the bottom of her big-toe, bringing about a torrent of giggles as she felt the tiny girl\u2019s body wriggle beneath her skin (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-Feet-1334553.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-...</a>). With her body still trapped in the wad of gum, Abby was powerless to resist as Brie shoved her, face-first, between her massive toes. The heat radiating off the giantess\u2019s skin was intense, and the rough patches unperceivable to people of the Bella\u2019s stature tore against her skin when she was roughly rubbed over them.  A small twitch of Brie\u2019s toes felt like it was about to crush half of Abby\u2019s ribcage. Then Brie ACTUALLY squeezed her toes around her; and at that moment, the tiny woman learned what the Wicked Witch of the East must have felt like when that house fell on top of her. Abby struggled, feeling her body start to creak under the weight of the massive digits as Brie just giggled from above, the napkin protecting her skin from Paige\u2019s gum. \u201c<b>WHAT\u2019S WRONG WITTLE ONE? YOU DON\u2019T LIKE IT WHEN I DO\u2026THIS?</b>\u201d Brie said as she squeezed a little harder, hearing a fun little cracking sound. The devious Diva would have kept going till Abby popped of not for Nikki poking her, hard, in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEY, YOU CAN\u2019T BREAK HER YET. SHE STILL HAS TO CLEAN MY SNEAKERS!</b>\u201d the giantess laughed, entertained endlessly by the tiny girl at the mercy of her sister\u2019s toes alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I\u2019LL LET HER GO WHEN SHE LICKS LIKE SHE\u2019S SUPPOSED TO</b>,\u201d Brie cheerfully chided. She leaned a little closer to her foot and wiggled her toes again, bringing about another few small crackling sounds and the high-pitched squeak of Abby screaming out in pain. \u201c<b>COME ON BUG, LICK MY FOOT\u2026</b>\u201d Brie commanded, biting her lip in anticipation. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Abby felt tears pouring from her eyes. Her nose was still leaking crimson down the front of her shirt, but that was hardly her concern right now. The bloody nose she was struggling to breathe through was already hard enough to deal with; now a simple squeeze of Nikki\u2019s toes had cracked her ribcage in more places than she could determine. Stabs of pain radiated from seemingly every inch of her torso, the spider-web of cracks and fractures to the bones seethed like liquid fire was seeping out. It was a pain so intense, she wished she could pass out, but more than enough to force her to stay awake; Abby was trapped in a living hell\u2026with only one, humiliating way out. She planned on taking it. Sticking her tongue out, the crying shrunken woman began lapping at the slightly salty-tasting, skin between Brie\u2019s titanic toes. Once, twice, thrice\u2026.Abby was quickly lapping at Brie\u2019s foot like a dog lapping at a bowl of water after being deprived of something to drink for hours. There was desperation in it to live that just tickled Brie all over; as the Diva began to laugh, Nikki squirmed in her seat impatiently.<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>OK, GIVE HER TO ME ALREADY, YOU GOT TO HAVE YOUR FUN!</b>\u201d Nikki teased, poking Brie in the ribs again. The other Bella twin was itching to show Paige\u2019s fan just what she amounted to\u2026the dirt on the bottom of her sneaker. <br>\r\n\tBrie smiled at her sister for a moment before looking down at Abby and letting loose and exasperated sigh, \u201c<b>SORRY WITTLE ONE, NIKKI\u2019S FEET WANT SOME ATTENTION TOO</b>.\u201d Bringing the little bundle of napkin back from her foot, she gingerly passed it to Nikki and leaned in closer, resting against Nikki\u2019s shoulder to enjoy the next part of the show. Nikki couldn\u2019t keep herself from smiling as she pointed the tiny girl towards herself. The gum had already mostly dried at this point, turning into a rubbery cast around the tiny, tormented girl. A crimson streak was running down her front, and while the nose-bleed seemed to have stopped, the remnants of it were incredibly pleasing to Nikki\u2019s eyes. A small squeeze of her fingers brought another tiny squeak to Nikki\u2019s ears; her tiny, tattered toy seemed to be in incredible pain, her eyes silently pleading up at her new tormentor. Silent pleas weren\u2019t enough for Nikki though\u2026she slowly began to lift the tiny thing up to her face.<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WHAT\u2019S WRONG? YOU SLEEPY?</b>\u201d Nikki cooed, her voice coming out in the sing-song tone parents used to talk to their upset infants. <br>\r\n\t\u201cP-please! I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t keep\u2026.\u201d Abby tried to say, her voice failing her with the feeble amount of air her ruined ribs could carry. Another tiny squeeze from Nikki\u2019s fingers made her squeak in pain, her ribs crackling and crunching just a little bit more. <br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YOU CAN\u2019T KEEP DOING WHAT?</b>\u201d Nikki asked, faking an inquisitive look.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026please, I\u2019ll be\u2026be killed if you\u2026.you keep\u2026..\u201d she began panting again, her face already turning a slight blue hue. <br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YOU MEAN\u2026YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO HELP ME CLEAN MY SNEAKERS?</b>\u201d Nikki looked almost hurt, giving another tiny squeeze to the injured girl between her fingers. \u201c<b>YOU\u2019RE HURTING MY FEELINGS</b>,\u201d Nikki said, slowly squeezing a little harder, bringing about a few more cracking sounds. \u201c<b>SO YOU\u2019LL LICK BRIE\u2019S FEET, BUT YOU WON\u2019T EVEN HELP ME CLEAN OFF MY SNEAKERS? DO YOU HATE ME\u2026IS THAT IT?</b>\u201d Nikki couldn\u2019t hide her smile anymore; a full on, sadistic grin was spread across her lips. Abby squeaked painfully, certain that at any moment, Nikki\u2019s fingers would collapse her chest; making her pop, a living grape. <br>\r\n\t\u201cP-please! I don\u2019t\u2026I d-don\u2019t hate you!\u201d she wheezed, the world around her starting to go dark. <br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>DO YOU LIKE ME MORE THAN PAIGE?</b>\u201d Nikki asked, giggling as she saw the little thing begin to go limp. Another tiny press of her fingers and she heard a tiny popping sound, a rib or two must have broken she figured. Either way, it was enough to rouse the half-asleep girl to action; she began thrashing and screaming out once more, livelier than she\u2019d been in a while. <br>\r\n\t\u201cY-y-y-y-yes! Please! Yes! I-I-I-I l-love you and B-Brie!\u201d Abby squeaked, struggling to breathe as the broken rib continued to crackle with electric pain. <br>\r\n\tNikki chuckled down at the tiny girl in the napkin, a low purr slipping from between her lips. She\u2019d managed to get one of Paige\u2019s die-hard fans to turn on her with just a little squeeze from her fingers. \u201c<b>DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT WITTLE BUG?</b>\u201d Nikki cooed one last time, smirking mischievously. <br>\r\n\t\u201cYes! Yes! I r-really mean it!\u201d Abby screamed, squirming. The tiny girl could only shiver in terror when she saw the cruel smile that spread over Nikki\u2019s lips as soon as the answer left her mouth. <br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>THEN YOU WON\u2019T MIND HELPING ME CLEAN MY SNEAKERS, WILL YOU WITTLE ONE?</b>\u201d she cooed. Before Abby could even scream in response, Nikki pressed the tiny woman into the side of her sneaker\u2019s sole and began dragging the tiny thing roughly against the patterned rubber surface. A tiny series of squeaks began sounding, barely perceptible to Nikki\u2019s ears, while she used the tiny girl to get at a bit of mud that had been clinging to the instep of her right foot. The Bella\u2019s exchanged an excited look. Nikki herself already felt her cheeks starting to burn a little red; having Paige\u2019s fan was one thing, but the Diva was already wondering if she ever got lucky enough to find one of her rivals at this size. Nikki\u2019s Nike\u2019s were relatively new, but that didn\u2019t stop the giantess from dragging the little girl against the white side of her shoe\u2026that is until she noticed a tiny red streak was starting to appear (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/Screen_Shot_2015-08-23_at_11.00.19_PM_b4qjk6.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.complex.com/complex/image/...</a>). With a calculating coldness, she switched her focus and began rubbing the napkin\u2019s tiny passenger against the toe end of her shoe. The rubber cup slowly began to have bits of dirt flake off when again more shimmery red streaks began getting left behind. Her rag seemed to be making more of a mess than it was meant to clean up in the first place.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Groaning, the giantess pulled the napkin from her sneaker and brought it back up in front of her face for an inspection. Abby\u2019s nose had been broken beyond comprehension at this point. Her gentle, ski-sloped nose was now bent horribly to the right, a torrent of crimson pouring down her face. If that were the only injury, it would be enough, but Nikki\u2019s intense need to clean had done wonders on the little woman in only the first few strokes against her sneaker. The tiny woman\u2019s smile had been ruined; a few teeth were now missing after the uneven surface of the giantess\u2019 sneaker was pressed to her far too tightly. Any bit of dirt or dust she was dragged over, seemed almost destined to mutilate her friend in one way or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YOU CAN\u2019T EVEN CLEAN MY SNEAKER RIGHT?! WHAT THE HELL? I THOUGHT YOU LIKE US NOW BUG\u2026</b>\u201d Nikki sneered, her fake anger slowly giving way to the sadistic smile underneath the crumbling scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cP-p-pl\u2026.pleashe\u2026.\u201d Abby tried to say, her words slurring on the mouthful of blood and missing teeth she was now trying to compensate for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>EEEEEEEEEWWWW!</b>\u201d Brie said, giggling as she leaned in closer to get a better look at the battered little fan. \u201c<b>SHE\u2019S SO FUCKING GROSS!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c<b>HAHAHA, YEAH\u2026I DON\u2019T WANT SOMETHING THIS GROSS ON MY SNEAKERS. YOU TAKE HER BRIE!</b>\u201d Nikki said, passing the napkin to her sister. Brie took it and smirked down at the little one, winking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving Abby even a second to react, Brie popped the lid off of Nikki\u2019s coffee cup and jammed the napkin down inside. The steaming liquid quickly soaked into the napkin, burning the tiny woman alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo! Nononononono! Please! It huwts! Hewp me!\u201d Abby screamed, tears coming to her eyes. It felt like she was getting slowly boiled as the giantesses above stared into the cup, giggling at her pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEWP YOU? WHY SHOULD WE HEWP YOU WITTLE ONE?</b>\u201d Nikki cooed, leaning over the cup. \u201c<b>YOU EVEN RUINED MY COFFEE NOW\u2026</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhghhhh! Pwease!\u201d she screamed again, her skin already turning red and raw. The burning sea around her did manage to do one good thing for Abby; the hot liquid let her finally get loose from the gum that had kept her firmly in place for her routine as a cleaning implement. It seemed more cruel than helpful though, the gum had at least insulated her back from the heat. Now that she was freed, Abby was left alone, treading with her one good arm and battered face in the boiling brown waves. A searing wave crashed down on her as Brie slowly began rotating the cup in her grasp a little, stirring in the soaked napkin until the soggy mass began to sink below the hot beverage\u2019s surface. \u201cHeeeeeeeeewp m-\u201d  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c<b>FINE, LITTLE BABY, THIS SHOULD HELP\u2026</b>\u201d Nikki said as she grabbed Brie\u2019s iced coffee and took the lid off, slowly pouring the concoction into the cup. Ice cubes began to splash down\u2026one landing right on Abby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEY</b>,\u201d Brie laughed jokingly, \u201c<b>I WASN\u2019T DONE WITH THAT YET!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c<b>YOU HAVE A DRINK IN YOUR HAND</b>,\u201d Nikki responded, biting her tongue to stifle another laugh as the pair looked down into the cup only to find they couldn\u2019t see Abby anymore. A second later, the tiny body broke the surface, screaming and thrashing. The influx of cold water had sent her shivering after the iceberg of an ice cube almost sank her. With only one arm though, Abby wasn\u2019t able to stay above the surface long before sinking back under the coffee\u2019s violent surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>DID SHE?....SHIT\u2026.WELL FUN WHILE SHE LASTED</b>,\u201d Brie said, disappointed as she stood up and began walking toward one of the vacant trash cans in the caf\u00e9. Bending down, she smiled as she saw another empty cup sitting inside the can. With a deft hand, she began to gently pour out her cup into the new one, hoping to see one last trace of her newest little friend. It worked. A tiny flash of the shrunken woman\u2019s little body whizzed before Brie\u2019s eyes, stopping her pour perfectly. Giggling, the giant Bella saw that Abby hadn\u2019t drowned yet, and the little woman\u2019s eyes were focused on her fearfully. Biting her lip, Brie only smirked down at the tiny girl as she slowly moved the cup that used to hold her over the little one\u2019s head. Abby began screaming, her squeaking voice barely reaching Brie\u2019s ears from down in the trash can. Between the broken face and the distance, Abby\u2019s final pleas went unheard, though the giantess knew the general gist. \u201c<b>BYE BUG</b>,\u201d Brie said as she began to slowly lower Nikki\u2019s coffee cup into the trash can. As the excess coffee began to get pressed out from the compressing cups, Brie watched the warm waterfall intently to see if Abby would get saved by the rising tide. Unfortunately for the tiny woman\u2026Brie never caught sight of her for a good reason. Abby had gotten stuck directly under the cup Brie brought down on her. Trapped to the bottom of the container, she wasn\u2019t able to get away with only one of her arms working and a pair of slightly broken ribs thanks to the Bella\u2019s slight squeezes. In the boiling ocean of coffee, the tiny woman struggled and thrashed like a trapped fish\u2026only to drown as Brie submerged her completely\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore Brie could turn to leave the table, Nikki walked up and dumped the remains of their breakfast into the can, burying the cups under a mess of plates, wrappers, crumbs, and plastic utensils. Smirking down into the can, Nikki looked at Brie and gave her a playful shove with her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee? Even Paige\u2019s fans are trash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs she still in the bathroom?\u201d Brie asked, realizing how long it had been since the anti-Diva had left for the bathroom after unknowingly amputating her fan\u2019s arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh\u2026yeah, I guess so,\u201d Nikki said, straightening up. Just then, her stomach growled playfully as the Bella chuckled. \u201cI need to use the bathroom before we go. I\u2019ll see if she\u2019s in there,\u201d Nikki mused, turning to walk for the ladies room. Brie stuck right by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll try too,\u201d she added, responding to Nikki\u2019s confused expression. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOk weirdo,\u201d Nikki replied, heading for the bathroom door. The swinging door gave way with a light push, revealing the softly lit, neutral-toned bathroom of the caf\u00e9. With coffee colored walls and a look that was somewhere between stone and Victorian bathroom, it was clear whoever had designed the place probably did so after sleeping on a pile of posh interior decorating magazines. Minus the hipster\u2019s-wet-dream of an interior, there was something else off about the restroom\u2026no Paige. \u201cWhat the hell?...\u201d Nikki\u2019s commentary would have to be put on hold as her stomach growled angrily at her again, a sharp pain going through her gut. Running into one of the bigger stalls, she quickly locked the door and sat down. Another wave of discomfort ran through Nikki\u2019s gut, bringing the Bella\u2019s head down as she tensed up. When it passed, she stared at her sneakers, the tile floor, and\u2026.Paige? Nikki couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing as she stared at the floor, her eyes had to be playing tricks on her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xQG7tXVY8EQ/sddefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xQG7tXVY8EQ/sddefa...</a>). It looked like Paige, who could not have been much bigger than her fan was, now waved up at Nikki from between her sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey! Nikki! Help!\u201d Paige\u2019s miniscule voice squeaked from the floor. The tiny wrestler thought that she\u2019d been saved when she dodged Nikki\u2019s sneakers in the stall\u2026she had no idea how wrong she was. Not yet anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWordlessly, Nikki bent forwards and reached down for Paige between her feet. The little woman struggled between her fingers as Nikki slowly gripped Paige in her hand and sat back up, dangling her before her face. Playing with Paige\u2019s fan before was one thing, but now that the little British bitch herself was in Nikki\u2019s grasp\u2026.Well, the playful grin that spread over the Bella\u2019s face was more than enough to clue Paige in that she\u2019d picked her \u2018savior\u2019 rather poorly. A slight squeeze of Nikki\u2019s fingers brought a tiny squeak of pain from the little Diva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cN-Nikki, cut that out, it fucking hurts if you squeeze me like tha-\u201d Paige\u2019s complaint was cut off as Nikki did just what the shrunken woman had just forbid her from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>NO FUCKIN WAY\u2026.IT\u2019S REALLY YOU\u2026</b>.\u201d Nikki mused, still a little dumbstruck by today\u2019s turn of events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cL-let go! Nikki, put me down!\u201d Paige demanded, squirming between the Bella sister\u2019s massive fingers. Her ribs started creaking under the pressure. Every passing second just seemed to reinforce the shrunken woman\u2019s hunch that she wasn\u2019t any safer having been found. Looking up at her captor\u2019s face, she for confirmation for that hunch. The smirk that slowly spread over Nikki\u2019s lips sent a shiver running down Paige\u2019s spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I DIDN\u2019T HEAR PLEASE SHRIMP\u2026</b>.\u201d Nikki purred, slowly starting to squeeze a little harder on the tiny ribcage clamped between her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cN-N-Nikki\u2026.stop\u2026.s-stop it! Stop!....\u201d Paige squealed, her voice getting higher and higher with each passing second as the pressure Nikki brought to bear on her only increased. Her fists pounded uselessly against Nikki\u2019s warm skin. Leaning down against it, Paige\u2019s head flopped down against the giant finger as her vision started to go dark. Acting on pure instinct, the little lady tried to push her head up for just a moment. Everything happened in a blur. One moment she was almost passing out; the next she could taste Nikki\u2019s skin in her mouth as she bit down with all her might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>OUCH! WHAT THE FUCK?!</b>\u201d Nikki snapped, dropping Paige back to the tile floor. Examining her fingertip, Nikki felt a swell of rage rise up in her when a single droplet of crimson started to form where Paige had bit her. The bug-sized girl had drawn blood. She was going to pay for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPaige hit the hard tile floor and groaned; her whole mouth tasted like copper after biting Nikki, but while she\u2019d gotten out of the Bella\u2019s grasp, the fall had left her stunned. Enraged, Nikki slowly began to lift her right foot above the bug-sized bitch. Her brain had been filled with so many ideas of fun things to do with the pathetically small wrestler, but not all she wanted was to feel the little thing crunch under the ball of her foot. Paige snapped out of her daze when the bottom of Nikki\u2019s tremendous sneaker blocked out the lights over the stall. The clean treads Abby had been dragged through and rubbed against now loomed down over the former Diva\u2019s champion. In a matter of minutes, Paige had gone from being one of the most recognizable female wrestlers in the world, to learning what the world looked like from a bug\u2019s eye view. Terrified, she flipped over onto her stomach and shot off like an Olympic sprinter. Her tiny sneakers squeaked and slid as the smooth tile underfoot provided little traction for the reduced refugee. Jumping into the grout between tiles, she finally found a solid track to run on, gaining some serious distance in the shaded land under Nikki\u2019s descending sneaker. The rush of wind roared in her ears as the massive foot grew closer and closer to impact. Without looking up, Paige threw herself forwards with all her might at the last second, praying that she\u2019d avoid getting stuck under Nikki\u2019s sneaker\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNikki ground her sneaker back and forth, unsure if she got Paige underfoot or not. If she did though, she wanted to make sure there was nothing left of her besides a red little smear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>FUCKING LITTLE SLUT</b>,\u201d Nikki fumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>NIKKI? EVERYTHING OK?</b>\u201d Brie asked, turning away from the mirror where she was fixing her make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YEAH, I JUST\u2026OH SHIT! NIKKI, THE FLOOR! GET THE LITTLE BITCH!</b>\u201d Nikki shouted, seeing that not only had she failed to crush Paige, but now the tiny Diva was out of reach and making a break for the bathroom\u2019s main door. If she wasn\u2019t stuck on the toilet, Nikki would have leapt for the tiny thing herself. Growling angrily, her eyes locked on Paige\u2026she was going to begrudgingly leave this one to Brie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?</b>\u201d Brie asked, slowly strolling towards the stall, confused by the sudden command her sister had barked at her. Unknown to Brie, she was about to step down with Paige once again shrouded in the shadow of a Bella sister\u2019s foot\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Getting to her feet, she screamed up at the other sister, hoping that Brie would treat her better than Nikki did (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://everybodyhatescleveland.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/paige-hair.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://everybodyhatescleveland.files.wo...</a>). Brie\u2019s other foot landed just to her left as the giantess knocked on the stall door. Looking over her shoulder, Paige felt a shiver go down her spine\u2026she could see Nikki glaring at her from under the stall\u2019s massive door. The sneakers that had almost crushed her were now pressed back against the sides of the toilet, bracing Nikki like a jungle cat about to pounce. Clambering onto Brie\u2019s sandal, the bug-sized-Brit moved towards Brie\u2019s tremendous big toe and cautiously reached out a hand towards the imposing mound of skin that dwarfed her. She hesitated for just a moment, unsure about this idea when Brie made the choice for her with a simple flex of her toes. Caught off-guard, Paige slid and fell onto her ass as Brie\u2019s rising toes bent the leather floor of the sandal, turning it into a one-way slope headed right for the massive digits. Only a slight squeak of a scream made it past Brie\u2019s toes before they settled back down, pinning Paige beneath them. Another slight scrunch and the tiny Diva felt like her body was going to pop at any second. She struggled like mad, trying in vain to push the toe off of her. While she wasn\u2019t able to move Brie\u2019s foot, Paige\u2019s struggles were more than enough to tickle the massive toes and get their owner\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WHAT?</b>\u201d Brie said, splaying her toes as she turned her gaze down to her sandal-clad foot. Gently, she pressed her toes back down against the sandal\u2019s sole only to feel a tiny wriggling sensation against her big toe. Bending down, she swiped under her toes with her finger, watching in awe as a miniature Paige was now left clinging to her finger like a tan life-raft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>DID YOU GET HER?!</b>\u201d Nikki called from the other side of the stall door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>Y-YEAH\u2026HOLY SHIT SHE\u2019S REALLY\u2026REALLY TINY!</b>\u201d Brie squealed. The sound of the toilet flushing echoed from the other side and a few seconds later, Paige found herself dangling between the Bella sisters\u2019 massive faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cS-stop it!\u201d Paige screamed, trying her best to look tough before the grinning giantesses. Nikki swiftly walked to the bathroom\u2019s door and flipped the lock. No one would be interrupting them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>STOP WHAT?</b>\u201d Nikki said on her return, holding her open palm under the wriggling shrunken woman. Brie released Paige, returning her to Nikki\u2019s hand where this whole fiasco had started. Only now, the giantess was much more cautious of the little woman\u2019s mouth, intent to make sure that this time if anyone was going to be losing blood, it would be the bug in her palm. \u201c<b>YOU SEEM KINDA NERVOUS THERE PAIGE\u2026AWE YOU MAYBE SCAWED WITTLE GIWL?</b>\u201d Nikki teased, wiping a pretend tear from her eye. Paige seemed at a loss for words, instead staring up at Nikki\u2019s massive face like a tourist reading billboards in Times Square on their first visit. Biting her lip, Nikki gently pushed Paige down with her thumb before quickly retracting it so she couldn\u2019t be bit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNikki, stop!\u201d Paige demanded, struggling to her feet again. \u201cP-p-put me down, right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YOU REALLY WANT TO GO DOWN?</b>\u201d Brie teasingly inquired, leaning in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I THINK SHE WANTS TO BE A BIG GIRL</b>,\u201d Nikki chirped, \u201c<b>AND WHY SHOULD I LISTEN TO YOU BUG?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HERE, I HAVE AN IDEA</b>,\u201d Brie said, quickly plucking Paige off of Nikki\u2019s palm. Giggling, she walked back to the sink and hopped onto it before kicking off her sandals, letting her massive bare feet dangle in the air (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img.ifcdn.com/images/bc19736c07135c8738423559d96175a3a72c90be2fe5604f0ce9f19e68035f30_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img.ifcdn.com/images/bc19736c0713...</a>). The giantess flexed her toes and looked down at Paige mischievously; the tiny wrestler began struggling once more, not liking where this was going. She was right to struggle, but it did nothing to stop what Brie had in mind. Like she was riding a rollercoaster, Paige found herself flying through the air all of a sudden, her stomach rising into her throat. It was all brought to a halt though as she was pressed (face-first) into the soft sole of Brie\u2019s foot. Grinning from ear to ear, Brie shifted her hand so that only her pointer finger was needed to knead the little Diva into her skin. Paige was trying to scream, but only managed to get a mouthful of Bella foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>LOOK AT HER WIGGLING, SHE REALLY LOOKS LIKE A BUG NOW!</b>\u201d Nikki chuckled, leaning down a little to see her sister playing with tiny Paige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>SHE IS A BUG</b>,\u201d Brie corrected, bringing about another burst of giggles from Nikki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HOW DO YOU LIKE BRIE\u2019S FOOT PAIGE? ISN\u2019T IT NICE?</b>\u201d Nikki taunted, loving the sight of Paige\u2019s arms and legs trying to push her face away from the slightly tanned skin of her sister\u2019s sole. The little woman was in hell as her body was pressed relentlessly into Brie\u2019s skin. After a whole day in sandals, the giantess\u2019s sole wasn\u2019t exactly fragrant like a field of flowers. In fact, the acrid smell of dried sweat continued to sting Paige\u2019s nose and lungs with each labored breath she had to fight to take in. When she wasn\u2019t able to inhale the smell of Brie\u2019s foot, Paige\u2019s head was buried in her foot, forcing her to taste the salty skin of the giantess. What\u2019s more, her body felt like it was on fire now as the heat of Brie\u2019s skin slowly cooked her. At her new size, the giantess\u2019s skin was more than just warm; it was like hot stones left out in the summer sun. Her now very thin skin didn\u2019t fare well against the rough surface of Brie\u2019s sole. Between getting too hot, almost being crushed, or suffocated, or rubbed raw against the massive foot, Paige was not having a good time while the Bella\u2019s watched, bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH HER NEXT?</b>\u201d Brie asked, loving the new burst of struggles from her captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I STILL WANT TO SQUISH THE BITCH FOR BITING ME BEFORE\u2026BUT I COULD COME UP WITH SOME BETTER IDEAS</b>,\u201d Nikki replied, her eyes transfixed on Brie\u2019s foot. \u201c<b>MAYBE I SHOULD JUST FLUSH HER LIKE THE PIECE OF SHIT SHE IS\u2026</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>NO WAY, I LIKE HER UNDER MY FOOT LIKE THIS! I THINK I WANNA KEEP HER HERE A LITTLE LONGER</b>,\u201d Brie shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEY, I FOUND HER FIRST, I GET TO PLAY FIRST</b>,\u201d Nikki teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>ONLY IF YOU HAVE A REAL PLAN, BITCH,</b>\u201d Brie retorted, smirking evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b>\u201cI WAS THINKING PAIGE COULD COME TO THE GYM WITH ME\u2026SEE WHAT A REAL WORKOUT LOOKS LIKE</b>,\u201d Nikki mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe twins continued discussing what to do with Paige, leaving the little woman to eavesdrop while getting gently ground into Brie\u2019s sole. After what felt like an eternity, the pair decided that Paige would be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Bellas saw that there wasn\u2019t anyone around, though some of the other Divas had left their stuff in here. Eva\u2019s bag was left on one of the benches while a few of the lockers seemed to have different Divas\u2019 equipment or street clothes inside. It seemed like everyone was making an appearance today. \u201cBRIE, COME ON, GIVE ME THE LITTLE BITCH ALREADY\u201d Nikki whined playfully, excited as she started getting changed into her workout gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. OK. DON\u2019T BE A BRAT\u2026SHE\u2019S ALL YOURS,\u201d Brie teased as she sat down on the bench Eva\u2019s stuff was on. Crossing her legs, Brie giggled and began fishing around with her finger between her slightly sweaty sole and her sandal for the diminutive anti-Diva who\u2019d been struggling there for the last half hour. The beautiful Bella sister smirked when she finally felt her finger begin prodding a tiny object that squirmed back in response. Paige had become stuck perfectly to the bottom of her foot, like a piece of chewed gum Brie had stepped on without noticing. She heard a tiny yelp of pain from under her foot as her nail dug into Paige\u2019s back, trying to peel the tiny woman off in one piece\u2026if not a little roughly. Brie couldn\u2019t help but giggle at the sight of the tiny raven-haired woman pinched between her fingers. \u201cAWWWWW, LOOKS LIKE THE WITTLE GIRL IS ALL WORN OUT. IS SOMEONE SLEEPY?\u201d Brie cooed teasingly. Paige tried to move, but only managed a weak little twitch between the Bella sister\u2019s fingers, much to Brie\u2019s amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHE BETTER WAKE UP,\u201d Nikki said, smirking as she pulled on her shorts and slipped her feet back into her sneakers, \u201cWE\u2019RE GOING TO DO A REAL WORKOUT TODAY. NONE OF THAT KID CRAP PAIGE IS USED TO.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJUST TRY NOT TO KILL HER YET, I STILL WANT TO PLAY WITH HER A LITTLE MORE TONIGHT,\u201d Brie said, passing the exhausted little thing to her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYEAH, YEAH, YEAH\u2026HEY\u2026WHAT\u2019S THAT?\u201d Nikki said, raising an eyebrow as she looked down onto the bench, right next to Brie\u2019s butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT\u2019S WHAT?\u201d Brie asked, slowly following Nikki\u2019s gaze until her eyes fell on the tiny thing too. Jumping up, Brie took a step next to Nikki and felt a small chill go down her spine, \u201cEEEEWWWW! WHY DOES THIS PLACE ALWAYS HAVE BUGS IN IT?!\u201d Brie slowly began to lift her foot into the air when Nikki placed a hand on her knee and forced it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT? JUST LET ME SQUISH IT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBRIE, JUST CHILL\u2026HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A BUG THAT RED?\u201d Nikki said, smirking as she dangled Paige in front of her sister\u2019s face to get the message across. There was a moment of realization as Brie\u2019s eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO WAY\u2026\u201d Brie bent the slightest bit at the waist and squinted down. A small squeak of joy escaped her lips; Brie broke out into a massive smile and began giggling. \u201cYOU\u2019VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the bench, Eva felt her blood turn to ice\u2026the crimson-haired Diva stared up at the Bellas in a mix of awe and terror. At only a few centimeters tall, Eva was barely the size of a small ant. From her vantage point, looking up at the Bellas felt like staring up at skyscrapers\u2026skyscrapers that had a bone to pick with her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/478/693/hi-res-445dd5f5de5a634433ee4d0661b2414c_crop_north.jpg?w=630&amp;h=420&amp;q=75\" target=\"_blank\">http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images...</a>). The tiny thing turned and began trying to run away across the seemingly endless expanse of hardwood that stretched out before her. She could feel the stale air of the locker room stinging her lungs; a stitch formed painfully in her side. Eva\u2019s mind was in a million places as she ran. Why was she so small all of a sudden? Why were Brie and Nikki here? Why was Paige small too? Why was Brie smiling at her like that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wall of tan flesh had fallen right in front of Eva, stopping the Diva right in her tracks. Falling on her ass, Eva felt her whole body stiffen when she opened her eyes to find herself staring up at none other than Brie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDID YOU DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH YOUR HAIR EVA?

The remaining Bella sister giggled, gently prodding Eva every so often to keep the little thing knocked on her ass. Brie looked like a little kid playing with a new toy; her eyes sparkled with such enthusiasm that it made Eva sick to her stomach. Already she could tell that Brie didn\u2019t see her as a person anymore\u2026just a bug to be dealt with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBrie\u2026p-please!

AFRAID OF ME GOING INTO\u2026BRIE MODE?!\u201d Brie shouted at the top of her lungs as she stamped her foot and stood proud over little Eva (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.wwe.com/f/styles/wwe_large/public/rd-talent/Bio/Brie_Bella_bio.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wwe.com/f/styles/wwe_large/pu...</a>).

An evil smile had fully spread over her lips, sending chills down Eva\u2019s spine. The tiny woman once again tried getting to her feet, only to be slammed into by Brie\u2019s fingernail which sent her once again tumbling along the hardwood surface of the bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCOME ON EVA, PUT UP AT LEAST A LITTLE FIGHT,\u201d the giantess teased, biting her tremendous lip playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cS-Stop it!\u201d Eva screamed, trying once again to get to her feet. Once again she was sent flying with a gentle flick from Brie. Crying out in pain, Eva thought she was going to die on this bench. Already bruises were starting to pop up on her arms, legs, stomach, chest, and back thanks to the hits she endured. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this, Brie!\u201d the redhead screamed, coughing as it felt like the last flick might have broken a rib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHEHEHE, WE AREN\u2019T DONE PLAYING YET THOUGH\u2026GET UP EVA!\u201d Brie whispered, her voice still deafening to little Eva. \u201cDON\u2019T BE A LITTLE BITCH LIKE USUAL, LET\u2019S KEEP PLAYING!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEva pushed herself to her knees, a hot wave of anger crashing down on her; snapping her head up, she was ready to tell Brie off when she was once again confronted with the sheer difference in scale between them...the cry of defiance died in her chest (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/87/files/2016/03/Eva-Marie-3-850x560.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blog...</a>). This time Brie let the little thing scramble to her feet. After so many flicks, Eva looked like she was slowly changing purple all over. Standing was already taxing for the little redhead, every bone and muscle in her body ached. Her bruised and/or cracked ribs made even taking in the smallest breath excruciating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cB-B-Brie\u2026p-please\u2026\u201d Eva whined, only bringing about another rumbling giggle from Brie\u2026until the giantess froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHOLD ON A SEC\u2026SORRY, ALLERGIES,\u201d Brie said sincerely as she sniffled. The gust of wind pulled Eva forward, knocking the tiny woman onto her face\u2026a fact that was not overlooked by Brie. Eva looked up to see the widest grin yet painting Brie\u2019s face. A chill went down her spine as the giantess smirked down at the redhead\u2026their newest game had begun. \u201cI\u2019M REALLY SORRY EVA\u2026MY NOSE IS JUST REALLY STUFFY,\u201d Brie cooed as she sniffed again, watching the gust of wind. Eva flopped onto the hardwood surface of the bench, trying her best to stay down and avoid getting pulled in by another gust. Brie inhaled again; the wind rushing past her and hurting her ears. For the tiny woman, it felt like intermittent hurricanes were blowing against her with each light sniffle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBrie! Stop it! Shit! Stop!\u201d Eva screamed, terrified as every small sniff threatened to rip her from the bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWAIT, SORRY MY ALLERGIES HAVE BEEN KILLING ME LATELY,\u201d Brie continued, pressing her finger down to close one nostril as she moved closer. Giggling, Brie breathed in deeply through her open nostril. The force from the first few sniffles weren\u2019t even comparable to this. Eva screamed as she was slowly lifted from the ground by the vortex of wind now swirling around her. Tumbling in the air, Eva looked up and screamed. Staring into the dark tunnel of Brie\u2019s nostril, Eva could only imagine the hell that awaited her if she didn\u2019t act fast. Reaching out, she grabbed onto the edge of the giant Bella\u2019s nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomeone help me! Please, help me!\u201d Eva screamed. Just as the words left her mouth, Brie finished inhaling. The whirlwind that was pulling on her finally disappeared, letting the tiny girl fall back to the bench again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Eva groaned, writhing as Brie giggled and examined the little thing with a sly smirk on her face (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ED7tjRdfOVk/maxresdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ED7tjRdfOVk/maxre...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI THINK IT\u2019S UNDER CONTROL,\u201d Brie giggled, letting Eva get to her feet again. The moment the little one got up, Brie smirked and leaned in closer. Her finger pushed one nostril shut a half-second later\u2026then the whirlwind began once again. Eva was ripped from the ground this time. She flipped and tumbled through the air too quickly for her to right herself and reach for the edge of Brie\u2019s nostril again. When she finally saw the side of Brie\u2019s nostril, the tiny Diva was already inside the fleshy tunnel. Eva\u2019s scream echoed inside Brie\u2019s nostril, even making it to the giantess\u2019s ears. Suddenly, it all came to a stop as Eva slammed into the wall, clothes-lined by one of the small little hairs that lined the tunnel. Brie felt an intense tickling in her nose from her little rival\u2019s struggles\u2026which ironically caused the Diva to ACTUALLY need to sniffle. \u201cUGH, GOTTA BE SOMETHING IN THE AIR,\u201d Brie teased before sniffling deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cN-No! Help m-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEva couldn\u2019t even get the rest of the words out before she was covered with mucus. Chocking on it, the tiny girl tried to spit it out. The slip-stream of air blowing past the thick layer of mucus began to dry it at an alarming rate. Eva found she couldn\u2019t get the mouthful of mucus out because it was quickly turning hard like rock, covering her face. Thrashing, the tiny woman tried to breath\u2026but nothing could get through the thick mask\u2026everything was going dark\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMUCH BETTER,\u201d Brie said, giggling as she sniffled again. Turning, the giantess finally\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Getting up wasn\u2019t giving her any sort of advantage. The world around her had gone from the towering walls and ceilings of the bathroom into a thick jungle. Well, at least that was the closest comparison Paige could make; she had never seen anything remotely like the plants that now surrounded her\u2026or so she thought. Another tremor knocked Paige to the ground once again. After falling through the thick canopy of this forest she had lost track of where Brie had gone, but the giantess was having no such troubles. Brie\u2019s giggled split the air like thunder. The sprawling jungle was the edge of Brie\u2019s lawn, right before the large weed-covered beds she\u2019d planned on preparing today for seeding. Nothing made Brie more relaxed than tending to her garden, working with the earth just felt harmonious to her. Today was special though, her little helper was going to make the normally mundane task of weeding far more entertaining! From her position, Paige was just another helpless insect in her garden, but she wasn\u2019t going to be ignored like any other ant or beetle would. No, this bug was going to entertain the beautiful Bella sister as she tended to the beds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShit!\u201d Paige screamed, falling on her face once again. Brie\u2019s slightest movement was turning this jungle into a trampoline\u2026with very painful landings. A thick, green screen suddenly rose up in front of Paige; one of those weird plants again. Trying to circumvent it, Paige realized that the same kind of tree seemed to be almost everywhere! Then her eyes caught sight of it, light! Ahead just a few dozen yards, Paige could see the bright beams of light peering through the thick green overgrowth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe quakes seemed to be getting stronger, that could only mean Brie was close. Paige hated the fact that she had no idea where the giantess was; it felt like she was running from Predator in a bad rip-off of the movie. She needed to get to the light, at least then she might be able to figure out what was going on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HMMMMMM\u2026.NOW WHERE DID MY WITTLE FWIEND GO?</b>\u201d Brie\u2019s voice echoed, sending a chill down Paige\u2019s spine. The light was closer now! 30 yards\u2026.25 yards\u2026..12 yards\u2026.7 yards\u2026.4 yards\u2026.1 yard! She burst through the foliage and immediately got tripped up as the blinding light caused her to slip on the sudden sharp incline. Rolling head-over-heels, the pale wrestler found herself spinning so quickly she couldn\u2019t see what was going on. Her world was a mess of greens, browns, and blues flying past her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was all brought to a sudden stop as Paige slammed into a boulder\u2026.well a pebble, but it was a boulder from her point of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEHEHEHE, AWWWWWW DID WITTLE PAIGE GET A BOO-BOO?</b>\u201d Brie\u2019s voice thundered, the giantess clearly entertained by the Anti-Diva\u2019s plight. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d Paige groaned, grabbing her head as she tried to stop the world from spinning. Basking in the sunlight, Paige noticed immediately when Brie\u2019s shadow blocked out the light. Her little eyes shot open as the alien world slowly began to come into focus. She\u2019d rolled down a steep earth hill from\u2026damn it! It was grass! The fucking jungle was grass! What was even worse was the realization that rising above it was Brie\u2026like some kind of ancient deity. Dressed for the garden, the casually dressed Bella sister only smiled as she lifted a garden trowel and began to point it towards Paige. The British bug didn\u2019t need further encouragement to run. Getting to her feet, Paige began running for her life down the trench that stretched out endlessly before her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/41/a6/97/41a6978919e00da684e8e460d15d25aa.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a>). Her charge was cut off as Brie stabbed the trowel into the earth right before Paige. The tiny woman ran directly into the metal wall, falling on her ass while she grabbed her head in pain. It surprised her that she hadn\u2019t managed to crack it open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YOU CAN\u2019T LEAVE YET SILLY, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME TODAY\u2026OR MAYBE I SHOULD HELP GET YOU TO NIKKI AT THE GYM? WOULD YOU PREFER THAT?</b>\u201d Brie cooed, giggling as she smirked down at the squirming Diva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis was hell\u2026being in a gym with Nikki was worse though. Springing to her feet, Paige looked up into Brie\u2019s playful eyes and swallowed. She couldn\u2019t believe she was actually going to do this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat should I do first?\u201d Paige asked meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM!<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBrie gently flicked Paige, sending the little woman rolling until she slammed, once again, into the metal wall of the garden trowel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>SPEAK UP BUG, IT\u2019S SO HARD TO HEAR YOU DOWN THERE</b>,\u201d Brie joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat should I do first?!\u201d Paige shouted, coughing as she wondered whether or not Brie had just bruised her ribs. If she ever got big again, she\u2019d make the Bellas wish they\u2019d never been born. For now though, Brie dominated her completely. Her giant jailer was more than happy to help stoke those angry fires as she pressed her pointer finger down on the tiny woman. Gasping for air, she watched as Brie yanked the trowel from the ground and let it hover over the tiny woman like a massive guillotine. \u201cHey! No! B-Brie please!\u201d Paige screamed, pissing herself as she saw her life flashing before her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>FINE YOU LITTLE BABY, YOU CAN YANK THOSE WEEDS</b>,\u201d Brie sighed, pointing the trowel towards the massive stalks at the top of one of the near-by hills. Much as she wanted to just bully Paige till the little woman\u2019s spirit broke, Brie really did have to weed these beds if she wanted to plant on time. She figured Paige would exhaust herself with the few weeds she picked out, leaving the tiny Diva right where the Bella sister wanted her. Holding her trowel, Brie began to dig into the earth, turning up the packed dirt so that no roots from the weeds would remain in the beds. Of course, she started her little project not too far from where Paige was struggling. As she lifted her first scoop-full of dirt, the loose soil began to fall onto the tiny woman, threatening to bury her. Oh well! Brie giggled and continued working, why should she care about the plight of bugs anyway?....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHelp!\u201d Paige screamed, trying to unbury herself from the mountain of dirt that seemed to be swallowing her. Looking up, she saw that Brie was totally ignoring her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA mini meteor crashed down just a few yards from Paige; it was a clump of dirt that had slid off of Brie\u2019s trowel. The worst part was that Brie hadn\u2019t even done this on purpose. Paige had really almost been crushed by an honest accident by the giantess. This was insane! Why was she working on weeds bigger than she\u2019d ever be?! Why was she still here?! Turning around, Paige did what she thought she should have done from the start\u2026run away! She headed for the trench, alarmed at how quickly it was filling thanks to brie\u2019s digging. The giantess\u2019s knees had already blocked off one route, climbing up the slope was suicide\u2026she could only try and run away from Brie in the trench and hope she wasn\u2019t caught. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBrie, for her part, hadn\u2019t noticed Paige leaving her job yet. Wiping the start of some sweat from her brow, the giantess wiggled her feet until the Crocs she\u2019d been wearing were knocked off her feet. Smirking, the Bella sister wiggled her toes, happy to have them enjoying the fresh air on this hot day\u2026oh, that could be a good job for Paige after these weeds\u2026were\u2026done\u2026. Brie finally noticed. Frowning, the giantess nudged the piles of dirt with her trowel, wondering if maybe she\u2019d unintentionally buried the little woman while digging. Sifting through the fresh earth, Brie was almost excited when she saw that Paige hadn\u2019t been swallowed by her shoveling. A chase was a way more fun to play with her little bug, Brie thought. Sitting back on her knees, Brie stretched and started to carefully look through the garden, thinking that Paige had decided she\u2019d be safe if she could camouflage herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEHEHE, KEEP RUNNING BUG\u2026WHEN I FIND YOU, WE\u2019RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN</b>,\u201d Brie purred, gently combing through the weeds with her trowel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile Brie searched through the weeds, Paige continued her charge down the trench, hoping to make it to the corner of the bed before Brie started looking in her direction. This was nothing more than a race against time; the longer it took Paige to get out of sight, the greater the chance that the titanic Brie Bella was going to humiliate her with another task. A tiny voice in Paige\u2019s head was telling her not to look over her shoulder\u2026that she\u2019d only regret it if she did. Even so, the pale peon couldn\u2019t stop herself as she stole one glance at Brie\u2026.She should have listened to the little voice in her head. Brie wasn\u2019t looking at her, but the cruel smile painted across the giantess\u2019 lips told her all she needed to know. If she got caught, she was fucked. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Paige could run for now, but there was no way out of this without Brie\u2019s knowledge. A new problem was presenting itself though. Brie\u2019s legs had fallen asleep under her. Giggling, the giantess swung her legs out to her right. Swiveling in the grass, she leaned back and raised her bare feet into the air, wiggling her toes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b3/e3/84/b3e3841929a3dd2866310bad09845a6b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a>). Her legs still felt like pins-and-needles, but at least they\u2019d start to come back to life. Giggling, she lowered her feet, enjoying the sensation as her left heel sunk into the damp earth of the thin ditch that surrounded the planting beds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFuck!\u201d Paige screamed, falling on her ass as Brie\u2019s heel slammed down right in front of her. All at once, the giantess had turned her escape plan into a prison. The world was completely dark; light had been shut out by the arch of Brie\u2019s knee. Trapped in the artificial nightfall, Paige felt her stomach churn as she found herself staring at the muddy wall that was Brie\u2019s heel. For the first time, the tiny Diva actually wished that the gigantic Bella KNEW where she was! At least as a toy she had value in staying relatively unharmed. Like this though\u2026well, Paige knew it didn\u2019t take a genius to see the situation was bad; the only way it could get worse would be if-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBRRRRRRNNNNNN\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe thought hadn\u2019t even finished forming in her head before it manifested right in front of Paige. A slow steam-roller, Brie\u2019s heel seemed to tear up the soft, cool earth between her and Paige as the tiny wrestler turned to flee with all her might. At least, that was her original plan. As Brie\u2019s heel drew closer, it threw up a small wave of broken earth that threatened to swallow Paige whole. The tiny wrestler attempted to outrun it, but with each passing second, Brie\u2019s heel seemed to be growing closer and closer. It pushed into the ground, sending out small fractures and cracks that almost tripped Paige up when they shot out under her feet. For a few inches, it actually seemed like Paige might just be able to outrun the slow march of Brie\u2019s heel\u2026until another one of those tiny fractures shot out from the flesh steam-roller. It happened while Paige was in mid-step: a small gap opened up under her and the anti-Diva\u2019s foot went right into the fissure. She tripped and was sent tumbling, her ankle already swelling from the sprain she\u2019d gotten. Not that it mattered much anyway. Looking over her shoulder, Paige had just enough time to scream before Brie\u2019s heel slammed into her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe pain was excruciating. Paige was wishing that she could pass out and just die in peace as Brie\u2019s heel slowly rolled over her\u2026burying the tiny woman into the soft muddy moat. Paige was, literally, dragged through the mud as Brie\u2019s heel finally came close enough back to her butt that the giantess could push herself up and stand at her full height once more. Unfortunately for Paige\u2026this meant getting the full force of the giantess\u2019 weight crashing down on top of her. The little one opened her mouth to scream in pain, but only ended up with a mouthful of dirt as she sank more into the mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>COME ON PAIGE, YOU\u2019RE ONLY GOING TO GET IN MORE TROUBLE IF YOU MAKE ME LOOK FOR YOU</b>,\u201d Brie chastised, her hands resting on her hips like she was scolding a small child. The giantess was totally oblivious that her prey was already being crushed underfoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBrie decided to give Paige a little longer to run and hide while she found her footwear. She already knew her feet were a mess, but there was only so much mud and dirt she could clean off her toes at once. Looking around, she smiled when she saw where she placed them. Slowly, Brie began to walk through the grass to slip on her Crocs; with every step, more of the dirt that had buried Paige began to come off until the tiny woman was revealed. Stuck face-first to Brie\u2019s heel, Paige was unable to even groan out loud from the pain she had been experiencing. What was worse was her face stuck directly to Brie\u2019s already perspiring skin. The first time Brie\u2019s heel touched down to the damp earth with Paige fully exposed, the tiny thing thought she was about to die. If not for the fact that Brie\u2019s weight settled on her heel for only an instant, Paige would have already become nothing more than a stain on the Bella\u2019s foot without the giantess even noticing. Without a layer of mud to protect her, the little wrestler was exposed to every pebble and blade of grass that wanted to take a strike at her before Brie had a chance to take her away. Even in her worst matches, Paige had never been in this kind of pain. Another step and Paige yowled in pain\u2026a rock had just dug into her back and definitely fractured a rib or two at the very least. Not that Brie noticed or cared, the Bella sister was more occupied with kicking over her well-worn, black crocs to help protect her feet as she walked over to the last area she wanted to garden. The woodchips she lined the paths with were new and had a bad tendency to give her sole splinters; today Brie was hoping to avoid that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Brie lifted the foot Paige was stuck to, the little one finally hit a stroke of good luck! She came loose from the bottom of Brie\u2019s heel and found herself flying through the air\u2026until that is she slammed into the plastic plateau of Brie\u2019s croc. No one said it was a long-lasting bit of good luck. Looking over her shoulder, the British bombshell could only do one thing\u2026scream and run for her life deeper into the piece of Brie\u2019s formidable footwear (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://renegadecinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BAT14_Photo_088.jpg?d4fadb\" target=\"_blank\">http://renegadecinema.com/wp-content/upl...</a>). The black, sloping ceiling only got closer to Paige\u2019s head as the tiny woman barely outpaced the advance of Brie\u2019s titanic toes behind her. A small twitch of the Bella\u2019s big toe tapped the ceiling of the croc\u2026 sending a tremor through it that knocked Paige flat on her face. Flipping onto her back, the tiny woman was just in time to watch the giantess\u2019s filthy toes lazily soar overhead like storm clouds\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \t\u201c<b>THERE WE GO, MUCH BETTER!</b>\u201d Brie mused, wiggling her toes inside her crocs. Thanks, in part to the dirt coating her sole, the giantess had no idea that her croc had just gained a new insole in the form of Paige\u2019s half-crushed body. Unaware that her toy for the day was now getting slowly ground to death underfoot, Brie slid on her other croc and made her way to the other end of the garden to finish weeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGaaaaaa-mmmmph!\u201d Paige almost screamed as Brie\u2019s filthy flesh pressed down on the wrestler\u2019s face. Her right leg had just snapped like a dry twig. Squirming like mad, the little one\u2019s death troughs were what finally got Brie\u2019s attention\u2026though that would prove to be anything but a relief for Paige. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c<b>HMMMM? WHAT THE HELL?...</b>\u201d Brie\u2019s voice thundered as the giantess slid her foot from the croc and slowly began to examine the bottom of her foot. It took less than a second for the Bella to spot what the weird wriggling sensation against her sole was. \u201c<b>HAHAHAHA! HOLY SHIT! PAIGE? WOW, YOU HAVE A THING FOR MY FEET OR SOMETHING?</b>\u201d the giantess taunted as she roughly ripped Paige off the bottom of her dirt-spackled sole. Plopping down on her ass, Brie tucked her legs under herself before dropping Paige off onto the small sloping hill before her. Staring down like a real goddess, Brie brushed a lock of dark-brown hair out of her eyes as they focused in on the tiny girl with a gleeful glow to them (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-Feet-803415.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-...</a>). With a broken leg, Paige could only do her best to crawl away from Brie towards the thick line of weeds further up the hill. At least, that was her plan before Brie\u2019s fingers gripped the long green strands and tore them from the ground like a hurricane ripping up whole trees. \u201c<b>AWWWWWW, THAT\u2019S OK PAIGE, YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO HELP ME WEED\u2026I THINK THERE\u2019S SOMETHING ELSE YOU COULD DO FOR ME THOUGH</b>,\u201d the giantess mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cF-Fuck you princess! Fuck you, your sister, and your fucked up little games!\u201d Paige screamed, flipping onto her back and grabbing her shattered leg. Her soul was crumbling under the pressure of the situation. The little one\u2019s body, mind, and mouth were all running on pure instinct now. Rehearsed thoughts and lines poured from Paige\u2019s mouth as though the tiny thing still were normal size. With each new insult and taunt that came from Paige\u2019s lips, the smile gracing Brie\u2019s only grew wider\u2026. After a few more seconds of ranting, the tiny thing was left panting and defeated on the muddy slope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>FEELING BETTER?</b>\u201d Brie purred, finding Paige\u2019s outburst to be more adorable than anything, coming from a person her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust turn me back! You already had your fun!\u201d Paige cried, tears starting to stream down her face as the anti-Diva blushed in shame. \u201cC-Come on, I won\u2019t even tell anyone what you did\u2026just turn me back! P-Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>AWWWWWW\u2026PAIGE, I CAN\u2019T TURN YOU BACK. I DIDN\u2019T SHRINK YOU</b>,\u201d Brie said, faking sadness although the smirk on her face gave away how much she was loving this.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026nonononono! T-That can\u2019t be\u2026That can\u2019t be right\u2026.Ah-Ahhhhhhhh!\u201d Paige wailed as she broke down into sobs. As the little thing began to cry like a small child, Brie bit her bottom lip and drank in the moment. The power she felt over Paige was incredible. No one would believe the normally proud Diva would be begging Brie for help while sobbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEY\u2026IT\u2019S NOT THAT BAD. I CAN MAKE IT A LITTLE BETTER IF YOU\u2019D LIKE\u2026</b>\u201d Brie almost whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cH-How?\u201d Paige asked, trying hard to stop herself from sobbing and embarrassing herself anymore in front of Brie. She was confused though then the Bella sister began to laugh and slowly stood up. Looming over Paige, Brie bit her bottom lip as her bare sole slowly lifted. Bits of dirt rained down like hail upon Paige as the shocked, shrunken woman slowly began to piece together what her giant captor was intending. She was going to get crushed! Brie was going to fucking crush her! Flipping onto her stomach, Paige screamed at the top of her lungs as she began to drag herself up the slope of soil (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lethalwow.com/wrestlingnews/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/summer-paige.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.lethalwow.com/wrestlingnews/w...</a>). \u201cBrie! Stop it! T-This isn\u2019t funny! Stop it you gigantic cunt! I swear to God, Brie! If you don\u2019t fucking quit it, I\u2019m going to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!.........CRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>MMMMMMMMMMM~ THERE WE GO\u2026PROBLEM SOLVED!</b>\u201d Brie purred as she felt a rush of firey hot tension flood through her system. Her low moan shook the ground while the massive Bella slowly ground her foot back and forth, bringing about a series of wet pops and crunches from under the ball of her foot. The sensation of Paige\u2019s body turning into a fine, gooey paste was intoxicating to the giantess. A high of a whole new level as she lifted her foot to inspect the damage. Seeing the dark-red splotch on the ball of her foot, Brie could only laugh to herself for a few seconds before wiping off the remains of her bug-sized rival in the dirt. <b>\u201cSORRY PAIGE\u2026I COULDN\u2019T HELP MYSELF</b>,\u201d Brie said before returning to her gardening as though nothing had happened\u2026. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tiny girl was left stumbling over her own feet and falling flat on her face as her eyes seared in pain. For the rice-sized woman, the flash of the phone\u2019s camera left her feeling like a fire had been lit in her eye sockets. Grabbing at her face with tears rolling down her cheeks, Abby looked up and slowly began to get her vision back as Nikki was absorbed in her phone\u2019s screen. As the tiny woman finally began to see the reflective Apple symbol staring at her...another bright flash of light stole her sight once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDamn it!\u201d Abby screamed as she fell to her knees, in tears as the pain in her eyes continued to pulse painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother bright flash echoed dimly in Abby\u2019s eyes, like the lights in a room getting just slightly brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HOW DOES IT LOOK?</b>\u201d Brie\u2019s voice boomed as Abby clenched her eyes shut, wishing the pain in her eyes away as hard as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>NOT RIGHT YET\u2026HEY LITTLE ONE, LOOK UP AGAIN</b>,\u201d Nikki demanded as she slid a finger down towards Abby and nudged her, knocking her prone on her back. Still blinded, and totally terrified, Abby began swinging her limbs through the air in a panicked attempt to fight off whatever attacker might pounce upon her at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the little woman fought against invisible enemies, Nikki was getting annoyed as she looked at the images moving around on her phone screen. The camera couldn\u2019t focus with the little thing struggling and moving so much on her shoe. Nikki was hoping that the little thing would finally stop fighting soon and get tired, but it looked like she had energy to spare. Impatient, Nikki finally pressed her pointer finger down sharply on the tiny thing, crushing it down against the tongue of her sneaker as its face turned bright red. As Nikki took her finger off the thing, she returned her focus to her phone and zoomed in as close as she could. Biting her lip, Nikki breathlessly pressed her thumb against the screen to focus the camera on the tiny face of the little thing on her foot. Picture coming into focus, Nikki pressed and waited eagerly as another bright flash of light engulfed the shrunken woman down on her sneaker (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/8e4ad576510a97aa1f9b10e11459868f/tumblr_mpoo2iYbgA1soj4rso1_500.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://25.media.tumblr.com/8e4ad576510a9...</a>). As the image loaded on her screen, Nikki bit her lip in excitement\u2026it was perfect! She quickly switched to Instagram and pulled up the photo, touching it up slightly before going over to the caption\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWHAT SHOULD I WRITE?</b>\u201d Nikki\u2019s voice boomed above Abby as the tiny woman continued to lay motionless on the tongue of the sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>WAIT, YOU\u2019RE GOING TO POST IT?</b>\u201d Brie asked, excitement creeping into her voice as the gigantic woman moved next to her sister; the twin mountain-sized women looking down in glee at the picture of a totally defeated, tiny fan in the middle of Nikki\u2019s tremendous laces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>DOES THIS WORK?</b>\u201d Nikki asked quickly typing out a message on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHAHAHA! THAT\u2019S PERFECT!</b>\u201d Brie responded, wiping a tear from her eye as she smiled beamingly down at the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>AAAAAND POSTED! LOOK, WITTLE ONE, THIS IS A REALLY BIG MOMENT FOR YOU!...HAHAHA! I JUST CAN\u2019T SAY IT SERIOUSLY!</b>\u201d Nikki exclaimed. The pair struggling to quite themselves down as people turned to look at the devious Divas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>WAIT\u2026HAHAHA! SHE\u2019S A PAIGE FAN! LOOK AT THE SHIRT!</b>\u201d Brie squealed as she pointed at the picture on the phone, almost ignoring the tiny woman actually at their mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWOW! LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND PAIGE\u2019S BIGGEST FAN THEN!</b>\u201d Nikki said, bringing both giantesses to tears as they almost collapsed in their chairs laughing. Stifling another fit of laughter, Nikki looked down at her sneakers and the little speck of a person who was still battered and broken on her foot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dailywrestlingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nikki1-620x350.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://dailywrestlingnews.com/wp-content...</a>). All it would have taken was a little more pressure from her finger. She could have just tapped her foot and knocked the tiny thing off\u2026then crushed it under her sneaker. The thoughts alone were tantalizing\u2026but so what? Sure it was easy enough to crush her if she paid attention, but if she just left the little thing alone; if she made it really work to earn her attention\u2026well that seemed more like real power. Abby watched as the look on Nikki\u2019s face changed almost instantly from excited to cold. Of all the lines and assaults today, the stony expression that took over Nikki\u2019s face had scared Abby the most of anything today. Slowly, the giantess began to pull away, sitting up straight and returning to her phone, not even a sideways glance was sent her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>WHOA, EVERYTHING OK?</b>\u201d Brie asked, thrown off by her sister\u2019s sudden personality shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I\u2019M FINE, I JUST THINK SHE\u2019S BORING</b>,\u201d Nikki responded as she went to her phone and began playing around with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby had no idea what to make of the situation, and apparently neither did Brie. As one monstrous sister turned away from her completely, the other became just that much more engrossed with her. Brie leaned in closer, her whole body taking up Abby\u2019s sky as she gazed down at her; Brie\u2019s mind buzzing with a thousand different things to do as the shrunken woman looked up at her, terrified by even the slightest motion of the giantess (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/23/bd/5c/23bd5cd24cb0ec22ba0c182e972ba293.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236...</a>). Slowly, Brie began to reach out for the tiny thing when she suddenly froze and looked back up at Nikki. Her sister was clearly eyeing her when Brie thought she wasn\u2019t being watched\u2026she did want the tiny woman after all. Brie stopped short of grabbing the tiny woman and looked up slowly at Nikki. She wanted to see how long it would take Nikki to break and go for their toy\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>SO, IT\u2019S FINE IF I TAKE HER, RIGHT?</b>\u201d Brie\u2019s voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>\u2026.GO FOR IT. DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH HER</b>,\u201d Nikki replied flatly, to Abby it somehow felt like she had just been forsaken by God as Brie\u2019s fingers wrapped around her. Abby immediately screamed and tried to escape as she found herself lifting off of the sneaker she had worked so hard to climb up. Now it felt like she was totally out of control of her own fate\u2026.and she was correct. A second later, Brie carefully places Abby down right on the edge of Nikki\u2019s sneaker. She giggled as the tiny woman held on tightly to the thick surface of the sneaker like it was a swaying rope bridge over a canyon. Terrified, Abby watched as the second giantess now left her alone, returning above the table and leaving her alone in peril down below. Abby quickly began looking for a way to get off of the razor\u2019s edge she was walking. Slowly pushing herself off, she focused solely on keeping a solid footing on Nikki\u2019s sneaker; all her concentration was poured into each step she took on the finicky fabric\u2026which explains why she didn\u2019t see what happened next coming.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both sisters quickly looked under the table again at the floor right between where their feet had crashed together. No red spot. Nikki instantly stiffened as she felt a tiny presence against her sock-clad foot. With a quite intensity like she had almost never seen before, Brie was treated to the face of her dearest sister trying not to crack and remain composed when she knew how much she wanted to freak out (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1165.photobucket.com/albums/q588/411mania1/Bar%20Rafaeli/Bella%20Twins/nikkibella123013-3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1165.photobucket.com/albums/q588...</a>). The face was priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I\u2019M NOT GETTING HER OUT OF THERE. SHE CAN EITHER CLIMB OUT HERSELF OR GET SQUISHED</b>,\u201d Nikki\u2019s voice thundered down from above. Abby laid in silence, wedged between the thick wall of Nikki\u2019s sneaker and the unyielding mass of her sock-clad foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?</b>\u201d Brie asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAaaaah!\u201d Abby screamed as she felt herself suddenly plummet a few dozen feet before stopping once again. Looking around terrified, Abby could already tell she had fallen in considerably deeper into the sneaker than she had intended. She was about to find which was to climb when the world around her began to move again\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSame story, Abby felt herself fall another dozen feet or so until the little woman was sandwiched between the sneaker\u2019s interior and Nikki\u2019s massive foot. The only saving grace in this situation was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother fall, this time was the last. Abby had slammed into a sloping surface\u2026the toe section of Nikki\u2019s sneaker. Slowly staggering up, the tiny woman began feeling ahead of herself blindly in the darkness until she crashed into the familiar fabric of the sock wall holding back Nikki\u2019s gigantic toes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://giantessbooru.com/post/view/189021?search=socks\" target=\"_blank\">http://giantessbooru.com/post/view/18902...</a>). Frantically, Abby began feeling along the wall of sock, hoping to find some kind of side way around the damn thing. No luck, it seemed she was right in the middle of Nikki\u2019s foot, going around the side would waste so much time; she might get crushed while moving too if Nikki moved the wrong way. That left only one option\u2026climb on top of Nikki\u2019s colossal foot and head for the ankle. As Abby approached the sock wall, the worst case scenario happened, Nikki lifted her toes. The massive wall soon turned into a cotton wave as Nikki\u2019s mighty toes quickly pressed down into the ground after lifting her foot only slightly. Scrambling back towards the wall of the toe section, Abby huddled against it\u2026the only safe place in the entire shoe it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>DID YOU SQUISH HER ALREADY?</b>\u201d Brie\u2019s voice boomed from the other side of the sneaker, clearly upset that her sister might have spoiled her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I DON\u2019T KNOW, WHY? WANT TO CHECK?</b>\u201d Nikki now teased back, shaking your world slowly side to side as she taunted her sister back. <br>\r\nAbby couldn\u2019t see exactly what was going on before her, but she knew something terrible was about to happen as the ground under her own feet began to slope dangerously. As Nikki was gingerly lifting her sneaker-clad foot for her sister to see, Abby could feel herself slowly slipping as the slope grew more extreme with every passing moment. Screaming, Abby lost her footing completely as Nikki wagged her foot in the air. The tiny woman quickly began to slide down the slick slope of Nikki\u2019s sneaker sole as the giantess continued to taunt and tease her sister with every wiggle of her foot. Terrified in the totally darkness, Abby began clawing in every direction, hoping to catch onto anything. In a stroke of luck, Abby\u2019s hand grasped hold of the bottom of Nikki\u2019s sock and was left dangling in mid-air as the giantesses continued to talk outside, unaware of the struggle going on inside of Nikki\u2019s sneaker. In the darkness, Abby was left breathing raggedly. Scared and alone, the tiny woman began climbing up the wall of sock as quickly as her body would let her; fear froze her joints every few feet as she worried about how much time was left till Nikki put her foot down once again\u2026. Pausing the breathe as her chest was burning, Abby felt a mix of multiple types of exhaustion begin to drain on her. The sheer pain from tumbling was numbing, but not so much as the humidity that was slowly cooking her. It felt like a sticky summer day inside the massive sneaker as Nikki\u2019s foot heated up the interior of the shoe to unbearable levels. Combined with the musty smell of sweat both fresh from the foot above and caked into the sole below, Abby felt constantly nauseas as she tried to keep pulling herself further up the sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, STOP! WHAT IF YOU ALREADY BROKE HER?!</b>\u201d Brie said as she bent down again towards her sister\u2019s massive sneaker-clad foot. Her voice cut right through into the cotton-filled cavern Abby was dangling dangerously in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>JESUS, OK. CALM DOWN, CRAZY</b>,\u201d Nikki sighed as she reached down and gently pulled her sneaker off of her tremendous foot, letting the colossal sneaker fall to the floor of the caf\u00e9 while her sock-clad foot was left dangling in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAaaaah!\u201d Abby screamed as she suddenly found herself dangling, not in the darkness, but what seemed like over a hundred feet in the air! Looking around frantically, the tiny woman could see the dirty, sloping ceiling of cotton above her\u2026and the giantess below. Brie\u2019s tremendous body was writhing below her, tilting over a sneaker bigger than a house in her massive hands for reasons that Abby\u2019s fear-addled mind was not capable of discerning. The air-conditioned winds in the caf\u00e9 were chilling Abby\u2019s sweat-soaked body as she looked down as the thick forest of hair moving below. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking down, the tiny woman cringed and stifled a scream as Brie shuffled unknowingly below her. Grateful as she was to be out of the confines of Nikki\u2019s sneaker, she had no interest in falling back into the hands of the giantess sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small wiggle of Nikki\u2019s foot threatened to undo Abby as she felt like she was going to be thrown clear across the room if she relaxed even a bit. High above, Nikki could only smirk down as she watched her sister so intent on checking through her sneaker for a little bug-sized woman who was probably crushed by her foot already (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/36/e8/f5/36e8f5112032b61c12af43228abad28e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/3...</a>). Nikki smiled as she saw her sister still looking so worried under her foot, it made her want to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>DAMN IT, IF YOU CRUSHED HER I WILL-</b>\u201d Brie was cut off mid-threat as she turned to look up at Nikki only to have her sister\u2019s damp sock planted directly on her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>OOPS, THOUGHT YOU WERE ANOTHER BUG, MY BAD</b>.\u201d Nikki joked as she pressed her sock-clad foot down on Brie\u2019s face, unaware that she also now had Abby sandwiched between the two of them for a split-second. For that seemingly eternal second, Abby thought she was going to literally be crushed like a bug as she found herself being pressed directly against Brie\u2019s forehead. With the colossal weight of Nikki\u2019s foot bearing down on her, Abby felt her body sink into the soft surface of Brie\u2019s skin as the wet fibers of Nikki\u2019s sock threatened to smother her. Abby\u2019s face was quickly covered with the damp fibers of the super-sized sock as the acrid smell of sweat burned her nose. The shrunken girl could feel the ball of Nikki\u2019s foot pressing down onto her harder and harder\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>EEEEW! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?</b>\u201d Brie said as she pushed her sister\u2019s foot away and stood up, her hair a mess in front of her face, matted down by Nikki\u2019s surprise attack. It was in the thick forest of black hair that Abby now found herself struggling to hang on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbby screamed as she now found herself flying through the air in the dense forest of Brie\u2019s hair as the other Bella pulled herself up from under the table. Dropping Nikki\u2019s sneaker back on the floor, Brie put her hands through her hair and flipped her thick mane out of her face as she tried to maneuver herself into her seat once again (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/ec/d3/00/ecd30032f6338965e3a6a2da4dcf5590.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236...</a>). The millions of strands of hair began flying and flowing around Abby like a powerful river sweeping her downstream. From the darkness inside Nikki\u2019s sneaker, Abby now found herself swimming in delicate twilight as the light of the caf\u00e9 streamed through the seemingly infinite strands of hair that were wrapping around her. She\u2019d survived being almost crushed underfoot countless times already, but the thick forest of hair that swallowed her now seemed to be alive! Abby grabbed hold of one strand, only to be yanked loose with a simple shake or shift of Brie\u2019s head. Lost in the wilderness of hair, Abby desperately tried to figure out where she was as she finally found some solid ground\u2026by crashing into Brie\u2019s scalp. The impact seemed to come out of nowhere as Abby had the wind knocked clear out of her as she found herself now laying down in the part of Brie\u2019s hair. A single, rope-thick strand of hair remained clutched in Abby\u2019s hand as she stared up, dizzy, at the lights. The rest was interrupted as, once again, another ominous shadow engulfed Abby\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFOOOM\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a moment of silence before a low rumbling filled Abby\u2019s ears. The ground lightly shook as the noise grew louder and louder. It sounded like something big was charging through dense woods, like a stampede\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWHOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbby was left breathless as she rolled out of the way just in time. It was like a flash as Brie\u2019s fingernail cut just through the thick forest of hair within inches of the shrunken girl. Almost relaxing, Abby was suddenly knocked over as the finger came back, thankfully smacking into her with only the pad of the pointer finger. As she got up, Abby saw she only had a second to jump out of the way as the finger came towards her again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWHIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbby held her breath as the nail this time zipped by so closely that she could feel the wind on it. Falling forwards as the gust of air passed, Abby struggled now to catch her breath before the nail was back at her again.

Once again, the roar of Brie\u2019s finger crashing through the forest of hair rumbled in Abby\u2019s ears as she began doing the only thing she could think to do\u2026flee! Running with all her might through the thick undergrowth of hair, Abby still had no idea where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WHAT ARE YOU STILL MAD FOR?</b>\u201d Nikki\u2019s voice boomed somewhere close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YOU JUST BROKE HER BEFORE WE EVEN GOT THE CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING! YOU ALWAYS GET CARRIED AWAY WITH THIS STUFF!</b>\u201d Brie\u2019s voice thundered, making Abby cower and cover her ears as she realized she had to be coming somewhere close to the front of Brie\u2019s head. Before she could start to feel triumphant though, Brie\u2019s finger finally caught up with her. Its approach was masked by the thundering voice of the giantess, so Abby couldn\u2019t even brace herself as the flat nail of Brie\u2019s fingernail struck her right in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbby was soon soaring through the thick strands of hair once again. Stunned from the hit, the tiny woman felt like she\u2019d been electrocuted as her entire body seemed to go numb. It was with all her might that she managed to close her hand around a single hair in the last few feet of forest that covered her (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/art/Macro-Hair-172781117\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.deviantart.com/art/Macro-Hair...</a>).

Looking down as the wind whipped past your face, you saw the first obstacle in your path fast approaching\u2026the thick forest of Brie\u2019s eyebrow was right in your path. Gripping as tightly to the hair as you could, you began spinning as your body slammed into the side of the warm wall of flesh (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thumbnails110.imagebam.com/38107/4aef83381060127.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://thumbnails110.imagebam.com/38107/...</a>). Groaning, you were stuck as you slammed, gut first, into Brie\u2019s eyebrow as she raised them in the middle of conversation with her sister. The thick group of hairs held you for a second as you tried to get a better grip on Brie\u2019s hair.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c<b>YEAH, LIKE I SAID, WE HAVE TO GET OUR SHIT TOGETHER IF WE WANT TO GET THE BETTER SPOT FOR THE NEXT FIGHTS</b>,\u201d Brie\u2019s voice thundered underneath you as you saw the shadow of her hand reaching up\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, no, no, no, no!\u201d you screamed as Brie\u2019s finger nabbed at her hair and began pulling it back behind her ear. Once again you were airborne as you were suddenly swinging back towards her tremendous ear. You tried not to scream as you found yourself headed right for Brie\u2019s massive ear! Clamping your mouth shut as tight as you could, only a tiny squeak managed to get through your lips as you slammed into the diamonds of Brie\u2019s massive earrings. Looking up into the cavernous hole of Brie\u2019s eardrum, you were terrified that the loud beating of your heart would be picked up by the giantess and lead you once again to her clutches. Your fears were set aside as Nikki\u2019s voice rang out once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WAIT, WERE THOSE THE GLASSES YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>YEAH, LOOK.

Looking up, you could see your own reflection staring back at you in the shiny plastic surface. Your hair was disheveled, your clothes a mess. It looked like you\u2019d been swimming in the ocean your clothes had been matted down with so much salty liquid from being underfoot a number of times today. Several holes were already worn through your clothing as you saw flashes of your skin, bra, and underwear as you slowly spun on the strand of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>SO, LIKE I WAS SAYING</b>\u201d Brie boomed again as she yanked the glasses off, sending you flying once again as your strand of hair was now headed\u2026right for her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou were motionless as you held on for dear life to the strand of hair with one hand as you found yourself in the middle of her lips (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://data2.whicdn.com/images/131723217/superthumb.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://data2.whicdn.com/images/131723217...</a>). Whimpering, you wondered why you were going to do to get out of here as you started to wrap the strand of hair around your wrist. You heard the hum of air circulating in Brie\u2019s mouth as you feared the scarlet, serpentine tongue you knew was lurking somewhere behind you. Trying to hold back the tears, you started trying to pull yourself from out between Brie\u2019s plush lips as the warm walls softly pressed down on you. Slowly, you crawled forwards, careful not to draw too much attention to yourself. It turned out though that your sneaking was useless as Brie pulled on the hair herself. Getting yanked out roughly from Brie\u2019s massive mouth, you jerked in the air and let go of the strand of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh no, no, n-\u201d you began to yell when suddenly all the air was seemingly ripped from your lungs.

SERIOUSLY, I HARDLY GOT TO PLAY WITH THE THING!</b>\u201d Brie said exasperatedly as she looked up angrily. The giantess froze as she finally caught sight of you clinging onto the bottom of Nikki\u2019s sock-clad foot. A chilling smile broke out on her lips as your eyes met\u2026. Abby nearly fell as the world shook once again, Nikki was getting impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>COME ON, PUT MY SNEAKER BACK ON ALREADY.

Suddenly, Abby found herself caught inside of Brie\u2019s palm as the massive fingers closed around her like a tan cage. Abby ran for a fleshy wall and began to beat her fists against the walls as they slowly began to close in on her more. The tiny woman felt like she was suffocating as she felt a gentle grasp on her from all sides\u2026then she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGasp!\u201d Abby came to the surface coughing as she felt like her body was being electrocuted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>THANK YOU!</b>\u201d Brie\u2019s voice echoed deafeningly as a flurry of shadows passed over Abby\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCLUNK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking up, Abby felt her heart sink\u2026she recognized her surroundings instantly; she was inside a cup of iced-coffee. Suddenly, a very real sense of dread began to fill Abby\u2019s chest as she saw something begin to press against the cup. The pads of Brie\u2019s tremendous fingers pressed against the plastic walls like a child pressing their faces against glass windows to see an animal at the zoo. Waves lapped up against iceberg sized cubes as the giantess slowly pulled the cup off the counter and began walking back towards the table. Freezing, Abby began swimming desperately for an ice-cube, trying desperately to not be swallowed by the sea of waves now storming all around her. Shivering as she swam for land that floated away from her, the shrunken woman watched the world flow past her with each large swaying space of land Brie\u2019s massive feet covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWah!\u201d Abby screamed as a wave carried her finally onto an ice-cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlamming into the solid, frozen mass, the tiny woman grunted as the impact nearly knocked her out again. Aching and freezing to her core, the tiny woman tried to get up on the moving mass under her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH</b>,\u201d Nikki\u2019s voice echoed inside the cup as Abby turned around the see the giant woman looking down at the cup.

Brie sighed as she pulled the cup back towards her, reading her sister\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HERE, STRAW</b>\u201d she said as she ripped the covering off and dropped it on the table. Looking up through the plastic roof, Abby saw as Brie winked quickly. Suddenly, the sky went black as the giantess pressed the bottom of the straw against the plastic barrier\u2026.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPOOOOSH!....THUNK!...........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeeeeelp! Help me! Oh god, someone! Please help!\u201d Abby yelled as she was swallowed up by the straw. Suddenly, surrounded on all sides by a solid black wall, Abby began treading in the cold coffee as she looked around fruitlessly for some way to escape. Looking straight up, the tiny woman saw only a few twinkling streams of light shimmer down. The empty tube howled with air as the tiny girl waited, terrified for what she knew was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HERE PRINCESS</b>,\u201d Brie\u2019s voice echoed still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBRNNNN\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe loud grating sound of ice-cubes pushing past the straw echoed inside the tube as the light suddenly disappeared\u2026presumably inside Nikki\u2019s mouth\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWOOOOOOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe air was sucked clear out of Abby\u2019s lungs as Nikki sucked deeply on the straw. Like a bullet, the tiny woman found herself zipping up the tube, struggling not to fall below the rising flood of coffee with very little luck. Falling below the surface, Abby bounced off the sides of the straw violently as she was pulled towards the cavernous space above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuddenly Abby fell as Nikki stopped sucking just short of capturing the tiny woman in her mouth. Splashing down again in the bottom of the straw, Abby swam to the surface and burst through, gasping for air. Soaked, cold, and scared, the tired woman looked up the length of the straw once more, wondering when she\u2019d have to go through that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t have to wait long as Nikki sucked harder, her mouth eagerly awaiting the rush of cold liquid headed for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbby fell back into the liquid once again as she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWHOOOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWHOOOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWHOOOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSPLOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbby burst to the surface once again in her secluded pool in the bottom of the straw. Dizzy from the series of small sips Nikki had subjected her to, the tiny woman felt like throwing up as she struggled to keep treading in the cold iced coffee. Banging on the wall, Abby let out a scream, hoping to be heard\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bursting out of the tube like it was a fountain, the tiny woman screamed as she found herself now in a flowing river while surrounded by total darkness. Screaming, the tiny woman tried swimming against the stream, her arms flailing and feet kicking against the rough surface of the tongue under her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby was slammed against a solid wall suddenly as the ground under her pulsed. Groaning, Abby reflexively grabbed onto the smooth surface as the liquid river rushing against her suddenly began to pool around her. Whimpering, the tiny woman dug her hands in between the massive walls as tightly as she could; waiting for what would come next\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, Abby almost got pulled in as the entire pool disappeared down the monstrous hole she knew awaited her somewhere behind her\u2026. Letting go of the wall, Abby\u2019s feet slapped against the wet ground. Alone and scared in Nikki\u2019s mouth, the tiny woman began wandering towards the center of the black cavern, unaware that her presence was quickly getting noticed. Abby felt the ground under her suddenly lift as her feet planted fast on the soft surface. Terrified, the tiny woman screamed even louder as she was suddenly pressed up against the roof of her mouth. The cold liquid drained around her as Abby felt a tremendous amount of suction on her body, like she was placed into a vacuum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>BRIE! EEEEEEEW!</b>\u201d Nikki\u2019s voice boomed all around Abby as a second later the dark cavern was flooded with light. Before the little woman could react, she was roughly grasped between two massive walls and pulled back into the familiar hum of the caf\u00e9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>OOOOOH, THAT\u2019S WHERE I PUT HER!</b>\u201d Brie said as she laughed at her very unamused sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>I ALMOST ATE A BUG!

The extreme amount of dirt and grime caked into the bottom of the sneaker was awe-inspiring to the tiny woman who could have easily fit in the treads of the sneaker. Slowly, she approached and reached out an arm, sinking it slowly into a glob of mud that had ended up between the treads. Pulling, Abby expected it to just come free\u2026instead, she lost her balance and fell forwards; the tiny woman was suddenly stuck in the treads\u2026. Her heart hammering in her chest, Abby began trying to pull herself free quickly, only to find the grime clinging onto her tightly. The more she pulled, the more she seemed to be pulled in towards the treads! It was like vertical quicksand as Abby found herself getting stuck deeper and deeper in the mud and crud encrusted in Nikki\u2019s treads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHelp!\u201d Abby yelled as the giantesses continued snacking above, unaware of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>OH SHIT!

Giggling, she reached down and began to pluck her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>AWWWW, POOR THING</b>,\u201d Brie cooed as she pet the tiny woman with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>MAYBE SHE\u2019LL BE BETTER ON YOUR FEET</b>,\u201d Nikki said as she set down the tiny woman right before Brie\u2019s tremendous sandal-clad feet (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-Feet-337567.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-...</a>). Abby stared at the tremendous toes, terrified. She refused to move forwards, her feet rooted to the floor almost as the two giantesses stared at her, expectantly. Looking up at the super-sized sisters, Abby began shouted and begging for them to have let her go. She screamed that they had their fun and now she needed help. Her voice was going hoarse quickly, and not one word reached the ears of the giant duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>WHAT\u2019S SHE DOING DOWN THERE?</b>\u201d Brie asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>BEGGING?</b>\u201d Nikki posed, stifling a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>AWWWWWW!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>IT\u2019S NOT CUTE!

The two sisters paused and looked at each other for a brief moment before bursting out laughing. Wiping tears from their eyes, both sisters leaned down and flashed an \u201cL\u201d on their foreheads like they had done to so many opponents they had bested (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/g5gClHt.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/g5gClHt.png</a>). Abby was just the latest in a new line of people these two had broken down, but she was definitely the most fun they\u2019d had so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HAHA, GET TO WORK BUG, OTHERWISE WE MIGHT NOT STAY SO NICE TO YOU</b>,\u201d Nikki threatened as she pointed to Brie\u2019s massive toes which wiggled in response. The sandal shook slightly as the giant toes pressed against the sole, their pads turning white as blood was forced from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>MAKE SURE TO GET BETWEEN THE TOES</b>,\u201d Brie said as she tilted her sandal up, making the tiny woman slide down towards her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbby fell against Brie\u2019s toes as they settled down around her. Looking behind her, the tiny woman found herself right where she didn\u2019t want to be\u2026between Brie\u2019s big and second toe on her tremendous sandal. Staring slowly higher, Abby found her gaze travelling up the slope between Brie\u2019s massive toes, to her gigantic leg, to her smiling face looking down at her. Abby was the star of a private show, and Brie could not wait for it to begin. Eager to not piss off her new boss, Abby took a few shaky steps forwards and began to rub the massive wall of flesh before her. The ground shifted as Brie wiggled her toes. Playfully they squeezed together on her; a sign to keep going Abby took it. Throwing more weight into it, the tiny woman sunk her elbow into the wall of flesh. No reaction. Looking up, Abby could see that Brie seemed almost bored with her already! Abby was scared now; she needed something big\u2026something new. Without hesitation, Abby sunk her face in between the walls of flesh and started licking like a dog. She wasn\u2019t ready for the reaction\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<b>HEHEHEHEHEHE!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cBrie\u2026can you get me some water or something? I don\u2019t feel that great\u201d Nikki said, starting to turn green around the edges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie paused for a moment, confused about what the hell could have happened to Nikki; maybe it was because she squished the girl? Either way, Brie wasted no time. Slipping her sandals back on, she put a hand on Nikki\u2019s shoulder and gave a brief squeeze before heading to the counter to get some cold water for her. Brie stood patiently at the counter of the caf\u00e9, trying to get someone\u2019s attention without causing a scene. She was quickly growing frustrated, seeing the teenage workers hanging out just beyond the back door. The trio of bargain-bin baristas were deep in conversation; if she left them alone Brie could find herself standing at the counter for a few minutes without them even looking up. Glancing back at her table, she saw Nikki hunch over\u2026.she didn\u2019t have time for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping behind the counter, Brie grabbed a plastic cup and tried finding the sink so she could fill it. While shuffling through the tons of taps and multitude of containers, the slackers finally came back from their chatting break to find the WWE Diva tearing through their work-space. Brie heard the timid complaints of the teenagers and sighed; looking back to her table she saw Nikki had vanished; probably using the bathroom or something. Facing the teenagers, Brie slowly began explaining herself to the dim group of gawking girls that were left in charge of the caf\u00e9 for God only knew what reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki on the other hand, was having a far less peaceful experience. As Brie left to grab her something to drink, Nikki began to feel like someone was getting a real kick out of lighting her body on fire. The whole world around her started spinning so fast she had to clamp her eyes shut to keep from throwing up. Hunched over, Nikki tried taking slow deep breathes to calm her swirling head, but it was having little effect. A quick, sharp pain jolted through Nikki\u2019s body; the electric tendrils radiated pins and needles from the tip of her forehead all the way down to the tips of her toes. Gasping for air, Nikki struggled to push herself up and out of her chair, feeling the world start to tilt around her again. Stumbling blindly over her own feet, Nikki found herself falling, striking the cold tile floor hard. Gasping in pain, the ill wrestler tried to push herself up only to fall flat on her face. All around her, the din of the caf\u00e9 seemed to be growing louder as Nikki wondered why on Earth no one was coming to help her. Panting on the floor and covered in a cold sweat, Nikki forced her eyes open\u2026and immediately regretted the decision. At first she thought that she must still be really dizzy, that her eyes were playing tricks on her. Rubbing them vigorously, Nikki opened them a second time; she found that the landscape before her hadn\u2019t changed in the slightest. \u201cOh God\u201d she whispered\u2026the cozy caf\u00e9 was gone. The world around her now appeared like it was viewed through a magnifying glass as Nikki realized her sudden bought of sickness wasn\u2019t without reason. The WWE Diva had shrunken down to the size of the little woman her sister had crushed between her toes not even five minutes ago\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBOOM!...BOOM!....BOOOM!....BOOOOOOM!......BOOOOOOOOOOM!.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was knocked to her butt as the ground under her began shaking with each step of Brie\u2019s massive sandal-clad feet. With every step Brie took closer to the table, Nikki felt herself getting exponentially more terrified. Brie\u2019s feet which, only a few minutes ago had been the size of her own, now looked like massive tan hillsides to Nikki. Backing away from the edge of the table slowly, Nikki thought she\u2019d been spirited away into some kind of monster movie. It felt like a continuous earthquake, Brie\u2019s footsteps giving Nikki not even a second to regain her balance before the next shockwave threatened to topple her. When Brie\u2019s massive foot crashed down just a few steps from the table, the ground shook hard enough to knock Nikki to the ground. Shrieking, Nikki began crawling along the grimy tile floor; only a few inches separated her from the solid metal bars of the table\u2019s base, her only hope for shelter. The tiny woman dragged herself the last few inches, her body disappearing under a metal archway just as Brie\u2019s feet finally came to a halt before the table. Watching her massive sister lower herself back into her chair, Nikki began running through a hundred different ways she could try to get Brie\u2019s attention before either the giantess left\u2026or till Nikki got crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching out, Brie reclined in her chair. Placing the cold cup of water on the table, Brie figured she could just relax until Nikki came back; then she\u2019d drive them home (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-Feet-1643278.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-...</a>). Taking out her phone, Brie set herself up to wait out Nikki\u2019s sickness episode. While going through her e-mails, Brie slowly began slipping her feet from her sandals; she wiggled her toes happily as the straps that had been squeezing her feet finally let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit\u2026\u201d Nikki groaned, looking up at the slightly lifted soles of her sister\u2019s massive foot. The tan skin sloped gently, the light trickling down from the ceiling of the caf\u00e9 reached Nikki as dim beams of twilight filtered between Brie\u2019s titanic toes. Nikki risked moving forwards a few steps to stand in one of the very few golden shafts of light coming down under the table. She looked up, her eyes burning, and tried to make out Brie\u2019s face above her. Nikki felt sick once again at the sight of the world above her; Brie\u2019s toes alone seemed to be several tens (if not over a hundred) feet above her, each toe already big enough to make a city bus feel inadequate. That didn\u2019t even speak to the incomprehensible sight of Brie\u2019s shin rising higher into the air than a good number of buildings Nikki had seen in her life. Her sister\u2019s knee blocked out the sight of Brie\u2019s face, but Nikki knew\u2026she knew if she could see beyond it, her sister would be blissfully unaware of her plight. In fact, if Brie looked down right now, Nikki knew she\u2019d see nothing more than her bare foot and the floor (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-Feet-1103355.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Brianna-Garcia-...</a>). The mental image alone was enough to send Nikki\u2019s stomach back into a clump of painful, tangled knots. What she saw next didn\u2019t help her mounting anxiety. At first Nikki didn\u2019t know what she was staring at between Brie\u2019s tremendous toes; walking closer, Nikki squinted just as a droplet of something hit her right between the eyes. Flinching, Nikki wiped her brow and looked at her hand to discover that it was red. Suddenly Nikki remembered all about how Brie crushed the tiny woman from before\u2026and now her remains were the mysterious smudge between Brie\u2019s tremendous toes. As if Brie\u2019s tremendous feet alone were not enough, Nikki had more trouble coming her way in the form of.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c<b>BRIE? IS THAT YOU?</b>\u201d A familiar voice thundered, making Nikki flinch. The beam of light was blocked out as Brie\u2019s massive toes suddenly curled, heading back for their home. For the tiny girl down on the floor, she found it hard to think of anything that could have been worse than the scene unfolding before her. As Brie\u2019s massive foot moved aside, searching blindly for her sandals, Nikki saw massive three pairs of feet heading towards the table. Once again, the tremors started to make the ground dance. Unfortunately for Nikki, three pairs of feet meant the tremors were three times as strong as when it was just Brie\u2019s feet coming towards her. The massive sole of her sister\u2019s foot struck her while swinging a long arch under the table, going for one of the sandals. Even though Brie didn\u2019t feel a thing, tiny Nikki was sent rolling across the tile floor of the caf\u00e9. Exposed now, Nikki groaned, trying to get up when the tremors finally stopped. Turning her aching head to the side, the shrunken Diva felt her stomach drop out like a bottomless pit had opened up somewhere in her gut. Now it wasn\u2019t Brie\u2019s massive bare foot that towered over her\u2026.it was the colossal teal sneaker of one of the newest members of the WWE Divas family, Becky Lynch (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.wwe.com/f/styles/photo_large_lightbox/public/photo/image/2015/05/004_BECKY_05122015ca_108-2160211003.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wwe.com/f/styles/photo_large_...</a> ). A titan now, the red-haired radical of the WWE Divas cast Nikki in her tremendous shadow. It looked like Becky had been on her way to the gym from the look of her outfit. The massive sneakers rose up to Lynch\u2019s grey sweats; her implausibly long legs gave way to her tanned, taut stomach that now flexed overhead as Becky leaned over, her hands planted on the tabletop. Somewhere behind her, Nikki heard Brie\u2019s feet (now sandal-clad once more) plant defensively on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>EVA, SASHA\u2026BECKY. DON\u2019T YOU GUYS GET ENOUGH TIME WITH ME WHEN YOU\u2019RE BUSY LOSING?</b>\u201d Nikki couldn\u2019t help but smile at her sister\u2019s quick assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the provocation didn\u2019t drive the three new giantesses away; instead it had much the opposite effect. Eva slowly drew closer to the table, flanking Becky; her left flip-flop clad foot stood before Nikki like a small office building had fallen out of the sky (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Natalie-Evamarie-Feet-1483256.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Natalie-Evamari...</a>). The colossal tan toes of Eva Marie were even bigger than Brie\u2019s, Nikki nervously observed. Slowly backing away from the giantess, Nikki\u2019s brain was on fire as it tried sorting through hundreds of different plans to escape as quickly as it could. She felt overwhelmed by the mere sight of Eva\u2019s massive feet before her. Every small twitch or flex of the massive toes before her was not lost on Nikki; a slight motion to Eva was a monumental movement to the tiny woman at her feet. While the 5\u20198\u201d redhead smirked at Brie, she was unknowingly putting Nikki\u2019s life in danger with a mere flick of her ankle\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeeeelp! Someone fucking help me!!!!\u201d Nikki screamed, pinned to the ground under Eva\u2019s now discarded flip-flop. It felt like a load of mattresses had been dropped on her back, the weight crushing, but the material just forgiving enough to keep her from getting crushed right off the bat. Instead, she was held to the ground, her body pressed flat like she was posing for a chalk outline at a crime scene. The bottom of Eva\u2019s flip-flop was covered in small, sharp pieces of gravel and a fine coating of dust and grime from the caf\u00e9\u2019s poorly maintained floors; now Nikki found herself slowly getting covered in the stuff as she tried climbing out from under Eva\u2019s footwear. Nikki was already in tears after just a few moments of being trapped. She clawed forwards towards the toe of the flip-flop, gasping and cringing as sharp pieces of gravel dug into her shoulder and back; her clothes ripped with each snag she tried pulling past. Dead ahead of her, Nikki could see Brie\u2019s massive toes scrunching in her sandal, the tan skin turning white as the digits were pressed into the leather floor. The shadow of Eva\u2019s flip-flop only extended a little further out, just a few inches separated her from freedom\u2026which is probably why Eva chose that moment to start sliding her foot back in. Eva looked down and stretched her free toes one last time before guiding them back to her black flip-flops (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pics.wikifeet.com/Natalie-Evamarie-Feet-1601957.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pics.wikifeet.com/Natalie-Evamari...</a>). As Eva\u2019s toes began to press down while working their way back into their proper place, the massive flip-flop was dragged back, causing poor Nikki to almost get torn to shreds as the saw-teeth of little pebbles and grains of dirt cut against her while being pulled back. Even with every fight, adventure, accident, and injury she had gone through in her life, nothing had prepared Nikki for the agony of getting worn down by the sand-paper-like sole of the massive flip-flop. Battered, bruised, and covered from head to toe in tiny scrapes, tiny Nikki was once again out in the open under the table; trying to get up was a hassle, and only the surge of adrenaline coursing through Nikki\u2019s veins after almost getting squished was keeping her going at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>SO, WHERE\u2019D NIKKI RUN OFF TO?</b>\u201d Eva\u2019s voice echoed from above, the foot that nearly crushed Nikki now planted itself down right next to the shrunken woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>SHE WASN\u2019T FEELING WELL, I GUESS SHE KNEW YOU GUYS WERE COMING</b>\u201d Brie shot back, slowly crossing her legs. The bottom of her foot dangled above Nikki, giving the tiny woman pause as she again saw the tiny remains of the little woman from before still stuck between Brie\u2019s toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>IS THAT THE EXCUSE YOU TWO ARE GOING TO USE WHEN YOU LOSE TOMORROW NIGHT?</b>\u201d Becky jeered. \u201c<b>NIKKI HAD A TUMMY ACHE AND COULDN\u2019T FIGHT WELL?</b>\u201d the Irish woman said, her voice dripping in contempt as she spoke in a mocking baby-talk. If not for the current size difference, Nikki would have told her to step off, but telling her to step anywhere seemed like it was tempting fate at this time. As if to confirm your suspicion, Becky started to lean forwards on the ball of her right foot, grinding it back and forth on the tile floor like she was putting out a cigarette\u2026or crushing a bug-sized wrestler. The spectacle turned Nikki's stomach; she wanted to flee, but didn't know where to go that wouldn't get her in trouble. Unfortunately, Eva made the choice for her with a flick of her flip-flop. It was like getting slammed into by a foam semi-truck as Nikki found herself flying towards....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You rolled over as you struggled to awaken. Your mind was blank, your surroundings black, and the outlook bleak. However, steadily and surely, your memory came back in bits and pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a night watchman, one who had the pleasure of patrolling the hallways of a women's gym where the WWE Divas frequently practiced. The Divas usually weren't around when you began your patrol, but occasionally you came across one of the bombshells training late or heard them in the showers just before closing time. That's not to say you ever tried to perv on the ladies when they were in the locker rooms, partially from absolute knowledge that anyone of them could probably easily floor you without breaking a sweat, even despite your athleticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you recall last night things went over a little differently than usual. It was close to midnight, long after most of the Divas would stay for their workout. You thought you heard a noise in one of the locker rooms, and were worried someone had broken in. At any other hour you would have knocked before entering, but at this hour you thought nothing of it and entered the door with your flashlight out. You were confused to find that the lights in the room were on, yet it was empty sage for a single gym bag on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regarded the duffel bag with suspicion and approached it as you had been trained to approach any suspicious looking bags. Kneeling down beside it, you carefully pulled back the zipper. Your caution left you as you caught the first glimpse of workout clothes along with the distinct acrid odor of sweat wafting up. Pulling the zipper all the way back you stared into the bag, confused, nothing suspicious about the bag. Just a woman's used gym clothes inside, plus an outfit that you could easily recognize as belonging to a Diva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat there pondering who the bag belonged to and why it was out late at night, you heard a shower start up. Your face turned red with embarrassment as you realized one of the Divas was back in the showers and you were creeping around staring at her discarded clothes. You immediately get up and turn to leave, hoping to avoid any awkward asskickings that might arise from such a situation. However as you turn to face the wall it begins to shift and distort before you. And as your vision fades, your thoughts follow suit, quickly tailed by your ability to remain standing. You recall falling backwards, darkness overtaking you as your consciousness unexpectedly faded before you even hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that brought you to the present as you woke up in the darkness, blinking rapidly as you try to adjust to the limited lighting. As your visual sense get warmed up, your other senses have already begun taking in information. Your skin has already started sweating from the incredible temperature. Below you, touch and prose at the ground feeling it's leathery features, yet as your hand drags around you feel wet fabric and thick canvas at various angles. Finally your sense of smell, which you would much rather lack at this point, has been forcefully crammed with a foul and strong odor which seemed to extend out from the floors and walls, it was the scent of hard work, distinctively feminine, but oppressively smelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally your eyes adjusted and you were able to see the vast peaks, valleys, and plains that occupied this space. The landforms had distinct shapes that could easily be confused with common objects. A few rather rounded mountains had the distinct shape of sports bras, while a distant ridge had a similar shape to a tennis shoe. In fact the more you observed the surroundings the more they looked like clothing. A pair of panties here, some shirts there, a long boot here, a set of shorts there. This confusing landscape began to make sense as the dark sky able you opened up as if being unzipped, letting the light of the sun slip in. In fact there actually was the distinct grind of a zipper, magnified a hundred times over, but still similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up to the \"sky\" you became aware of the features of someone's face, a woman's to be specific. And quite an attractive one at that. The only problem was that she was absolutely gigantic, you were barely the size of one of her nostrils. Furthermore as your eyes adjusted to the light, certain features made the woman more recognizable,  her long black locks and piercing gaze were all you needed to see. The titaness above was none other than WWE Diva, Paige. And looking across the hills and valleys around you, quickly revealed the Divas's distinct outfit along with a handful of workout clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis realization was cut short as the bag was lifted off the ground, shaking you around and sending you flying inside Paige's _____.</span></div></div>",

Deciding to wait for your Uber to pick you up, you lean towards a bush and wretch, as your head spins out of control. When you regain consciousness, you open your eyes and see that something is very off about your surroundings. You're still in front of the frat house but... the street is an expansive ocean of asphalt, and you don't get to look around the sidewalk for long because titanic beings are headed your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy shit!</i> Still on campus but you're a couple of inches tall. You survive being crushed by some fellow inebriated students, narrowly missing a high heel impaling you onto the sidewalk. It smells awful where you're standing, the traffic of all the people passing through and the mess you left behind in the bushes are a powerful odor to your small nose. You run up the sidewalk, watching the deadly incomprehensible sized cars roaring by with massive clouds of toxic fumes. It seems like all hopeless is lost when again, a giant is stomping down the sidewalk, stumbling around. You can barely see anything which reminds you of the other sorority girls leaving the party, but this giantess's face is completely obscured by her massive chest. One of the cars immediately screeches by the street, not too far from where you are watching everything. Then, a miracle for you, you hear the giantess loudly curse and the car door opens for her. She has dropped her purse on the sidewalk, and is scrambling to collect the lipstick tube, wallet, and other contents of her humongous being. It is a long shot but it beats staying on the sidewalk, maybe you can get closer to her or climb into her purse and play it by ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"JUST A SECOND, SORRY...\"</b> Her voice booms to the driver, who you can guess doesn't mind at all that a drunk busty chick is taking her sweet time. The giantess's body appears closer as you approach the mess of her spilled purse. One of her colossal, muscular bare legs is bent, her massive behind exposed as she crawls slightly on her knees to scoop up the fallen objects. </span></div></div>",
