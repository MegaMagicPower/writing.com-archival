She pulled a pillow over her head to mute the sound but it tore in two, stuffing scattered throughout the room, slowly raining down to join the clutter on the floor. The shredded pillow only added to her ire as the alarm continued. She rolled over and smacked the clock like she had a million times before but this time the clock exploded from the force of her blow, bits of hard plastic shot in all directions like shrapnel. <br>\r\nShe shot upright and raked her long blonde hair out of her face. What the hell was going on?<br>\r\nShe shook the sleep from her head. The destruction of the clock and the pillow slowly began to register. Before she formed any concrete thoughts her bedroom door flew open.<br>\r\n\"Get up you lazy cow, your going to be late for school!\"<br>\r\nShe shrieked as she pulled her sheet around here. He elder brother under the pretense of making sure she was awake was trying to sneak a peek at her again. The sheet tore apart in her hands like wet tissue giving John an unobstructed view of his naked younger sister. <br>\r\nShe was anything but a cow. She was not very tall standing only 5 foot 3 in her bare feet, she was trim but well proportioned. Her golden blonde hair reached passed her neck resting on her shoulder blades in back, or brushing the tops of her boobs on the front. Her bra size was only 34 B but on her small body they looked much larger. She had shapely hips and a well rounded butt, she filled out her clothes in a way that made most males want to peer under them for a better look.<br>\r\nHolding the halves of the sheet she sat in shock. <br>\r\n\"Whoa, you better get this cleaned up before mom gets home. She will freak if she sees the way you've torn up your room.\" John took one more long look as Cindy covered herself with her hands. Slowly he left her room and went downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\nBreaking everything she touched left her too stunned to be angry at John. It was her fault really, he was just taking advantage of it. She hated wearing clothes to bed. Her parents caught her sleeping in the nude a couple years ago and hit the roof. They demanded that she sleep in something, a long tee-shirt at least. To avoid fighting with them she usually did as they asked but now and then she gave in to her dark desire to feel nothing but skin between her and the sheets. <br>\r\nShe considered it freaky that her parents would sometimes sneak into her room to check on what she had worn to bed. It was bad when it was mom, but so much worse when dad spied on her, especially on the nights she opted to wear nothing.<br>\r\nAlone again she slipped out of bed taking her shirt off the back of the chair where she'd left it. She stretched it out to pull it on but it ripped as she held it. What the hell? Had all her clothes rotted overnight? She knew she needed to buy some new things but this was ridiculous. Maybe John was pranking her. She often wondered if he came into her room during the night for a peak too. She was a very sound sleeper. Maybe he weakened the threads of her clothes somehow? <br>\r\nShe carefully selected different clothes and was relieved that they didn't fall apart at her tough. Whatever had been happening seemed to be over. It was too late now to take a shower. Her first class at South High was PE anyway, she  would have to shower afterward anyway. She filled her bag with clean clothes and ran to the bus stop to met her friend Julie. <br>\r\nShe debated if she should tell her about her morning or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It life didn\u2019t amuse her Julie would do something to amuse herself. She felt sorry for whoever was her chosen victim today.<br>\r\n\u201cHi Slut, are you trying to miss the bus?\u201d<br>\r\nCindy called back to her BFF, \u201cWhatever Skank. I\u2019m not in a hurry to get to prison, I\u2019m surprised you are?\u201d<br>\r\nAfter exchanging acidic greetings the two friends hugged. Julie let out a muffled moan of pain. \u201cNo so rough, I\u2019m not into pain-play.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know you were so fragile.\u201d<br>\r\nJulie stepped away, a little confused and a little annoyed. She decided to change the subject. \u201cNot funny. So did you get finished with Mrs. Idlebrooks paper yet? It\u2019s due today.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be done by class, what about you. Last I heard you hadn\u2019t started. You are so toast!\u201d<br>\r\nJulie was a dark haired beauty with olive skin. At 5 foot 6 is towered over her shorter friend. Cindy\u2019s parents disapproved of their friendship but grew tired of fighting it. They hoped it would run its course and die a natural death. As long as people tried to pry them apart their bond just got stronger. Julie was from a good family, very affluent in fact, but she had the reputation of being a bad girl. She smoked, drank, and had been picked up by the police for shop lifting. The only reason rode the bus was she destroyed her car driving while intoxicated. Only her father\u2019s influence had made the charge go away but he refused to buy her another car until she could show some maturity. <br>\r\n\u201cMy paper is done. I had it finished last night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? How?\u201d<br>\r\nThe brunette smiled. \u201cYou know Randy Gunn?\u201d<br>\r\nHow him? She practically worshiped him from afar. Randy was her brother\u2019s best friend and was a god on Earth. He and John had graduated last year. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe did my assignment for me. He reedited the one he turned in last year and gave it to me. It will be an easy \u2018A\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\nCindy tried to hide it but that made her mad. She had worked on this stupid English paper for weeks. It was a quarter of their grade, now Julie was beating the system again. She could have killed her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would he do that for you? Did you pay him? This is so unfair!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t cheap. Don\u2019t get so upset. See if you can get a car tonight and I\u2019ll take you out. My treat.\u201d<br>\r\nJulie\u2019s family was better than well off but they gave her only a small allowance. It was enough for her to have ample spending money but not enough to get into too much trouble. \u201cHow do you have money? I thought you said the paper was expensive?\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiled again. \u201cIt was. I let him take a naked picture of me. He was so satisfied he even threw in 20 bucks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJulie, I can\u2019t believe you did that. You're only 16 who knows that he will do with that picture? C\u2019mon that\u2019s crazy.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI'm nearly 17, besides don\u2019t sweat it. My face wasn\u2019t in the shot, it wasn\u2019t what he wanted to see anyway. Your only mad because he\u2019s seen me naked and not you. Why don\u2019t you tell him you like him? Better yet, let me take a bare-ass pic of you and give it to him. That\u2019s a great way to break the ice.\u201d<br>\r\nCindy was silent for a moment. \u201cNo. I have more respect for myself than that. Thanks for the offer. Besides he's John's best friend. I've known him forever. It would be weird.\u201d<br>\r\nShe was surprised that she's almost considered it. Her friend was more liberated than herself, it was one of the things she liked about her. Cindy could live vicariously through the antics of her friend without risking pregnancy, STDs, humiliation, or jail time. She had promised her parents that she would not follow in Julie's footsteps. <br>\r\n\"What's weird about it? If John ever wanted to have the Julie experience that would be the bomb. Would you object?\"<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment. She didn't want to tell her friend that she would want a better girl friend for her brother. So instead a polite lie had to do. \"No, not at all. You go ahead and strip let me get my phone. I'll send the pic to him to him right away.\"<br>\r\nBefore Julie had a chance to call her bluff the bus rolled around the corner and stopped in front of them.<br>\r\nCindy followed her on but when she grabbed the hand rail it bent like putty in her hand, then it snapped free from the bus\u2019 interior. <br>\r\nShe exchanged worried looks with the driver. His eyes had bugged out of his head staring at her holding part of his bus. She smiled sheepishly as she handed the twisted chrome item to him. \u201cSorry.\u201d Then took her seat.<br>\r\nThe driver spent a moment trying to bend it back into shape. He was a big man and at full exertion it would not budge. He gave the 5 foot 3 inch blonde a concerned look before continuing his route. <br>\r\nThey had been his last pickup before heading to school.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The students grabbed their gear and exited the bus.<br>\r\nThe girls exchanged in small talk as they headed towards the building when an oversized hand grabbed Julie\u2019s backpack from the rear.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, give that back!\u201d<br>\r\nThe thief was Lance Armstrong, up and coming jock and future sex offender. He was with his two greatest fans, David Harris and Doug Parkenson. The three of them were the scourge of the senior class.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can have it back at Duncan\u2019s Reef tonight. There\u2019s a party and you have the honor to be my date.\u201d<br>\r\nJulie made several grabs for the bag but Lance whipped it away at the last second. <br>\r\n\u201cI need that!\u201d In fact she did, her prized pirated English paper was in there and she needed to hand it in.<br>\r\nThe three goons laughed, tossing it back and forth between them. <br>\r\n\u201cYou can have it back tonight. Take it easy or you\u2019ll have to be Dave and Doug\u2019s date too!\u201d<br>\r\nDavid smirked. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard it wouldn\u2019t be the first three-way she\u2019s had.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou moron,\u201d Doug called to his friend, \u201cthere\u2019s three of us and her.

Give her the bag, the bell\u2019s going to ring.\u201d<br>\r\nLance tossed Julie\u2019s bag to one of his waiting goons and lunged to grab Cindy\u2019s.<br>\r\nThings seemed to move in slow motion. Cindy saw him dive towards her and reflexively she reached out and grabbed him by his shirt. With a casual toss she sent him sailing into a stand of bushes nearly fifteen feet away. Then she sprinted and caught Julie\u2019s bag in mid-air before it reached Doug. <br>\r\nThe small crowd that had gathered to watch Julie\u2019s torment now stood silent. No one could believe what they had just seen, including Cindy herself.<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your bag.\u201d She handed it to Julie who numbly took it from her, it was only then that Cindy noticed that the stress of what she had just done shredded her pants from the knees down and her shoes had disintegrated. She stepped out of the ruined footwear and rushed to first period PE with a stunned Julie following behind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing about him, though, that irritated his father to no end, was the fact that Jay was a little lazy sometimes. This meant that Jay was always... Slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring P.E. class at school, Jay almost always came in dead last when the kids had to run laps around the soccer field. It wasn't that Jay couldn't run faster, but that Jay was just too lazy to put in the extra effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his dad needed Jay to get groceries out of the car, or to get the mail out of the mailbox, Jay always too a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Jay wasn't fat or overweight or anything. He was just slow and laid back. This would drive his father nuts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay's dad, Harry, worked for a science lab. Harry had developed a secret serum that would speed up a person's legs and arm movements to amazing speeds, increasing rapidly over time. Harry had enough of Jay lagging behind all the time and he had decided that he was going to make his son the fastest kid on the planet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jay! Come here for a sec...\" Harry said, as he called Jay to come into his lab in the basement of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy got up and slowly stammered his way down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a move on, son! Stop being so slow and so lazy!\" Harry groaned. He was so tired of Jay being so slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down on the chair.\" Harry instructed his son, as he grabbed a syringe and filled it up with the serum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! What are you doing, dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna give you an injection, son! Your days of being slow are over!\" Harry grinned, as he injected the serum into Jay's right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he pulled the needle out, Harry stuck and bandage on the boy's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Now, get up and go get the mail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay got up and started walking to the staircase. But, he started walking faster and faster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to teh staircase so fast, it seemed like he was running!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Jay grinned. \"I'm moving a lot faster than before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he raced up the stairs and through the living room before he was out the door. Then he came back inside... With the mail, in under 10 seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! That's much better!\" Harry grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm like... fast! Really FAST!\" Jay said out of amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your super speed, son!\" Harry smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay just grinned, turned around, and raced to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every passing moment, it seemed like he was doing things faster and faster, including studying, writing out his homework, doing dishes, reading and typing on the computer! He had his homework done in under 5 minutes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh man... I like THIS!\" Jay grinned, as he wondered what to do next....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were other couches, some filled with people, some not. There was a small TV in the corner of the room, but some hoodlum thought it would be humourous to smash it. To his right was a window showing the bottom of the seats. From there Alex would be able to see when his friends are back. To his left was a doorway leading to the entrance of the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only went because the 4 of them agreed to take turns where they all went each winter. About 3 years ago. After Winter. Next year, he'll be able to choose. He sighed. This was the last day before they all went back, and everyone else was spending the most they could out in the snow before they would have to leave. Hopefully earlier. He wiped his forehead with his hand, then rested it with his other hand. He then asked the woman next to him \"Hey, is it just me, or is it hot in here?\" She made a wierd look right at him, which quickly changed into one of shock. \"I think it's both,\" she told him. \"Huh?\" She pointed to Alex's hands.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachael Blake has often lived a free life, being rebellious and enjoying her young adulthood. At times, she has often messed with other people by stealing from them or by messing with their heads. She is a mischievous one, always starting trouble when she feels the need to. Be it by making one person fight another, tricking people into giving her free stuff, and getting away with trouble through sheer luck or antics. Rachael's a trickster and she loves it. It fits her trickster personality of being the wild, tricky, and   creative type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the lifestyle Rachael chose after gaining the abilities to teleport herself wherever she wished. Back when she was 16, she was a nerd who wanted the attention of everyone at her school. At times, Rachael never got a chance to come to parties or trips because she was socially awkward, leading to her staying home because her friends, schoolmates, and sometimes her family didn't want her to be around. She was alone, feeling as though all this was her fault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to make up for this, Rachael thought that maybe she could be better than that, perhaps she could become someone after doing something no one else has done. So she took to experimenting. When Rachael had free time, she would formulate plans that she wrote during science and engineering class about time and space in her notebook, deciding to see if she could maybe study something new about the world around her. Maybe that would get her recognition and become one of the popular girls at school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time, while spending time in the garage, Rachael managed to build a gadget that looked like a watch. It was based on some online tech specs and her own knowledge, hoping to draw out a significant change in time. It was weird but worth trying out. She didn't have no knowledge on how to properly use it. Being a strange contraption, Rachael wanted to make sure that no one would see her work on it. So then Rachael stayed in the garage to test it at. Each night, she continued to test it out, hoping to get results from her hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, something went awry during her third try in the garage at night. Strange energy started flowing from the watch, enveloping Rachael in electricity before causing a black out and knocking her out. Many people in the vicinity was in the dark that time. After a while, power came back and Rachael stayed asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Rachael woke up, tired after falling unconscious. When she looked at the time, she realized that she was almost late for school. Shocked by this, she thought about getting her clothes and heading to school. Hopefully the teacher doesn't mark her up as late. She needs to get to school on time. Trying to think about getting her bag and clothes, she turns around and faces the door. One moment, she is in the garage, and the next she was in the living room holding her clothing and bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was strange to her, feeling as though she discovered something new. Fortunately, nobody was around to see her do this. Wondering what just went on, Rachael tries again, hoping to get some food. Just like that, she appears in the kitchen, giving a shocked expression from it. She was by the fridge, wondering why she didn't get an apple and a soda immediately. Opening the fridge, she takes a can of soda and an orange. Closing the door, she heads over to the table. Maybe she should test out her powers  more right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a moment to realize that she was going to be late if she messes around. Realizing this, Rachael stands up and concentrates hard on getting to school. For a moment, she is teleported to the school bathroom, wondering how she got there. <i>This was all too weird!</i> Ever since that day, she decided that she would use her powers more and make the most of it. Heading out of the bathroom, she goes to class, smirking at her new-found potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she has these powers and has gotten a bit older, Rachael thought about possibly doing more with them. So far, she has expanded her goals and how she would use them. She doesn't want to fit in to everyone's standards. Instead, she wants to do whatever she wants. At night, she would be a vigilante, causing her own mischief. By day, she would use it less often, hoping to prevent others from finding out about her powers. This would be fun for her, being a rebel who finally has something no one else does. With her abilities of teleportation, Rachael spent her years being creative and perfecting them the best she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will she do?</span></div></div>",

He picked up the carbon butter knife pieces and through them in the bin. He ate  his toast dry thinking that his brothers had put more traps in there.<br>\r\nThe ride to school was uneventful as usual but when he got to school he started thinking about that mornings events when suddenly he was awoken from his daydreaming when he heard a familiar voice \"Hello John\" Charlie said as he sat next to you.<br>\r\n\"Salutations Charlie\" John greeted back.

Any mercy you once had is gone.  I guess that is what happens when you become the most powerful human on the planet.  However, these guards did not realize that you were that powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too dangerous to be around people.  You will be sent to solitary confinement for 4 weeks,\" The head guard said.  His terror seems to have dissipated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think I'll be going to solitary.  I don't want to.\"  You slowly turn around and walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rocco, go get him.\"  You hear the head guard say.  You turn around and see a large man about 50 yards away.  You still show no sign of fright.  But now you are having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands in the air, or I'll shoot!\"  Rocco yells.  You just stand there, not putting your hands up.  All you say is, \"No, I don't feel like it.\"  This guy is being brave, but not smart.  If he was smart, he would turn around and run away screaming.  \"I MEAN IT!!!\"  He screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you calmly respond.  Now you are having fun.  Then, a loud bang.  People from all over your cell block come to watch, from a safe distance away.  Now, for what Rocco lacks in brains, he makes up for in aim.  The bullet hits you right between the eyes.  A normal person would die immediately, but you are the most powerful person alive.  You are unfazed by the bullet.  Since that run in with the gun toting telekine in London, you developed a resistance to pain.  That bullet merely tickled your face.  By the time the bullet hit the floor, you were face to face with Rocco.  \"Now I'm angry,\" you lie.  You're having fun messing with him.  Rocco now is paralyzed from fear.  As you ponder how to kill him, you feel another tingle.  Another bullet.  You make a small ball of your trademark light-blue fire, and send it at the guard that shot you.  It goes right through him, creating a hole in his chest.  Now the other guards are terrified.  They try to run, but you make a force field, trapping them in there with you.  You decide the most fun way to kill Rocco.  You step back, and rearrange every atom in his body.  You turn him into two balls of pure unstable hydrogen.  \"Goodbye,\" you sneer at the two other guards.  Then you laugh as you fuse the two balls together, creating a 150 megaton explosion confined inside of your force field.  Then, as you absorb all of the leftover matter, you dispel the force field, emerging from it unscathed.  Even though that blast created a fireball that was 10,000,000 Kelvin, you're fine.  You love being invincible and immortal.  \"Does anyone else want to fight me?\"  You yell.  There was silence in the room. \"That's what I thought.\"  You laugh evilly as you phase through the wall of the maximum security prison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fly away, you notice a military helicopter following you.  Seeing how you'd rather be alone, you create another blue fireball, and destroy the helicopter.  Now the military knows your power, so you hope to have a quiet journey back home to your lair in the City of Power.  You just served 40 minutes of a 40 year sentence at prison.  You laugh maniacally as you fly home.  However, something interrupts your flight.  What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option 1:  Someone else with the Deity Force.

First, I have a full list of powers that I've acquired over my years of being The Fierce Deity.\"  He takes out a piece of paper, and starts reading.  \"This will take a minute.\"  Just from that, you get excited.  \"Super strength, supersonic flying/running, laser/heat vision, freeze vision, metalkinesis, pyrokinesis, biomancy, manipulation of matter, creation/destruction of matter, creation of new elements, invulnerability to physical attacks such as gunshots stabbing and punches, immortality, necromancy, and telepathy.  However, I would suggest not making an army of the dead, or using necromancy at all.  Most of the time, you just get skeletons that crumble immediately due to their lack of muscle.  Plus, it is scary.  Anyway, did you get all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Out of those, I've been able to...\"  You list all of the powers you've mastered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you have a decent amount of learning left.  Anyway, lets start by finding your limits.\"  Leo then makes a bazooka, points it at you, and fires.  You shrug the explosion off like it was nothing.  \"Okay, durability, high.\"  You then realize that you haven't had your super suit on in a while.  You conjure up your costume made of your own personal indestructible metal, and put it on.  The suit is black with light blue streaks, the same color as your demon fire.  \"Oh, I forgot about my suit.\"  Leo puts his on too.  It is black, but with red streaks, the same color as the fireball that he made.  \"I love this suit.  I made it so that it would be indestructible, and it would augment my power further.\"  You can see pure power emanating off of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I not think to do that?\"  You ask yourself.  You modify your suit to augment your power 100 fold whenever you have it on.  After that, a blue aura of power surrounds your body.  \"Let's start this training montage!\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first, considering that you are a super villain, you should look a bit more intimidating.  I'd say that you should make yourself appear stronger than a normal 14 year old boy.\"  You agree with him, and you use your biomancy to buff yourself up a little.  You see your pecs emerge from your chest, an 8 pack form under them.  After a minute, you looked like a junior bodybuilder.  \"Can I learn some powers now?\"  You ask impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, I'm calculating your limits, that way I don't strain you.  Even the Deity Force has limits.  How fast can you fly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mach 100, but now, because of my suit, I guess Mach 10,000.\"  You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's start.  What do you want to learn first?\"  He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telepathy.  That seems like it would be quick.\"  You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what am I thinking right now.\"  <i>Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\"  You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now how about super strength.  I've never checked to see if I had that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here, try to lift this.\"  Leo then creates a large weight.  \"It weighs 10,000 tons.\"  You walk over to it, put your hands under it, and pick it up.  It was like a feather.  \"Okay, I was not expecting that to be an issue.  I found that one almost immediately.  Let's try something a bit more complicated, laser vision.\"  He holds a piece of paper in front of him and looks at it.  \"Watch closely.\"  He narrows his eyes.  As they close, you see a red glow form in his pupils.  Then, a red laser shoots out of his eyes, igniting the paper.  \"Now, the secret to a good precise laser is focus.  Focus on what you want to shoot.  The more you focus, the more likely you are to hit the target.\"  You look at a target about 50 yards away.  You narrow your eyes, and shoot a beam of blue at the target.  It is a perfect bullseye.  \"Well, I've never seen a blue laser before.  I guess you really like the color blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it has always been my favorite.  Anyway, I've had a question for a while.  Whenever I make fire, it is blue.  People call it demon fire.  What do you call your red fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell fire, anyway, freeze vision is the same as laser vision, you just focus on freezing the object rather than setting it ablaze.  You can also change how powerful the laser is.  The more powerful, the more taxing it is on your energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  Anyway, is there anything else I need to learn?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only 2 more things.  Creation and destruction of matter.  This is the most difficult.  You have absorbed quite a lot of matter since you discovered your power.  You've had to use that or other matter around to create things.  With this power, you will be able to create something out of nothing.  Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\"  You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lets begin.  I can see if you use existing matter to create stuff, so this will be the ultimate test.  First, try to create a ball of pure carbon, without using any of the matter in this room.\"  You focus on carbon.  Since you can manipulate matter, you've memorized every characteristic of every element, compound, ion and isotope.  You focus on making a ball.  Slowly, you see matter appearing before your eyes.  Matter that was not there before.  You shape that matter into a ball, and manipulate each atom to be carbon-12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\"  You exclaim happily.  \"Now I need to destroy this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear goes nothing.\"  You look at the little ball you made, and focus on making it go away.  After a minute, you see the matter fade out of existence.  \"Yes, I did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, to complete your training, I would like you to stay in here and strengthen your powers for a couple of hours.  Then, we will see if you are ready to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do.\"  You make a chair in the middle of the room, creating all the matter in it, and sit.  First, you practice your super strength.  You create a block of iron weighing 1,000,000 tons.  You lift it no problem.   Then, you add more iron to it, making it 1,000,000,000 tons.  Finally, you've found your limit, as you struggle to lift the block.  Then, you focus on flight.  You set up a radar gun to pick up how fast you fly.  Your goal is to be able to fly .1c, or 10% the speed of light.  Seeing how your radar gun picks up your speed in m/s, calculating your speed in \"Machs\" should be easy.  You raise up off of the ground, and start flying around in circles.  After flying for 30 minutes, you feel your acceleration decreasing.  Once you feel your acceleration stop, you start to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you stop, you look at the gun.  It says that you reached 35,000,000 m/s.  You calculate that to be approximately 12% of the speed of light, or mach 102,941.  You are happy.  Then, you focus on your vision.  You stare at the target from nearly one kilometer away.  You fire a blue beam.  Then, you rush over to the target.  Another bullseye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue this kind of training more more than 3 hours, before Leo walks in.  \"Okay, lets see your progress.\"  You show him your new powered up powers.  He is impressed.  It took him years to master half of the powers you mastered in one day.  \"You're ready to go.\"  You and him leave the sky palace, and head to your City of Power.  With your new speed increase, you and him get there in 4 seconds, despite it being almost 3,000 km away.  You enter your lair, and see Julian where you placed him 2 days before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess 40 years means nothing when you can get out that easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you respond laughing.  You then tell him what happened since you last saw your brother, introducing him to Leo.  \"Leo is going to be our personal advisor and bodyguard.  He also is in touch with the Deity Force, so he trained me to use my powers even better.\"  You turn to Leo.  \"Leo, my brother is the most powerful pyrokine I know.  Could you train him to make him even better?\"  You ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"  He responds.  Somehow, your nearly perfect life gets better.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Julian, follow Leo.  He's going to make you even stronger,\" you say to your brother, motioning him to follow the 16 year old.  Once Julian leaves, you broadcast yourself on all of the TVs in the city, saying that you have made your triumphant return from prison.  Immediately after you say this, you hear muffled cheering from the whole population of your super city.  You also let the public know about the war, and how your military was winning.  Another cheer was heard.  You feel that pretty soon the war will be won.  You shut off the broadcast, and wait for Leo and Julian to finish.  You have business, and you need them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your brother and bodyguard emerge from one of the many power practice rooms in your lair.  \"Bro, guess what!\"  Julian shouts at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  You inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo is a very good trainer.  So good in fact, that he helped me discover a new power!  Follow me.\"  He said.  You follow him to the practice room they used before.  The large empty room was littered with targets, weights, random objects, and any other thing a super could use to practice.  \"While I was making one of my fireballs, which are now green, I..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Green?\"  You cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  Julian says.  He makes a bright green fireball, and lobs it at one of the targets, setting it ablaze.  \"I call it Wildfire.  Anyway, It seems this pyrokine can fly, and has super strength.\"  You are dumbfounded, but proud.  Julian flies over to one of the many large weights scattered around the room.  It reads, 100,000 tons.  Julian lands next to it, puts one hand under it, and lifts it over his head.  \"Catch!\"  He yelled.  Pretty soon, you were playing catch with the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, that was fun, but I have important business to tend to.  I'm taking Leo with me to Brussels to negotiate a surrender.\"  You say, putting down the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we be surrendering?\"  Julian asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not us, them.\"  You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.  I assume that you'll put me in charge until you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  You are my second in command after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.  Anyway, see you when I see you!\"  It was Julian's trademark farewell.  You leave the practice room, with Julian left in it practicing his new found flying capabilities.  You tell Leo of your plan, and you set off for Brussels with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how you can fly at more than 10% of the speed of light, the journey did not take long.  You might as well have teleported.  You enter the UN building, telling the receptionist that you would like to meet with the same people you met with a few days prior.  She obliged, seeing how you were in your suit, radiating power.  She did not want to cross you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shown up to the same large room filled with tables.  At every table, there was a representative of a country.  The U.K, the U.S, Israel, Canada, Japan, etc.  They were all there.  \"So, the Fallen God comes before us again.\"  One of them says.  You recognize this man as the representative for the United States.  He's also the person who sentenced you to prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again.  I'm here to negotiate your surrender.  My troops have won every battle they've fought in this war.  We are stronger and smarter than you.  If you surrender now, we will stop fighting.  All that we want is to make peace, and coexist with you peacefully.  And about London...  Personally, my destroying of London was to make sure my troops were safe.  I mean, it's like the end of WWII, just much more destructive.\"  The American was furious about that remark.  \"Anyway, I promise that no more cities will be wiped off the face of the Earth if you surrender.  Unless of course, they start making anti-super laws, like London.  Then it will go poof.  We stop fighting, we coexist, and we supers will not be persecuted.  No more anti-super laws.  Capisce?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give us a moment.\"  One of the reps said.  You exit the room and wait to hear about their decision.  If they were smart, they would surrender.  However, these were the guys who sent you to prison.  And that plan worked perfectly.  You laugh as you realize that nobody is stopping you from setting the room ablaze if they say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 30 minutes, someone exited the room, and told you to enter.  \"We have made up our minds.\"  Said the American.  \"If you promise that there will be no more bloodshed, and that you will exit here with only peaceful intentions, we will surrender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember my terms, outlaw anti-super laws, and the bloodshed will stop.\"  You remind the reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, we need to have some to protect the general public.\"  A Chinese rep remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we seem to have reached an impasse.  I refuse to stop unless you refuse the laws, and you say that you need the laws.  I guess the war will continue.\"  You smugly retort.  \"Good day ladies and gentlemen.\"  And with that you start to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\"  You hear.  You turn around, and see that they are not done with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\"  You sneer.  You have an army to command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that you've escaped from our most secure prison within hours of arriving.  This proves that we cannot stop you from doing anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know that.  Besides, it was minutes, not hours.  However, in those minutes, I did kill 7 more people.  It was self-defense though.\"  Your taunting the UN now.  Even though you are the leader of the supers, you're still a 15 year old kid, inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignoring that, we still want to surrender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad.  You refused to meet with my demands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're willing to make a deal.\"  Now you're interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this deal?\"  You ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The laws we want to make are not prejudice laws.  No discrimination, no segregation.  They're just laws like, 'No using powers to take advantage of those who don't have them.' and 'No using powers to get away with crimes.'  People with and without powers will go to the same schools, live in the same city if they choose to, get the same jobs, or even get jobs that their powers will help them with.  We will make sure that lawmakers will not make laws that limit the rights of supers.\"  That is a good deal...  But how will you continue being your evil self?  You ponder this thought until an you have an epiphany.  Now that you think about it, why should there be normal, non supers?  You decide that this will be your next goal, but you will save it for a good time.  Now, you want to make amends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After thinking about it, I have made my decision.  I will agree to that deal.  We stop fighting, you stop persecuting.  Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\"  The whole room, besides you and Leo, responds in unison.  You sign the forms agreeing to the terms, and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive back in your lair, where Julian is sitting.  \"How did the meeting go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I wanted.  The UN surrendered, and all of the super-prejudice laws will be revoked and outlawed.  We will coexist peacefully, until I say so.\"  You start to laugh evilly.  Then, you walk over to Julian.  \"Do you really want to live a normal life again, knowing full well that the peace can only last so long?\"  Julian looks puzzled.  \"Personally, I feel that, if this new way of life doesn't work, and more super-prejudice laws appear, we wipe out any non supers.\"  Julian starts to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we start?\"  He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the best time is in a year or two.  We see how life is going, and if it is returning to the state it was in when we ran away, then we put the plan in motion.  Otherwise, start being normal super villains.  Threatening landmarks, crowded places, etc.  Then, lawmakers will reinforce the anti-super laws, and boom!  Start the plan.\"  After debriefing Julian, you hug it out.  Then, you broadcast your success at the UN, and tell all of the citizens of your city that the rest of the world is safe for supers.  For now.  Then, you tell them of your plan.  The response was overwhelmingly positive.  They were fed up with the prejudice.  This will be perfect revenge.  You finish your broadcast, and stay in your lair.  You, Julian, Leo, and everyone else who wants to stay in the city will spend from now until when the plan starts honing your powers and strengthening.  The UN won't know what hit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Brussels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little suspicious about that kid.  He seems a bit twisted.  I think our hidden loophole in the papers will do the trick...\"</span></div></div>",

I am not a psychopath, and I have no idea where these ideas came from.  I'm a bit disturbed myself.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord, you may want to see this.\"  Leo says to you.  You walk up to a monitor set up in your lair, and notice some troubling news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The UN has made a statement denouncing the Nation of Super Humans, otherwise known as N.O.S.H, for breaking the rules of war, and will not be upholding the terms of their surrender.  Starting tomorrow, all people registered as 'Super' will be relocated to areas currently unknown.  Sarah Storm, City of Power News, Channel 4.\"  Sarah Storm, the news anchor for the city's news channel stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Sarah,\"  Pierre Clemont, a french super said.  He's the other anchor.  \"In other news, scientists here in the city have been able to breed fire proof cats.  For all you pyrokines scared of owning animals, now's your chance!  Located in the shopping district, Xavier's Pet Shop is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the monitor ablaze in a marvelous shade of blue.  \"It's been one week.  ONE WEEK!  THEY ARE GOING TO PAY!!\"  You scream.  \"Leo, find all the supers you can and bring them back to the City.  This is the only safe haven for them.  Especially after what I'm about to do.\"  With that eerie remark, you disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll fix the monitor first.\"  Leo muttered.  He makes a new monitor, and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Leo is retrieving supers, you head back to Brussels.  As you approach the UN office, you notice that it's completely abandoned.  They moved, and without a trace of where.  This gets you even more angry.  \"Okay UN, you want to play hard to explode?  Fine.  However, I will find you, and I will destroy you.\"  You laugh maniacally.  You're officially a psychopath, but you don't care.  As your laughter subsides, blue fire dances on your fingertips.  \"You know what Brussels, you're OK for now.  I think I'll go somewhere else.\"  You fly off, fire still erupting from your fingers.  Eventually, you settle on something to annihilate.  You change flying directions to straight up.  Soon, you're in space.  \"I don't feel like killing right now.  Just exploding.\"  You say as you head off.  While you want to destroy something important to the non-supers, you also don't want to damage any astronomical tools or findings.  You've always enjoyed astronomy.  Soon, you settle on a random asteroid.  \"Hello Mr. Asteroid, I'm The Fallen God, and you're history.  Since you're in space, there's no oxygen to fuel your fire.  Rather than create some, you take the more direct approach.  As the asteroid comes hurdling towards you, you set up for a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne minute ago, a 600km wide asteroid existed.  Now, all that's left is dust.  You obliterated the asteroid with a single punch.  <i>I guess when I'm angry, I get more powerful.  That or my powers are even stronger than before.  Anyway, that was fun.</i>  You think to yourself.  As you float in the newly empty space an asteroid used to call home, you realize something.  If the UN moved out of Brussels, they probably are at one of their other offices.  With that thought, you immediately head off to New York City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, you reach a large street in the middle of Manhattan.  On each sidewalk, a line of flagpoles with flags of many different countries is visible.  \"I think I've found what I was looking for.\"  You laugh as you walk into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the United Nations.  How may I be of service?\"  The receptionist said as if it was rehearsed.  You can sense her absolute terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I need to speak with the leaders of all the nations.  It's urgent, and they know what's coming.\"  You sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm s-s-sorry, but I'm af-f-fraid I c-cannot grant that request.\"  She stutters.  She is terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.  I will not hurt you if you cooperate.  Now, where is their main meeting room.  I have urgent business.\"  You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"27th floor.  You can't miss it.\"  She screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  Your cooperation will be rewarded.  You might want to leave this building.  Things may get explody\"  You say.  She immediately runs out of the building, and to the sidewalk, where she gets a cab and drives off.  \"I think she will go far.  She knows what's important in life.  Surviving.\"  You laugh as you head over to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"27th floor.\"  A voice in the elevator says.  You walk out and are greeted with a hallway.  You walk down the hallway and notice a large set of double doors.  With your immense strength, you destroy the doors, revealing the same representatives as in Brussels.  \"I thought we had a deal.  Well, you broke it.  Prepare to meet the wrath of a God.\"  Similar to how you destroyed London, you begin making a small compact star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\"  A voice yells.  \"You agreed to this!  It's right here in the treaty!\"  You look and notice the German representative holding the treaty with your signature on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agreed to no persecution, not forced eviction.  So give me one reason why I should vaporize this whole room!\"  You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This treaty states that the relocation is not considered persecution!\"  The German responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit!  If it truly says that, than that treaty is called off!\"  You yell as your eyes start to glow blue.  You then turn the treaty into ash with your laser vision.  \"Anyone else have anything they want to say before you become a gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't kill us!  We have friends, families!  People need us to live!\"  Representatives yell, all terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I won't kill all of you.  Only the ones who denounced the N.O.S.H before.  If you did not denounce my nation, please raise your hands over your head and leave the room.  And I will know if you lie.\"  About a third of the room got up and left.  However, you notice something wrong.  \"You must be the representative of Belarus.  Remember what I said about lying?  Well, I know that you denounced the N.O.S.H.  However, you may be wondering how I know?  I have these things called powers.  I am telepathic, and I can read your thoughts.  However, unlike many, I can read past thoughts.  I know what you did, and because of this, you get to watch my remodeling of this room before I kill you.  Are you ready.\"  Your psychopathy acts up.  \"I'm really not sorry.  After what you said about my nation designed to protect supers against prejudice, I've lost all empathy for you non-supers, and even supers who sympathize with you.  You may think I'm leading a 4th Reich, but I'm not.  I'm simply trying to do what's best for my nation.  You brought this upon yourselves.  Anyway, where was I before Germany so rudely interrupted me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were creating a ball of gas.\"  The Russian representative answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good!  For that, you get a gold star!\"  You laugh as you lob a small gold fireball at him, setting him ablaze, killing him.  After that, many of the representatives tried to escape through the busted doors or the fire escape, but noticed they could not.  \"Don't even bother trying to get away, your trapped in here with me.  Force fields are fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a monster!\"  One representative yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer the terms psychopath and God.\"  You say.  Rather than setting that one on fire, you redesign his molecular structure, turning him into a stone statue of himself.  Then, you punch it, turning it into dust.  \"Who's next?  Eeny, meeny, miny, you!\"  You point at a woman cowering on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't kill me.  I only said what I said because other reps forced me to.\"  She cowers.  You use your telepathy to see if she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but your story does not add up.  Sorry not sorry.\"  You grin as you turn her into a ball of gas.  \"While killing you individually is fun, it's taking too long.  (And it won't fit into the character limit).  You have two options.  You can either be vaporized by this gas ball which will soon be a small star, or you can be crushed by gravity.  Those who choose the vaporization, go to my left.  Those who choose crushing, go to my right.\"  The room splits, and you begin.  You start with the left group.  You make a small force field around this group.  \"Goodbye.  You will be missed, but not by me.\"  You take the gas ball which was once a living person, and compact it into a small glowing star.  You then make it collapse, causing a brilliant explosion compacted into the tight space of the force field.  \"I just realized something.  This is exactly how I killed those guards in that prison.  Funny how things repeat.  Anyway, next group!\"  You enter the force field containing the terrified politicians.  \"I've never tried manipulating gravity before.  If this doesn't work, I have a back up.\"  You concentrate on making an extremely dense object in the force field.  Soon, you notice the people being forced towards it.  You just keep adding matter to it.  Soon, it becomes a small black hole, and all the people in the force field get sucked in.  After everyone disappeared, you dismiss the fields and remove all the matter from the black hole and former star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner, you notice the one representative you spared cowering.  \"What are you going to do to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have just the plan.  In physics, there are laws stating that matter cannot be created or destroyed.  Allow me to show you that that's not true.  I'm not killing you, I'm erasing you.  Goodbye.\"  As you finish, you lift him in the air, and slowly begin removing the matter from his body.  After one minute, his existence became a thing of the past.  \"This is what happens when you double cross a God!\"  You yell into the air, as you lift yourself up in the air and fly back to the City of Power.</span></div></div>",

Also, the beginning of this is just an explanation of how society will work for the supers.  Enjoy</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you fly back to the City of Power, you realize something.  There are a lot of people there.  Soon you'll run out of room for the newest immigrants.  So you begin to think about solutions.  Finally, you come up with one.  You alter course and head towards the North Atlantic Ocean.  As soon as you make it to your desired location, you create a large island the size of France.  You then create it's landscape, adding mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, etc.  You then create towns, farms, buildings, cities, resorts and infrastructure.  Finally, you create its climate, making it have a diverse climate so it can have everything from skiing to swimming.  With your remaining power, you teleport the population of the City of Power to this new country with all their belongings.  \"Hello my subjects!\"  You announce to the public.  Everyone cheers and screams like you're their lord and savior.  Then again, you are.  \"You may wonder why you are here.  Well, with the City of Power's population reaching 25,000,000, and it continuing to grow, I felt that we needed more room.  So, I created this country.  It has the name Supernia.  There are 14 provinces in Supernia.  You can read all about them in your pamphlets.  You may choose one to live in.  However, there is limited space in all of them.  There are 14 teleporters on the ground corresponding to each province.  Each province will play a part in the country's society, whether it is food production, tourism, education, etc..  Each province has recommended powers.  For example, people who manipulate earth would be much better in Greensboro, the farming province, than Regina, the capital region.  Those people will have top priority when deciding who gets to go to which province.  The only exception is the education province, Educanta, which houses all the colleges in the country.  This one needs the top users of powers.  Next, government.  I will rule over the country as a whole, but each province will have its own government.  When you arrive at your province, you will be able to democratically choose members of the province's government, as well as representatives of your province for the overall government.  Each province, regardless of population has 7 delegates for the overall government, as well as 1 for every 500,000 people living in each province...\"  (There is more, but I don't feel like writing it.  If you have any questions about how life will work on Supernia, then let me know via e-mail.)  \"Anyway, with that out of the way, choose where to live!\"  You finish as you fly to the capital city, Regina City.  Soon, the population of Supernia disperses around the landmass in a favorable way.  \"Perfect.  Now, to rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou predicted that Regina would be the most populated province, and you were right.  Using your supreme intellect, you calculated that about 15% of the population would flock to Regina, and you were right.  The population of Regina was 3,600,000, with 2,000,000 living directly in the city.  You, Julian and Leo live in the heart of the City, in the Palace of Power.  While creating the country, you made sure everyone could live a comfortable life, no matter the monetary situation.  Every house also has a practice room, made so that any power can be used in it without affecting anything outside of it.  Your tax law is actually one that doesn't crap on the poor and benefit the obscenely rich.  There are jobs for everyone, and the country is entirely self sufficient.  You were worried about people being drawn to the touristy areas, and being uninterested in the more labor intensive provinces.  However, everything worked out perfectly.  You took a census, and found that each province had a perfect amount of people in it.  Happy, you go to your bedroom to lay down and sleep.  Creating an entire country out of thin air took a lot out of you, despite your immeasurable power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you noticed that your programs were already working.  Every person kept their old jobs from the City of Power, so society was able to function immediately.  Again, exactly as you planned.  \"Wake up sleepyhead!\"  Julian yells at you.  It scares you and makes you punch in the direction of Julian.  Thankfully, Julian reacted in time, because one punch from you can destroy a mountain.  \"Watch where your punching, I might be powerful, but not quite 'You' powerful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, natural reaction.  Anyway, what's going on?\"  You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everyone is responding to the new country very well.  I also adopted one of those fire-proof cats from Xavier's pet shop.  They're not kidding about their fire resistance either.  Even I couldn't burn it!\"  Julian laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian, how long was I out?\"  You ask in a concerned manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 3 days.  I didn't want to disturb you, but when I heard you get up, I darted in here.  Thanks for creating this place.  However, I think you overdid it.\"  Julian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  You inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were out for three days!  You are more powerful than anything, and yet you were in a three day coma!\"  He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean.  However, look at the result!\"  You respond happily.  \"Plus, a lot of times, when supers strain themselves, they get stronger out of it.\"  You say.  All of the sudden, a ball of light appears in you hand.  \"Thanks to that, I've unlocked energy manipulation.  I've been waiting for that one.  I'll be in the practice room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the practice room, you create a target to blast.  You aim your finger at it, and shoot a laser out of it.  It hits the target and produces a large explosion.  You determine the strength of it as 50 megatons.  \"Wow, that took like, no effort.  I really did get stronger.  I didn't even know I could get stronger!\"  You laugh maniacally as you exit the practice room.  Once the door closes, the room resets, a standard feature.  \"Julian, I'm going into space to destroy things.  I'll be back in a jiffy.\"  You walk onto the balcony of the presidential palace, take a look at the beautiful Regina City, and fly straight up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach an undiscovered, uninhabited planet about the size of Earth.  You land on it, the cold of space and poisonous atmosphere not affecting you at all.  <i>Okay, Let's see if I can destroy this planet.</i>  First, you make an energy ball, and shoot it at the planet.  It blows up immediately.  <i>Energy ball destroys, what about a punch?</i>  You rebuild the planet.  Because you don't have to put the detail of Supernia into this one, it doesn't drain as much energy.  You land on the planet and punch it as hard as you can.  However, you only create a large crater.  Granted it's the size of a city, but it's still not total destruction.  This disappoints you.  You decide to try your favorite power than causes explosions.  Laser vision.  You look directly down, and shoot.  The blue laser digs through the ground like it's paper, and hits the core.  The core collapses and the planet implodes on itself.  <i>I was not expecting that, but it works.</i>  Succeeding in planet destruction, you fly back to Earth, but not before running into another planet in your path.  Rather than move out of the way, you just aim your finger at it and destroy it.  It didn't have life on it, and you knew nobody knew about it on Earth.  Plus, you didn't care what people on Earth thought of you planet-destroying.  You did have standards for planets though.  You would never destroy a planet known by astronomers.  Astronomers are some of the only non-supers you currently respect.  Anyway, the planet explodes because of the energy blast you hit the planet with, and you continue on your way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return home, noticing that all the provinces were done choosing their governments.  You study all of them, and approve each one.  The group that runs the whole nation, otherwise known as the Council of Supernia, consists of all the provincial representatives, yourself (President), Julian(Vice President), and the leaders of each division of the government.  (I'm basing the Council of Supernia off of the US government, minus the parties and corruption.)  \"John!\"  Julian yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  You calmly respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a Council meeting starting in 10 minutes.  Every single member of the new government will be there, including provincial leaders.  You need to be there.\"  Julian answers.  \"See you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya.\"  You go to your bathroom, shower, put on a nice suit, and head to the meeting.</span></div></div>",

Still a psychopath.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the doors leading into the main meeting room of the Capitol, you make a small mirror in your hand.  You just need to check your tie, that's all.  Once you finish perfecting your tie knot, you open the door to your new Council.  Each of the 75 people in the room, stood up and cheered, giving you a standing ovation worthy of a perfect Broadway performance.  This event was also being televised on Supernia national TV, channel 86.  One moderator stated that 80% of the TVs were on this channel.  It seems that the people want to meet their government.  As you approach the back of the room, you notice Julian and Leo sitting on either side of a large chair.  You sit down in the comfortable chair, making it your throne.  \"Welcome to the first Council meeting!  You may be seated.  Let's begin with introductions.  Each person will introduce themselves, state what they represent, and state your power/powers.  For example, I am Johnathan Anderson, President Anderson, or Lord Anderson.  Outside of this country, I am known as The Fallen God, due to my power.  I control what's known as the Deity force, which in summary, gives me God-like power over matter, life and energy.  I also have many other powers that would take me a very long time to list.  As you may know, I am President of Supernia.  I also will not hesitate to eliminate anyone who I feel deserves it.  Luckily for you, it takes a lot to get on that list.  Anyway, that's me.  Who's next.\"  You finish and sit down.  The room erupts into loud applause.  \"Can we hold the applause until the end?\"  You ask.  The applause stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm next.  I'm Julian Anderson...\"  (I'm sparing you guys the trouble of reading 75 of these bios.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>2 hours later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's out of the way, let's govern.\"  You begin.  \"The first issue on the table is the creation of a Supreme Court.  We need judges.  I'd say have one from each province, and one from the council.  That will make 15 people.  Seem fair?  There are buttons on your desk for voting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, the anonymous vote came in, and was unanimously in favor of the court.  \"Okay, we need justices then.  Each province will have an election to decide who will represent them.  Meanwhile, for the Council Justice, I nominate Seymour Flannery.  He's currently in charge of the Bureau of Law Creation and Regulation.  After he speaks, anyone who would like to nominate anyone else may come up.  The nominee can decline the nomination, and will not be in the running for the position.\"  This meeting lasts another hour, and it makes a Judiciary and sets production standards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your time.  That will be all.\"  You say as you close the meeting.  You get up, shake the hands of many of the officials, and fly back to your palace.  After some time, Julian arrived at the palace.  \"Hey Julian.  What's you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it went well.\"  Julian responded while holding a small green fireball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the fire for?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it'd be a good idea to make some fireworks to celebrate the creation of the country!\"  He replied.  \"With the colors we could create together, it could be nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now.  Besides, April 18th will be our independence day.  Not April 21st.\"  You say.  \"Besides, it could be a liability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\"  A guard interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"  You thrash.  This is never good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some people who would like to speak to you.  They were not thrilled about the events that transpired in New York a couple days ago!\"  He responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right down.\"  You sneer.  You just wanted to have a nice afternoon.  Walk around the city, go to a restaurant, find a girl to date.  Normal teenager things.  But that will have to wait.  You take off your suit and put on your costume.  The familiar blue aura surrounds your body.  Your icy blue eyes start to glow as you shoot a beam into the sky off your balcony.  You're angry.  \"Ready Julian?  Your about to witness something special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\"  He laughs evilly as he finishes putting his costume on.  He shoots a beam of green fire parallel to your laser.  \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the grand hall of the palace, and notice a group of 5 foreign diplomats.  \"Hello and welcome to Supernia.  I am The Fallen God to you.  I run this place.  This is my brother, Blaze.  What brings you to my country?\"  You ask in a very proper manner.  You don't want any violence, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're here to discuss the fact that this land mass did not exist a week ago.  Plus, considering the advanced infrastructure, something had to have happened.  We just want to know what happened.\"  One diplomat requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems simple enough.  The City of Power, a city created to be a safe haven for supers was just getting too cramped.  So I flew over here and created this!\"  You respond, suggesting that you created the country, which you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, created?\"  Another diplomat responded curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  What part of God did you not understand.  I have power unmatched by anyone and anything.  Do you have a problem with that?\"  You respond playfully.  You like taunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind demonstrating this power you have?  I'm a very skeptical person.\"  The first one asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Just stand here.\"  You point to a spot on the ground.  \"I promise I won't hurt you.  I only hurt those who have wronged me and my people.\"  The group walk to the spot you pointed out.  You create a small glass box around them.  \"This will be your transportation.  Blaze, come with me.\"  You, Julian and the box of people lift up into the air.  You then fly over to an uninhabited island.  You scan it for life, and notice that it's just an uninteresting rock in the middle of the ocean.  \"In five minutes, that island will not exist.\"  You say to the terrified diplomats.  \"What's the matter?  Scared of heights.  Here, have a front row seat!\"  You lower the box so that it is next to the island.  \"I promised that I wouldn't hurt you.  Don't worry!\"  You laugh as you point your finger at the island.  A small blue glow forms at your fingertip.  \"Boom.\"  You say as a beam of energy fires from your finger, annihilating the island.  The box of people was completely unscathed.  \"I told you.  No injuries!\"  You laugh at the terrified expressions on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT!\"  One screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it wouldn't exist soon.  I don't lie often!\"  You laugh.  \"Now I can do a lot of other things too.  For instance, I've proven able to destroy planets, and my brother can make fires stars would be jealous of.  Anyway, any other requests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, can you get us back on ground!\"  One yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  You, Julian and the box fly back to Supernia.  You touch down, and get rid of the box.  The five all collapse.  \"Stuart!\"  You yell.  One of the guards comes over.  \"Can you find a place for these five to recuperate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord.\"  The guard replies.  You carefully picked your guards.  They are some of the most powerful supers in the world.  But they know what would happen if they tried to mutiny.  That's how you keep them in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later, the diplomats wake up.  \"Rise and shine!\"  You taunt.  \"So, why else are you hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing how you are a sovereign nation, you need representation in the rest of the world's politics.\"  One diplomat started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do we really.  Last I checked, you didn't want us.\"  You interrupt.  \"Plus, we are entirely self-sufficient, isolated and neutral to the rest of the world.  All we want here is a society where supers are treated as people.  In fact, I've been trying to get the world's supers here.   I estimate that we have about half of them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing is that some don't want to be part of your nation.  They do not like your ways.  For example, how you destroyed London a while back.\"  One diplomat added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they can deal with that themselves.  If they do not want to join me, that's fine.  And I don't want to join you.\"  You insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't join us, then you will not be able to enter any other country.\"  Another diplomat adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Some people may want to see friends left out of here.  Then, I'll just have to make some trips to some countries.\"  You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  One diplomat asks with a growing feeling of uneasiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple.  I'll have a civil conversation with the leaders of other countries.  Allow access to my citizens, or feel what it's like to be that island.\"  You laugh.  \"I only tease.  I would destroy the country.  However, it wouldn't be pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Anyway, can you let us go now?\"  One diplomat plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, and never drop by unannounced again.  Tell that to your organization.  If they surprise me again...  well, the island I destroy will be inhabited.  Bye.\"  You grin.  Once the diplomats were gone, you turned to Julian and said, \"See Julian, sometimes threats are what you need to get through life.  Now, I want to have a relaxing afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's meet some citizens.\"  Julian suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea.  I need some casual clothes anyway.  Let's go shopping.\"  You suggested.  You and Julian both go to your respective parts of the palace.  You personally have a suite the size of a large house.  It includes a kitchen, living room, rec room, practice room, master bedroom with walk in closet and en suite bathroom, a guest room, and more.  You put on a t-shirt, jeans and sneakers.  You look just like a normal 16 year old kid.  You want to be incognito.  But, if people recognize you, oh well.  They all love you.  Plus, what could they do to you?  You're a God among men.  You wait for Julian in the main parlor.  He's in a similar outfit to you.  However, he looks nowhere near as good as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, I just noticed something different about you.\"  Julian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  You ask, genuinely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you seem more, built.\"  Julian responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  I get it!\"</span></div></div>",

Well on the way home, I met Leo, and he suggested to buff myself up to look more intimidating.  It seems to have also affected my appearance.\"  You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, because you look great!\"  Julian adds.  You make a mirror appear in front of you, and look at the contours of your face.  You do look quite sexy.  Plus, with your buffed up muscles, you look like a model.  Slim, muscular and toned.  You look like a model.  \"Meanwhile, I'm a twig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Julian, that can change.\"  You laugh as you buff Julian up to look great as well.  His arms fill in the sleeves on his shirt.  He grows to an even 6', 2 inches shorter than you.  He's not quite as big as you, but you knew Julian didn't want to be huge.  Just handsome.  And boy was he.  You both could pass off as fitness models.  \"Let's meet some fans.\"  The two super teens walk out of the palace, and are swarmed with press.  Everyone wants an interview with the 2 most powerful people in their country.  (You, the reader, may be wondering where Leo is in all this.  After the meeting, John gave him a vacation.)  \"People.  Not now.  If you want an interview, you'll need to contact me privately!\"  You yell.  \"Same goes for my brother, or anyone in the Council.  I just want to have a relaxing afternoon!\"  When you finish, you create a small force field around you and Julian, pushing away the reporters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.  I need space to breathe.\"  Julian laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Anyway, where to go.\"  You wonder.  \"How about Go Figure?  They have some nice stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  You and Julian walk to the store, talking about your plans for the future, and about how you'll convince countries to allow Supernia passports.  Thirty minutes of walking later, you arrive at the clothing store.  As you walk in, you're greeted with many stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those the Anderson Brothers?\"  One clerk yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, they are!\"  A woman screamed.  Soon, the whole crowd rushed towards you and your brother.  However, your personal space force field proved extremely effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People, act civilly.  We just want to buy clothing.  Relax!\"  Julian yelled.  \"Anyway, I need some more jeans, shorts and t-shirts.  I'm good on more formal and warm clothing.  Meet you at the register.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya Julian.\"  You wave goodbye.  You head over to the shorts section.  You outgrew all of yours a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr, and welcome to Go Figure.  Can I help you with anything?\"  A saleswoman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you.  However, if I do need something, I'll make sure to find you again.\"  You respond politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  She walked away.  She looked disappointed.  She really wanted to help her President.  You look through the shorts, eventually finding the style you were looking for.  You head to the changing room, and put one of the pairs on.  Unfortunately, they were too big.  You overestimated the size of your waist.  Thankfully, you grabbed other pairs.  You put the next size down on, and it fit perfectly.  Plus, they made your muscular legs look great.  You flexed your calves, and approved of your selection.  You grabbed more in the size you needed, and headed to the athletic wear.  You grabbed some work-out shorts, and went back to the changing room.  As you entered, you took off your shirt and shorts, and tried on the shorts.  You wanted to see what you would look like while you worked out in your normal fashion.  Needless to say, you looked fantastic.  You flexed your 8 pack abs, and ran your finger along the ridges of the muscles.  You looked perfect.  You changed back into your normal clothes, grabbed the rest of the clothes you needed to buy, and met Julian at the counter.  You rung up the clothes on one bill, which came out to be 800 credits.  (The credit has strength equal to the pound for contextual reasons.)  You paid, and left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey John, have you figured out teleportation yet?\"  Julian asked, carrying all his bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\"  You respond.  Your levitating your bags telekinetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these bags are inconvenient.  Can't you just teleport them back to the palace?\"  He answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.  I can make teleporters, but can't teleport myself.  Weird, right?\"  You laugh.  \"Let's just fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  The two teens fly up and land on their balconies.  They put their bags in their rooms, dressed in nice clothes, and met at a fancy restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, and welcome to Cafe Italiano.  Will it just be you two?\"  The hostess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A table for two will be ready in ten minutes.  Please feel free to get a drink at the bar, or sit in our waiting area.  What name shall I put you under?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooper.\"  Julian responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Cooper.\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be incognito.  What do you think would happen if she yells out Anderson in a crowded restaurant?\"  Julian explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\"  The two teens head over to the bar.  While your actually 16 years old, you changed your appearance and maturity to be that of a 25 year old.  Same goes for Julian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, would you two gentlemen like a drink?\"  The bartender asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I would like a glass of Pinot Noir.\"  You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like a Gin and Tonic.\"  Julian responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  The bartender leaves to make the drinks.  All of the sudden, something happens to the Anderson brothers.  What is that something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for continuing this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo gratuitous sex/erotic images.  I want to keep this PG-13.<br>\r\nJulian and John are idealistically identical, so do not make them fight, unless it's a play/practice fight.<br>\r\nJulian is an extremely powerful pyrokine.  He is also capable of flying at supersonic speeds, is super strong, and super durable.  Keep powers consistent.<br>\r\nJohn's powers were all previously mentioned in other chapters.  If they exist in other chapters, you can use them.  I'm trying to make his inability to teleport a joke, so no teleporting.  If you want to add a power, make sure something happens to trigger the development of this new power.<br>\r\nTry to keep their personalities consistent.<br>\r\nTry to keep the story consistent.<br>\r\nI've been trying to instill some morality on John.  but, if you want to make him more moral, do it slowly.<br>\r\nMake sure your chapters have creative titles, and make sure they have substance.<br>\r\nUnless you have two vastly different options for continuation or a clear path you want to follow, add a Reader's Choice option.  Don't be shy.  Also, don't end the story.<br>\r\nFinally, make sure you write it with correct grammar and spelling.

You turned around and noticed one of your friends back from London.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephanie?  I wasn't expecting you here.\"  You laughed as you got up to hug her.  Since you were exiled from England, you hadn't seen any of your friends or family, aside from Julian.  Stephanie was a 23 year old girl (Even though the events that transpired in this story have all happened over a couple of months at most, I'm just pretending that this makes sense.  Go along with it.), about 5'6\" tall.  She was a very pretty girl with long, brown hair, and piercing hazel eyes.  You did not know she was a super too, seeing how most people tried to keep that secret back before you created a nation for them.  \"I didn't know you were a super too!  What's your power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can stretch very far, almost like my body was elastic.\"  She responded.  (Think of Mr. Fantastic or Elastigirl from The Incredibles)  \"And I know what you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, some people are just born overpowered.\"  You joked.  \"Have you ever met my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't.  Stephanie Barteau.\"  She introduced herself to Julian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian Anderson.  Pyrokine and brother of John.\"  Julian responded.  You laughed at the way he introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have some serious catching up to do!\"  You said to Stephanie.  \"I'll be back.\"  You walked away and requested to change your table size to four.  The hostess said that it's okay, but will take an extra 10 minutes.  You're fine with this.  \"Okay, we have a table for four now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\"  Stephanie smiled.  \"Oh, and Julian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian perked up.  \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a friend who'd like to meet you.  She's also a pyrokine.\"  Stephanie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.  This relaxing dinner seems to have become a double date.\"  You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Diana!  I have someone who you's be interested in!\"  She shouted.  Soon, her friend appeared in front of the group.  \"Julian, this is Diana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana MacGowen, nice to meet you!\"  She extended her arm for a handshake.  She's a bit shorter and more curvy than Stephanie.  Her hair was fire-red.  She spoke with a Scottish Accent.  Unlike you, Stephanie and Julian, she's from Edinburgh, not London.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian Anderson.  Nice to meet you too.\"  Julian finished the handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all talked to each other, learning about how power discovery, interests, and other things you'd talk about on a date.  After about 15 minutes, the hostess yells, \"Cooper!  Party of 4!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's us.\"  You sprang up.  \"We used a fake name so we wouldn't cause an uproar.\"  You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart.\"  Stephanie smiled.  The hostess led you to your table.  It's right by the window.  You and Stephanie sit on one side of the rectangular table, and Diana and Julian sit on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buonasera.\"  A waiter said.  \"I am Sergio, and I will be waiter tonight.  Could I start you off with something to drink?<br>\r\n\"Could we have water for the whole table?\"  You ask.  \"And could I have another Pinot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Anything else for anyone else?\"  Sergio asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water is fine with me.\"  Julian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\"  Diana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I have some Seltzer water?\"  Stephanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  I will return momentarily.\"  Sergio said.  After he left, everyone at the table grabbed their menus and looked for what they wanted to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to start with?\"  Julian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Calamari Fra Diavolo?\"  Diana suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum!\"  You reacted.  \"Let's share that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm vegetarian, I'll just get a salad.\"  Stephanie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Stephanie.  We don't judge.\"  Julian laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Sergio return with the drinks.  He put them on the table and asked, \"Are you ready to order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, can we share a Calamari Fra Diavolo, and could I have Veal Parmigiana?\"  Julian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  You Miss?\"  Sergio responded, motioning to Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I have the Pappardelle with Wild Boar?\"  Diana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  You Miss?\"  Sergio responded, motioning to Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I start with a Caesar Salad, and could I have the Spaghetti Primavera?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  You Sir?\"  Sergio responded, looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I have the Linguini ai Frutti di Mare?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  I will bring bread shortly.\"  Sergio said and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your water glass, sipped and noticed that it tasted funny.  You then notice that when Sergio was pouring the water, there was lemon in it.  You hate lemon.  \"Guys, the water is really lemony.  Like, lemonade lemony.\"  You said.  \"Anyone want some lemon removal?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me.\"  Diana responded.  \"I hate lemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  You take the water glasses, and remove the lemon juice from the water using your powers.  (How else?)  \"There, no more lemon.\"  You take a sip of the now lemon-less water.  \"Much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a great dinner guys!\"  Diana shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should do this more!\"  You laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.  Anyway, I have to get home.  I told my mom that Diana and I wouldn't be out long.\"  Stephanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll walk you home.\"  You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  See you Diana!  See you Julian!\"  Stephanie shouted at the other pair.  As you start walking, Stephanie asked, \"Was that a romantic date, or an outing with friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends.  Which would you have rather it been?\"  You responded smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that was a fantastic date.\"  She smiled.  \"And you'll be a fantastic boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're making me blush.\"  You laughed as you went in for a kiss.  She understood the gesture and your lips connected.  \"And you will be a fantastic girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my god!  He's nice, hot, powerful, and strong.  He's so perfect!</i>  Stephanie thought.  You overheard this thought and smiled.  She loved you, and you truly loved her.  You also noticed her trying to grab your arm.  You flexed your 18 inch arms, and she squeezed the rock-hard muscle.  \"Johnny, your so strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of my powers.\"  You laughed as she continued to hold your arm.  \"I can do a lot of things.\"  Stephanie giggled as she took your hand and held it firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost at my place.  Come in!  Meet my parents.\"  She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  You smiled as you approached the door.  Her house was in one of Regina City's suburbs.  It was a moderately large suburban home.  As Stephanie unlocked the door, you notice the \"Wipe your paws\" doormat sitting in front of the door.  \"Have any pets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I have a cat.  Her name is Selena.\"  Stephanie responded.  \"I'm just warning you, she's very playful, and will not hesitate to jump onto you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a cat too.  Well, my brother has a kitten.  He's one of those Fireproof cats Xavier's sells.\"  You laugh.  \"I love him to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm sure you'll be fine.\"  Stephanie laughed.  As she opened the door, she yelled, \"Mom!  Dad!  I'm back.  There's someone I'd like you to meet!\"  Mr. and Mrs. Barteau rushed into the living room.  \"Mom, Dad, this is John Anderson.  We used to be friends back in London.  We just met up at Cafe Italiano, and now we're dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have asked us before becoming a couple, but I approve.\"  Mrs. Barteau started.  \"Oh, where are my manners.  Coleen Barteau.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnathan Anderson.  Just call me John though.\"  You introduced yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, aren't you the president?  Why are you out like this unguarded and...\"  Mr. Barteau started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still just want to lead a normal life when not governing.  Plus, I'm all the protection I need.\"  You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.  I'm Lucien Barteau.\"  Mr. Barteau finished.  \"What brings you to our house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my brother and I decided that after that meeting today on TV, that we just wanted to have a relaxing dinner, so we went to Cafe Italiano.  That's where I ran into Stephanie.  We knew each other back in London, but we had not seen each other in a very long time.  We caught up and just hit it off.  As we were walking home, she asked if that was more of a friendly get together, or a date.  I just replied that it was which ever one she wanted it to be.  And at that moment, we became a couple.\"  You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't that romantic.\"  Mrs. Barteau joked.  \"I think you two are adorable with each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\"  Stephanie laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember who your dating Stephanie.  This is the president.\"  Mr. Barteau said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with anything?\"  You asked confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you may have to be away a lot, doing presidential things, working, etc.\"  Mr. Barteau explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  If other leaders can function with a family, why can't I.\"  You said, defending yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that dating is a big commitment.  I'm not against you dating my daughter.  It's just that I don't want her to feel lonely.\"  Mr. Barteau added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, I know what I'm doing.\"  You defended yourself again.  \"Plus, she'd never get lonely if she lived with me in the presidential palace.\"  When you said that, Stephanie's eyes lit up with desire.  You knew once you said that, opinions would change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on.  We need to talk a bit.  Just discuss this with Stephanie.\"  Mrs. Barteau said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay.\"  You responded.  As the Barteaus left the room, you knew that there was no way they could say no to Stephanie living with you.  There was obvious mutual love between you two, and it would solve the problem of longing for the other.  While waiting, you entertain yourself by playing with some fire in your fingertips.  You watch the small blue flame dance around your fingers, careful to not waft any smoke into the fire alarm.  After a couple of minutes, you dismiss the fire from your fingers, and try something else.  <i>Hey Julian?  Come in Julian!</i>  You thought.  You and your brother share a telepathic connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah?  What's going on?</i>  Julian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We may have another resident of the palace.</i>  You stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, I'm having the same conversation with Diana.  We decided to be a couple.</i>  Julian laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, same.  Stephanie's parents are discussing letting her live with me.  She's an adult.  She should be able to decide herself!</i>  You raised your mental voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'd say that if they don't let her, argue.  But don't get violent.  I know your temper.  It's bad.  Almost as bad as you'll look lashing out at her parents.</i>  Julian suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay.  They're coming back.  See ya.</i>  You finished, calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll let Stephanie live with you, as long as we can check on her and visit every so often.\"  Mr. Barteau explained.  He loved explaining.  Your smile grew even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Barteau.  I'll take good care of her.\"  You said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call us Coleen and Lucien.\"  Mrs. Barteau insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  It's been great meeting you!\"  You said as you left.  Stephanie needed some time to pack, so you decided that you'll pick her up tomorrow.  It is now 10 P.M.  You just met the love of your life, who loves you back just as much.  Your brother also has fallen in love, and you've figured out how to live a normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you exit the house, you noticed that a car was heading towards you.  It stopped next to you, and a man walked out of it.  \"My Lord!  What are you doing here at this hour?\"  He's one of your guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I was going out tonight.  I was just dropping my date off at her house.  Relax!\"  You explained.  \"And before you ask, Julian is doing the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand.  Something's going on, and we need you at the palace.  NOW!\"  The guard explained further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was about to fly there, until I was interrupted.  Just go away.\"  You dismissed him, as you fly to the palace.  You land in the front garden, and notice more foreign diplomats.  \"I told you not to drop by unannounced.  How difficult is it to let me know a day in advance?\"  You scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an emergency.  Aliens have landed in the north pole, and want to know who destroyed a planet they were looking for as real estate.  They found evidence pointing it to you.  They want to speak to you.\"  One quickly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  I'll meet them, and I'll deal with them.\"  You agreed as you put on your costume and flew due north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, you noticed a large spaceship parked on an iceberg, and many aliens walking around it.  \"What do you want?\"  You yelled at them.  One, presumably their leader, came up to you and started speaking an alien language.  \"Hang on.\"  You tried to use your powers to learn their language.  Thankfully, you could understand any language.  \"Okay, what do you want?\"  You ask in their language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You destroyed the planet of Zephof, is this correct?\"  The alien asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you describe this planet to me?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was uninhabited, and had an atmosphere made entirely of Sulfur Dioxide.  Our planet is dying, and we were going to move to that planet.  It was the only planet inhabitable by our people within 100 light years.  Then, when we went there earlier, it was gone!\"  The alien explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  So I may have destroyed it testing my power.  But, I remade the planet!\"  You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but with the wrong atmosphere.  It now has Sulfur Hexafluoride.  We need dioxide.\"  The alien explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be right back.\"  You flew over to where you tested your powers before, and found the planet.  Sure enough, it had an atmosphere of Sulfur Hexafluoride.  You used your powers to change the atmosphere to Sulfur Dioxide, and left a small present on the surface.  A little I'm Sorry gift.  Just some art.  You then fly back to Earth.  \"Okay, the atmosphere is Sulfur Dioxide now.  Happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.  We're still angry with you.\"  The alien answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY?\"  You yell angrily.  The blue aura around your body glowed brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you prolonged our ability to move off our planet long enough to have half of our population die!\"  The alien screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can fix that by killing the rest of you!\"  You laugh maniacally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not necessary.  Men, tell everyone on Zenith that Zephof is safe.  I'll handle this one.\"  The alien explained.  One of the aliens used a messaging system to tell his planet that it's safe to leave.  \"Everyone leave.  I'll be right behind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you won't.  You underestimate my power.\"  You laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you underestimate mine.\"  The alien took out a blaster and shot you right in the stomach.  The energy blast exploded when it made contact with you, making a huge smoke cloud.  \"And that's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"  You laughed as you emerged from the cloud unscathed.  \"Peekaboo.\"  You aimed your finger at him and shot a laser through his body.  As he fell down dead, the other aliens turned around to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monster!\"  They all yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He instigated the fight.  I just won.\"  You smirk as a crowd of 100 aliens rushed towards you.  You create a force field around them, trapping them inside with you.  \"So, everyone stop.\"  You use your telekinesis to hold each alien in place.  \"Now, who wants to die first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll avenge the death of our leader!\"  One alien yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!  A competitor.  This should be fun!\"  You laughed.  You sense that this one is stronger than the leader.  You also notice that this one, similar to you, created a force field around himself.  \"Interesting.  You can make these too!  I'm impressed.\"  You taunted.  \"Now, when it comes to force fields, their effectiveness is not always perfect.  They have what's known as a pulse rate.  It's measured in Hertz, or pulses per second.  The more pulses, the harder it is to penetrate.  Now, your field has a rate of around 50 kiloHertz.  Pretty nice.  Mine currently around you, has a rate of 1 octodecillion yottaHertz (1*10<sup>81</sup>.)  To put that in perspective.  For every time yours pulses, mine will pulse more than yours would if it was up for as long as the universe existed and will exist.  That's my strength compared to yours.  Anyway, hit me!  As hard as you can.\"  The alien attacked you with an energy blast, which created a large explosion.  \"Next time, try harder.\"  You continued taunting.  \"Try again.  I want to feel something by the end of this.  In fact.  All of you!  Attack me at the same time.  As hard as you can.  I want your race's last stand to be something I can remember.  The aliens all hit you with force great enough to destroy a planet, condensed into the confines of your force field.  All the aliens were panting, considering they used all their energy trying to kill you.  \"You know what, that was a nice try!\"  You laughed.  \"However, nothing compared to what's about to happen to you.\"  You took the first alien, converted his body into a star, added mass equivalent to a galaxy to it, and collapsed it, creating a hypernova inside of your force field.  All of the aliens were vaporized by the blast, while you were unscathed.  The explosion was the strongest the universe ever experienced, and you caused it.  You cleared the force field of all the matter you used, and flew off to the planet you just fixed.  \"Yeah, I'm not sorry.\"  You aim your laser eyes at it, and destroy the planet.  Then you find the next closest planet inhabitable by this race, and destroy it using an energy blast.  \"Never mess with a God.\"  You then flew back to Earth, sent the alien technology to researchers, and flew back to your palace.  \"Everything's under control.\"  You laughed.  Nobody knows what you've just done.  \"They were just trying to settle a misunderstanding.  Anyway, next time something comes up, let me know in advance.  I don't like surprises like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Fallen God.\"  One diplomat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, that name sounds more like a title.  Call me My Lord or God.\"  You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then, My Lord.\"  Another diplomat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let me go to sleep.  I've had a long day.\"  You yawned as you flew up to your balcony, took off your costume, and showered.  \"God I love being God.\"  You say, looking at yourself in the mirror.  You then put your pajama bottoms, and fall asleep shirtless in your king sized bed.</span></div></div>",

Enjoy!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine bro!\"  Julian yelled.  \"Come on.  Are you still tuckered out from wiping out an entire alien race?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your question, yes.\"  You yawned.  \"What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"8:30.\"  He answered.  \"Why, going somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Stephanie said she would be here at 10-ish, so I just want to know how long I have to get ready.\"  You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see you down for breakfast,\" Julian said as he left your room.  After 10 minutes, you finally mustered the energy to sit up and walk to your bathroom, where you preceded to wash your face, comb your hair, and do other things to get rid of your terrible morning face.  Once finished, you put on a nice pair jeans and a polo, and went downstairs to eat breakfast.  There were three main rooms for dining in the presidential palace:  The large dining room; meant for parties and other large gatherings, the private dining room; meant exclusively for your closest friends and family, and finally, the kitchen, which only has a small four person table.  The kitchen is mainly used for quick meals.  This meal took place in the kitchen.  As you walked into the kitchen, an aroma of omelets filled the room.  \"Bro, you're just in time.  Eddie over here just finished making some killer omelets.  They have cheese and bacon and onions and peppers and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  Don't mind if I do!\"  You interrupted your brother.  You grabbed a plate and put an omelet and a waffle on it.  Then, you sat down at the table, across from your brother, and started eating.  \"So when's Diana coming?\"  You asked with a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she'll be here at noon.  She had to take care of some things.\"  Julian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so soon!\"  You added excitedly.  \"Oh crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Julian inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already 9:15!\"  You stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax bro, you still have 45 minutes.  What could you possibly still need to do?\"  Julian asked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get ready.\"  You replied nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What needs to be ready?  You're dressed nicely, your hair is fine, what else needs to be ready!\"  Julian yelled, again jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to get her something, and I still need to!\"  You facepalmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..\"  Julian's expression completely changed.  \"Good luck with that now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Your nerves grew even more.  You begin to panic.  After a couple of minutes deep in thought, you figured it out.  \"I know, I'll order tickets for a show online!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's using your noggin\"  Julian smiled.  \"Now finish your breakfast before it gets cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom!\"  You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever did happen to mom?\"  Julian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know.  She was away on business when I blew up London, and I know she's not a super.  My only guess is that she's with dad in someplace that isn't London, seeing how it's currently a crater.\"  You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd believe it.  Still, she's family, and she wasn't super against the fact that we had powers.  No pun intended.\"  Julian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am curious.  I think it's better if we stay out of their life, seeing how I kind of blew up their place of residence, most of their belongings, and way of life.\"  You suggested, feeling an iota of regret for blowing up the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just kind of miss them,\" Julian said, becoming slightly emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.  When I'm traveling to all the countries convincing them to allow safe travels for Supernia passport carriers, I'll find them, alter their memories, give them some powers and let them join the nation.  They'll still remember that we're their kids, will always think that they had powers, and were always waiting for the right moment to leave wherever they are to join us here!\"  You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you're smart.\"  Julian laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"  You laughed.  \"Well, I'm done.  If you need me, I'll be waiting for Stephanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's 9:30 in the presidential palace.  You left the kitchen, ran up to your room, brushed your teeth, and ordered tickets for the show you wanted to take Stephanie to.  After that, you went to the foyer, where you could wait for Stephanie in peace.  Meanwhile, Julian, still in pajamas, was finishing a bowl of cereal.  After he finished it.  He went to his room, took a quick shower, put on some rather nice clothing, and prepared to meet Stephanie at the door.  By 9:50, the brothers were both ready to greet their newest resident of the palace.  \"Hey bro?\"  Julian started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"  You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was curious as to when you were planning on doing your international voyage to convince countries to let us in.\"  He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you must know, I was going to do that next week.  I want to get Stephanie situated here before going off.  Plus, it'd be weird to invite someone to live with you, and then immediately leave for God knows how long.\"  You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I was just wondering.  That's all.\"  Julian began.  He immediately started snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's funny?\"  You asked smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find it kind of funny whenever one of us says God, like, God knows what or Oh My God.\"  He snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you've been playing God for a couple of months now, and I'm pretty convinced it's not playing anymore.\"  He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it.  You're calling me God, aren't you?\"  You asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I guess I am.\"  Julian answered, still snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I basically am God, so it makes sense.\"  You laughed as you reminisced about wiping out that alien race for annoying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, there is someone at the door for you.\"  One guard told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here I go Julian.\"  You said, pumping yourself up for your big moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock her dead, but not literally,\" Julian responded, joking about the sheer amount of power you possessed.  You opened the large front doors, and noticed Stephanie with a lot of bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny!\"  Stephanie let go of her bags, making sure none hit the ground too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephanie!  I've been waiting so impatiently for you.\"  You smiled as you ran for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, can you help me with my bags?\"  She asked, holding your muscular arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Stephanie.\"  You replied with a giant smile on your face.  You looked at the bags and used your telekinesis to lift them all at once.  \"Ready for the grand tour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Johnny.\"  She responded excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll meet you in the foyer in a couple of minutes.  Let me just put your stuff upstairs.\"  You lifted yourself up and flew yourself to your balcony, where you unlocked the door and deposited the baggage in the room.  You then walked over to the call system, whereupon you called the butler to put away Stephanie's things.  He said that it will be ready within the hour.  You then walked back out on the balcony, relocked the door, and flew to the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Julian, you look good,\" Stephanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Diana and I really hit it off last night, and she's going to live here too!\"  Julian responded happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Johnny never told me that,\" Stephanie responded excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he wanted it to be a surprise.  But I just had to spill the beans.\"  Julian laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MROW!\"  Samantha meowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephanie, I hope you like cats, because this one is a rascal.\"  Julian laughed.  \"Meet Samantha.  She's one of the fire-resistant cats that they sell at Xavier's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually have a cat at my parent's place.  But she's technically my parent's cat.  So she's still there.\"  Stephanie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello guys.  I see you've met Samantha.\"  You laughed as you picked her up.  \"Samantha can be a real rascal.  She likes to show up in places you'd never expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I'm used to it.\"  Stephanie laughed.  \"Anyway, I'm ready for my tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  The Anderson Tours tour of the Presidential Palace is not departing.  Please keep you hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times.\"  You started as Stephanie laughed.  \"Our first stop is the kitchen.\"  You and Stephanie left to go on your tour, leaving Julian and Samantha alone in the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have made it to our final stop, the bedroom.  Thank you for choosing Anderson Tours.\"  You finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Johnny.\"  Stephanie hugged and kissed you, causing you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, anyway, what do you think of your new home?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a bit small, don't you think?\"  She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a funny one, aren't you.\"  You laughed.  \"Anyway, make yourself at home.  Oh, the one thing is that gym negates some powers, most notably super strength, speed, and stamina.  It gives a better workout that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good to know.\"  Stephanie made a mental note of that, not that it mattered to her.  \"Anyway, what's for lunch.  I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to wait for Diana and Leo to get here before lunch, that way we could all have it together.\"  You explained.  \"They should be here in an hour.  If you want a pre-meal snack, then there's some in our suit's kitchenette.  I'm just warning you it's all stuff I like.  We need to get food for you too.\"  Stephanie walked over into the kitchenette as you were saying that, and made a small discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these cheese balls?\"  You heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I have an addiction to them.\"  You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LOVE CHEESE BALLS!\"  Stephanie screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, she's a keeper.</i>  You smiled as you thought that.  You two were a perfect match.  \"Don't eat too many.  We have a great lunch planned!\"  You yell at her.  \"Save some for later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"  She responded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So...  While this may be a weird time to do it, I'm going to make a character bio for you, John Anderson.  If you have no interest in this, you can go to the bottom and choose the Lunchtime chapter option.  I just really wanted to write this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are John Anderson, a technically 16 year old super human.  However, you've aged yourself to be 25.  So, in reality, you're 25.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysical:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are approx. 6'1\", 220 lbs, with a strong, ripped, athletic build.  You have a slightly tanned skin tone, with dark brown wavy hair.  Your face is still slightly boyish, but with enough maturity to be \"sexy\".  People, especially Stephanie, find you extremely attractive/sexy.  You also have one brother, Julian, who is very similar to you in build, personality, and looks, just a tad smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMental:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're personality is very complicated.  You are slightly psychopathic, feeling no remorse for killing the millions you have.  You feel that super-humans are superior to those without powers, and should not have the authority to control any aspect of their lives.  You also have a very short temper, and could go on a rampage just from a little provocation.  However, you're working on it, and have gotten better.  Whenever you fight, you have a huge ego, mainly because you know there is nothing anyone can do to stop you.  You love taunting your enemies before annihilating them.  Sometimes, you even let them attack, which you know won't do anything to you.  You'd never hesitate to kill your enemies.  They rarely leave a battle with you alive.  Aside from your psychopathy, you are a kind guy in a relationship.  You have strong connections with all your super friends and family, but became detached from your parents, mainly because they're not supers.  You hope to be able to remedy that during one of your presidential duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout You:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers...  You have a large multitude of powers, and it seems that you have more out there.  You just have to unlock it.  However, at this time, you can still do a lot.  Besides your signature power of manipulating matter at a Planck level, (Planck is the smallest possible.  You can manipulate all matter).  You can take an atom, and change its element, create your own elements with your own properties, create and destroy matter, and even absorb matter to use for later.  You can also change any objects physical and chemical properties.  For example, you can make air poisonous without changing the elements in the air.  Basically, you can do anything to anything or anyone.  You are completely invincible and immortal, and it takes a lot of damage for you to even feel pain.  An explosion you created stronger than any other in the universe did not even come close to damaging you.  You can survive in any condition your put in, whether it be the vacuum of space, underwater, in a volcano, or even in a poisonous gas.  Nothing can harm you.  You also have extensive knowledge of chemistry, and can learn the chemical make-up of any object.  You know every property of every element, isotope, ion and compound, and can use that knowledge for your matter manipulation.  Aside from that, you are capable of lifting 7.45 * 10<sup>31</sup> pounds, or 17 Suns, running/flying at speeds of 100 Light-years per second, and not (and never) teleportation.  (It's a running joke that John cannot teleport.)  In terms of attacking, you can use your matter manipulation to make your enemies into elements you can weaponize.  Your favorite method of killing is creating a small star, collapsing it, creating a supernova inside of a force field, vaporizing everything, and then destroying all the matter made in it.  Speaking of force fields, you can make them with pulse rates of 1 * 10<sup>81</sup> Hz.  A pulse rate measures how strong the field is.  The more Hz, the stronger it is, because it is harder to penetrate.  You have an easy time penetrating all force fields weaker than 3 YHz, (3*10<sup>24</sup> Hz)  In this universe, force fields are considered impenetrable when their pulse rate is greater than 1 MHz, or 1,000,000 Hz.  To your knowledge, the only person that can create force fields of a strength strong enough to stop you is yourself.  Not even Leo can.  You also have unlimited power over energy similar to your power of matter manipulation.  You can create energy blasts, beams, and pulses, all strong enough to destroy whole solar systems.  You also can use laser vision, heat vision and cold vision, all strong enough to destroy large planets.  You also can steer your beams and energy attacks.  For example, you can make your laser vision go through a maze, and come out the other side to blow something up.  Other powers include telepathy, reading a person's past, lie detecting, biomancy (creating life), all types of kinesis (Control fire, metal, telekinesis, etc.), and the power to change people.  Give powers, take them away, strengthen, weaken, change looks, personality, and any other part of a person.  You also have a super suit that makes you 100x stronger.  It is made of an indestructible element you created able to withstand literally anything.  It also creates a sinister blue aura surrounding your body, making you look as though you are visibly radiating power.  The fire you create, dubbed Demon Fire, and all energy/laser based attacks you have are this blue color as well.  Your suit also has the blue color, in the form of blue streaks down the black armor-like suit.  It is very mobile, and feels almost like a second skin, but gives off an extremely intimidating vibe.  However, even after all of that, you can't use your powers forever.  You have limits, and stamina.  If you ever strain yourself too much, you can fall into a coma.  However, sometimes, this coma can strengthen you.  You still (somehow) have untapped potential, and at some point, will break past limits and flat out become a god.  However, the title you've given yourself, The Fallen God, makes you believe you are God already.  However, when I say become a god, I mean omnipotent ruler of the heavens and universe kind of power, not your kind of power currently.  But, you are the closest thing to a god the universe has at the moment, and are continuously getting closer.  You also are incapable of having your powers suppressed by anything not created by you.  So if someone tries to put you in a setting where all powers are nullified, yours will not be unless you want them to be.  When they are, your powers obviously go away, and your physical strength is that of a normal non-super's.  You are still strong naturally, though not super-humanly strong.  Just above average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are the president of Supernia, a country you created to be a safe haven for supers.  You live in the presidential palace with your girlfriend, your brother and his girlfriend, your advisor Leo, and servants/guards.  Your servants and guards call you \"My Lord\", while all regular civilian's regular reaction is to call you Mr. President.  You also have a net worth of 100,000,000,000 credits, which is the currency of Supernia.  One credit is equivalent one British Pound.  When you go out, you just want to act as a normal guy, and people usually respect that.  You don't like the special presidential treatment.  You only like the power it gives you.  However, despite your hunger for power, you are not corrupt, and will always do what's best for the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak with a British accent, and are very patronizing toward those you feel are inferior to you.  Otherwise known as non-supers.  You also have an addiction to cheese balls, and love cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's John in a nutshell!  Anyway, if you want to continue the plot, be my guest!  The link to the next chapter is below.</span></div></div>",

But you're probably used to that by now...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think of the food?\"  You asked, shoving a bite of steak into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, you never cease to amaze me.\" Stephanie smiled, toying with her salad.  \"First the palace, now the food!  What more could there be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cat?\"  Julian butted in, laughing.  \"Speak of the devil, here she comes!\"  With perfect comedic timing, Samantha ran into the dining room, chasing a toy mouse.  She ran under the eight person table, through all of the chairs, and finally back out.  \"Cats will be cats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truer words have never been spoken.\"  You laughed.  \"Although more redundant words haven't been said either.\"  Everyone, except for Leo, started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, is something bothering you?\"  Julian asked.  \"You seem awfully quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  He replied with a bit of a pout.  \"Something that happened during my vacation.  I'd rather not talk about it, and don't try your telepathy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  I'll let you have your privacy.\"  You agreed.  \"Just remember that if you want to talk about it, I'm almost always available.\"  A long, uncomfortable quiet fell upon the room.  It seemed as though everyone ran out of things to talk about.  After a minute of quiet, a tall, slim man walked out of the kitchen.  He was a middle aged man, wearing all of the clothing you would expect of a chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was the lunch to your liking?\"  He asked with a slight Spanish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  It was delicious!\"  Diana smiled, breaking the discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like dessert?\"  He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"  She exclaimed.  \"I hope it's chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie, could you stay a couple minutes before you continue?  I want you to meet our new residents.\"  You said, catching his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course My Lord.\"  Eddie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie, this is Diana MacGowen and Stephanie Barteau.\"  You started.  \"Stephanie, Diana, this is Eduardo \"Eddie\" Alvarez.  Personal chef to my closest friends and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you.\"  Eddie formally stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is mine.\"  Stephanie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much Eddie.\"  Diana said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us a little about yourself Eddie.\"  Stephanie suggested with a curious look in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I born in Chile, where I first learned of my powers.\"  He started.  \"I found that I was able to change any choice I'd made in the past hour.  After finding this, I realized that being a chef would be a rather lucrative career.  If the food didn't come out right, I could change what I did to it.  Last year, back in the City of Power, I opened a small restaurant that mainly served traditional Spanish, Mexican and other Latin cuisines.  One day, I heard that there was someone very important in the restaurant.  Sure enough, when I looked into the dining area, I saw Lord Anderson ordering food.  This restaurant wasn't fancy, or upper class or anything, so I was shocked to see someone as important as him here!  When I got his order, I made sure it was perfect.  A couple of minutes after the waiter delivered the food, I heard that Lord Anderson wanted to see me.  I was terrified.  Every bad thought possible raced through my head as I wondered why he wanted to meet me.  For some reason, the correct thought never made it through though.  I still remember exactly what you said to me that day.  'Sir, this might have been the greatest meal of my life.  There is no doubt in my mind that I will be here again.'  I almost fainted.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the only thing that kept me conscious were Lord Anderson's powers.  Immediately, word got around that my restaurant was Lord Anderson's favorite restaurant, and we got swarmed with patrons.  Eventually, I was asked to be Lord Anderson's personal chef.  I couldn't say no, could I?  Since then, I've expanded my culinary spectrum, and I've been indebted to Lord Anderson ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot one detail.\"  Julian interrupted.  \"The fact that your restaurant is now one of the most popular destinations in Regina City!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is also true.\"  Eddie laughed.  \"My sous chef, who has a very similar power to me, took over the restaurant, and changed nothing but its size.  I'm sure that if you go, you'll get a discount.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have some dessert to prepare.\"  When he finished, he gave a slight bow, and rushed back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now you guys know Eddie.  If you want anything to eat, he's the guy to ask.\"  You laughed.  \"My favorite thing about him is that you never know what he's going to make next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In one meal, you can sample the cuisine from all of Western Europe.\"  Leo said, starting to regain his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo!  Good to see you back in the real world!\"  Julian laughed, visibly angering Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian, not now.\"  Diana scorned.  \"Let's wait for him to fully recover from this experience before we make jokes, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Julian pouted.  \"Sorry Leo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Julian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow.  Even I can't control Julian like that!</i>  You thought to yourself.  \"Anyway, desert should be coming soon.  I'm excited!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\"  Diana yelled.  \"I hope it's chocolate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me three.\"  Julian laughed.  \"John and I sometimes bet on what we think the meal will be.  We're usually both wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  If we gave Eddie our wagers every time, he'd be the richest man in Supernia!\"  You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"  Everyone, including Leo, started laughing.  The friendly, cheerful atmosphere of the lunch has finally been recovered, only to be destroyed by something completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY LORD!\"  A guard came running in.  \"EMERGENCY OUTSIDE!  COME QUICK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on guys.  I'll be right back.\"  You scowled angrily as you walk up to your bedroom, put on your costume, and look at yourself before you head out.  There was something different.  You had the same aura, body, face, and everything.  However, your irises were a bright, terrifying red.  The rage building inside of you has given you an even more intimidating appearance, and you love it.  After checking out you new ocular development, you flew out from your balcony and headed to the place of emergency.  Immediately, you saw a large spaceship, similar to the one that the aliens you wiped out came in.  \"Those bastards.  I thought I killed them all.\"  You flew down in front of the spaceship, and greeted the aliens.  They were very different from the ones you wiped out.  \"Hello, and welcome to Planet Earth.  Home of 7 billion people and counting.  How may I help you?\"  You asked like a hotel receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap Anderson.\"  One alien hissed in English, surprising you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know English?\"  You asked, genuinely surprised.  \"The last ones didn't, or at least wouldn't speak it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you murdered their entire race and blew up 3 possibly inhabitable planets?\"  A different alien asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  You asked, taunting them this time.  \"You think I did that myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't think.  We know.\"  The first alien scowled.  \"Don't play dumb with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  Can I just know why you are here?  I'm not a fan of surprise visits.\"  You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathan Anderson, you are under arrest by the Intergalactic Federation of Interplanetary Life for genocide, disrupting the peace, and 3 counts of planet destruction.  Come with us.\"  One alien off to the side grabbed your arms, and cuffed them with strange looking handcuffs, compelling the guards to come forward for attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards, stop.  I'll handle this one myself.  It's personal.\"  You yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These were specially designed for you.  There's no way to escape from them.\"  The alien putting the cuffs on you smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just take me to your fucking leader then.\"  You scowled angrily.  \"Oh, Lars!  Tell everyone I'll be a little late for dessert, and to save me some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it My Lord.\"  Lars, one of the guards outside, responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think you're every going home?\"  The alien who arrested you asked tauntingly.  \"Say goodbye to Earth.  You're never going to see it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Earth.\"  You said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you laughing, scum?\"  The first alien questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for me to know, and you to find out.\"  You laughed as you were forced onto the spaceship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

Two aliens were in charge of making sure you behaved.  They each had gun-like weapons drawn with one hand, with the other hand tightly clamped around one of your arms.  Eventually, you made it to a small cell, which they threw you into.  You landed with a loud thud.  Deciding to cooperate for now, you didn't make any kind of struggle or show any kind of emotion.  Your ruse seemed to be working.  \"Too easy.\"  One alien laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that The Fallen God has fallen!\"  The other alien yelled in your face.  It was a struggle, but you maintained your composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think that this weakling was calling himself God.\"  The first alien continued laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I feel like I have some right to know this.\"  You started.  \"Do you have any kinds of powers at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, considering your current predicament, I think we can talk.\"  The first alien thought out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I'm sure we can.\"  The second alien agreed.  \"We're the strongest fighters of our race.  Physically, there's nobody who can beat us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?  Any mental achievements to boast about?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our physical might is enough for us.\"  They smiled.  \"Why do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just curious.\"  You lied.  You really wanted to know if they could read minds.  Now you know that they can't, you can start planning out your next moves.  \"Maybe during my incarceration, we can mock fight.  I'm not as weak as you'd think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your weak enough to be captured by us.\"  The aliens laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right.\"  You feigned defeat.  <i>I cannot wait to kill these motherfuckers.  This is going to be fun.</i>  You though.  <i>It's only a matter of time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 30 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the IFIL.\"  One of your alien captors said.  The building was bigger than any other on Earth, and was quite imposing.  \"We're taking you right to the leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  I wanted to speak to him anyway.\"  You thanked.  You were led through many different passages before making it to a large room.  The main point of interest was a giant monitor floating in the center.  Currently, it showed a picture of Earth.  In front of the monitor was a group of aliens all speaking an alien language you were not familiar with.  Your powers allow you to understand any language, but you have to hear it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Mr. Anderson.\"  The center alien, presumably the ringleader, started.  \"We've been expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you were expecting me!\"  You shouted.  \"You sent for me and arrested me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for the rudeness.\"  The alien said calmly.  \"Do you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing your the president of this organization.\"  You inferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct.  Politically, I am the most powerful being in the Universe.\"  The alien bragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One question.  Why is Earth not part of this organization?\"  You asked, trying to regain your composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple.  According to IFIL regulations, a planet cannot become part of the IFIL until it makes peaceful contact with at least 3 other member planets.\"  The leader explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Earth needs to get its shit together then.\"  You clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"  The leader, disgusted with your language, answered.  \"Now, the punishment for the kind of crime you committed would be the destruction of your planet.  However, since Earth is not part of IFIL, we have no rights to do so.  So, we're just going to imprison and torture you for eternity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, can I make a rebuttal?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but make it quick.\"  The leader stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be over in a jiffy.\"  You laughed as your eyes changed from an icy blue to blood red.  Immediately, you separated your arms, breaking the cuffs you were restrained with.  \"Too easy.\"  Everyone in the room started to panic, and the aliens who were dragging you everywhere started to attack.  \"Everyone, just freeze.\"  As soon as you finished, everybody in the room, aside from you, lost the ability to move, and were frozen in place.  \"First, let me just say this.  This whole time you've had me captured, I've been playing along.  Every time you called me weak, I took it.  Someone as strong as me needs to be able to deal with weaklings like you.  Now, to the guards who guarded my cell before, let's try out that \"mock fight\" that I suggested.  However, this fight will be real.  Let's start with you!\"  You smiled as you released one of the two aliens from your grasp.  At first, he tried to run away, but was stopped by a force field you created.  \"Oh, there's no escape from this room.\"  You laughed evilly as the alien turned to face you.  \"Now, I want you to hit me as hard as you can.  I'm going to let you have one free shot.  Let's see what your race can do.\"  The alien rushed towards you, seeing as he had no other choice, and punched you directly in the face.  He just kept punching and punching.  After a minute, you grabbed his arms, stopping the punches.  \"You know.  If your going to brag about being strong, you should tell the truth.\"  With him immobilized, you kicked him, cutting him in half with your foot.  \"Ooh.  That felt good.  Tell me, how scared are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrified.\"  The other alien who guarded your cell cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  You should be.\"  Your red eyes started to glow, and a strong blue beam of light came out of them, completely incinerating the alien.  By the time you were done firing, the alien was nothing but a pile of ash.  \"Tell me, what race were they a part of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gronids.\"  One alien screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is their planet?\"  You demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't tell you!  You'll just destroy it.\"  A different alien screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DIDN'T ASK YOU!\"  Your voice boomed violently, shaking everything in the room.  Your blood red eyes met the gaze of the alien that talked out of turn, terrifying the alien.  \"You know something.  I think I'm going to use a different method of killing for you.\"  You laughed maniacally as you started to rearrange his internal organs, making his body cease to function.  You released him from his frozen state to see his body fall limp and dead.  \"3 down, 8 to go.  It's a real shame.  I wanted to kill more.  Anyway, he didn't let me finish.  I asked you, the leader, where their planet is.  For every minute you don't answer, I'll just destroy a random planet.  Capisce?\"  You grin evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you're bluffing.\"  The leader stuttered, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I?\"  You laugh, as you raise your hand.  \"Let's play monitor time!\"  You fly over to the monitor, and play around with it, finding a random inhabited planet.  Eventually, you came across Haarcointh.  \"Ooh.  Population 3,012,642,217.  That's a good number to add to the total!  You sir!\"  You pointed at a different alien.  \"How would you like me to destroy this planet?\"  You ask evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a monster.\"  The alien you pointed at answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a method of destruction.  I'll give you one more chance before I turn you into a puddle.\"  You threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, make it blow up.\"  He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!  Nice and traditional.\"  You waved your hands in the air, making a large screen appear.  \"Now you get to watch!  Enjoy your featured presentation.\"  You laughed as Haarcointh appeared on the monitor.  \"So, I like your explosion idea, but I'm going to tweak it a little.\"  You pointed your finger directly into the air, and smiled.  \"Haarcointh, you lived a good life.  Goodbye.\"  The tip of your finger started to glow a light blue, and a huge laser, the diameter of a football field was shot out into space.  (It started outside, so the room was not destroyed.)  The screen you created split and showed the laser travelling through space at unfathomable speeds.  \"I'd estimate that the laser will arrive in 15 seconds.\"  You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haarcointh is on the other side of the galaxy.  Nothing can go that fast!\"  The leader yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm bluffing?\"  You laughed.  \"You'll see.\"  Silence befell the room as everyone watched the monitor.  On the side that Haarcointh was displayed, you could faintly see a blue speck approaching.  \"There it is!  Right on cue!\"  You laughed happily.  The laser edged closer and closer.  All of the sudden, the laser and all of its glory appeared next to Haarcointh, and flew right past it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You missed.\"  One alien pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the twist!\"  You laughed as the aliens realized your actual plan.  The side with the laser showed the laser hit the star Haarcointh was orbiting.  The laser was absorbed into the star.  For a second, it looked like nothing happened.  \"You know, everyone on Haarcointh probably just wished on a shooting star.  I wonder what they wished for.  All I know is that it won't come true.\"  You laughed as you snapped your finger.  As the sound died out, the star exploded, taking Haarcointh and 12 other planets with it.  \"So, where is the Gronoid planet?  And don't lie.  I'll know.\"  You demanded, starting to let your anger show.  Your blue aura was turning black as death, accenting the redness of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!  Who are you!\"  One alien yelled in disbelief and cowardice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM THE FALLEN GOD!  KNOW MY NAME AND FEAR IT!\"  You boomed, making the alien who just asked that question faint.  \"Nope.  Your waking up.\"  You snap your fingers, instantly waking him up.  \"So tell me, where is this fucking planet.\"</span></div></div>",

Just promise me you won't kill me.\"  One alien pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  You reluctantly agreed, unfreezing the alien.  The alien immediately darted towards the monitor, where he started swiping through planets.  \"Here.  Gronidia, home of the Gronids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\"  You sneered as you flew up to the monitor.  \"Gronidia.  Dominant race, Gronid.  Population, 10,549,867,332.  \"This is going to be a fun total.\"  You laughed as you motioned to shake the alien's hand.  \"For helping me, here's a token of my gratitude.\"  The alien walked over to shake your hand, to terrified not to obey.  \"Thank you.\"  Your face grew an evil grin as the alien's hand made contact with yours.  Your hand started to glow yellow, as a 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Volt bolt of electricity shot out of your hand and electrocuted the alien, turning him into a pile of electrified ash.  \"You think I would keep a promise to a weakling like you?  Pitiful.\"  You laughed as you prepared to annhilate Gronidia.  \"This one's going to be a special destruction.  Pay attention to the screen!\"  You continued your evil laugh as you opened your hand out wide.  Then, you closed it aggressively, making a fist.  As you finished, Gronidia started to cave in on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to it?\"  One alien cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I removed everything but the crust of the planet, creating a vacuum where it's core should be.  This causes the planet to implode on itself, and lose all of its gravitational pull.  The atmosphere will float away, leaving Gronidia as a couple of rocks floating in space.\"  As you explained it, everything you described happened in real time.  \"Lastly, I created a virus that only affects Gronids, and set it loose in the whole galaxy.  Any Gronids who come to or are already in this galaxy will die immediately upon entry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just committed genocide on a race because two of them annoyed you?\"  The leader cried, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and it felt damn good.  Now for the rest of you seven.  What should I do to you...\"  You asked yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare us?\"  One suggested timidly.  Without hesitation, you pointed a finger at him and shot him with a small laser, killing him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the rest of you six.  What should I do to you...\"  You grinned.  \"Oh, I know.\"  You smirked as you reached your hands downward.  In doing so, you started your favorite method of killing.  (Everything happens as you say it)  \"I call this move, 'Supernova'.  It's fun!  First, I create a force field around myself and my targets.  Then, I gather up matter.  Next, I create a small, but ultra dense star.  Finally, I collapse it, making it explode.\"  As soon as you uttered the word explode, the room was illuminated by an intense white light.  As the light dissipated, you absorbed all of the excess matter, making the entire room appear as if that explosion never happened.  The only sign that there was conflict (if you could call that conflict) was a message you wrote in your trademark blue fire.  It read, \"Unless you want me to destroy even more planets, do not come to Earth.  John Anderson.  AKA, The Fallen God.\"  You then looked up Earth on the monitor, found it's direction and flew home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 50,000 light year fly was very dull.  You didn't pass by anything interesting.  Easily the most boring 10 minutes of your life.  Once you finally made it back home, you noticed that only 2 hours had passed since you left.  \"Yeah, I'll never see Earth again.  What a bunch of fucking morons.\"  You laughed as you touched down on your balcony.  The fly helped calm you down, so the black aura and red eyes disappeared.  When you entered the bedroom, you noticed Stephanie lying on the bed, taking a nap.  You didn't want to disturb her, so you quietly took off your costume, put on the outfit you were wearing at lunch, and walked to the dining room.  In there you saw Leo, alone.  \"Hey Leo, getting an afternoon snack?\"  You asked somewhat innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just thinking.  Also, we left you a slice of chocolate cake.  We would've left you more, but Diana ate way more than she should have been able to.\"  He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"  You smiled, nicely this time, and went to get the cake and a glass of milk.  When you reentered the room, you noticed Leo looking a little like he did at the beginning of lunch.  \"Is something wrong?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get Julian, then we'll talk.\"  Leo answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Julian?</i>  You asked telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's up?</i>  He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dining room.  Now.</i>  You said.  In the blink of an eye, Julian appeared in the dining room.  \"So Leo, Julian's here now.  What do you have to say?\"  You asked, making sure not to sound demanding, which was pretty difficult considering your recent adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I was on vacation, I traveled to many places.  While I was in Edinburgh, I saw two people who looked an awful lot like you.\"  He started.  \"I figured out that they were your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  You found our parents?\"  You said, trying not to cry.  \"No matter how powerful I get, I can't hold back the guilt I have for leaving them.  I need to see them immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something you should know about them.\"  Leo continued.  \"They were leading a rally against super people.  I don't think they are aware that their son is the leader of the supers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  They've turned against us?\"  Julian asked.  \"This isn't possible!\"  At this point, Julian couldn't hold back the tears.  \"John, we're going to Edinburgh right now.  We need to talk to our parents.\"  You had no response.  \"John?  Remember our plan?  You'd give them powers, wipe their memories, have them live here.  We can finally rebuild our family.\"  Still no response.  \"JOHN!  LISTEN TO ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian, I need you to be quiet right now.  I have to think.\"  You said, struggling to hold back the tears.  Unfortunately, the combination of the lack of time between the aliens and this, and your disbelief made your pool of rage overflow.  Your eyes started to turn red.  Leo, seeing this, left the room in fear.  You didn't bother stopping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?\"  Julian asked, concerned.  \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Julian?  I'm not fucking okay!\"  You yelled, crying.  \"Our fucking parents hate our existence!  Why do they deserve to live here?  Why do they deserve me giving them powers?  Why do they deserve anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still our family.  Aside from the 5 of us, we have nothing!\"  Julian said, trying to reason with you.  \"We need them.  People without parents or parental figures always end up as horrible people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not horrible?\"  You asked.  \"I've destroyed 3 completely inhabited planets!  I killed over 14 billion people today!  That little excursion made my rage, the rage you're currently witnessing, overflow.  I'm a monster!  And you know what?  I don't mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I understand how you feel.  Maybe we shouldn't give them powers, or let them live here, but we should still talk to them!\"  Julian pleaded with you, crying.  \"We shouldn't take revenge!  Remember that Luke kid?  (Tying this with the Imagine Matrix story line)  He went completely insane.  We had to lock him up!  After some time, we were able to stabilize his mental condition.  John, just calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why shouldn't we kill them?  They hate us.  They'd want the same for us!\"  You cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the reason why Luke went insane was because he killed his mother, and felt nothing.\"  Julian explained.  \"John, I don't want you to go down that path.  Think of me.  Think of Leo.  Think of Stephanie and Diana.  Think of Supernia!  If you go insane like him, you could destroy everything you love.  Deep down, I know you still miss them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian, I.  I.\"  You couldn't finish your sentence.  You just slumped down and cried in your brother's lap.  \"I can't go now.  I need some time to sleep this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to go now.\"  Julian smiled, trying to cheer you up.  \"I know that if they saw how far you've come, deep down, they'd be proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you say so.\"  You cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, eat your cake.  It'll make you feel better.\"  Julian said.  You picked up a fork, and slowly started eating the cake.  With each bite, the redness in your eyes faded slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so good.\"  You muttered, the tears slowly stopping.  \"You know, I think you and Eddie just saved the city of Edinburgh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John.  Next week, do you think you'll be able to see your parents?\"  Julian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Tuesday, let's go to Edinburgh.\"  You replied, finishing your milk and cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!  Now, tell me about your excursion.\"  Julian suggested, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's what happened...\"  You told Julian the story of what happened in space, the red eyes and the black aura.  \"Yeah, so it seems that I get even more powerful with anger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, most people are like that.\"  Julian started.  \"Even when regular, non-super people are angry, they become strong enough to do things they would not normally be able to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, I like it.\"  You laughed.  \"It looks fucking awesome, it's intimidating to my enemies, and a warning to my friends to get away.  I'd say it's a win-win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Although your blue eyes are better looking.\"  Julian laughed.  \"Red eyes won't get you any ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, I need a nap.  I think I'll join Stephanie.  See ya!\"  You said, your episode seemingly over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice nap.  See ya at dinner!\"  Julian yelled to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

You decided to go for a burgundy polo, some dark, stone washed jeans and sneakers.  After you finished putting on your clothes, you walked down to the kitchen, where breakfast was being prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord, what would you like for breakfast today?\"  Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I have some pancakes?\"  You asked.  \"With chocolate chips?

What's on the menu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on what you want!\"  Eddie yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have what John's having then.\"  Julian replied.  \"What are you having?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate pancakes.\"  You answered with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum!\"  Julian exclaimed happily.  \"Keep those away from Diana though.  She's a bit obsessed with chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed...\"  You laughed, waiting for you breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 Minutes Later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast is served.  Would you like anything to drink?\"  Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it.\"  You replied, walking over to the fridge.  When you opened it, you noticed that you were out of orange juice.  \"Okay, who's going to the store to get more OJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it!\"  Eddie answered without hesitation.  \"I have to get more ingredients anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank's Eddie.\"  You smiled, grabbing the milk instead.  You sat down, poured yourself and Julian a glass, and started eating your breakfast.  \"Eddie, you are such a good cook!  I just don't get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's pretty hard to screw up pancakes.\"  Eddie laughed.  \"It's all just practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to teach me how to cook at some point!\"  You smiled, hoping to get lessons from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Anything for you My Lord!\"  Eddie smiled.  \"Anyway, I have some dishes to clean.  I know you have a busy day, so I don't want to keep you occupied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Eddie!\"  Julian added, stuffing pancakes into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished you breakfast, you started to head outside.  Everyone in the palace knew that you and Julian would be out for the day, so you didn't need to worry about anything until you arrived.  \"Okay, remember the plan?  Blend in until we find them.\"  You reminded Julian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  Let's go.\"  Julian nodded, lifting himself into the air.  Even though you and Julian could complete the 2,000 mile journey in less than a second, you decided to take it relatively slow.  Sometimes a leisurely fly is what you need in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour, you landed in a small field outside of Edinburgh, making sure not to be noticed.  After landing, you jogged to Edinburgh, making sure not to use any powers along the way.  Eventually, you made it to the Royal Mile, which was exactly as you remembered it from family trips there.  You decided to walk along, looking for a place to get lunch in the near future.  Besides, if anything was going to happen in Edinburgh, it would happen here.  After some walking, you came across an anti-super rally.  You and Julian (nobody outside of Supernia would recognize you guys without your costumes) walked over to one of the protesters, and asked what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've had it with these super people!\"  The protester yelled.  \"They might have powers, but they can't rule the world!  We all need to live too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, one crazy one destroyed London!\"  Another protester yelled to you.  \"Why would someone do that!  There were so many people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's terrible, isn't it?\"  You replied, trying to blend in.  \"Anyway, I'm trying to find someone.  Thank you for the info!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\"  The protester replied.  You continued through the crowd, trying to find your parents.  After 5 minutes of searching, you found nothing.  Feeling a little down, you decided to sit outside at a small restaurant.  Across from you were two very familiar people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian.  I see them.\"  You whispered.  \"Turn around.\"  He turned around, and saw who you were referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  That's them all right.\"  Julian smiled.  \"We should go up to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this.\"  You agreed, getting up from your seat.  \"Hello, you two look extremely familiar.  Do I know you?\"  You asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?  Julian?  Is that really you?\"  The woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mom, hi Dad.  We've missed you.\"  Julian started crying.  \"Ever since the explosion in London, we've been looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap Julian.\"  You dad replied harshly.  \"Listen, meet us at this address in one hour, we'll talk there.  I know why you're here.\"  You were shocked as you were handed a sheet of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  You replied.  \"We'll be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at the address.  It was just another house in Edinburgh.  Nothing fancy.  You knocked on the door, and waited.  After one minute, your mother answered the door.  \"Did anyone follow you here?\"  She asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  you and Julian replied simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Come inside and follow me.\"  You mother started into the house and headed for the basement.  It was a very empty room.  However, your mother kept going in.  At one point, she stopped at a wall and raised her hand.  Immediately, the wall disappeared, revealing  a secret room.  \"Leo found us when he came here on vacation.  Unfortunately, he caught us trying to 'blend in'.  We've been hiding here since you blew up The Gherkin.  We've changed all of our personal information, and hid the fact that we had powers from everyone.  Even you.\"  She explained.  \"This room is impenetrable and undetectable to anyone who does not have powers.  Follow me.\"  She started into the room, you and Julian following.  After you made it completely in, she closed up the room.  The room was not large, but had a lot of stuff in it.  It was almost like a nuclear bunker.  In the middle was your dad sitting in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain.\"  He started.  \"We moved here after all of your London incidents.  However, people here were starting to feel uneasy about the super situation.  We couldn't come out and say that we were the parents of the person committing 'terrorism' in London.  Once David Cameron announced the existence of supers officially, the country went into a panic, and wanted to come after everyone with powers.  Us included.  Thankfully, our powers helped us.  I can alter memories, and you mother is a master illusionist.  With this combination, we were able to convince everyone around us that we were not supers.  Unfortunately, we had to blend in, hence the anti-super rallies we've been participating.  In reality, we've been slowly saving up to get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now's your chance!\"  You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  Your mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sons just so happen to be the most powerful people on the planet!\"  Julian laughed.  \"We can take you to Supernia!  John's the president!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Your father replied, tears forming.  \"You don't understand how worried we've been for you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really shouldn't worry.\"  You smiled.  \"As I said, I'm the most powerful super out there.  There's nothing that can be done to combat me!  Not even Julian has a chance of beating me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're going to settle this later.\"  Julian chuckled.  \"Now is not the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So John, I heard a lot of stories about you.\"  Your mother started.  \"Are they true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on the stories.  I feel like The Fallen God has gathered quite a reputation.\"  You chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how you single-handedly destroyed London, and killed a majority of the UN.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...  I might have gone a bit overboard on those.\"  You smiled awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\"  Your father replied.  \"It was for the good of super lives.  Now, let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are starting to get suspicious of us.\"  Your mother started.  \"I'm not sure why, but I think that they might be catching onto our ruse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go.\"  You said, exiting the room with Julian and your parents.  You made it to the front door, where a policeman was standing.</span></div></div>",

Is this the Cooper residence?\"  The man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  Your father replied.  \"Is there a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our super sensing equipment has been going crazy in this neighborhood.  It's strongest right here.  In fact, it's the strongest it's ever been!\"  He explained.  \"Are you harboring supers in this house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Why would we!\"  Your mother yelled.  \"Your equipment is probably malfunctioning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's never done this before.\"  The man said.  \"This piece of equipment is the best for finding supers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then it must be pretty good then.\"  Julian laughed.  \"We've been found out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  You replied, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir.  I will ask you again, are you harboring supers!\"  The policeman yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not technically.\"  Your father replied.  \"Can you harbor yourself?\"  All four of you started to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, let me take care of this one.\"  Julian smiled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on.\"  You interrupted.  You snapped your finger.  \"There, he won't be going anywhere soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"  The policeman yelled, trying to advance forward, only to be stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a force field there.  You won't be escaping anytime soon.\"  You grinned.  \"Julian, your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank's bro, or should I say, Fallen God.\"  Julian laughed.  As soon as the police man heard the name Fallen God, he froze.  \"Oh look, he's scared.  Maybe he wants to go home to his mommy!\"  Julian taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  It's not like we just did that!''  You laughed, reminding Julian that his parents were right behind him.  \"Guys, this might get a bit brutal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian, John, let me say one thing before you continue.\"  Your father started.  \"I'm not a fan of violence.  I don't think killing for the sake of killing makes the world any better.  That being said, this man has constantly tried to arrest us, thinking that we were supers.  He was right, but nobody believed him.  Julian, have fun with this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\"  Julian's grin grew.  \"So, I see your familiar with the Fallen God?\"  No response.  \"I asked you a question!  Respond!\"  Julian walked up to his face, and made a small green fireball in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard stories.\"  The policeman stuttered in cowardice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of stories?\"  Julian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind Julian guys.\"  You whispered to your parents.  \"He likes to have fun with his victims.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine.\"  Your mother replied.  \"This is somewhat entertaining.  I could use some popcorn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  You snapped your fingers and made a bowl of popcorn appear.  \"Bottoms up!\"  You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Save me some!\"  Julian yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have more at home!\"  You responded.  \"Just continue your game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAME?\"  The policeman screamed.  \"THIS IS A GAME TO YOU?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  A very one sided one.\"  Julian laughed maniacally.  \"Now, I want to validate any rumors about my brother and me, so talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.  Didn't he destroy London?\"  The policeman whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  He did.  It was quite easy too.\"  Julian grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the hardest part was making sure I didn't kill any supers.\"  You interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How powerful is he?\"  The policeman cried.  \"How powerful are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it like this.\"  Julian started.  \"We don't call ourselves 'God' for nothing.\"  Julian laughed as his green fireball started to dance.  \"Now, there are too many options here.  But I'll think I'll do this!\"  You watched as Julian stepped back and launched the fireball at the policeman, covering his body with flames.  \"Now this fire's special.  It doesn't go out unless I want it to.  And, it likes to burn slowly.  Enjoy your death.\"  Julian laughed evilly, watching the policeman writhe in pain.  \"It's a shame really.  You didn't live to see what my brother can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAH!!!!\"  The policeman yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you want to know?  Here!  Let him show you.\"  Julian laughed as he put out the flames on the policeman's body.  The policeman was an inch away from death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian, you know that I don't want to kill him.  I wanted you to.\"  You started.  \"But, if you insist...\"  You smiled as you grabbed the policeman by the neck and lifted him up effortlessly.  \"See this hand?\"  You raised your other hand so the policeman could see it.  He nodded.  \"This hand is going to do this!\"  You pointed it straight up, and shot a large blue laser directly into the sky.  You then froze the laser in mid air.  \"See that?  It's going to hit you in one minute.  In the mean time, let me tell you a short story.  It's the story of how I personally destroyed the planets of 3 different alien races.  You might wonder, 'Hey?  Why did you kill close to 20,000,000,000 people?'  Well let me tell you.\"  You leaned in close to the severely burned policeman.  \"I just felt like it.\"  You smiled as you waved your hand down, sending the laser hurdling down into the policeman, vaporizing him.  \"Now that is the extent of my power.\"  You smirked, lowering the force field.  \"Now, let's get out of here.\"  You nodded over to Julian, who took your father's and mother's hand.  You took their other hands, making a circle with you and Julian across from each other.  \"Hold on, it's going to be fast.\"  You lifted yourself into the air, and took off faster than light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantaneously, you arrived back at the palace.  And just in time for lunch.  \"Thank you for flying Air Anderson!  Have a nice day!\"  Julian laughed, seeing your parents slightly discombobulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the flight.  Lightspeed travel is difficult the first time you do it.\"  You smiled, healing the discombobulation (great word) with your powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is where you live?\"  Your father asked, looking at the large palace.  \"You compensating for something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's what I have my powers for!\"  You laughed as you led your parents into the palace.  You headed directly for the dining room, where Leo, Stephanie and Diana were sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny!  Your back earlier than I thought you'd be!\"  Stephanie yelled as she ran to give you a hug and kiss.  She didn't notice your parents at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephanie Barteau?  Is that really you?\"  Your mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Anderson?\"  She asked into the air.  She turned and saw your parents.  \"It's really you!  It's been so long!\"  She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, judging by that greeting, you're John's girlfriend.\"  Your father butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  We've got great chemistry!\"  She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I approve.  I'm also guessing the other girl is Julian's?\"  Your father continued.  \"Again, I approve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Dad!\"  Julian smiled, sitting next to Diana.  \"Oh, you mentioned that you saw Leo.  How did you know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We saw him flying, and we used some equipment we had in the secret room to find out who he was, and his relation to you guys.\"  Your mother explained.  \"We wanted to find you guys, so we created t some kind of 'super tracker', for lack of a better term.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's all good.  Our family is reunited.  Let's have some good lunch!\"  Julian smiled, preparing to eat.  \"What's for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie said that it would be a classic.\"  Leo replied.  \"I'm excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will there be enough?  We have two more people.\"  Diana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of it.\"  You smiled, heading for the kitchen.  \"Eddie, we have two more people today!  My parents have come to live here.\"  You told Eddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!  Let me tweak this then!\"   Eddie smiled as you noticed everything get bigger.  \"There's my power at work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank's Eddie!\"  You said as you headed back to the dining room.  \"Everything's taken care of, and it looks like today's lunch is Paella!  And Stephanie, he's making a vegetarian one too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"  Julian yelled.  \"The Paella was what made us decide to have Eddie be our personal chef!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm excited.\"  Your father smiled.  Finally, you have a completed family, and are truly happy.  Lunch was spectacular.  Every single bit of food was eaten.  After lunch, you gave you parents the full tour, and showed them to their room.  Once they got comfortable, you took them shopping, seeing how you accidentally left all of their stuff in Edinburgh.  It was fine though.  You were able to buy them everything they wanted/needed.  Clothes, electronics, etc.  Once you were finished, you went to your room, where you changed the alarm to your alarm clock.  As you left your room, you saw Julian standing outside your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still want to fight.\"  Julian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, meet me in my practice room in an hour.  I have something I need to do right now.\"  You agreed.  \"See you in an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Warning.  Some strong language.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulian?\u201d  You asked into the empty room.  \u201cI\u2019m ready to fight.  But, there\u2019s something I would like to discuss first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d  Julian responded, coming out of the shadows, flames brandished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo.  There\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to do for a long time, and I think this is the best time to do it.\u201d  You started.  \u201cJulian, prepare for a powerup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d  He asked.  \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re my brother, and I want you to be ridiculously powerful, like me.\u201d  You smiled.  \u201cI can augment anyone\u2019s powers but my own.  I need special suits for that.  I thought it would be fair for The Fallen God\u2019s brother to be as godly has him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d  Julian started to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.  You stand there.\u201d  You pointed right where he was standing.  \u201cNext, I\u2019ll strengthen your fire to have potential to be hotter than physics would allow.\u201d  You immediately shot a beam of fire towards your brother, engulfing him in a beautiful blue fire.  Rather than burn him, it felt soothing to him.  \u201cNow, fire is basically energy, and close to plasma.  Thus, I\u2019m giving you control over plasma and energy, both to a greater extent than myself.\u201d  You shot a beam of energy and plasma at your brother, joining the flames in the vortex surrounding him.  \u201cFinally, like me, you will be immortal, invincible, and ridiculously strong.\u201d  You ended by shooting him with a beam of pure white light.  The vortex surrounding your brother looks directly out of a sci-fi film.  Blue fire mixing with white light, orange plasma, and dark blue energy all swirled around him.  \u201cOh, and you also have the red eyes when angry thing now.\u201d  You added a speck of red to the mix.  \u201cNow, wait a minute to absorb all of the power\u2026  NOW.\u201d  You forced your hands down, dissipating the vortex.  You brother just stood there, motionless.  \u201cJulian?  How do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHonestly John?  I think this fight is going to be interesting.\u201d  He responded.  \u201cMuch less one sided now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow that\u2019s what I like to hear!\u201d  You smiled.  \u201cI estimated that the power I granted you will make you and I near equals.  However, I still can erase your existence just in case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly for serious emergencies?\u201d  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d  You grinned.  \u201cNow, let\u2019s get our costumes on and do this thing!\u201d  You yelled as you changed your clothes into your suit.  A blue aura surrounded your body.  When Julian put on his costume, a green aura surrounded him.  \u201cI also made your costume augment your powers to the same degree as mine.  100 fold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks bro!  Now, let\u2019s fight!\u201d  Julian smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know something funny Julian?\u201d  You chuckled.  \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been worried in a fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSame.\u201d  Julian laughed.  When the laughing subsided, there was nothing.  Not a single sound was made in the room.  After about one minute of this silence, Julian created a fireball in his hand.  You could feel the intense heat coming off of it, making you start to sweat.  After about a minute of holding it, he hurled it at you faster than you could have imagined.  It hit you square in the chest, knocking you back a couple of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOw.  That hurt!\u201d  You yelled.  \u201cThis is going to be interesting!\u201d  You looked at Julian who was preparing to fire an energy blast at you.  Before he could even blink, you flew at him at top speed, punching him directly in the stomach with enough force to destroy a planet.  On top of that, you augmented the punch by adding a strong gauntlet to your hand.  You then followed the punch with an energy blast, sending your brother flying backwards.  \u201cHow did that feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHonestly?  Hurts like a bitch.  But nothing I can\u2019t deal with.\u201d  Your brother responded.  \u201cI didn\u2019t expect any less from you.  But, you missed something\u2026\u201d  Immediately, you felt a sharp pain in your back as a narrow beam of energy hit you directly.  \u201cI can control energy now.  Your energy blast certainly made that one fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJulian, you certainly are crafty.\u201d  You grinned.  \u201cHowever, you forgot one thing.\u201d  You shot freeze vision at him.  \u201cMy heat, freeze and laser visions are all not energy.\u201d  Julian froze solid, encased in a block of ice.  \u201cI know that won\u2019t hold you, but it still felt good.\u201d  You laughed as you watched Julian melt the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAgain.  Hurt like a bitch.  Ice isn\u2019t good for me.\u201d  Julian started.  \u201cIt seems I have a weakness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, there was nothing I could do about that one unfortunately.  All pyrokines are inherently weak to ice.\u201d  You explained.  \u201cThe only way to get rid of an ice weakness is to get rid of your fire powers.  Even I couldn\u2019t get around that one.  In fact, I have a weakness!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStop the fight!\u201d  Julian yelled.  \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah!\u201d  You started.  \u201cMy weakness is that people can mess with my telekinesis, which is what my matter manipulation is.  However, you and I both have enough powers to counter these weaknesses, unlike most.  If people try to cancel my tk, I can still punch their face into oblivion, use laser vision or energy blasts.  With you, you can melt the ice, and use energy to your advantage.  So yes, we have weaknesses.  But, we also can counter them much more easily than others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOkay, back to the fight.\u201d  Julian said, taking in all of that information.  Julian then flew up to you and punched you.  However, you blocked.  This super powered brawl soon became an expertly fought fist fight.  Both of you were fighting like martial arts experts, smoothly dodging and countering every attack.  After a minute of a Dragonball Z-esque fight, you both stopped, panting.  \u201cWow, this is really taking a toll on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.  Me too.\u201d  You agreed.  \u201cI think we\u2019re even!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.  Me too.\u201d  Julian chuckled, mimicking you.  \u201cLet\u2019s call it a draw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure.\u201d  You smiled, reaching out your hand for a handshake.  Julian grabbed your hand, and you shook.  \u201cThat was fun, albeit a bit painful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.  Next time, let\u2019s not attack each other like we\u2019re trying to kill each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d  You laughed.  \u201cNow, I think it\u2019s about time I start getting ready for dinner.  I\u2019m starving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope it\u2019s good!\u201d  Julian laughed, wrapping his arm around your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSame.  Though, when is it not?\u201d  You laughed, walking out of the practice room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTrue.\u201d  You both laughed.  \u201cSeriously though, this was a battle of Gods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYep.\u201d  You agreed.  \u201cTwo Gods are leaving this room together.  It feels good to be God, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d  Julian smiled, making green fire dance in his fingertips.  \u201cYou might be the God of Matter, but I\u2019m the God of Energy.  Together, we\u2019re unstoppable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJulian.  I just realized something.\u201d  You smiled, freezing while you reveal you epiphone.  \u201cWith the kind of power we have, we could probably rule the Universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re thinking a bit too big here.\u201d  Julian laughed.  \u201cLet\u2019s start with world domination first.\u201d  You both laughed as you went your separate ways to prepare for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

Will do.\"  Stephanie laughed back.  \"Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya!\"  You yelled as you flew off to the USA.  You'd made an appointment with the President for today at 9 AM.  It was 8:55.  Way more than enough time to get there.  You decided to go for a full tuxedo, complete with bow tie and cummerbund, rather than your super suit.  However, you could pull that out of thin air if need be.  By 8:56, you were already in front of the White House.  You landed with a soft thud in front of the main gate, where you were greeted by two members of the Secret Service.  \"Hello there!\"  You said with an innocent looking smile.  \"I have an appointment with President Davis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're going to need any forms of identification to make sure you do.\"  One of the men started.  \"We don't allow anyone into the White House.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"  You began.  \"I'm the president of Supernia, Lord Jonathan Anderson.  All the proof you need is in my hand.\"  You smiled as you made your Supernia passport appear out of thin air.  You gave it to the men, who were both awestruck at your use of your powers.  \"If you really want a show, then find me in a good mood.  But don't drop by unannounced.  I don't like surprises.\"  You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everything seems to be in order.  Right this way sir.\"  The other man said, letting you into the White House.  \"Follow me.\"  He started walking through the building, showing you to Roosevelt Room.  \"Here's the room.  I hope you have a productive meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"  You agreed, making a bit of a scowl.  You'd already decided the fate of Washington DC if the president doesn't meet your demands.  Hopefully things won't explode today.  You entered the room and saw a man sitting in a chair.  He was about 50 years old, and looked like he was extremely anxious for this meeting.  \"Hello Mr. President.\"  You started, trying to be as polite as you could.  \"I'm Lord Jonathan Anderson.  President of Supernia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you Lord Anderson.\"  The president began, reaching to shake your hand.  \"As you probably already know, I'm President Davis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you too Mr. President.\"  You smiled, finishing the handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what brings you to Washington?\"  The president inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very simple really.\"  You started.  \"Supernia is a brand new country.  Thus, I felt that I needed to get the world acquainted with it.  It's going to be here a while, so might as well know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, tell me about Supernia.\"  President Davis demanded, but in a polite way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  You told him about the political, economic and social structure of Supernia.  \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed and flattered.\"  The president smiled.  \"Thank you for modeling the government around our country's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\"  You smiled back, glad that it doesn't look like things will be exploding any time soon.  \"Now, one more question.  There are many former American citizens who are now citizens of Supernia.  They left their friends and some of their family behind to join our nation.  I was wondering if it would be possible to do two things.  First, to set up a Supernian embassy here and an American embassy in Supernia, and to allow people with Supernia passports into America and to get visas, and visa versa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that will have to go to congress, but I don't see any reason not to allow it.\"  The president explained.  \"I personally will be for it.  I'll get back to you as soon as the vote takes place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much Mr. President.  That is all I needed.\"  You smiled, getting up from your seat.  \"Oh, if congress doesn't meet my very simple demands, then tell them that the Fallen God will say hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do.\"  The president agreed, shuddering.  \"By any chance, who is this Fallen God?  Is he some renegade you have in Supernia to 'keep order'?  I've only heard stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  It's much simpler.\"  You started laughing.  \"It's me.  Goodbye Mr. President.  I hope I don't have to give congress a visit.\"  You continued laughing as you left the White House.  <i>That was more successful than I anticipated.  That guy certainly knows what's best for his country.</i>  You thought as you flew out of Washington DC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

The PM immediately called for the embassies to be built, and for Supernian passports to be accepted in Canada.  Everything went perfectly.  To celebrate your success, you decided to fly towards Area 51.  Considering all of the conspiracy theories and stories, you had to see what exactly was going on in one of the most secretive places in the world.  Who's going to stop you?  You approached the No Fly Zone with a complete lack of caution, which the American Military was not happy about.  You were flying quite slow, only around Mach 1, mainly to take in the scenery.  As soon as you entered the airspace, you noticed missiles approaching you.  With a flick of your wrist, your costume appeared on your body, replacing your tuxedo, and the familiar blue aura appeared.  At the very next moment, another missile appeared on your trail.  You decided to let them hit you.  What could they do to you?  The two missiles exploded in brilliant bright flashes and smoke.  You stopped as soon as the missiles exploded to give an air of suspense to those who fired at you.  After your break, you continued flying towards the air base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepeat this missile process 5 times, and you have the fly to Area 51.  It got boring after the first 3 missiles.  At one point, a plane flew next to you and started firing.  You reflected the bullets back, destroying the plane and killing the pilot.  Eventually, your leisurely stroll to Area 51 was complete, and you landed on Groom Lake, the salt flat next to the base.  To add an extra bit of fun to the day for you, you decided to sneak around the base completely invisible.  Maybe you could spook some people, or just eaves drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of a walk, you made it to the buildings of Area 51.  When you got there, you were appalled by what you saw.  Lines upon lines of super people being tested on.  It looked as though the scientists were trying to extract what made people \"super\" from them.  You were disgusted.  Regular people should never have the authority to test on those superior to them.  As you were planning the downfall of Area 51, you came up with an idea.  You rushed into a corner where nobody would see you, became visible and disguised yourself as a scientist.  You walked out of the corner and towards the supers.  As you were muttering that you'd save them under your breath, another scientists walked over to you.  \"Hey!  Are you supposed to be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  You replied.  \"My shift is over here.\"  You lied, trying to explain yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, we're under much more security than normal today.\"  The scientist started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  Did something happen?\"  You asked, trying to play dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rumor has it that something breached our air space and is in the base.\"  He continued.  \"One guard speculated that it was the Fallen God that we've been hearing stories about.  That's why we're on high alert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though that guy was just a myth!\"  You laughed, finding it very difficult to stay in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we thought so too, but someone in the White House told us that he was there today.  You can't argue with that, can you?\"  He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I guess the rumors are true.\"  You started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean true?\"  He interrupted.  \"Just because we know he's real doesn't mean all of the stories about him are true.  Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could say that, but I know for a fact that the rumors are true.\"  You smiled evilly.  The other scientist looked very confused, and somewhat scared.  \"I can confirm that those rumors about me are true right now in fact!\"  You yelled as your costume formed on your body, your eyes shifting into your angry red.  \"Nobody without powers in this facility is living past today.  The tests you've been doing on these super people are terrible.  Now, for your sins, you will be punished!\"  You raised your arms in the air, preparing for a supernova.  \"Goodbye foolish mortals.  This is what happens when you play with the wrath of a God.\"  You laughed maniacally as you detonated your supernova, completely destroying the air base and all of the people here.  The only things that survived were you and the supers you protected with force fields.  \"There, that should do it.\"  You smiled as you quickly flew all of the supers being tested on to the best hospitals in Supernia.  You could not believe that this was allowed to happen.  However, you knew not to take it out on the US Government.  Not even they knew what happened in Area 51.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a breather to calm down, you continued on your quest to legalize Supernian travel and embassies in the countries of the world.  Your next stop was Mexico.  Maybe before your appointment, you'd stop at a beach in Cancun to relax for a bit, but you didn't care.  Destroying Area 51 felt good.  Too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

The lights in the corridor flickered as you approached, the air became stale as the fire around your arms burnt up the oxygen in the immediate area. You walked to the door, behind the barred door was the yard. You phased through the bars having them de materialize and re materialize around you. As the bars re formed behind you, you extinguished the fires around your arms as to not raise attention to your self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\" a child's voice said. You turned to see a twelve year old boy with shaggy brown hair, his orange jumpsuit was tied around his waist. From the Psychic aura he was emitting you could tell he was super , a pyrokinetic to be precise. \"what are you in for?. I'm guessing using your powers in public.\" He said standing up from the wall and walking closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, mass murder of multiple accounts, possibly genocide depends on how good of a lawyer i can find.\" You answered shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, who did you kill?\" the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just most of London\" you said Humbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's were i remembered your face from.

They locked me up for an undisclosed amount of time after I got pushed over and sparks flew out of my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped off your restraints and clicked your knuckles \"I'd almost forgotten how bad it was here\" you said cracking your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon.\" you said as you started to walk towards the crowd of inmates around a podium with two supers on the top. He followed and was close behind you when you got to the group. You ducked and weaved through the crowd until you reached the front. On the podium there were three inmates one was on the floor with deep lacerations covering his body, the other two were standing over him triumphantly. \"And that's what happens to those who disrespect us.\" the taller one said. These guys were the supers you saw from across the yard and now you are closer you can see that they are shadow manipulators . You stepped out from the crowd and moved towards them. They looked at you puzzled but when you stopped just in front of them and snapped your fingers causing them to be torn apart by your vectors. A red mist started coalescing around you as the two of them slowly turned into 1 cm X 1 cm cubes in a neat stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the droplets condensed on yours and others jumpsuits others saw what you had done a wave of panic swept through the crowd. \"all of you who are supers kill all those who are not .\" you commanded as you atomized the stacks of meat behind you and formed a black metal suit of armor by re jigging the particles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bunch of lights erupted from the crowd as supers all over the yard started massacring the norms. streams of blood filled the air as people were crushed between walls of earth, others were burnt to a crisp as supers threw streams of fire across the yard. you stood there marveling in the chaos you had created as the last of the smoke settled and a set of about 10 people were left standing. the boy that you had spoken to early was one of them. the yard was torn up, burnt and littered with corpses that had been crushed turned into shreds or burnt. Some had even been strangled by the grass as one girl stood their with vines behind her and body's bound to the ground by grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can manipulate plant life as long as I'm touching some. My mother and father reported me when they saw me playing with the flowers in my window box, you know making them move and shit, and since dryad types are rare they were moving me to a facility god knows where. I had nabbed some grass from the lawn outside my house so managed to break free but government trained supers are much harder to evade than norms so i got sent here.\" she explained as you navigated your way through the tunnels to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a thick metal door, probably steel, you could tell from their psychic signatures that there were about 20 norms and 2 supers on the other side. there was a camera in the corner next to the door and it focused on you and your posse as you approached. you looked at the camera then sliced it in two with your vectors. the guards behind the door started taking cover as you approached the door and kicking it into the room with a single kick, the door crushed two of the guards on the opposite side of the room. there were tables flipped over and guards with SA80 bullpup assault rifles trained on you. you snapped your fingers and the four closest guards necks gushed crimson as they were decapitated by your vectors. Then the bullets started flying. from the 16 rifles trained on you over 150 rounds impacted your armor every second. despite this you still gestured for the other supers to go ahead and yet another bloodbath ensued. by the end there was vines coming out of the ground with the heads and torsos of several guards on them mostly impaled, some of them were burnt and others crushed against the walls by great slabs of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next room there was the supers. the first two of your group to rush into the next room got peppered with hypervelocity projectiles by the two supers standing guard in there. you shed your armor to become lighter and then darted in the room. the two supers countered your movement with a violent attack with their vectors. you dodged side to side and ducking under the telekinetic whips that slashed around you. you countered with your own vectors and coupled that with blasts of tk to knock them off balance. you managed to sneak one of your vectors through their defenses and slash one of their arms off. this caused their defenses to drop and you made short work of them by turning them into sashimi.</span></div></div>",

You snapped your fingers and the the armour you had dropped in the other room disintegrated in dust. \"can't have them finding that element.\" you said as you turned to face the last door that stood between all of you and freedom. You placed your hand in the centre of the door and it instantly turned to a fine powder that then arced into your arm. Light rays reflected off the tiny particles of metal as they darted across the doorframe and were absorbed into your arm. You stepped out and breathed in the fresh air... Before being peppered with bullets. Your mind raced as your Swiss cheese body fell to the ground. You thought about how they could hurt you so and why you couldn't detect them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your healing kick in quickly but eradicating over 200g of bullets is no easy feat. As your vision cleared you saw 5 norms standing around you wearing strange armour. It was like an exoskeleton in design but much thinner and had a full helmet complete with rebreathers and HUD. Two of them picked you up and a third slid a box beneath you. The last two had their guns trained on the door. As your mind healed you sent out telepathic SOS messages. The two that were picking you up lowered you into the box and closed the lid. They loaded you onto a chopper and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you came round you tried to feel out with your mind but were blocked by the box. You thought that the box must be lead lined so you slammed your hands on the side and they turned to dust but they met another metal, one you hadn't encountered before. This was the element that was blocking you. You repeatedly tried to read its makeup but it just kept repelling you. For the duration of the flight you sat there in the pitch black of the sarcophagus thinking about what to do. You disintegrated the rest of the lead and wood box that they had lifted you in and felt around inside the metal tomb and found several grills. You felt through them with your mind until you came to a valve made of this new metal.<br>\r\nThe helicopter touched down gently on a  pad somewhere. You heard a hissing sound and the valves opened up sending in a rush of knockout gas. You disassembled this before it reached your lungs and reformed it into the oxygen nitrogen mix of air. The coffin was pulled out of the chopper and carried by about 6 people. You thought that because you're not that heavy, so this metal must be quite dense. With a clang you were set down and the lid opened with a hiss. You kept your eyes closed to make them think the gas had worked. The light was bright enough to make the usual black of your eyelids a dark red.</span></div></div>",

There were 5 people in the room 3 of which were supers and the two just walking out the door were the norms. you felt telekinetic hands lift you out of the case and lay you down on the metal slab. then metal skinned hands from one of the supers morphed and cut off your jumpsuit leaving you in your underwear on the slab. the final one inserted and IV into your left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe IV made your mind foggy but didn't knock you out as they were expecting, but they didn't know that as you were faking unconsciousness anyway. \"test subject 0284. John Anderson. power: deity force. date 14/6/2019 time is now 16:58 and we are beginning by testing the subjects regenerative capabilities. we will begin with an incision from the elbow to the wrist.\" one of the supers recorded as he picked up a scalpel. you felt the cold chrome steel press against your skin. you decide to mess with them so you atomized the scalpel and the needle for the IV and let the metal powder just sit there instead of absorbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"this is astonishing when we went to perform the incision the subject must have had a subconscious reaction to it and protected itself by turning the IV needle and the scalpel into a fine metal powder.\" he says pinching some of the powder and letting it drop in front of his eyes. the super that had put in the IV brought over another gurney and the telekinetic one lifted you up onto it. The one that had brought the gurney over grabbed a white set of scrubs with a number on them and pulled the trousers onto you and slid the shirt over your head then he wheeled you to the door and one of the guards took you along a corridor. they laid you down in a glass cell with guards on all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter about ten minutes of assessing the area you decided to 'wake up'. So you scrunched up your eyes and then opened them. several guards looked at you astonished as you sat up on the glass bed. you looked around, the room was a light grey and you were in a glass box in the center of it. There were bright halogen lamps flooding the room with light. you stood up and walked around the cell. the floor itself was concrete and you used you matter manipulation to feel through it to see its composition, It was your standered Reinforced concrete. the walls were a tempered glass. you placed your hand on one to test and all the guards immediately trained their rifles on you. You removed your hand from it and held your hands in the air until they put their rifles down. On the desk in the cell there was a leaflet with a schedule on it: 6 o'clock breakfast, 7 o'clock shower, 7:15 o'clock school, 12 o'clock lunch, 1 o'clock power training, 5 o'clock dinner, 5-7 o'clock freetime 8-10 o'clock lockdown, 10 o'clock Bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou observed this schedule intrigued and you looked up at the clock on the wall \"dammit i missed dinner.\" you thought out loud. you looked around at the guards and said. \"come on not even a smile. alright tough crowd... feels like a German trip.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou sat down in the glass chair and waited a few minutes then a buzzer went off and a glass canopy was lowered from the ceiling down just above the door to the cell and glass walls slid up from the floor enclosing the door. Part of the concrete at the other end slid down to reveal a large white common room. the glass door of the cell opened and you got up and walked down the new created glass corridor and out of your cell room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the room there were a group of tables and  chairs and a small open area. The room was full of children and teens all of whom were supers, they were all wearing white scrubs much like yours. Almost all of them turned their heads to see what the massive psychic presence was that came into the room. Some looked at you puzzled, but others just turned away. Three of them walked over to you. One of the three was a boy younger than all of you around 9 and had flame red hair with deep brown eyes and freckles. The next was a girl was around your age and had her long brown hair tied in high ponytail, she had brilliant blue eyes and a piercing gaze. the third was a shorter girl with short brown hair and  mid brown eyes, her face was baby like and flawless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall girl talked first. \"hey, what's your name?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, That's George, this is Katy,and I'm Hayley\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\"George said and Katy just blushed when you looked at her. you smiled at her and turned back to Hayley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so what exactly is this place?\" you asked looking around and sending out psychic feelers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"this is the facility... at least that's all any of us have been able to scrape off the guards by talking to them.\" Hayley answered \"oh and no use trying to go through the walls with you feelers. They're all lined with that black metal shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\" you acknowledged and retracted the psychic tendrils. \"so what are your powers?\" you asked as you were unable to get a clear reading from them. \"well I'm a shadowkine.\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pyrokine\" George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telekine\" Katy said in a hushed voice whilst trying not to make eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"cool\" you said noticing Katy's aversion to your gaze. Hayley also noticed the blushing on Katy's part and quickly changed the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, I'll show you around\" She turns and motions for you to follow. You walk to the group of tables and chairs. A few other supers start to look at you due to your immense psychic energy. \"Over here is the communal area\" she motioned towards the tables and chairs. Their was another super who took an interest in you, he had silvery spiky hair and crystal blue eyes. He was a little shorter than you but his hair made him taller. Hayley saw the boy looking your way and called out to him \"Hey Owen, Come over here\" The boy walked over passively and then at the last minute sprung into life and jumped over the table separating you and the rest of the hall. \"Hello.\" He quickly articulated. You were a little taken aback by the sudden burst of movement and speech. \"Erm... Hi\" you uttered.<br>\r\n\"Owen don't torment him!\" Hayley Snapped. At this he coward back a few steps and walked with the others behind you and Hayley.</span></div></div>",

After that she briskly walked down the corridor, you and the group followed close to heel. \"down here is the training room and exercise yard.\" Hayley points forwards and towards a large open doorway leading out into another large space. A breeze rushed over the group and at this you shot your vectors forwards. Hayley, Katy, George and Owen winced as you let lose your psychic energies. Just as the immaterial hands reached the boundary line a pulse echoed through them and back to you sending shooting pains right into the very deepest part of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a ringing in your ears as you came to and you saw two new faces hanging over you. One was a boy around 7 with raven black hair and heterochromia iridum with the left eye being gold and the right a pale grey. The other was the dryad from the prison and her long black hair bushed over your face. \"You are stupid. There's  a neutralization field over that door, You should have died.\" the boy explained as you saw his gold eye track across your body piercing you with psychic vibrations. He was scanning you. When he got to your brain you could see his face gawp in amazement. \"This is incredible, your brain is alight with activity, not only that it is ridiculously efficient it must be your brain having a completely open psychic channel.\" he continued to scan each individual neuron.<br>\r\nYou sat up and saw the rest of the group gathered around. Using your TK you floated up and onto your feet. \"Boy, whats your name?\" you snap, with no humour in your voice whatsoever. \"Fred\" he jumped at your sudden change of attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fred, what powers the field?\" you ask clicking your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few indentured supers\" He answered guessing what you were about to do. You smiled and in a blink of an eye you were at the other end of the corridor closely followed by multiple sonic booms and the corridor being ripped apart. you slammed your hands on the door frame and felt the swirling energies of the field. As they energies drifted apart for a second you sent a massive pulse of energy into the door frame causing a crackle of lightening from were your hands meet the frame. There was a power surge throughout the entire facility and you could feel three large psychic presences go out as there minds were overloaded. you could feel a massive rush of energy as all the fields in the facility shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuards pushed past the group at the end of the corridor and as you turned you saw Owen start to smile nefariously. He cracked each knuckle in his hands and promptly his hands shriveled into just bones bound together by his mind. He jumped up behind one guard and caught the bare skin on the back of the guards neck. In a second the guards clothes dropped down and a skull rolled out from the helmet. As he landed in a three point. The other guard began to turn as Owen pointed his skeletal right hand at him index finger outstretched. Before the guard could pull any of his fire together a black arc crackled out of Owens finger and scorched through the helmet visor and boiling the Guards brain. A red bubble filled liquid spurted out of the hole in the guards face.</span></div></div>",

They weren't expecting any resistance from the general populace, they only thought that there were a small group of rebels but they were severely incorrect. Almost every super in that hall wanted to escape and now the opportunity had arisen they were not going to skip out. A girl stepped out from the crowd and stamped her foot on the ground sending the floor beneath three of the guards shooting up into the roof taking them all by surprise and leaving three big red splotches. At this your group took it as a signal to attack as you recovered from venting such a huge amount of energy into the system. Katy sprung into life and with her TK she blasted her self into the air and did a backflip as she brought her heel down into one of the guards throats. She landed in a three point then lurched forwards and flung her arms apart tearing a guard in two lengthways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen sauntered casually behind a pair of unsuspecting guards standing on the sidelines and in a flash his skeletal appendages were thrust into the bare skin. In a second their skin had shrivelled much in the same way as Owens hands had when he activated his ability. Less the a second later the two guards fell into a heap of clothes, bones and dust. Owen smiled as he let the black sparks jump between the bones in his hand unaware that behind him a guard was readying his vectors and lining up a shot that would cleave Owens head from his shoulders. Before that shot could go off however the geokinetic girl that had started the fight used the concrete as a trampoline to launch herself into the guard at almost 30 mph. She caught her foot beneath the guards jaw and rode him down to the ground, skidding a good 10 metres before coming to a stop. \"Thanks Shannon.\" Owen waved with his skeletal hands, she waved back and jumped into the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge rushed up behind two guards and snapped his fingers sending two white hot streams of fire ripping through their chests. They slumped off to the side as he jumped in between the two of them. Before he hit the ground in front of five guards George snapped his fingers again and this time created two six thousand degree fireballs, turning the air to plasma as they passed through it. He slammed the fireballs into the ground instantly turning it to bubbling lava. He pushed more heat into the concrete causing the pool of lava to spread underneath the guards and they swiftly caught alight and sunk into the lava, screaming in agony as they charred down to the bone. George let out a malicious chuckle and beamed psychotically at the doomed guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sent a spear of shadows into a guard sending him flying back, embedding itself in another guard and sending the two guards sprawling. Swiftly she created a spiked whip like weapon from the shadows and in one swing cleaved four guards in half, sending blood spraying over the white concrete floor. A host of guards ran towards her at inhuman speed and she reacted not a millisecond to late as she slammed her hand into the floor sending a pulse of shadows erupting from Hayleys hand, knocking the five guards off their feet. Quickly she sent a large spike through each of their chests, impaling them and causing them to rise about a metre off the ground in a gruesome Vlad the impaler style spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dust settled as you stumbled out still half drained from your actions earlier. You saw the carnage that had ensued you overloading the suppression system. There were charred skeletons half embedded in the concrete and the concrete itself was folded and not as flat and neat as the rest was. All in all there were a hundred and six dead guards and only twelve dead child supers. You saw Katy and the other telekinetic supers lift all the bodys up and separate them into piles, one for guards and one for the child supers, the guards pile was significantly larger and they were thrown randomly into a pile whether as the child supers were laid out in two rows of six with white sheets covering them respectfully. Shannon stamped her foot and the skeletons were pushed out of the concrete. They crumpled into piles as the sinew holding them together finally gave way. Before she could try and gather up the bones you disintegrated them and absorbed the matter. Shannon turned and called out to the group \"hey he's here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen was the first to get to you, his hands still skeletal but now they had padded leather gloves on, \"so what do ya' think?\" he blurted out, wiggiling his gloved phallanges beside his head.<br>\r\n\"that is a very interesting power, what is it a void based power using the life void created by sucking all the life from your hands to force out others energy and into an internal battery to be used later?\" you asked flicking through your memory to find the one other person with this power. You found it and her name was Alice Cain and she had died in the war, Alice was one of your commanders and had been caught in an I.E.D. He was gobsmacked by your question and was utterly bewildered by how much you knew of his ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley and the others got to you next and Katy looked worried about how tired and drained you looked. She was telling you to go sit down but you just couldn't take your eyes off the big blood splatter on the side of her face. You tapped the side of yours and she brought her white sleeve up to her face and it came down red. Katy quickly grabbed Hayleys arm and before she could object Katy had wiped the considerable amount of blood from the side of her face. Hayley looked at it and wiped on the nearest dead guard, this did not work as she only succeeded in getting more blood on her sleeve. \"damn It\" she mumbled as she rubbed her sleeve.<br>\r\n\"give me a minute\" you mumbled and you walked slightly unevenly towards the large pile of corpses. You placed one hand on the pile and closed your eyes to focus. Within ten seconds the corpses started to disintegrate and the dust that once made them up arced around the pile and into your back giving you energy, revitalizing you and restoring your energy. In another twenty seconds the entire pile had been disintegrated and you were back at full strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group stood in awe as the twenty foot tall pile of bodies turned to an ultra fine dust and moved like iron filings to a magnet towards you and if there were any obstacles the particals would bow around them in a smooth flowing motion. They saw you straighten up from the slight slouch you had to being bolt upright. You twisted your head to one side, several loud snapping sound emminated from your neck, then you twisted it the other way, again several loud snapping sounds could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were back at full strength and had nothing blocking you abilities you sent out a large scanning wave, those that had any TK based ability, e.g. Geokinesis, Pyrokinesis, Hydrokinesis, Telekinesis and Telepathy, Winced a little as it passed through them. The wave rebounded off a layer of that new metal. You deliberately walked up to one of the concrete walls and slammed your palm into it causing a ripple to be sent through the stone and a second later almost all of the concrete within a three metre radius cracked and burst off. Panels of this unknown material layered the inside of the wall. You lightly placed your hand on them and then tried to read this materials chemical makeup, but all you got back was static.</span></div></div>",

They continued passing suggestions as you thought of something, you had been attempting to read it as an element, what if it wasn't an element but something else. You pondered that for a few moments and then turned tail and quickly walked to the wall with the missing concrete. You placed your hands on the metal and pumped energy into it, scanning it as if it were hundreds of different kinds of object. All but one of the scans returned static. The one that did identified this matter not as matter but as energy condensed down and bound to the material world, Black matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed with this new knowledge you passed energy into the material and got a pulse back, you repeated that and it sped up rapidly until finally the plate that your hands were on melted and floated to your skin and begun being absorbed into you. You turned to see the group still arguing . \"guys\" you spoke and they all turned to see the last of the black matter be absorbed into your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you did it\" Hayley came bolting forwards. You nodded and then sent out a scanning pulse into the gap. The facility was deep underground, probably around two hundred feet deep, and it was beneath a city but you couldn't tell which one from here. You rushed over to the cell you had left and obliterated the door with a single punch. The glass room you were in before you had gone into the common room sat in the centre with a three metre walkway around the edge. Across the room on the opposite side of the glass chamber there was a sliding door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked around the cell to the slightly different panel on the wall opposite the door to the common room. As you placed one hand on it you could feel the same cold metal as was in the walls and then began to pass psychic waves into it to break it down. The black matter responded in the same way and broke down in a similar way to before. In its place stood a thin titanuim door, you didn't bother breaking down this one so you just cleaved it in twain with your vectors. The two peices of metal fell with a clang and you stepped over them into a grey corridor with flashing red lights lining the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown at the end of the corridor some tables were flipped over and there were guns jutting out from every orifice of the barricade that had been hastily thrown together. You waved at them and you could smell the perspiration emanating from the guards, many of whom were not supers. Just for show you snapped your fingers and created a red delicious apple materialize in your hand. You took a bite from the apple with a crunch as you began to casually saunter towards the shoddy fortifications. The tension soared among the guards as you came within 10 metres but then an officer shouted \"FIRE!\" and every rifle protruding from the metal table pile started spitting metal slugs towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the nano seconds before the bullets reached you, the apple was thrown in and you held your hands out stopping all the bullets mere inches away from your hands. Once the guards had ran out of bullets you turned your palms to face you and then flicked them round back to face the guards, sending the bullets darting into the guards. Blood sprayed out in a crimson deluge coating the corridor in a thick coating of vitea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You pushed than aside with your TK and walks past the dripping walls. The corridors continued for miles in each direction and had many levels. You lead your little party through the labyrinth and eventually reached a stairway. You stood at the centre and sighed. \"This is getting tedious.\" Then you raised your hand and a small ball of light appeared in your hand. You had been thinking about the physics of a directed fusion blast and now was your time to try it out. You splayed your hand apart and the ball instantly spread out into a beam that continued up and through the facility above, about the width that the stairway was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong smell of ozone filled the area around the beam you had made. You looked up and saw the night sky at the top of the burnt out shaft. You sent out a scanning pulse and found that you were beneath Seattle. To be precise the shaft you had made was in the Olympic national park less than 60 km from Seattle's city centre. \"Alright, every body gather round.\" You said and all the supers gathered around you and you formed a force field.  You lifted up everybody using the force field and flew them all out and past Seattle. You took them to a point 40km away from the city and a good few km up and left them in the field as you flew back to the facility and created another supernova. This time big enough to consume both the entire facility but also Seattle. You left the needle though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost morning by the time you got back to the Nosh. Not everybody can handle going at a fraction of the speed of light. You dropped everyone off and headed for the Capitol tower. As you walked through the doors the guards greeted you with a salute of punching their fists forward. You waved your hands and your jumpsuit turned into your black carapace and regal cape. You stood beneath a shaft that was made especially for flyers and shot up it at mach 2. You gently stepped onto the penthouse floor and burst through the doors. Julian came out of his room, yawning, looking like he just woke up. When he saw you he was instantly awake. \"Hey, Bro.\" He greeted as he matched your march towards you office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we still occupy Britain?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Our troops are currently helping with the evacuation of the last remaining supers. Actually we took that prison you where shipped to less than a day ago. We now hold all but the north of Scotland.\" He briefed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start the process of annexation. Use empaths to determine whether the norms harbour anti-super views. If they do Put them to work. If they don\u2019t register them as citizens and they can live in piece. I will forgive those that only harbour anti-super views for the two occasions of me using the supernova blast.\" You ordered. Julian was surprised by this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two occasions....\" He said stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I destroyed Seattle.

His fist just hovered there about an inch away from your face, it then moved around slowly so that the fore arm was just In front of your mouth. You opened your mouth  revealing your fangs, then bit down on his arm. The sweet red liquid from his arm gushed down your throat, quickly quenching that light burning sensation at the back of your throat, you didn't hold back in feeding so he soon went limp and you soon heard his heart stop beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up outside the open door and looked at each of the car jackers with blood trailing out of your mouth.

Your surprise was short lived as the gates to the old district loomed overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA security guard came  to the drivers side window and knocked on it.

Demitri turned to face you and asked \"shall we toy with them or just kill them?\" <br>\r\n\"we are late as it is, so the later\" you responded coldly. Following this command Demitri turned to face the guards, he closed his eyes and removed his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon opening his eyes fire started to pour out of all of the guards mouth and eyes as there very brain was incinerated.

You were a senior at your juinor high and the high school is right next door so they share a bus service. At the back of the bus you see a bunch of seniors from the high school, they look at you then start talking amongst themselves. The bus ride continued as usual up until it was time to get off when the group bolted to the exit before anybody else. You thought nothing of it as they were just standing by the entrance and letting people past until they got to you. \"hey kid give us your phone and your wallet\" one of the group demanded.<br>\r\n\"no, why should I\" you replied trying to push past them, they grabbed your arm and pulled you back. <br>\r\n\"Because if you don't we'll beat you up\" the senior that grabbed your arm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of you refusing they started to punch you until you felt a hot rush run through your veins in your right arm. You didn't know what to do so you lashed out landing punches on all of them in one strike sending them flying. You looked down at your arm to see the veins were glowing, you didn't know what to do so you grabbed a jumper out of your bag and stuck it on you grabbed a marker pen and drew on the veins on your hand so to blank out the glowing as you didn't know how to turn it off (you didn't know about your eyes). You proceeded into school hopping nobody would notice the one inch of glowing vein visible on the back of your neck. The day continued remarkably normally considering what happened until maths last period, you hated maths and was terrible at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went into your classroom and sat down at your desk. You got out your books and waited quietly whilst the rest of the class chatted amongst yourselves occasionally pointing at you and sniggering slightly. When the teacher came in he started writing some algebraic equations down on the board, these made your brain hurt. You scratched your head and wished you could be the smartest person in the world. You felt a hot rush around the back of your head and then your head felt 'roomy' as you took one look up at the board and figured out the equations in an instant then recording them to memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"so who's figured it out yet?\" the teacher asked.<br>\r\n\"507.98\" you said with your hand up. The teacher looked at you with amazement. <br>\r\n\"Correct\" he said quiet astonished as you had never gotten a algebraic awnser correct yet.<br>\r\n\"that isn't all the awnser yet sir, it is x -[y^3 /zx12\" you continued. At this the teacher had to sit down as one of his academically worst student had just solved a quadratic equation with a degree level awnser. You continued through The lesson until the bell rang when he called you up to the front to speak with him. \"what happened today luke?\"the teacher asked. <br>\r\n\"I don't know sir , I just seemed to know how to figure everything out.\"you replied. <br>\r\n\"well if you keep this up im sure that we'll have to move you to gifted and talented.\" he said with a smile \"go on you'll miss your bus\"<br>\r\n\"thank you sir\"you thanked him as you were leaving the classroom to go home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then proceeded to shout for you to put your hands on your head and still you just stared at him with a devilish grin. \"Put your hands on your head you Mon...*splat*\" the now deceased soldier said as you cut off the top half of his head using a leftover disc. The bottom jaw was still intact but the quivering body was still leaking blood all over the pavement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified at your actions John and George just backed away with a look of complete and utter terror on there faces. \"Yo...You ...k...k.killed him.\" George said trying to make sense of it all. <br>\r\n\"You monster, you...\" John started but you stopped him. The circular blade impacted the ridge of his nose cutting cleanly through the bone and the brain sending a rush of blood over you and George, Thud , the body made as you examined the cut. \"perfect.\" you said with a disturbing smile.
