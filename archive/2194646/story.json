Inside the case was a remote and a manual, the manual read as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for using the remote of swapping, to use the remote press the red button on the top of the device and time will pause providing you with a holographic display. To use the display indicate who you want to swap with by pointing or saying their name aloud and the display will appear provided you have line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display contains an ever growing set of options as to what you can swap so let your imagination run wild, once you have selected everything you wish to swap with the target simply verbalise the word \"Confirm\" and the swap will commence! *Note all swaps will not be noticed unless the swappee maintains physical contact with the device*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious you tried the Remote on somebody in the park you passed and time stopped, you however didn't swap anything and it was at this moment you realised the power you now had. You had so many ideas rushing through your head as time stopped and you could hardly contain yourself, you ran back to your house ignoring your mum at the door to get to your room. So many possibilities so many things to do what should you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could swap with your family, Go somewhere else to swap, Make some unorthodox swaps or something else the possibilities are endless.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caught off guard by your mother's sudden entrance, and worried about her discovering your new toy, your finger almost instinctively slams down on the button of the remote. Just as it did in the park, time draws to a halt, your mother standing frozen in the doorway of your room. You breath a sigh of relief, knowing you could use the remote's time stop function to properly calm down, think through your response, and hide the remote from your mother's view before restarting time again, even if that wasn't really what the remote was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think this over, however, a mischievous grin starts to spread itself across your face. The opportunity had presented itself, why not use it? Raising a hand, you point at your mother, confirming her as the remote's target. Now that a target had been confirmed, the remote began to project three holographic screens, two showing yourself and your mother, and one showing a large list of options for what you could choose to swap. Giving the list a quick scroll made it seem as if it went on forever, accounting for every possible thing you could ever want to swap with someone. Though you didn't really have anything in mind for what you wanted to swap with your mother, having selected her on a whim after stopping time, something catches your eye as you scroll through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life,\" you read aloud. You weren't entirely sure how it would work, but you assumed it would allow you to live the life of the person you were swapping with. In this case, it would let you be your mother while she was forced to be you, Tapping on the option brought up you and your mother's names below your images, presumably showing which life each body was living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, you decide to go with it. Your mum was the one who barged into your asking what was wrong, so why not have her answer? You dragged the life option over to the image of your self, and instantly the images changed. Below the image of yourself, the name read \"Katherine Jones,\" while the name \"Michael Jones\" was written below your mother's image. Strangely, your clothes also appeared to have been swapped, which you assumed meant that clothes stayed with a person's life, while the body stayed with the person themselves. You supposed you could use the remote to give you your own clothes again, but for the time being, you decided that wasn't necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confirm,\" you said aloud, deciding to leave it at just the one swap for now. No doubt you would be doing much more in the future, so you were fine with starting slow. The screens disappeared, and as time started back up again, you suddenly found yourself standing in a different position. Instead of sitting on your body, you were now standing in the doorway, right where your mum had been. Looking over at the bed, you saw that your mother was now sitting where you had previously been, wearing the clothes you had worn to school today. You could feel the remote still gripped in your hand, but you quickly slipped it into the pocket of your mum's jeans, which you now found yourself wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mum, I'm fine,\" your mother says, seemingly seeing nothing wrong with calling her own son \"Mum.\" \"I just had a lot on my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside you were giddy at the fact that this was working, that your mother truly seemed to believe she was you, but you manage to keep it inside. \"Well alright. Just know I'm here if you need to talk about anything,\" you say in a motherly tone, the words seemingly naturally finding their way to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks Mum.\" With that, your mum gets up and walks over to your computer, seemingly deciding that that's what she was supposed to be doing without the remote to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, were leaving the room, heading down the hall towards your parents' bedroom. You wanted a little privacy to think through your next move, It felt strange wearing your mother's clothing. She wasn't wearing anything particularly feminine today, and the clothes had adjusted to fit your teenage male body, but the bra felt odd clinging to your flat chest, and the panties were already starting to ride up a bit. You could also feel a bit of makeup on your face, a feeling you'd never really had expected to feel in your life. Reaching the room, you immediately locked the door, ensuring no one would walk in on you, before heading towards the full length mirror on the far wall, deciding you wanted to see what you looked like in your mother's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the mirror, however, your jaw dropped. what you saw in the mirror was not yourself wearing your mother's clothes, it was your mother. You looked back and forth between your own body and your mother's reflection, scarcely believing what you were seeing. You could only assume that this was what everyone else saw when they looked at you, even if you still saw your own body. You place a hand on your chest, and though in reality it was flat against your pecs, your reflection showed your mother cupping her breast, creating a strange disconnect between what you were seeing and what you were feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is sooo cool,\" you murmur to yourself, watching as your mother's reflection matched your mouth movements. You start to do all sorts of strange poses, watching as your mother's reflection mimics you, as you think through what you want to do next. The bulge in your pocket where the remote was caught your eye. After how great this first use was, you were somewhat eager to use it again. You knew where your mother in your life was, so you could swap with her again if you wanted. Perhaps you could swap back for now and find a different life to swap with, or maybe you could take her body as well, allowing you to match your reflection. Of course, there were other family members around the house too, and it shouldn't be difficult to find another target if you wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, just because you had a reality altering remote, didn't mean you immediately had you use it. You had already taken your mother's life, why not just enjoy that for now. You could see what being the woman of the house was like, and perhaps gain a bit more respect for your mother in the process. Or you could just enjoy a bit of authority and use it mess with your siblings. That said, the mirror was right here, and the door was locked. Why not ignore your bother's life for a moment and just see what you could do with your new reflection? You were sure you could think of a few fun things you could do with it.</span></div></div>",

Looking at the images you saw them to be you and the barbie doll in the Vitruvian man pose and the text were different attributes and traits associated to you and the barbie, you scrolled down on the list of traits for the barbie and saw head, you dragged it over to your image and then suddenly the images changed all of a sudden the image of you showed you with the barbies body and clothes from the neck down and the reverse for the barbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis intrigued you so you scrolled further and saw a section that said social position and under it for the barbie it said: toy and for you it said: Human being. Curious you dragged it over to your image and nothing changed with that finished you spoke aloud \"confirm\" when you did there was a blinding light and suddenly you were in Stella's hands \"Hey Micheal are you okay?\" she asked \"yeah i'm fine\" you reply \"you just looked spaced out there for a moment\" Stella states. As Stella looked up she saw Your old body now with The barbies head on it fall over outside your room \"who let Barbie out of bed and just left her there?\" she asked \"one moment Micheal\" she stated as she got up and begun dragging your old body back into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at yourself you saw your body was now plastic but you could move, your movements however were limited by your new joints but you had movement, you were now in a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt and had been put down with some of your sisters other toys at the moment they were horses. Everything was so much bigger as you were only the height of a 6 inch ruler now, luckily however you found that in your fingers which luckily had individual joints was the remote that had shrunk down to scale with you. You heard Stella walking back to her room so you quickly hid the remote under a pile of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"alright big brother lets get back to playing!\" she said as she sat down on the ground near you, now dwarfing you in comparison \"big brother\" you asked slightly confused thinking that you had swapped social position \"Yes Micheal we've told you this a hundred times, just because you're a toy doesn't mean your not my brother just like How barbie is human but still my property that mum got me last year for Christmas\" This was odd, so you had swapped social status so that people thought you a toy and non human you hadn't swapped your families social hierarchy \"come on i'm tired of playing horses let's play\"</span></div></div>",

Having a look at your body you seemed rather shapely but you were missing any actual body parts instead just consisting of shaped lumps of plastic, \"arms up\" Stella instructs as she pulls the dress over you head as she puts it on you. Once on she adds some heels and a Tiara before running off to her Wardrobe, You walked through the house until you got to the front door and opened it to find your sister had changed into a similar dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed some plastic furniture and placed a table, chair and some cups out she offered you a cup and pretended to drink imaginary tea, you played along and ended up having fun with your sister for once.

You were much smaller, and your stiff, plastic body made getting around a bit difficult. In addition, being used as your sister's toy gave you little time to yourself, which meant you would need to be very careful about your usage of the remote unless you wanted to share the secret with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your decision, you pressed the button on the remote again with your plastic fingers, and time froze once again, not that there was anything moving that would have allowed you to see that. Just as before, you selected the Barbie with your body, and the holographic display reappeared, showing the figures of yourself and the Barbie, your heads still exchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to simply swap everything back when a thought suddenly crosses your mind; why did it have to be everything at once? You had swapped two things with the Barbie; your head, and your social position. You had swapped them both before time resumed, so reality had changed to take both into account. You couldn't help but wonder how things would change if you reversed one, but not the other. At present, you were considered a toy, but still had the same place in your family hierarchy, despite your sister playing with you as she would have her Barbie before the swap. How would that change if you were considered a toy, but you had your normal body back? Would she still be playing with you like that? On the other hand, what if you swapped your status back, but kept the Barbie's body under your neck? Presumably your sister wouldn't be treating you like a toy anymore, but it was hard to imagine everyone treating you normally with a body made of plastic. You also couldn't help but wonder which aspect your size had been tied to. Why had your head shrunken to fit Barbie's body instead of her body growing to fit your head? Were you small because your head was on Barbie's body, or were you small because you were a toy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all of this was simply hypothetical. While it could be fun to experiment, both your position as a toy and your plastic body were inconvenient, and were holding you back from swapping more. If you wanted to find new targets, you'd probably need to go back to normal first. So, taking everything into account, you ultimately decided to...</span></div></div>",

As much as you did enjoy getting to spend some time growing closer with your little sister, you were going to need some private time to really make the most of this remote. You may not be HER toy specifically, but while you were a toy, she was bound to want to play with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear what you needed to do. With your plastic fingers, you left the head option alone, and dragged the social position over to the image of you, or how you currently looked at least. Nothing seemed to change about the image, but then, nothing had changed to first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but wonder how this would affect you. People would obviously treat you a bit differently, seeing as you would be a human again rather than a toy, but would they go back to treating you as normal or would it still be different because of your plastic body? More interesting though we're the implications regarding your size. You weren't certain if you were this small due to the head swap, your head simply shrinking to fit the body, or if it was due to your social position, as this was how small a toy should be.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stroked your chin with your plastic fingers as you stared up at the Barbie with your body lying dormant on your bed. You had originally come over to swap back, but that didn't seem quite so appealing anymore. You had become a toy, the plastic body of a Barbie doll sitting below your neck, why would you want to go back to something so boring as being normal? Sure you could always swap again after swapping back, but there was no real need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you weren't sure you just wanted to stay like this either. You had walked all this way with your stiff joints and your high heels, it would be a waste to do nothing, wouldn't it? As fun as your current bizarre situation was, you were sure you could use the remote for even more. You weren't satisfied yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was a question of what to do, though. The Barbie with your body was right in front of you, just waiting to be swapped with. You may not have wanted to swap back, but there were other things you could swap. For instance, you still had your own head, which looked rather out of place atop Barbie's curvy body, especially now that you were dressed like a princess. You weren't sure you really wanted to take Barbie's full body, but maybe you could do something to fit in better, like taking her hair or makeup or something. Alternatively, you could try to do the opposite and make things a bit more familiar by taking more of yourself back, adding your human, male parts to this plastic, female body. You also couldn't help but wonder if there was a way to change Barbie's body from the somewhat unfeeling plastic into actual flesh. You weren't sure if the remote would allow it, but the idea of experiencing a body like Barbie's in actual flesh did sound appealing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Barbie wasn't the only potential target around here. You family was currently having dinner, and if you were quick enough, you might be able to catch them unaware to swap with them while they were eating. Family aside, you certainly weren't planning on leaving the house by yourself this small, what with the potential dangers that you'd have to face, but if you could climb up to a window, you might be able to spot some people you could swap with outside. The might not be many people at at this time of day, but it could give you some more variety than simply swapping with your family. However, swapping with people on the street also ran the risk of losing whatever you swapped. You obviously knew where your family would be, but if you swapped with a stranger on the street, you'd have no idea where they'd end up if you wanted to swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans weren't the only thing you could swap with though, as your current situation was clearly evidence to. You couldn't help but wonder what else the remote would allow you to swap with. After all, Barbie may have been a toy made out of plastic, but she was still more or less shaped like a human. Barbie was obviously not the only toy Stella owned, what would happen if you swapped with a different one? What if you swapped with an animal outside on the street? Would the remote let you do that? What about plants? Pictures or drawings? Inanimate objects that in no way resembled a living thing? The idea excited you. You would still need to be careful, though. Your swap with Barbie may have given you the body of a toy, but it still had fingers that would let you use the remote. You'd need to make sure that whatever you swapped with, you were still able to press the button that activated it, otherwise you'd be unable to swap back when whatever form you'd taken on wasn't fun anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have forever to decide, though. Once your family was done having dinner, Stella would be coming back, and would probably expect you to be in her room so you could play some more, and considering the dress she'd put you in lacked any pockets, you'd probably want to get there before her so you could hide the remote somewhere.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While swapping with new people or experimenting with some more unorthodox swaps seemed like a fun idea, you decided that was something better saved for another time. After all, you were currently on a bit of a deadline; you needed to finish whatever you were doing and get back to Stella's room before she was done with dinner. Considering how long it had taken you to simply walk down the hallway with your tiny doll body, you decide it would be for the best to simply swap with the doll right in front of you and then head back. It wasn't like the remote was going to suddenly disappear, after all, you could always experiment more later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press the button on the remote, stopping time, thereby giving you all the time you need to decide what you wanted to swap. Pointing at the Barbie with your body once again brings up the holographic display that had gotten you into your current situation, letting you scroll through the list of traits you might want to swap, allowing you to check whether your prior ideas would actually work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first idea was getting your head to fit your body a bit better, as it currently looked a bit out of place. You weren't sure you wanted to go all the way and completely become a living Barbie doll, but there were definitely options within the list that could help you out. Hair stood out as a good options, and after a bit of searching, you managed to locate a makeup option as well, although you're not sure if dolls could be considered to wear makeup, or if that was just part of their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, you could try adding more parts of your own body to Barbie's. Barbie's body was shapely indeed, but being made of plastic, it lacked much feeling, and you wouldn't mind getting some actual body parts back, even if it meant you had to take them from your original, male body. The amusing image of a Barbie doll with a bulge in her panties briefly flashes through your mind. You do have to wonder how this all worked, though. How much of your body would actually function when attached to a body of plastic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the idea you doubted whether or not would work, turning Barbie's body into flesh. While you had really just swapped with Stella's Barbie on a whim, testing the more unorthodox side of the remote, you were still a teenage boy, and being able to experience such a shapely female body from this angle was rather exciting to you. Said excitement was dampened, however, by the fact that your body was made of plastic, and you lacked the actual parts that someone in your position would want to get their hands on. You scroll through the options, hoping to find something that might make your plan possible. For a moment, you thought \"species\" might be it, but apparently \"toy\" was not a species, and Barbie was still considered human, as that was what she was representative of. With some more time, you might be able to find something that worked, something like \"material\" perhaps, but you were starting to think it wasn't worth your time and you should just go with one of your first two ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyes scanning over the list you were scrolling through one more time, you look up at the large human body laying in the distance, a grin gracing your face. You were rather happy you had decided to try swapping with Barbie in the first place. Being inanimate, she'd never run off, making her the perfect guinea pig. And ultimately, you decided that the plan you wanted to use on your guinea pig this time was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While gaining more feeling in your plastic body did seem nice, for the time being, you decided that if you were going to stay a Barbie doll, you may as well get into the role. It wasn't like you were going to stay a doll forever, you could always snatch a human body, perhaps even a female one, another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't about to fully become Barbie, though. While that would certainly be the easiest way to have your head fit better with your body, you weren't sure you were comfortable having your entire body being made out of plastic. This was partially due to how dulled your sense of touch had become upon becoming a doll, but was mainly because you could only move along the doll's stiff joints, and you were pretty sure this specific Barbie didn't have a moving mouth. Would you still be able to speak if you weren't able to move your mouth? That wasn't something you were keen on investigating for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you decide to utilise some of the more cosmetic options available to you. Firstly, you select the hair option and drag it over the picture of you. The moment you let go, the picture changes, showing Barbie's long blonde hair on your body, while she had your short brown hair. It already does quite a bit to making your head look less out of place, but you decide to go a little further. After dragging the makeup option over, the image changes once more. Barbie's face on your body is now devoid of makeup, though still very clearly female. Your face, on the other hand, was now fully made up. Lipstick, mascara, eyeshadow, the works. If one looked closely, you could still tell that the face behind the makeup was that of a boy, but for the most part, your head now looked right at home on your Barbie body, even in the girly princess dress you'd be put in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confirm,\" you say aloud, deciding that was good enough for now. Just like that, time resumed, and the images you'd seen on the holographic display became real. Laying on the bed in front of you, Barbie's hair had shortened and darkened, although you weren't able to see her face too clearly. On the other hand, you now had long blonde hair on the edge of your field of view as it draped down your back. Despite looking the part, you couldn't help but think it felt oddly artificial against the real skin of your head. You could also feel something caking your face, though it felt far stiffer than you would have imagined make up to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving performed the swap, you decided it was time to head back to Stella's room now. You may have had more time left, but you didn't want to take any chances and make people suspicious of what you were doing. It takes you a while to make your way down the hallway, though not as long as the trip to your room had taken, as you were starting to get used to the degree of movement your plastic body had, as well as walking around in a dress and heels. For a moment it crosses your mind that despite being a teenage boy, in your own body at least, you had shown absolutely no resistance to becoming so girly, through either your own actions with the remote or through playing princess with Stella. You decide it doesn't matter, however, and decide to just let yourself enjoy the odd situation you've place yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching Stella's room, you head straight for the dollhouse she had placed you inside of to get you dressed, assuming that that was probably where you lived now, seeing as the Barbie with your body had taken your bed. You slowly make your way over to the bedroom, taking the time to marvel at how all the plastic furniture was now life-size to you. Inside, you are immediately greeted by the mirror, showing you your new visage, and allowing you to notice the subtleties that had been missed by the holographic display. As you had deduced, the long blond locks flowing behind you were not real human hair, but was instead artificial doll hair, looking shiny and perfect. Despite not being real, it seemed to be coming out of your human scalp, the same way the flesh of your neck blended into the plastic of your body. You couldn't help but wonder if your hair would still grow like a human, or if it would be stuck at this length like a doll. The makeup was also not exactly what you had expected. The Barbie doll was clearly not wearing actual makeup, and instead just had it painted onto her face. Thus, swapping \"makeup\" with the doll had permanently painted your lips bright pink, your eyelashes long and black, and so on. It made you a little anxious to see these colours actually painted onto your face, but you supposed that this was what you needed to do if you really wanted to get into the role of Barbie. It wasn't like it was permanent anyway, as you still held the remote, and could swap it away in seconds if you wished. Overall, your face looked decidedly feminine now, just as you had been attempting to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like a princess,\" you mumble to yourself, making light of the girly dress you were still wearing. You frown slightly at hearing your old voice, though you suppose you should have expected that, seeing as you did still have your own head. That wasn't something you could have changed anyway, seeing as the Barbie you'd swapped with didn't possess a speaker, and thus had no voice for you to swap with. You have to use the remote to get a new voice later if you wanted to go even further down this feminine rabbit hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the remote, you decide to stash it away underneath the pillow on the bed. There were drawers you could hide it in inside the house, but you didn't want to risk Stella moving the furniture around and losing it. The bed you guessed she probably wouldn't touch if it was really where you slept, so you hoped it would be safe there. You had only just placed the pillow back down when you suddenly heard footsteps beginning to approach the room. Your family must be done with dinner, and that would be Stella coming back. You couldn't help but wonder what she'd want to play now. You'd interrupted her while she was playing horses, and then found yourself playing princesses instead. You couldn't help but get a little excited wondering what you little doll body might be used for next.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't help but lick your lips at the weird waxy texture of the red paint.  But you had to admire the high quality materials used on the Barbie doll, the red on your lips wasn't fading one bit even when you gave it a quick rub.  You were so amused by your doll body and features you didn't even notice the room had been gradually becoming much darker.  You finally noticed when Stella's door opens.  You make your way out of the dollhouse ready to experiment with more doll life, \"Hey Stella, what took you so long?  What do you want to do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella turned to you and her eyes lit up with excitement for a moment, but the voice from the doorway dampened the mood, \"Sorry Michael, but it's already Stella's bedtime, after dinner we stayed in the living room to watch a movie so shouldn't play with you tonight.  But would you like me to tuck you into bed with your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms as well as your joints would allow and let out a little huff of annoyance.  After all you had just traded away your humanity not only out of personal curiosity, but also to hang out with Stella and she was choosing to hang out with everyone else in the family over him even after he made himself a doll for her.  \"No thanks, I don't want to go to bed with Stella, I've got my own bed I can stay in.\"  You said as you turned in a huff and swished your princess dress behind you back into the dollhouse.  But before you could shut the door behind you Stella stopped you.  \"But Michael...I'm sorry, can I stay up some more to play with Michael.  Please mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Stella, it's still your bed time.  But you're being such a good girl by apologizing.  Michael, you accept it right?\"  You mom looked down at you and asked heavily implying you should.  You sighed and said, \"Yeah, you I can't stay mad at you Stella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"  Stella said as she picked you up and gave you a big hug.  She looked up at your mom and asked with big puppy dog eyes, \"Can I put Michael in a pajamas?  It's not playing if it's for bed.\"  Your mom chuckled and gave her approval.  With that you lifted your arms and let Stella help you out of your princess dress and put you in a purple silk night gown.  \"Thanks sis,\"  You said giving her a thumbs up for her clothing choice, she glowed with happiness before she jumped into bed with you in her clutches.  Your mom turned out the light and kiss Stella goodnight.  As you drifted off to sleep you thought about what you were going to do tomorrow, after all with that Remote of Swapping you could do and be anything.  Maybe you'll spend another day as a doll?  Or maybe you'll switch with Stella and play dolls for the other end.  Or hell you could make yourself a potted plant if you wanted the possibilities were endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be the start of a wonderful relationship.\"  You said thinking of the remote as Stella hugged you tight against her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A grin was plastered across your face as you began to scroll quickly through the list, glancing at each option that flashed past. The idea seemed a little too crazy, but this remote was nothing if not crazy, and so, you endeavoured to keep Barbie's body, but turn it into real flesh. Beyond the obvious reasons a teenage boy might want some time with a real-life Barbie's body, you were also just starting to feel a bit perturbed by how little feeling your plastic body had. It hadn't hampered you in moving about, but it still seemed a bit unsettling that you couldn't feel much below your neck. You could barely even feel the dress you was wearing. Sure, you could just take your own body back, but you were more interested in Barbie's at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much, much scrolling, through which you managed to spot several weird and interesting options you'd be interested in trying out later, you finally saw it; \"Material\". Wasting not even a second to consider whether or not it would actually do what you wanted, you immediately dragged it over to the image of your head on Barbie's body. The moment you let go, the image immediately change. Gone were the visible joints and plastic sheen on Barbie's body, and instead smooth human skin coated her form. Just as you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this left you with the opposite problem now. Though the image showed that Barbie's body would become human flesh, not it showed that your head would be made out of plastic, looking like someone had made a doll in your likeness. You doubted you'd find options to only swap the material of your head, so you'd need to come up with a different solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, there was an easy solution right in front of your. Along with the image of your doll-ified head atop a real-life Barbie body, there was also the image of Barbie's head on your body. Scrolling way back up to near the top of the list of traits, you located the \"head\" option. The only issue was that last time you tried swapping heads, it kept your mind in your own head and placed it on Barbie's body. This time you wanted to keep your mind with the body you had and place it inside the new head. You did have an idea for that, though. When you swapped onto Barbie's body, you'd dragged the \"head\" option onto the image of your own body. This time, you dragged it into Barbie's, or rather the image of Barbie's head on your body. You hoped that would work, but if not, you could figure it out from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confirm,\" you said aloud, unfreezing time. Almost immediately, you found yourself hit with all sorts of new sensations overcoming you. Part of it was just having feeling again after having been plastic all afternoon, but it was also different to what you were used to with your old body. The relatively large breasts hanging from your chest, the incredibly thin waist, the void between your legs, even smaller things like the longer hair hanging from your head. It was all a bit much to take in at once. Following your teenage instincts, you slowly reach up to your new breasts and give them a tentative squeeze. The sensation sends a shiver down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" you moan quietly, noting that your voice seemed to have changed to one befitting your new head. Presumably the material swap gave Barbie's head read vocal chords that you were now using. After your initial squeeze, you manage to contain your urges, knowing that you still had to get back to Stella's room before dinner was over. You were still considered a toy, after all, even with your new \"human\" body. You were even still doll-sized, while a life-sized doll replica of your old body now sat upon your old bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way back to Stella's room, feeling your hips swaying and your breasts lightly bouncing with every step, you come across a somewhat embarrassing realisation; you weren't wearing any underwear underneath your dress. Stella had completely stripped you before pulling the dress over your head, and the Barbie body you'd possessed had been completely naked, not even having any sort of underwear design drawn on. This left you walking back down the hallway with your new sensitive nipples rubbing against the silky fabric of the dress, and the skirt of the dress occasionally flitted a little too close to the unprotected area between your legs. Your face was bright red by the time you made it back to the room. As you climbed the stairs of the doll house Stella had previously put you in, assuming that this was where you lived now, you couldn't help but hope Stella had some doll-sized underwear somewhere in all her Barbie clothes. Otherwise, this was going to be a rather embarrassing affair for you all around. Not that you were considering undoing it, of course, you were having too much fun for that. You might just have to use the remote to borrow some else's underwear if it became a bit too much for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it back to the bedroom of the doll house, you can't help but admire yourself in the mirror. You looked stunning, a perfect replica of what Barbie would look like if she were a real person. If it weren't for the fact that you could feel every curve of your body, every swish of your dress and hair, every little movement, you'd scarcely believe what you were seeing. This all felt incredible. As your eyes wandered down your princessly outfitted form, you couldn't help but wonder how much time you still had before Stella got back from dinner. Perhaps you had enough time to have a look beneath the dress, and check out what was for the time being your body. Raising your gaze back up, your eyes locked onto the remote, still clasped in your dainty, feminine hand. This thing was absolutely amazing, and as much as you were already starting to enjoy being a real-life Barbie doll, you couldn't help but glance in the mirror at all the other things sitting in Stella's room. Maybe there'd be time for another swap or two, just to see what else you could do?</span></div></div>",

Ensuring you had the remote in your pocket you told your mother you'd be going out of the house and you'd be back before dinner. As you walked over to Avril's house your mind filled with ideas as to what you could do however they were cut short when you approached the front gate, looking past the gate connected by lush green hedges you saw their three story house, given the facilities most would call it a Mansion but after the weekend you spent with Avril at her families beach house last year you knew that this house was meek and modest in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the buzzer on the gate you heard a female voice emit from the speaker, you recognised it to be Maria, the Macavoy family's Maid. \"Hello who is this?\" she asked \"Hi Maria it's me Micheal, I'm here to see Avril\" You explained, \"One moment\" Maria replied. Then the gate was opened allowing you in, as you walked up the driveway you saw Avril sitting on a bench playing catch with her toy poodle Missy. They both quickly noticed you and Missy ran up to you excited to see you and Avril gave you a hug, \"How are you?\" Avril asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing well\" you replied, \"So what's the occasion?\" Avril asked \"Did you want to do anything in particular while you were here?\". </span></div></div>",

You were trying to decide who to swap with. Avril was a prime candidate, as she was your girlfriend. She was attractive, kind, smart, way out of your league, but for some reason liked you. Pushing open the door to her room, you were always amazed at the size of it. Neatly organized due to Maria\u2019s hard work, you sat on the edge of the bed and petted Missy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I would swap with you?\u201d You whispered, looking at the poodle. Then you glanced out the window. Avril\u2019s sister was out swimming in the pool. She was a year younger than Avril and puberty had been kind to her. She was really hot, if not a bit stuck up. Avril\u2019s mother was also sunbathing out in the open, so you had two more targets. Avril's mom was a stunner and the rumors she had surgery to make herself more attractive seemed probable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fell onto the doll on Avril\u2019s dresser. She told you about that one once. It belonged to her Grandmother before it passed away and she really loved the old fashion doll in the white dress. A valuable porcelain doll, though she would never sell it. That doll was super important to her.

Your excuse was, however, good enough to get you to leave you alone for now though, as she left your room and returned to whatever it was she had been doing before you got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that sorted, your attention returned to the remote. You had only pressed the button once, just checking whether or not it worked, but you'd never selected a target or actually swapped yet, and you were rather eager to try it out. However, before you could do that, you needed a target. But who to choose? Being home, you had your family at the ready to be swapped with if you so wished, but now that the opportunity was right in front of you, none of them really seemed like an appealing option. Swapping with your male family members seemed a bit boring, and while swapping with the girls would be a bit more interesting, you'd feel a bit weird about any of the fun stuff you could do just because they were family. No, you needed a different option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to your bedroom window, you looked around at the street outside, hoping someone would catch your interest. Unfortunately, while there were a handful of people milling about this afternoon, most didn't seem like an appealing option for a swap to you, and the couple that did were strangers rather than neighbours, which would leave you little hope of reclaiming anything you swapped once they walked away. You let out a sigh, deciding that you may as well just test the remote on your family for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you can turn away from the window, a loud yapping noise catches your ear. Directing your attention towards the source, you find a small, fluffy dog barking as passersby from a nearby yard. You didn't know the people who lived there, as they'd only moved in recently, but you'd seen their dog on the way to school a few times. Normally you didn't pay much attention to it, but seeing it now gave you an idea. With a curious smirk on your face, you click the button of the remote, and time draws to a halt. Ignoring the other people in the street, you point your finger at the dog, wondering if it will work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching you by surprise, a trio of holographic screens suddenly appeared, being projected by the remote. The centre screen gave a list of options, presumably things that could be swapped, while the left and right screens displayed images of yourself and the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...This thing works on animals,\" you mumbled to yourself, stating the obvious. A wide grin starts to spread across your face. Your options had just increased tenfold. Swapping with your family suddenly seemed like a much more boring option than it already had, now that a much more interesting proposition had presented itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what to swap though? Perhaps you should start simple, one or two body parts perhaps. You could only imagine how you'd look with dog ears and a tail, let alone how it would feel. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity though, or at least it would have been had you not a remote that would let you do this whenever you wanted, so why not go big? You could take the dog's whole body if you wanted, experience something no human has ever experienced before. Of course, you did need to be a bit careful, you needed to make sure you could still use the remote after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the options, you found that you need not necessarily swap something physical. Personal information like names, belongings, social status, and so on and so forth were listed, giving you yet more options. You could trade your clothes away to a dog and walk around naked if you wanted. The most enticing of these, however, was an option labelled \"life\". If you had to guess, that option probably allowed you to live the life of whoever you were swapping with. If you used it now, everyone would see you as a dog, specifically your new neighbours' dog, even though you'd probably still have your own human body. That would certainly be an interesting way of getting acquainted with your new neighbours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you need not necessarily swap with this dog. You didn't know its name, gender, or even the people who owned it. You knew the remote worked on animals now, so why not go find an animal you knew? Your family didn't have a pet, but who knew people who did. Heck, you could even plan a trip to the zoo if you wanted. Then again, why limit yourself to animals? You now knew the remote wasn't limited to humans, who's to say it wasn't just limited to animals either? You were sure you could find something else unorthodox to swap with beyond this dog. However, before searching for a new target, you'd need to decide whether or not you wanted to swap anything with this dog, and if you did, what swap you'd perform.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to go big or go home, you opt to leave your body alone for now, and instead drag the \"life\" option over to to the picture of the dog. The moment you let go, the figures suddenly swap places. Rather than simply switching sides, though, the dog is now standing on its hind legs, wearing the clothes you were currently wearing, while the image of you was now naked, and down on its hands and knees. You debated taking something else from the dog while you were at it, but decided this would be enough for now. If you wanted more from the dog, you could always wait until you saw it again. After all, the dog belonged to one of your neighbours, so even if you stayed in its life, your old life would be just across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confirm,\" you said aloud, your heart racing as you anticipated the swap. In an instant, the world suddenly fell away, almost sickening as your point of view was moved somewhere else. You suddenly found yourself outside, staring at one of the people on the street as they walked by. For whatever reason, you felt the urge to shout at them, but suppressed the urge as you had other things to worry about. Like the fact that you were now crouched down on the ground on your hands and knees, though thankfully you could still feel the remote grasped within your hand. Stranger than your new pose, however, was the fact that you could feel the grass tickling your legs, and a breeze blowing across your entire body. Glancing down at yourself, you find the obvious reason for it; you were naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" you mumble, fighting the urge to cover yourself up. Or at least, that was what you tried to say. It ended up coming out more like a dog-like growl. Your eyes widened at that revelation. \"I guess I can't speak normally anymore,\" you bark to yourself. Strangely, you could still completely understand the words you were saying, even if they weren't coming out in English. You briefly wonder if that means you'll be able to understand other dogs now, and what it means for your ability to understand humans, but that was something to worry about later. Because right now... \"It's worked!\" You jump around on your hands and knees like a dog wanting to play with someone. The remote had worked, not that you doubted it after it had stopped time and brought up the holographic displays, but there was something exhilarating about that that that the world likely saw you as a dog now. Maybe being a dog wouldn't even be that good, but the fact that you could do it at all was exciting to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to stand up to get a better look at your surroundings, but find yourself oddly compelled to stay down. You could could stand on just your legs if you wanted to, but it felt uncomfortable to do so, like you weren't used to standing up anymore. Ultimately, you decide to you just stay on all fours for now, seeing as the grass was comfortable enough on your hands. The yard seemed mostly the same as it previously had from your window; a few shrubs dotting the edges and some dog toys strewn around. The biggest change appeared to be the dog house, which had grown to account for the fact that you were a good deal larger than the small fluffy dog it had once housed. You wonder how comfortable it would be to sleep there. You'd probably find out tonight if you didn't swap into a different life again before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding you may as well check out your new accommodations, you crawl your way over towards the dog house, finding it a little awkward to walk on all fours while still carrying the remote. Perhaps you'd need to perform a swap to give you access to pockets again later on, but for now it wasn't too big an inconvenience. Before heading to the dog house itself, you briefly stop  at the water bowl in front of it, glancing down at your reflection. To your surprise, reflected on the water's surface is not your own face, but rather that of the dog you'd swapped with. The reflection did its best to mirror or surprised expressions with its doggy features. You supposed that must be how people saw you now. At least that'd be helpful if you swapped with another human later on. You could only imagine the difficulty you'd have trying to look good to everyone else as a woman if you only had your male body as a reference. Moving on from that, you approach the dog house again, only to stop as you see the name plastered above the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Princess!?\" you shout, surprised by your new name. That didn't sound like the name of a male dog. You quickly glance between your legs to confirm that your little buddy is still there, and thankfully find it is still hanging there. \"So, I'm a girl dog, but my body is still a boy?\" you mumble to yourself, dog-like barks still coming out of your mouth. You weren't sure how to feel about this. Sure, the idea of becoming a woman may have been exciting, but you didn't know if you wanted to be a female dog. On one hand, it shouldn't really matter what gender you were, a dog was a dog, but on the other, you felt like it might be a little much being treated like a dog and like a girl all at once. At least for now, perhaps it wouldn't feel as strange once you were more used to swapping all over the place with the remote. Besides, there were plenty of other things you could swap with now that you knew the remote worked on animals, so why stick to this one life you felt a little iffy about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance back over at your house across the street, up at your window, only to find it deserted. You growl to yourself in annoyance. The dog in your life obviously had no reason to keep staring out the window now that it didn't have the remote, so it must have gone back inside to do something. Now you were in a predicament. You silently curse whoever decided to not give the remote an undo button. You briefly pondered what you should do next. You could always just stick to Princess's life for now. It wasn't like being a dog was uncomfortable or anything, you just felt a bit weird about being a girl and a dog and having a human, male body all at once. Then again, it wasn't as if you needed to go from Princess's life directly back into your own. You may be stuck in the yard as Princess, but there were still a handful of people walking down the street. If you swapped with one of them, you could go knock on your door and hopefully swap back with yourself that way. Heck, you could probably even just wait for one of your family to walk outside and swap with them. Sure, whoever you swapped with would be stuck as a dog for the time being, but it wasn't as if they'd notice any difference. You look down at the remote still grasped firmly within your hand, shivering slightly in the breeze as you wondered what you should do.</span></div></div>",

Without Heather's envy of her motherhood there was no reason to be playing with who she now saw as her baby brother. James began to crawl around the house, now seen as the eldest son he didn't need to be supervised so he began to explore the house unimpeded by your mother. Heather put a stop to Kevin and Stella's fighting and they went to their respective rooms soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and your dad finally stopped arguing and went their separate ways instead, that left only you and Heather in the room. Heather began playing games with you taking glee in the process, enjoying playing with who she believed to be her baby boy. The games were hardly entertaining though, it was simple block stacking and make believe stuff that became boring relatively quickly. However, to your Benefit Heather stopped the games so that she could complete the new 'motherly duties' that now fell on her shoulders. \"come on Micheal, i need your help to bring in the washing\", She stood up and offered you a hand up despite you not needing it and held your hand as she walked outside grabbing a basket from the laundry on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was interesting how she had adapted to the new changes, she knew what she had to do and she made it work. For example, she couldn't reach the clothes on the clothesline so she had you take them off and pass them to her so she could fold them and put them in the basket. To her this was routine and for you it was at least more entertaining than the simple games you were playing earlier. Once you were finished taking everything off the clothes line Heather looked up at you \"do you want to play on the swing set?\" she asked. This prompted you to look over at the swing set in the corner of the back yard, it had been there for at least a decade but was still in relatively good repair considering how much it had been used. \"Sure\" you replied walking over and sitting on the only seat you could fit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather spent immense effort and time trying to push you on the swings to no avail, she apologized for this saying that \"mommy isn't as strong as she thinks she is\" which honestly didn't surprise you but you appreciated the effort. Heather led you inside struggling with the heavy clothes basket and began to sort them in the living room, turning the TV on for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV was set to cartoons, mainly reruns of stuff you had watched as a kid so you attempted to let nostalgia take over so you could appreciate it to varying success. Something grabbed your attention however, Stella in Kevin's body ran down the stairs to see your dad who was working on a case at the dining room table. She ran over to him with her Barbie that was dressed like a flight attendant and showed her off. \"Daddy look at Barbie she's a pretty flight attendant!\", This elicited an eye roll from your dad who no longer cared enough to pretend to be interested. \"It's not the best job ever but hey the uniform is cute\" he said returning to the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis piqued your curiosity. You reached under the couch and found the remote, this situation could result in some interesting swaps, you thought to yourself.</span></div></div>",

You had a look at some of the options, to your surprise you found that occupation was an applicable option, this could result in your dad becoming a flight attendant and Barbie would become a lawyer. There was also the physical option, making some physical swaps between your dad and the barbie, perhaps making him a woman or causing him to become a plastic woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were the less physical options such as social status and position within the family, it would be interesting to see a barbie be the patriarchal head of the family.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing there you looked at the displays in front of you and considered what to swap between them until eventually deciding upon swapping their professions. It shouldn't be too much of an issue and you could always swap back if need be. You scrolled through the options until you saw professions dragging flight attendant from Barbie's list to your dads. The displays changed showing your dad in the blue uniform with pink highlights as well as barbie in a suit jacket, button up shirt and business pencil skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished you spoke aloud 'confirm' and saw the differences, your dad was now no longer working on a legal case, he was now looking at his lists of flights he had to work on. The conversation between him and Stella had changed too. Changing from him belittling barbies vocation to yearning for it, this amused you immensity and you could tell this would be an interesting sight at dinner. Soon enough Heather was finished sorting clothes and put them in piles in the basket for later distribution, \"Micheal could you help me with dinner\" she asked. You nodded and got up to help her, once in the kitchen you found her moving a kitchen stool to the sink with a handful of potatoes in a bowel. When you joined her she asked you to grab the box of macaroni and cheese, as well as some assorted vegetables. You helped her by doing what she asked (which wasn't much mainly moving things for her) and it hit you, mashed potatoes, salad, macaroni and cheese. These were all the things she actually knew how to cook, she didn't know anything else because mum hadn't let her help with much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough dinner was ready, it wasn't an amazingly creative dinner but it was something. The first thing you noticed when everyone sat down at the table was seating arrangements, Dad, Hannah, Stella and Kevin hadn't changed where they sat but the family members who swapped had changed where they sat. As usual Dad was at the head however either side of him were now Heather and James instead of your mum and yourself, next to heather was Hannah and Mum sat next to her, Then Kevin was sat next to James. Your position was weirdest of all, James usually sat in a high chair between mum and dad, you were still in a high chair it was just the most in-proportionate chair you had ever seen made to accommodate your large frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner had started Heather asked your dad \"so when will you be off on your next flight?\", \"In two days\" your dad replied in a disappointed manner.</span></div></div>",

Luckily though dinner was finished soon enough, Heather had you help her clean up afterwards and you all gathered in the living room to watch TV. Heather paid special attention to you while everyone sat likely due to her feeling she had to look after you due to her new status within the household. Soon enough Everyone got tired or their Bedtimes came up and every one went to their rooms, you were lead to your room by heather which was for the most part unchanged except your bed had safety rails on the sides that had a child safety lock on them. Some other things had been made 'safe' for you but nothing major, Heather tucked you in and offered a bed time story which you declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you woke up at 7am, much earlier than normal. Disabling the safety lock on the rails you got out of bed and looked through your wardrobe, it was all James' clothes. You were still wearing a diaper too, although you didn't need it. Staring at the clothes that had all changed to fit you, you put on a T-Shirt that said 'strong' with some arms coming from either side of the word and a pair of pants over the diaper. You walked out of your room to see Heather in James' room struggling to help James put on your old clothes. They eventually did it but when they did Heather saw you and immediately started fretting \"how'd you get out, it's not safe\" you simply shrugged it off which while calming her a bit didn't stop her whining. \"want to help me with breakfast?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting a repeat of dinner Micheal ran to grab the remote and the aimed it at both mum and Heather, activating it then dragging over cooking from the skills section, then your curiosity was piqued, maybe there's something else you could swap that would be interesting.</span></div></div>",

You got curious so you dragged it over to Heather from your mother and then the display showed something rather funny, Your mum and Heather were quite a contrast before the swap, Heather had really short legs and your mother had legs for days. Now that had swapped, leaving your mum 4' tall and raising Heather to 5'1. They had swapped from the stomach down. This was too hilarious to not see for real so you spoke aloud 'confirm' and now suddenly your mum was below your shoulders and your 5 year old sister was just above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather no longer needed constant help in the kitchen only asking for your help to grab things from higher shelves, and she was actually making a pretty good breakfast of bacon, eggs and pancakes. Your real mother on the other hand was struggling to get up onto her chair at the dining table. Eventually you made your way into your odd high chair and waited for dinner to be served, Nobody noticed anything out of the ordinary except you and it was hilarious. Then an idea popped into your head, you could do the same with James, hell you could do it for your whole family.</span></div></div>",

You were short, James was 2'8 before the swap, you couldn't be taller than 3'10 now. James on the other hand probably was 4'10. Additionally you could no longer walk, so you had to crawl like James did. Crawling made everything seem so much bigger, you spent a good while crawling around taking everything in and before you knew it you were being carried into the car to drop everyone off at school.</span></div></div>",
