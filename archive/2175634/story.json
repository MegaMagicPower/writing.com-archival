Pi-ka-chu~! Pi-ka-click!\u201d It didn\u2019t even make it to three rings before an excited hand reached out from under the covers and shut it off. Excitedly, those blankets were thrown up in the air as a excited little zangoose boy leapt out of bed, anticipating the day ahead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed happily over the bathroom, brushing his teeth in the mirror with a cute comic book-themed toothbrush. Of course, there was a warm yellow spot in the front of his diaper, indicating that he\u2019s wet himself overnight\u2026 but that was normal! He didn\u2019t let it bother him as he marched happily down the stairs, walking up to his much larger zangoose mother. \u201cMorning, mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, sweetheart!\u201d She smiled, giggling when she turned to him. \u201cDo you need a change, sweetie?\u201d Of course, Kyle happily nodded, and his mother happily lifted the little guy up and carried him over to the changing table, where he liked to relax while his mother changed his diapers. \u201cAre you excited for your first day of school, Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, super duper excited! I\u2019m gonna make so many friends, and learn, like, a bunch of stuff and things!\u201d He smiled, his eyes sparkling with excitement. \u201cOooh, and give me one of my special diapies!\u201d His mother smiled with a little roll of her eyes, but still slid one of his \u2018special diapers\u2019 on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were even softer, thicker, and poofier than his regular diapers, and had all sorts of cool colors and patterns on them. They were too expensive to wear all the time, since he\u2019d need new ones for every time he messed\u2026 but on his first day of school, he wanted to make a good first impression!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she\u2019d dressed him with a cute, poofy diaper colored with his favorite comic book characters, she led him by the hand to the kitchen. \u201cAlready have breakfast prepared for you, sweetie. Your favorite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled brightly, seeing the breakfast laid out on the table. \u201cAw, mom! You\u2019re the best!\u201d She cooed happily, ruffling his hair as he hugged her hip. With that, he planted his comfy, padded rump down on one of the chairs to happily chomp down on his breakfast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he was all ready for the morning, with his backpack on his back, his lunchbag held in his hands, and of course, his perfect diaper ready to impress all the other kids with its sheer poofiness. \u201cHave fun at school, sweetheart!\u201d His mother smiled, leaning down to give him a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe! I will!\u201d He smiled, giving her another hug, before he had to finally run out the door to catch the school bus. \u201cBye mom! I love you!\u201d She stood in the doorway, waving at him with a warm smile on her face, as he ran excitedly to the school bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a bunch of other kids, all wearing big, poofy diapers just like his! They weren\u2019t going to have to worry about that boring potty training stuff until at least middle school, after all. Excited, he goes and sits down next to a...</span></div></div>",
