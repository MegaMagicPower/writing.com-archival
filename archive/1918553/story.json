But what are these weird buttons?\u201d With that, Ash starts to dust off the remote, but accidentally brushes against one of the buttons, setting off a blinding flash. \u201cWaaah!\u201d Ash exclaims, startled by the large flash as he falls over. Iris and Cilan, seeing that Ash has fallen over, stop to help him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh what are you doing, gosh you\u2019re such a child!\u201d Iris says to him mockingly, folding her arms. \u201cOh yeah? Well... Sigh... I got spooked by that light, that\u2019s all\u201d Sharing a confused glance with Iris, Cilan lifts Ash to his feet. \u201cWhat light Ash? What are you talking about?\u201d Confused, Ash starts to dust himself off. \u201cWhat? How could you not see it? There was a... Never mind\u201d he mutters, not wanting to argue. He looks over the remote one more time before slipping it into the back pocket of his jeans, only to find that there was no pocket to slip it into. \u201cWhat in the... WHAT THE HECK!?!\u201d Ash exclaims, as he notices his outfit for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than his usual clothes, he finds himself now wearing a complete set of Iris\u2019s clothing! On his torso he finds a very loose, cream top, with long flowing sleeves that ends in pink cuffs, as well as a pink collar. Her skirt is tied tightly around his waist, and he can feel the tight feeling of leggings clinging to his legs. His usual shoes are replaced by Iris\u2019s pink and yellow runners, and he can feel hair clips in his hair. Along with all of this, he can see his chest tenting out slightly, as he realises his chest is being supported by her bra, and that the discomfort he was beginning to feel in his crotch was from a pair of rather tight, but lacy panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did this happen? Why am I in your outfit Iris?\u201d He exclaims, trying to cover himself. \u201cUhh... I don\u2019t know what you mean, we\u2019ve always dressed the same? And that couldn\u2019t be one of my outfits, we\u2019ve checked before, I\u2019m too many sizes smaller than you for you to fit in mine.\u201d Iris replies, somewhat worried for her friend. \u201cMaybe we should take a break for a while and get you out of the sun, Ash\u201d Cilan suggests, highly confused. Internally freaking out, Ash agrees as they set up camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over himself again, Ash can\u2019t help but blush. \u201cThis is insane, how are they not freaked out by this?\u201d He thinks to himself. \u201cThis all started after that flash from... the remote...\u201d he realises as he looks over it one more time. \u201cThere must be a way to reverse this...\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking over the remote in his tent, Ash slowly starts to piece together what some of the buttons do, taking notes as he goes.. \u201cAlright\u201d he thinks to himself, \u201cThis button is labelled \u201cC\u201d so that must be Clothing. There\u2019s a B on this one... That could be... Body? This little thing can swap peoples bodies? I\u2019ll have to test that. P... Maybe personality? Or part? Whatever, I\u2019ll find out. There\u2019s a U on this one, no idea what that could be, L could be life..\u201d After a while Ash is fairly confident that he knows what most of the buttons do, but he can\u2019t think of a way of getting is original outfit back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf the clothing button works by copying somebody else\u2019s outfit, then how am I meant to get my own clothes back?\u201d He mutters to himself, as he sits uncomfortably in his new clothes. Looking himself over, he\u2019s amazed at how naturally Iris\u2019s outfit fits his body. Each piece of clothing must have been readjusted to his body, but he\u2019s still embarrassed to be wearing something so feminine. He lifts the front of his skirt and can see the outline of panties underneath his leggings, along with a rather prominent bulge. \u201cIf these are meant to be my own clothes, why are the panties so damn tight\u201d He sighs, as he readjusts his junk to sit comfortably in his lacy panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile checking himself out, he can\u2019t help but notice how the leggings show off his ass quite well with how tight they are. \u201cAww man, if this is what these leggings can do to me, I can only imagine how they make Iris look under that skirt of hers... Skirt of ours\u201d he snickers to himself, though the thought of Iris\u2019s ass turns him on slightly as he sees a bulge pushing out the front of his tight, white leggings, which causes him to blush. \u201cBad thoughts Ash, bad thoughts. These panties are tight enough without being turned on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his \u201cissue\u201d settles down, Ash makes his way outside to eat his lunch, thinking over what to do with the remote. He notices that Cilan and Iris are keeping an eye on him to make sure he\u2019s alright after his fall earlier, but he keeps them from talking about it too much. \u201cOh by the way Ash\u201d Iris says, \u201cI have that set of underwear you let me borrow, they were a bit loose but they did the job.\u201d Ash was stunned, does he share clothes with Iris now? \u201cNo.. No problem Iris, have I got anything of yours you need back?\u201d He asks, feeling his hard-on coming back, though his skirt is covering the majority of it. \u201cI think that some of my clothes might have been mixed in with yours, but that\u2019s about it. Oh! And my swimsuit, but I don\u2019t need them back right away\u201d Iris says with a smile. Blushing quite a bit, Ash nods and excuses himself from the table, making his way back to his tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, clearly this remote has changed things more than I thought\u201d Ash thinks to himself. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to get my own clothes back, but I don\u2019t want to just leave it at this. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find a way to change back, but I\u2019d rather experiment than wait until that happens\u201d Pulling the remote out of his bag, he looks over it one more time. \u201cI\u2019ve already come this far, so if I have to switch with anyone I might as well switch something with Iris. I could switch with Cilan, but switching with a guy wouldn\u2019t be a big change.\u201d He says to himself, as he pokes his head out the door. He sees Iris putting away her plate, takes aim, and presses one of the buttons.</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s tryyyy this one!\u201d Ash says to himself as he scans through the buttons, eventually settling on the button marked B, guessing that it would switch their bodies. \u201cI\u2019m already dressed like her, might as well make it so her outfit fits properly\u201d he chuckles to himself as he activates the remote. Once again he is met by a blinding flash, which eventually fades, revealing that his entire body has been replaced by Iris\u2019s. \u201cI guess I was ri-\u201c he stops himself mid sentence as he realises he has Iris\u2019s voice now too! \u201cTesting, testing. I am Ash from Pallet town, Iris is such a child.\u201d He giggles to himself, finding it slightly disturbing to hear himself giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back across at Iris, he sees that her body has also been switched with his, though her clothes have stayed the same. \u201cHuh, maybe because I actually targeted her this time she was included in the swap? I still don\u2019t have a way to get my clothes back though\u201d He says to himself as he looks over his outfit again. The major difference he can feel already is how much more comfortable his outfit is on Iris\u2019s body, her panties are no longer riding up because of his penis, and her leggings feel a lot more form fitting on his now feminine legs. He also realises that he no longer has to deal with erections renting out his leggings, which is a bit of a bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking slightly, he lifts up the back of his skirt to reveal Iris\u2019s firm, toned ass. \u201cDayum, I knew she was hiding something good under that skirt\u201d he says to himself, as he briefly gropes his ass. Pulling out the front of his top and glancing down, he is a little bit less impressed by her breasts, though still gives them a quick squeeze. How can Iris deal with this hair!\u201d Ash says to himself as he pulls his ponytail infront of his face. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m carrying around a second person here!\u201d He says, laughing slightly. \u201cOh well, it\u2019s just the price I have to pay for fashion\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of his tent, Ash stretches out his new body before making his way over to Iris and Cilan, who are getting ready to leave.</span></div></div>",

Not knowing any of their functions, he randomly pressed the blue button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Ash felt very different. His perspective had shifted slightly downwards and he noticed weight in areas were there had been none before, namely his chest and the back of his head, and yet other parts of his body felt lighter. Irritated by the new sensations, Ash took a peek at his chest and was shocked to see two mounds on his formerly flat chest. Taking a hand to his chest to confirm whether this was actually real, he noticed his now smaller, feminine hands and the darker and smoother skin that now covered them. Upon seeing these changes, Ash got a suspicion of what had happened and needed to confirm it. He reached behind his back and felt... hair, a lot of it. This was enough to confirm his suspicion, he had actually turned into Iris. Then it dawned on him, there was one area of his body he still had to check for changes. Not daring to look, he pulled his hand away from his hair and slowly moved it towards that part. Once he reached it, realization hit him, now her, like a ton of bricks: she was actually female now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally managing to look downward again, she notices that, oddly enough, she was still wearing her own clothes, only re-sized for Iris's, now her, body. Looking back at where Iris was standing, Ash saw that she, now he, was in her original body, wearing Iris's clothes re-sized for Ash's body. However, it seemed that Iris was completely oblivious to what was going on as she was still talking to Cilan, who also seemed not to notice anything. Seeing this, Ash came to the realization that this remote could alter reality. By pressing that button, Ash and Iris had swapped bodies and reality was adjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was amazed at the power the remote in her hands held and was eager to see what she could do with it. Thinking back, she remembered that when she pressed the button, she was aiming the remote in Iris' direction, so this must be how the target is selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wasn't sure how she should go on from here. Unfortunately, she couldn't remember which button she pressed to swap with Iris, so if she wanted to swap back, she had to guess.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash was currently on his way to Pallet Town with his friends Iris and Cilan after their long journey together in the Unova Region. He was keen to introduce them to his mom and to all of his other Pok\u00e9mon at Professor Oak's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had stopped to make camp for the night and Ash had walked off to see if he could find some more berries for Cilan's stew, when he saw something strange on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh; what is that?\" said Ash as he leaned forwards and picked it up. It looked like a TV remote with many strange buttons. \"That's strange,\" muttered Ash. \"Why is there a remote out here in the forest?\" Out of curiosity, Ash pressed one of the buttons on the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the exact moment that he pressed the button, Ash thought he heard the sound of one of his Pok\u00e9balls opening, but didn't put too much into it as the bright light that suddenly streamed out from the remote completely engulfed him, forcing him to shut his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was then hit with the oddest sensation. It felt as if he was being pulled through a vacuum-cleaners tube, spinning around in a wide circle before being spat back out again. Oddly enough, he felt somewhat 'compressed', for lack of a better term, upon his 'exit' from the pulled-through-a-tube feeling. In fact, his entire body felt very strange to him now. But the strangest thing was that those feelings seemed vaguely familiar to him. Before he could dwell too much on this, he noticed through his still shut eyes that the bright light seemed to have gotten less bright. Opening one eye slightly, Ash could see the light was indeed rapidly dwindling in strength, before vanishing completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that Ash noticed when he fully opened his eyes was that everything seemed to have grown much bigger. The surrounding grass, the trees, and even the small rock that had been right beside him looked absolutely massive! Ash looked very slowly at the enormous flora in front of him before he looked down and noticed another odd thing: the ground seemed to be much closer to him than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" mumbled Ash. \"How come everything looks bigger now? And what is this thing in front of my face?\" It was only now that Ash noticed something green and triangular, obscuring a bit of the lower part of his line of sight right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to shake his head to make it go away, but sadly it didn't help. It was almost like it was attached to him. \"Well, that didn't work,\" said Ash in an annoyed tone. Before he could say or do anything else, he heard a loud outcry of shock from a Pok\u00e9mon. He recognised the cry as that of his Snivy, before another loud sound occured somewhere a little beside him; it sounded almost like a phone being broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Snivy; where are you?\" called Ash. He was a bit confused at how Snivy could have gotten out, until he remembered the sound of a Pok\u00e9ball opening when he hit the button. Maybe it was some kind of tool to activate Pok\u00e9balls from far away? Ash didn't speculate too much about it right now; it sounded as if his Snivy was in distress. \"Snivy! Are you alright?\" he called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sni-vy!\" sounded the reply. Ash noticed that it sounded both shocked and frightened at the same time, but the oddest thing was that it sounded as though it came from somewhere above and behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy?\" Ash called out as he turned around to look for Snivy, expecting her to be somewhere behind him. But it wasn't Snivy that he saw. Instead, Ash found himself staring at an enormous pair of red high top sneakers. \"That's weird,\" said Ash in confusion. \"Those sneakers look just like mine, only bigger... Hey; wait a minute,\" said Ash as he got a better look at the large shoes in front of him. \"Those ARE my sneakers! But, how did they get so big? I couldn't have shrunk, could I? What just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh trailed off as he suddenly remembered why the feeling from before was familiar to him; it felt just like it did when he had temporarily swapped bodies with a Pok\u00e9mon Ranger named Jack Walker, thanks to a Manaphy using it's Heart Swap move! As a feeling of nervousness and a dawning realization entered Ash's mind, he slowly began to look further upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's gaze moved slowly up past a pair of black baggy jeans, to a blue and white hooded jacket with a golden zipper, before finally looking up at... his own face! His own face wearing his distictive hat staring horrified at his own hands with the black fingerless gloves! As he looked up at the enormous version of himself right in front of him, the feelings of realization and nervousness from before were magnified tenfold within Ash's mind. Swallowing a lump in his throat, Ash nervously called out to the huge version of himself: \"Snivy; is...is that you?\" The giant copy in front of him turned its horrified face downwards to look at him. \"Sni-vy-vy! Sni-vy!!!\" came the reply from his body. There was no doubt about it; it was Snivy's voice that came out of his body's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an increasing sense of dread, Ash swallowed another lump in his throat before looking down at himself. Instead of seeing his human body, Ash saw a tan stomach and a small pair of spindly legs in the same colour! His arms weren't human anymore either; they were instead small, green and leaf-like with only three 'fingers' at the end! As he looked behind him, looking past a yellow, collar-like protrusion on his neck, he saw a green and yellow tail with a three-pronged leaf at the end of it! As Ash became aware that the green thing in front of his face was actually a green snout, his nervousness turned into full-blown horror, while the dawning realization turned into an awful certainty: THE REMOTE HAD CAUSED HIM TO SWAP BODIES WITH HIS SNIVY!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!\" yelled Ash terrified. \"I'm a Pok\u00e9mon! I'm Snivy! Snivy is me! I'm you and you're me! We're each other!!!\" Although Ash was completely freaking out over having swapped bodies with a Pok\u00e9mon; Snivy, although just as terrified as Ash was, managed to stay calm while observing her former body fall down and thrash around in a total panic; although she did fall down on her new, human butt from the shock. It took a full minute before Ash's flailing about made him short of breath, forcing him to calm down as he gasped for air. After he had regained his breath, Ash looked back up at his former body, still seeing the terrified and shocked look on his former face. \"Sorry about that, Snivy,\" he said. \"You must be just as scared as I am.\" Ash saw his former face shift from an expression of terror into a nervous smile. \"Sni-vy-vy-sni!\" Ash managed to give a nervous smile back. Snivy always managed to stay calm, no matter what situation she was in... Ash blushed as he suddenly became aware of another thing. \"Oh, great! I'm not just a Pok\u00e9mon; I'm also a girl! No offence, Snivy,\" he quickly added. Snivy began to blush as well, while also giving a reassuring: \"Vy-vy! Sni!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash clumsily stood up on Snivy's thin legs, he tried to remain positive. \"Okay; so the strange remote caused us to swap bodies,\" he said while trying to keep his balance. \"So, all we have to do to return to normal is to just press the button again. I think.\" Ash looked over at Snivy who was currently busy with getting used to moving her human hands and fingers. \"Snivy, did you see where the remote ended up?\" As Snivy turned her new face to look at him, Ash became confused as his former face took on an expression that could only be described as 'guilty'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy; what's wrong?\" asked Ash. \"Sni! Sni-vy-vy! Sni!\" she replied in an apologetic tone before moving her new arm to the side. Although she wasn't yet used to having human fingers, Ash knew that she was trying to point at something lying beside Ash's sneakers. Ash felt another wave of dread overtake him as he suddenly remembered the smashing sound he heard earlier. Hurrying over to the spot Snivy was pointing at, falling down a lot due to his tiny new legs, Ash's fears were confirmed; although it was still whole, the remote was clearly broken! \"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Ash before looking over at Snivy. \"Snivy; that remote was the only thing that could swap us back to normal!\" \"Sniiiii...\" cried Snivy sadly, making Ash's former face look like it was about to cry. Ash mellowed out at this; it wasn't like she'd done it on purpose, after all. The shock of suddenly being inside Ash's body likely caused her to drop the remote by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Snivy,\" apologized Ash. \"It was an accident; I know that now.\" Snivy's new face began to liven up a little, but Ash could see that she still felt guilty over having broken their only means of returning to normal. \"Don't worry, Snivy,\" Ash told her. \"The remote is still whole. Maybe Professor Oak can get it working again and swap us back.\" Ash saw his former face brighten up considerably. \"Vy! Sni-sni-vy!\" Snivy hapily exclaimed. \"But, we can't let the others know what happened; exept for Pikachu, of course,\" said Ash. \"Until we get that remote fixed, we're going to have to pretend to be each other. I'm not sure how we can hide our voices, but I'll think of something.\" He looked up at his former body. \"Think you can pretend to be me for a little while, Snivy?\" Snivy's new face got determined as she nodded. \"Alright!\" exclaimed Ash. \"But first...\" he looked at his new leaf-like arms, \"I think we should try and get used to our new bodies.\"</span></div></div>",

There's only one city, with the rest being countryside, farms and Poke-Ranches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a paragraph about the vast beauty of it all, how the horizon of each hill made them wonder what lied beyond it, how the open fields were so green with life that the colour touched the very soul, how there were wild Pokemon roaming in the dense woodlands and alongside the flowing river - but why read that part aloud when our heroes Ash, Misty and Brock, standing atop a great hill, could see it all with their own eyes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll like this part, Ash.\" Brock continued, \"Apparently there are some rare Pokemon in this place, even ones that aren't from Johto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy fistpumped whilst searching the horizon for the first place to start. \"Sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The PokeRanches are something else, too. Their care standards with pokemon are very high. Some ranchers make special ingredients that are used in the world's most expensive skin, hair and beauty-care products.\"<br>\r\n\"The most amazing, you mean!\" Misty added affably. \"My sisters use that stuff all the time. Just rub its shampoo in your hair and it'll be silk-soft in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Ash, deadpanned, \"from Brock's description I thought it was something valuable.\" The boy rolled his eyes in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr, dumb little boys like you can't appreciate anything that isn't piggish, can you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault if girls can't do anything valuable with their free time!\" Ash retorted, and the two locked glares against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd call 'not smelling like garbage' to be pretty important, thank you.\"<br>\r\n\"Or end up smelling like a completely different kind of garbage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to be that narrow-minded then you shouldn't even be allowed to hear about nice things!\"<br>\r\n\"It would sure save me a lot of grief!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy, you two, there's enough to do here for everyone.\" Brock rested a hand on both their shoulders. This wasn't the first fight Ash and Misty had over something 'boyish' or 'girlish', and Brock knew it wouldn't be the last. Why couldn't they appreciate both things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, you and I can see if we can get a discount on some of those brands in the city, and all three of us can find out first-hand some breeding techniques the ranchers use. That's something we can all enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then Pikachu and I can find some nice Pokemon to catch!\" Ash cheered. What kind of Pokemon were there to catch? Bug types? Steel? He couldn't wait to find them.<br>\r\n\"Let's hold on, Ash, we only just got here.\" Misty said, putting a pause to her friend's passion. \"There are ranches out here, remember? How do we know which Pokemon are wild and which ones belong to someone?\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? We can just use the pokedex to tell which--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great clopping sound on pebbled ground distracted Misty from whatever he was moaning about after that. Behind them was a giant carriage, being dragged by at least six spirited Ponyta moving at a breackneck pace, and the three friends were right in its way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked, they each dove out of the way to the side of the road, avoiding injury by an inch. But an angered Ash was quick to his feet, and before the carriage was far away, shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's the big idea?! You almost trampled all over us, you rude jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had hoped whoever was inside had heard him, and when the charging carriage came to a sudden halt, he guessed so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut stepped from the carriage a butler, who opened the back door for a tall noblewoman, dressed in high-lifestyle clothing, wearing far too much makeup, and with her long black hair sharpened and extravagantly stylised. Ash would have been fighting back laughter at how ridiculous she looked if he wasn't so angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to him very closely, and it was clear how she towered over them all, even Brock. \"Who are you, little child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was a little intimidated by the gravitas in her voice, but he did not back down. \"Ash Ketchum, from Pallet Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what did you just call me back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought you were really inconsiderate, the way your carriage just charged at us like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heave so great that a shampoo bottle dropped from her pocket, the lady slapped him stingingly across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you! Could you not tell that you were at fault in that situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh would have continued the fight, but he was busy trying to fight back the tears from that slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me now, but anyone would have agreed that you weren't fair then!\" Misty shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" The noblewoman clicked her fingers, and on cue came barging out of the carriage a policeman and a pair of Growlithe.  The dogs quickly began barking and sniffing the trio, while the policeman stood dutifully beside the noblewoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Police Deputy Chief Harrington, what did you think of my butler's driving there?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was absolutely exemplary, Madam Thornsworth!\" The policeman cheerily complimented. \"I'm sorry, but you youngsters had no business being on an open highway like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought this was a minor footpath...\" Brock's wispy skepticism, however, was lost on everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, you're the Madam Janet Thornsworth?\" Misty asked. \"My name's Misty. My sisters run the Cerulean City Gym, and we're big fans! We use your products on us and our pokemon when we wanna look and feel extra good, it's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thank you, young lady: I do so love to hear from my company's fans. If your friends behave, I might show you around my mansion. Perhaps you can show me just how much more beautiful your Pokemon are thanks to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's eyes were wide with excitement, and Brock seemed happy about the idea himself. As everyone but Ash knew, Thornsworth's ranch was a ranch in name only - it was a massive company with factories dedicated to beauty, and its clothes lines were big hits among fashionistas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, thought Ash, through a dismal stare. This woman was not only a snob who feigned concern for others, but a rich one whose friends and even the law were eating from her hands. Why couldn't it have just been an ordinary jerk, instead of someone with a lot of influence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you looking at me so disdainfully?\" Madam Thornsworth snapped him out of his thoughts. \"Straighten up! Look at the person you're speaking to right in the eyes. Pleasantly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the demand, Ash corrected his posture and tilted his boyish chin up at the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We rarely ever see travelers in these parts. We see spies trying to steal my ranch's secrets, and thieves, and plenty a poacher, though! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a Pokemon trainer, ma'am. All I wanted to do today was adventure, make new friends and catch some Pokemon while I'm at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch Pokemon, on my land?? I knew it! Thief!\" She exploded with fury. \"You were planning to steal from my ranch! Arrest him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?!\" But Ash had no time to defend himself, and the Growlithe had already jumped on him and pinned him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" Misty pleaded. \"This has got to be just some big misunderstanding. Ash may be a simpleton, but he is my friend and he'd never steal a Pokemon even if his life depended on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Madam Thornsworth mulled it over. \"Perhaps you can convince me of this...at my own personal mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She gasped gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this a wonderful treat for you all? Except for you.\" Thornsworth glared at Ash, \"I dare not trust you near any of my prized Pokemon just yet. You will visit the premises once I tell them to call you. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded meekly, hoping it would be over with soon. That way, Misty could have her fun with all her girly stuff, and he could go exploring with Pikachu--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this little fellow simply must join us!\" She heartily swept down and grabbed Pikachu with a titan's grip, making the poor mouse to yelp with fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hey!\" Ash objected, but the Growlithe pinned him down again, and he fell down on his backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ash,\" said Misty. \"I'll drill some sense into her head. Pikachu will be just fine.\" Yet as soon as she'd said that, she ran right up to Janet's luxurious carriage as though the two were best friends. \"Oh man, this is so comfy!\" Ash could hear her cheer inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably won't be that much fun without you.\" Brock bent down and left the brochure by his side. \"Good luck with those Pokemon, okay? But be careful about ranch-owned ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Brock was sincere with his concern for a friend, he would also meet Janet's beautiful niece Larissa inside the carriage, and a very familiar story would ensue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his friends left, Janet afforded one more look at him, and smirked. \"You know those Growlithe are only pups? I'd have expected a poacher, much less a man, to be able to keep on his feet against them. My own niece plays with them, and she's far less bulky than you. Or actually, now that I look at you, you're scrawny enough play dress-up with her!\" The old woman laughed haughtily. \"Until later, little child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deputy recalled his Growlithe into their pokeballs, and by the time Ash got to his feet, the carriage was blitzing across the tiny path once again, leaving him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. Some luck he had - if Misty and Brock weren't there, he wouldn't be able to stop himself going after Pikachu and causing trouble. But he could count on them, so he could wait a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now he could get started on catching Pokemon! Perhaps a nearby rancher could give him advice on where to look. Ash just hoped that not all ranchers out there were as mad as that lady was - he'd had enough bad experiences for one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around him to gauge where to start first, he noticed a bottle on the ground - the one that Thornsworth had dropped when she smacked him. Holding it in his hands, it had the picture of a young girl at the back among the ingredients, and its front depicted a ranch setting with the label \"Robin Ranch Hair Gel\" adorned above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was this on the bottle? Was this ranch nearby somewhere? And why did Thornsworth have someone else's shampoo bottle when she made her own?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl Ash had seen on the bottle was actually out in the open fields that morning, and while she was a rancher in name, today she was like a shepherd, taking care of her flock of Mareep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a spring in her heeled step, frolicking over from sheep to sheep, and checking each one to make sure it was happy. They all were, of course, and each one had a vibrant shimmering fleece, so wonderfully cared for that rubbing it was like touching silk, and her fingers ran through it like it were field of barley. It was so pristine you could mistake them for being shiny types, but they were all normal Mareep - just well cared for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Mareep's fleece built static electricity: when they felt defensive or careless, they released this electricity at the source of their discomfort. But in Melanie Robin's company, they always felt safe. She knew each one by name - from Francina to Paul, from Little Henry to Jolly Sarah - and they knew her by sight, smell and touch. She gave them the best care that a person could give, and any static they had stored only left a warm, tingly sensation when she rubbed their fleece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so soft that Melanie could sit down, bury her head into it, and think for a while. But lately, Melanie's thoughts were about how hard she had to work as a rancher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else had help on their farm, but despite Melanie's attempts to reach out she was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day she looked after the Mareep, after the Miltanks, and the Bellossum, and all the other Pokemon on the ranch.<br>\r\nEvery day she picked berries off of all the trees she had grown.<br>\r\nEvery day she had to mix her ingredients so she could ship her products to stores where they'd get ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet no one heard of her stuff, and she barely got by financially. All she had to show for it was exhaustion; after a great many days like this, she desperately wanted a vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere nice, like Olivine City, where she could lie at the beach. Or go see a concert. Or go make friends her age, who'd share her interests. Or just quietly bask in all the attention her cosmetics would get if people paid attention to them like they did Thornsworth's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to be anywhere other than a big field, watching Mareep as they graze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait, how much time had passed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. She had dozed off! At the one time when she took all the Mareep out to a field far from home. Snapping back to reality, where her glove-laced hands were still in a Mareep's fur, she rose up and did a quick head-count.<br>\r\n\"Five, ten, fifteen, eighteen, nineteen...\" She lost her breath. There was one missing. \"Where is the last one??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie wanted to scream. Looking around frantically for him, she noticed that the stray Mareep - Little Henry, by the looks of it - had already wandered into a faraway field, close to to the nearby wild forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull of wild, fierce Ursaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzzing, poisonous Beedrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthless, creeping Ariados.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd other scary Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie ran. She held her cutely styled cane as tight as she could, as if that would make it alright, and ran hurriedly after the Mareep, petticoat rustling all over the place as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had made it to the end of her field, had pushed the open gate further aside, and was bolting over the bumpy, terrain of dried earth. Little Henry was looking at the forest now, but if she called out for him now she'd be able to--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--trip on the ground and lose her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurses! She moaned. She was losing time! (And she'd only just cleaned this dress.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the dangerous sound of a lightning bolt somewhere up ahead helped her onto her knees, and she was back on her feet in no-time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet in the no-time that had passed, the Mareep had been attacked by a young boy and his Cyndaquil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use Ember!\" Ash shouted, and Cyndaquil spat hot blasts of fire at his opponent. The shiny Mareep was too frightened to move away from the attack, and took it head on with a cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was surprised - this Mareep was strong, after all. A wild pokemon with electric attacks at this high a level shouldn't be knocked down so easily, but it was so injured by a simple attack that it looked ready to be caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it in place with a leer while I catch it!\" Ash ordered, and Cyndaquil leered so threateningly at the wild Pokemon that it quivered and stammered from anxiety. Ash pitied the creature, but once he caught it he could take it to a Pokemon Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Go away!\" The cry of a teenager not much older than him stopped Ash just as he was about to throw his pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl ran up to them, tapping down on the ground with a prettily stylised shepard's cane to keep her footing. She wore a wide-brimmed hat above her golden blonde hair, which was done up in a ponytail with two bangs spread across her forehead. Her skinny legs were adorned with long white stockings, her slender hands were veiled by white silky gloves. Her white dress was puffy by the shoulders, with thin green stripes running down to the double layered petticoat, and had a pink diamond in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had never seen such a dumb getup in his life. But he recognised her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're that--\"<br>\r\n\"Leave Little Henry alone, you big bully!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie swung her cane at him. He ducked under it by a hair's breadth, only for her to swing again in a great flurry. The shepherd swung with the speed of a master fencer, and the fury of an angered bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Ash pleaded as he ducked, leaned and backpedalled out of harm's way. With each swing she came ever closer to leaving the boy crying with pain for the second time that day. \"My pokedex says this is a wild pokemon: that's why my pokeball can work on it. You must be mistaken--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl landed a blow to his gut, and Ash tumbled backwards onto his backside. Melanie held her cane to him like the tip of a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Poachers. Allowed here!\" She shouted. He opened his mouth to beg her to listen...and she stopped mid-swing. But not because of anything he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her head at a large creature, whose shadow had just cast itself over Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an Ursaring. A family of Ursaring. Tall, bulky, fire-breathing Ursaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been riled up from the forest by the ruckus they had made, and they did not look thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tallest one roared loudly at them, and spewed a Flamethrower attack at Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, in his panic, scarcely rolled out of the way, and scurried to his feet at a running pace. He looked around - the field was now full of a flock of mareep on the other side, all of whom had followed the shepherd here, and Cyndaquil and Little Henry had stopped fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Melanie was left lying on the ground, as the large bear pokemon drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Ash, in his haste to escape, had knocked her down, without even realising it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really was an idiot, wasn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie's foot had been injured, and now she was looking in fearful awe at the Ursaring. Even if she were physically able to move, she was terrified by the sight of the bear Pokemon. Their flea-ridden smell was suffocating her nostrils. And why did her whole flock follow her here where it was dangerous?? Her distraught mind was like frozen jelly, wobbly yet immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one Ursaring drew close and raised its sharp claws for an attack, Ash ran back, grabbed Melanie and dived safely to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyndaquil, we've gotta go!\" Ash cried, cradling the shepherd girl bridal style, and ran into the flock of mareep. All the Mareep, Little Henry included, were so terrified by the poacher and the Ursaring that they bolted with the fury of a herd back the way they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was close to the other field, but the wild bear Pokemon were giving chase with rising fervour, embers gathering around their sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, where's a safe path??\" Ash asked Melanie.<br>\r\n\"My ranch, just keep running straight!\" She shrieked, clearly disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran to the next field, surrounded by Mareep, but the bear-like pokemon were getting too close for comfort. A few more seconds and they'd be in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ash got an idea. \"Cyndaquil, use smokescreen!\"<br>\r\nUnderstanding the intent, the fire mouse spouted a black gas from his mouth, passing behind him and surrounding everything behind him, namely the Ursaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened with a second wind, Ash sprinted even faster, and he and Melanie were long gone by the time the Ursaring got their bearings back.</span></div></div>",

He slanted forward, willing himself to inch forward.  His shoes and pants were drenched with water and his shirt was soaked with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we lost them.\" Melanie informed him, looking worriedly at Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Ash had earned his great sigh of relief. \"Can I set you down now?\"<br>\r\n\"I, uh...alright.\" Truth be told, she liked the feeling of being carried home, but she let Ash put her down and she leaned on her cane. They began walking ever so slowly forward, and with Ash getting his breath back, now was a good time to clear some things up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Ash Ketchum, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Melanie Robin. Talk about a gut-bumping first impression, eh?\" She chuckled, and Ash chuckled along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm new here: I didn't realise that Mareep belonged to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't realise you were actually a kind boy who'd run back to help me.\" She added. \"Don't sweat it; no one can know everything all the time, right?\" She beamed brightly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was suddenly aware that Thornsworth and Misty were right - the ranchers didn't tag their Pokemon as wild or trainer types, so any Pokemon he met out there might be a vital part of someone's ranch. He had been unthinking and uncaring - things he should never be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm training to be a Pokemon master. I only got here recently, but I heard about you, I meant to say. You sell shampoo or something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie widened her eyes. \"You've heard about my work? Thank you! What's your favourite? The hair gel? The apple juice? The skin cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Ash said defensively. When he saw the frown on the blonde girl's face, he scratched the back of his neck. \"I mean, I only heard of them. I didn't buy them.\" He didn't really care about whatever girls fussy over their looks did, but after the clashes with Misty and Thornsworth he could do with one less angry girl for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does a pokemon ranch have to do with shampoo, though?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I make lots of things there, with some unorthodox techniques!\" She began with enthusiasm. \"My Pokemon help out by supplying really special ingredients you can't get anywhere else! Some perfumes and anti-perspirants from Victreebels and Chikoritas, herbal mixes from Bellossoms and Oddish with some dabs of Miltank milk, and my lovely Mareep,\" she patted Little Henry there and then, \"use their electricity to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped. All of a sudden, Melanie and Ash were aware of one important thing. Asides from Cyndaquil and Little Henry, not a single other Pokemon had followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are my Mareep??\" She gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, they didn't follow us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They normally always follow me, but we're not normally chased like that! Or so far away from the ranch!\" Melanie's knees were shaking and her whole petticoat began shaking. Some shepherd she was: who had ever heard of a shepherd girl that lost her sheep, and didn't know where to find them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rested his hands on her shoulders. \"Don't panic. I'm confident that they're safe. Cyndaquil's smokescreen protected them too, and they were outrunning the Ursaring comfortably.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Ash thought guiltily, maybe the smokescreen was a big reason why they got lost at all. \"Maybe if we leave them alone, they will come home, bringing their tails behind them!\" He said optimistically, but who was he kidding? That wouldn't happen even in nursery rhymes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go back for them!\" Melanie was already turning around to sprint, but the moment she started she began to fall, and Ash barely caught her in time. In her numerous trips that day she had injured her foot, making it hard to use her cane for anything more than a crawl's pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but you need to go back and rest. Where's your ranch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just over there.\" She pointed to an idyllic ranch across a river stream five minutes away. Over a small arching bridge, there were two houses, a ranch a barnhouse, a fenced-in farmland field and a small lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing that I was praying, as it looks like something out of my imagination.\" Ash acknowledged, and, carrying a worried Melanie once more, helped her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You know, your foot might be better if you didn't wear heels.\" Ash suggested, earning himself a slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Robin's Ranch' was as pleasant and quaint inside as it was outside. Its barn and Melanie's house felt old, though it's obvious Melanie had made some modern updates. The third building looked to have been built comparatively recently, and with light machinery for all sorts of tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie had several chores to do that day, but Ash and his Pokemon had insisted they see to the task instead. Totodile watered the grass Pokemon; Bayleef befriended the lake Pokemon and fetched clean water; Heracross was keeping watch over the barn and performing the brave task of learning how to milk a Miltank; Phanpy collected ripe berries by headbutting their trees. Between them, Melanie's exhausting day of chores had been broken down to an easy, manageable sum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fenced field, which used to be filled with Mareep grazing and playing, had only poor Little Henry standing alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie looked at him wistfully through the window. She couldn't even say anything, as Ash handed her a cup of tea. Melanie had changed out of her fancy dress into something less dirty: a simple black shirt and blue skirt. Walking about was proving painful, she told Ash; there was no way she could get the Mareep by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was just as dismayed. \"None of this would have happened if not for me.\" He sighed. \"I attacked Little Henry. I got those Ursaring out of their forest. I got you hurt and the flock frightened away while trying to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his fist into his open palm and boldy made a promise. \"Well I'm going to get them back. Every last one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really mean that?\" She turned and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded, and Melanie jolted out of her seat to hug him. \"Thank you thank you thank you!\" She sounded overjoyed, and her sadness from a second ago was now just a distant memory - but the pain in her ankle was not, and she quietly sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send my Noctowl out to go look for them. He can find some and bring them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't work. My Mareep have never been trusting of many people or Pokemon except me. After what happened, I'm afraid they'll be extra frightened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll go to them. Don't worry, I'm great at bonding with Pokemon.\" Ash fondly remembered many adventures he had befriending Pokemon in the wild. \"It'll be a cinch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Melanie watched as Ash went out the door and into the fenced field. She watched as Little Henry shook at the sight of the boy, who slowly approached him with kind words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as, the moment Ash got within ten feet of him, the Mareep fried him with a great bolt of lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched Ash back off and try again, and again, for far too long. (It was kinda hilarious to watch, actually.) Eventually, Little Henry gave chase, and electricity pursued him all the way as he jump the fence, burst through the door and slammed it shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme tell you,\" The dusted and blackened boy panted through his pain, smoke rising from his hat, \"whatever you do with them works. I'm used to getting electrocuted...but that Mareep hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie wracked her head for ideas. What could they do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mareep distrusted Ash because he tried to catch one and cause this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were perfectly comfortable with Melanie, yet Melanie couldn't go exploring for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo if there was only one person they'd warm up to, but only one other person who could go out and find them before things get worse, then...what if the other person were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea the fashionista in her relished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she knew that Ash was not going to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie?\" he asked worriedly. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, my friend. I know what to do.\" Melanie, grinning with mischief, told him. \"I just got a very pretty idea.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You should know a thing or two about Mareep.\" Melanie began, as both she and Ash walked through her refinery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough 'refinery' was a glorified term compared to the giant buildings that industrialists and big farmers had: this was just a place where she stored the mixtures she made - and had a massive bubblebath when there was money to spare. Still, Ash could hear the humming from each engine and boiler, and he could imagine how noisy it got when this place was busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, they get timid when afraid, but since most Mareep have to fear predators, their senses of smell, sight, touch and hearing are excellent. They also remember faces very well, and I...don't like saying this, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--I caused a lot of trouble and scared your flock away,\" Ash humbly admitted, \"and I'm going to get them all back. Don't worry. So I bet you have a way around this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. We just have to change a few tiny things. Nothing drastic.\" She lied. They had to change his appearance entirely, into something the Mareep would find much more lovable. But why tell this unsuspecting boy everything at once when she could spring one surprise after another?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie eyed up her model: Ash was about as tall as her. He had a fair bit of black hair on his head, though not as much as hers, and it spiked out messily to the sides (endearingly so, but that wasn't what they needed). While he was in rather good shape, his skin was rough and brittle from years of travelling. Also, he smelled, and that had to be fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a lot of work to do. And a lot of changes to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to fix was the touch. Melanie's Pokemon were used to her soft touch, one she had cultivated using some skin cream she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, to make it I combine some Sunflora oil with the sleep powder from a Vileplume, then give it an electric charge so it won't induce sleep, add some berries for nutrition and for--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh found it difficult to keep up with her, yet he was enthralled all the same - he didn't know how Melanie, who could only have been two years older than him at most, was such a science whizz. Did everything she say check out? He was bored by what she used it for, yes, but the way she worked with Pokemon to create it was fascinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Did you get all that, Ash?\" <br>\r\n\"Eh, yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, the cream she used was great, if Melanie could say so herself; it left the skin softer and slender than before. Apply it twice a week, and it paid off in under a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were on a tight schedule, so she just filled an entire tub with it and mixed it with mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way it's both a moisturiser and a mud-bath!\" She beamed. The side-effects couldn't be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Ash, wearing only his boxers, stammered in his step when they reached the small pool. \"Are you sure this is safe? I can just have a shower and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie shoved him in before he could finish that sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just as nice!\" She assured the boy, who sank with a ceremonious 'plop'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could add some bubbles if you like!\" The girl hollered, but Ash was busy spitting mud out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got out five minutes later, the first thing Melanie had him do was shower off, and when they did they could see he had fortunately not grown a third arm or any horrible conditions like that. But his skin had turned as soft as a peach. His hands, rough from years of travelling across forests, mountains and oceans - now they were so light that he could get a papercut from mishandling a letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, you did come out good.\" Melanie stroked his hand all the way up to his shoulder. \"I should try that treatment myself sometime!\" Ash winced when her nail poked against some skin, and Melanie backed off. \"Though I might make it two minutes instead of five next time. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh couldn't say he was pleased. He tried touching the palm of his hand himself - he wasn't just soft, he was skinnier. He'd heard that mud baths had that effect, but his arms and legs seemed at least a size smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I supposed to be smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that? Don't worry about the skinny thing, that wears off in a week, easy.\" She said nonchalantly. Though Ash was feeling nervous; life is so much easier when people don't fuss over looks, but Melanie was making him fret about it. Was this how girls felt all the time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute, he was comparing himself to girls. That train of thought needed to crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's done,\" He said almost dismissively, \"I can try again with Little Henry. Where are my clothes?\" He looked around the room, but there wasn't anything to wear nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put them in the washing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? I still need those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were sweaty! Your shirt stunk like a Grimer!\" Besides, she smirked, they wouldn't work for what she had in mind. Oh hoh, definitely not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now before you change, let's work on your body odour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rancher readied one of the worst things she could have shown Ash - a bottle of perfume from behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one in all of Agria that day recoiled with as widely opened eyes as Ash did when he the bottle pointed straight at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait!\" He pleaded. The memories of Celadon City and its perfume-ridden shops came flooding back. He'd gone so long since a perfume incident that he'd let himself get vulnerable; just glancing at the bottle made him shiver!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be shy.\" The blonde innocently insisted, completely naive to Ash's hatred of perfume. \"I wear this stuff all the time: everyone on the ranch is used to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not touching that stuff, Melanie! Give me anything else, but not that! Anything else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired boy backed briskly away, but Melanie cornered him against a wall, and squirted the contents all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon the first puff, strong, sweet sensations of pomegranates, persimmons and lotus blossom filled the air. The odours clung to his body with each squirt of the bottle, and the smell overpowered his nostrils, crawling up through them and clouding his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh fell unconscious on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next minute, Cyndaquil, busily working on the ranch, was baffled by the sight of Melanie carrying his semi-nude trainer, unconscious, out of the refinery and into her house. But at least he smelled nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nWhen Ash came to, he found himself sat down in a chair before a timber, six-drawer kneehole, with a mirror and many a cosmetic set up beside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're awake!\" Melanie beamed. She was bent down beside Ash, her face visible in the mirror. \"That only took you twenty minutes. See, I knew you were a real trooper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Trooper' was an appropriate word, as Ash felt shell-shocked. He could barely make sense of his surroundings. He guessed that this wasn't the refinery - perhaps it was Melanie's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if I overdid it with the perfume. I guess it was pretty strong. Try closing your eyes for a while if you feel woozy still, but you should be fine, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, he wasn't, because he still stunk of it; he couldn't breathe without feeling how 'nice' he smelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had to get his thoughts together. There was still a towel strapped around his waist, the black-haired boy was wearing a vest that was loose, airy and suspiciously soft. Strange: where did this come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what about his reflection in the mirror seemed so odd to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, what are you doing to my hair?\" Ash asked. The rancher was running her hands through his damp hair, occasionally rubbing fingers in place. She hummed a soft song as she worked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just working.\" She said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my hair?\" Oh great, something boring. With something as dull as a a hair job happening, Ash didn't even have to worry about staying awake, so he let his weary eyes drop shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's a good thing you used so much of my special shampoo; it's making this a lot easier. Hair takes a lot of work to get right, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No it doesn't.\" He dismissed. \"I've never done anything with it in my life and I got on just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no duh. But if you want great hair like mine, you've got to take good care of it. You've gotta comb it, shower it, treat it--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't.\" The boy bluntly cut her off. \"You don't have to be pretty and gentle to enjoy life. Just let it be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie frowned, and Ash could tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like fashion very much, then.\" She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" He dismissed her a third time, and that left Melanie quiet. Ash frowned a little too; stupid though this was, this mattered to her. Why not let her enjoy it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said suddenly, with renewed spirit, \"let's see if I can't change your mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe.\" He said half-heartedly: he couldn't blame a girl for trying, even if it was for a lost cause. This trainer had been in enough tough battles to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, Melanie hummed a little song to herself as she worked, a favoured nursery rhyme of hers. Ash had paid little attention to the technique, but gradually more of his focus returned to his senses. \"What are you trying to do, anyway?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm easing your hair out so it grows better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, grows??\" That got Ash to open his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn't notice first, because he couldn't believe it; as clear as day in the mirror, his hair had grown in volume. He had always had a big head of hair, but it had grown drastically into a spiky bush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steady, steady, we don't want to harm anything.\" Melanie now had taken out a comb, and began stroking the hair into shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you do that??\" Ash couldn't contain his amazement. This just plain didn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, Melanie couldn't contain her pride. \"It's that shampoo you used. I owe it all to my Pokemon. I give some special nutrients to Sunkern, get them to trade them back in exchange for proper food, and mix those with some Lum berries and Staryu cells--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Sunkern can do that?\" He thought Sunkern would only conserve their nutrients; what Melanie had said wasn't even in the Pokedex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" The rancher went on to explain her unorthodox techniques in depth, as she continued to comb and Ash shut his eyes again. Whenever Ash came across a scientific term he didn't know about, she told him. He was amazed by how much he learned about Pokemon he thought he knew so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something people all over the world would buy into. Why weren't they interested?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you told me a little about your travels.\" She changed the subject. \"Do you really think you'll be a master one day?\"<br>\r\n\"I try my best! If I keep working hard, I will be eventually.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm envious. I wish I could see the places you have. You must have made a lot of friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have, but none that have been good ranchers and hair stylists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm good? Aw, thank you!\" Ash didn't know any hair stylists, but it was nice hearing Melanie in good spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I was a kid I've had a big interest in both taking care of Pokemon and in beauty care. When my Dad got too old and retired, I left the city life and took over the ranch: with a few changes, I made it a good chance to follow both passions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But doesn't that give you a lot to do in a day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ash, you have no idea!\" She chuckled bitterly. \"I'm left working until late at night all the time. I always felt I could use some help, but this place is just so poorly known, I could never find anyone; nor can I take the time out to go spread the word.\" At this point, Melanie glanced at her watch; the hair dye effect of the shampoo should be kicking in at any moment - though she doubted Ash caught that detail on the back of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets lonely here. I'm just hoping for a lucky break. If only I had a sister or someone to split chores with, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh pondered how odd that sounded. Robin's Ranch wasn't well known? That surprised him; hadn't he seen Thornsworth with that bottle of hair gel? That must mean someone valued her work. Did Melanie not know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, she had other bottles, like hair dye; did Thornsworth buy those too? But he was about to lose his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaand done! Wanna see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ash had opened his eyes, his hair was so different, the sight of it almost knocked him off his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar black colour was gone, replaced with a striking blonde like Melanie's to the roots, as yellow as a daffodil. His spiky, untamed hair had been tamed to fall delicately straight behind his head, stopping wavily by his shoulders. The hair to the side of his face grew to his neck, where it began to curve elegantly inward to the chin, framing his face angelically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt even lighter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt flowy, it was smooth and the tips of his hair tapped soothingly against his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a style perfect for a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it made him want to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo, I feel very proud of that, let me tell you!\" The hairstyling girl beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a girl's hairstyle.\" Ash muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie found it adorable how he couldn't shake off the frown on his face. \"Oh, you just look precious. I love how it curves to your chin: it makes you look like an angel!\"<br>\r\nShe leaned down by his side, lifting the hair behind him up and down. When she let go, it fell back perfectly to the way it was before, as if it was its natural state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is a girl's hairstyle!\" He squealed uncharacteristically. This didn't suit him at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe compared her ponytail to his bangs for good measure. \"I know, right? We should go shopping sometime!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even joke about it!\" He fumed with closed eyes, and Melanie giggled in cheeky defiance. If he just loosened up, he'd be able to have fun too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we can change this back, right?\" The formerly raven-haired boy asked, looking for a pair of scissors. He suddenly cared very much about what Melanie did with his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, but that's not important right now.\" Melanie cheekily told him, surprised he hadn't figured out the plan yet. But she was right: now he could go off and find the Mareep, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now-blonde boy stood up, finally free to move about. Clarity was returning to him, with the hair job done and the perfume out of his mind, and he found himself with many a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you give me such a girly hairstyle, anyway?\" He asked. \"Or this girl's blouse?\" Oh no, had he been wearing a blouse this whole time?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, feel this.\" Melanie handed him two palmful's worth of Mareep's wool, curled into a ball. It was sensational to the touch, warm, fuzzy and vibrant all at once. Ash would be smiling if he weren't so suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I holding this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then passed him a bra, just large enough for each ball of wool to fit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I holding that??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie then opened her wardrobe for him to see, and he finally caught on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heck no! Just no! I refuse! You are not getting me to</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl couldn't contain her giddiness as she sat by her bed, waiting for the dressing room door to open like it was Christmas morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to come out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never.\" The voice behind the doors grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to come out sometime.\" She sang. \"Might as well be now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the door opened, and Ash slowly inched out, looking completely different to how he went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was wearing heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was wearing stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was wearing a bra, a blouse and a wide-brimmed hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was wearing Melanie's dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a different dress to Melanie's, which was now in the wash, in that the lacy stripes on his were pink instead of green. But it was still as white as snow, and still puffy by his shoulders, accentuating his new hairstyle. The double layered petticoat arched down to his knees, moving along with every step he took, shaking with each swerve he made. And of course, it had that loveable purple diamond shape stitched into the center, right where the balls of wool inflated his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's face was bright red like a cherry with embarrassment; the cherry at the top of a beautifully decorated cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just...it looks so...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Melanie was able to say before entering the mother of all gigglefits. Arching back and rolling on the bed, she laughed long and loudly, so loud that she could be heard outside, so much that tears were coming out of her eyes. The sheer sight of him(?) was just priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean, I knew I was good, but wow! You're adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde trainer just whimpered audibly on the spot. This couldn't be happening. It was all just a dream. He wasn't being laughed into oblivion right now. Any second soon, he'd wake up in his sleeping bag at a camp. In his proper clothes, with a proper hat, with proper underwear, and a real shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if it was real, he'd run back home and hide in his bed forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're prettier than me! I swear, you're prettier than me!\" The girl kicked her legs wildly against the bed in her joy. Even when she was laughing so uncontrollably that she fell off the bed, she kept giggling as she picked herself back up, dusting off her black shirt and blue skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her laughter ended (but the massive grin on her face was there forever), looking at Ash gave her another opinion - he looked like a delicate flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you remind me of a flower. Your hair's soft and yellow like a daffodil, your face is full and red like a rose, and the way you stand there, rooted, is like a shrinking violet! Isn't it wonderful to be so many pretty things at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going out like this.\" He whined as soft as he looked. \"I'm not.\" The effeminate looking boy was already inching back inside the changing room when Melanie grabbed him by the puffy shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you haven't seen how fabulous you look yet!\" She turned him towards the mirror, but he immediately tucked his head into his bosomed chest. His elegant hair and wide hat obscured his face completely: between them, not an inch of his face could be seen no matter which way you looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie took one look at this veil and let out a baw. That was the most precious pose she had seen in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" The rancher told the meek trainer, and stepped three paces in front of him. \"Take all the time you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only said this because she was now using her phone to take pictures of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Ash heard the first flash he shot his head up and gasped openly, only to provide a perfect shot of his beautiful face for the second and third one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's too much!\" Ash cried, and ran over to her to make her stop, but in the very first step he took he tripped over his high heels and landed on his back side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear: you still need to work on your posture.\" The girl was sniggering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're going to delete those, r-right?\" Ash stammered, too unused to unwieldy high heels to get back up, too flustered by his petticoat to get his bearings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't knooow,\" she winded him up, \"you came out awfully well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" he cried: he could not let Misty and Brock see him like this again. That one time at Celadon was bad enough. \"With all you did, I can't even recognise myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, so you do like how good a job I did!\" The rancher teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ash blushed as bright as a rose, completely flustered. He constantly stammered whatever else he wanted to say at that moment, but never got it out. Melanie was twisting his words, right? He didn't actually just say that, did he??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie offered him a hand, but Ash did not take it; his mind had just cracked. She had to bend down, grab the well-groomed boy by the elbow, and walk him back to the vanity table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, there just one more thing...\" And when she looked at his face, she saw it - those bolted cheeks of his. Melanie wanted to cover those, so she took some blush and dabbed a brush in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn't protest for the first time that day: he just looked defeatedly at the mirror. He had no idea what to do and it was all he could manage to keep from panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little, I promise.\" She patted down his quivering cheeks with blush to give them a hazel hue. She couldn't obscure the bolts at all like she wanted, but perhaps they were part of the charm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh hadn't said a word: he had only quivered. \"Ash?\" Melanie asked, but he didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered what to do. She didn't want to hurt his feelings too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also wondered if he'd be even cuter with some eyeshadow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis part was completely useless to finding Mareep, sure, but Melanie hadn't done anyone's makeup since she was eight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got some brown eye shadow ready, and Ash closed his eyes like a decorated automaton when her hand drew near. When he opened them again, his eyes had a soft, smokey look to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl was right: he did look cuter. Since he hadn't said anything, he clearly didn't mind doing more, right? Right! So what else could he use?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome mascara, she thought, and she took some out. Without argument, Ash let her define his eyelashes, without a single smudge around his eyes; Melanie just hoped the boy wasn't going to cry anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be wearing my gloves,\" she noted, since they had been dirtied earlier, \"so you get a chance to show off your nails to everybody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" Ash croaked, and Melanie could hear the faint 'don't' shortly after. But he clearly meant to say 'Please, don't wait: I need to look fabulous!' She took out some blue nail varnish anyway. The girl held one of his hands in hers and painted away: in a moment, he couldn't look at his impeccably soft hands without noticing a deep cerulean blue on the tip of each finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie decided to quit pushing her luck; that'd do, for now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaand you're done. Perfect, even.\" The fashionista eyed her model from top to bottom. His skin was sublime, his scent was splendid, his face was glamourous, his puffy petticoat dress was fabulous, and his lengthy gold hair was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you feel?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn't look a thing like himself. He looked nothing like the boy who would one day be a Pokemon Master. Instead, he looked completely like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you turned me into?\" He mewled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" she mulled it over, \"how about Ashley Robin? My lovely sister from out of the country, who finally came over to visit? And is now going to help me find my Mareep while I'm recovering? That cover has a nice ring to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay...\" Ashley moaned.</span></div></div>",

The owl Pokemon met Melanie by the window, but she asked him to wait outside; 'Ashley is nervous and needs some time to come out', she had told him. It was easy to forget, with all that done, that Ash still had to go find Mareep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie slowly walked out into the hallway, and Ash inched even more slowly behind her. She had given her new little sis her crook to balance with (but mostly because it completed the outfit).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl's gotta pride herself in her posture.\" She told him, and though it ached to do so she tried to set an example. The slow pace made it easy for the boy to follow, and he was learning to keep his back straight, his steps pointed and his movements gentle and dainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a girl.\" Ash muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me: you've gotta sound like it too. Right now your voice is a little too gruff and moany. Can you lighten it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was quiet. Maybe if he ignored her, the problem would magically go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mareep have a good sense of hearing.\" She turned back at him, knowing she was going to win this argument too. \"Little Henry will remember your voice if you don't change it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, and lightened his vocal chords as best he could. \"I can do my best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was fortunate she reached the staircase railing at that point, because she needed something to lean on while she suffered another gigglefit. He could even sound bubbly like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really can do anything you set your mind to, Ash! I like that about you.\" But he didn't take the compliment well at all: when she looked back at him, he'd dropped onto his knees sulkingly, stockings against the floorboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his sullen state, his eyes glanced at his blue-nailed hands, and that reminded him of Misty. What if she saw him like this? He'd never hear the end of it! What would Pikachu think? What if his mom showed up for no reason? What if--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Ash, don't stop now.\" She lifted him back onto his feet. \"You're doing great! If anyone saw you now, the only thing they'd give you is compliments!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a good thing Melanie put that cosmetic blush on Ash's face, because it helped hide the neverending flood of literal ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Robins inched down the stairs, one more gingerly than the other. At the rate Ash was moving, it would be the evening by the time they made it out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie wracked her head for any encouragement she could give him. \"Do you know what helps me out when I feel nervous? Singing. There's a nursery rhyme that I learned in nursery school, 'Baa Baa Black Mareep'. You remember it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh did, but not that fondly. He was the kind to play with Pokemon toys and win all the imaginary battles with childhood friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baa Baa Black Mareep, have you any wool?<br>\r\nYes sir, yes sir, three bags full.<br>\r\nOne for my master and one for his dame,<br>\r\nAnd one for the little boy who lives in the lane.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silly, but Ash forgot about his nerves a little just listening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's do it together, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ash joined in, but very quietly. They sang it together, all the way down the stairs, all the way out of the house. All the way past Cyndaquil, who had been busy cleaning the house, whose baffled thoughts were lost over the melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only by the second rep that Ash noticed he was already out in the field, with Melanie hiding behind the house door, and Little Henry sleeping behind the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a thumbs up. Ash breathed in and gathered his courage. He could do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrodding along with his crook against the ground, he opened the fence, and slowly walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Henry reared his head from the grass. There was a pleasant looking figure in the distance, heading his way, and a pleasant smell came from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Little Henry?\" She called out lightly and chirpily, and Little Henry could tell it was a friend. Melanie, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mareep ran up to her side, where she bent down and patted him: her hands felt so soft to touch that he gave a cry of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Henry knew there was something odd about Melanie; there were subtle differences only he could tell. But even if this girl wasn't her, he could see her kind intentions, and that's what mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt an euphoric relief, as he felt just how comforting it was to pat a Mareep, and Melanie cheered from inside the house. It had worked, it had really worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came back, Melanie congratulated him. \"Now you can go save the rest of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm glad. Maybe this whole--\" Ash said, slipping back into his normal accent, but Melanie held a finger up to his mouth when he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-huh-huh, you've gotta stay in character.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this whole,\" Ash began again, sounding appropriately girly, \"dress up to find Mareep thing won't be so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I knew you'd like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit winding me up!\" His blush face was quickly becoming his regular face. \"I just mean, y'know,\" he glanced over his puffy shoulder and blonde hair to see Little Henry in the field, jolly at long last, \"it's good to see Pokemon happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is.\" Melanie agreed. Even if he didn't share her enthusiasm in some areas, he definitely cared for Pokemon as much as her. That was something they could share anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoctowl took the moment to swoop in and join them, and a curious Cyndaquil scurried over. Ash's Pokemon eyed him quzzically: the owl barely recognised his trainer and friend, and had to tell Cyndaquil that it was Ash looking like that. But neither of them could understand why. \"Don't ask, please.\" Was all Ash would tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey asked him about the Mareep, and the owl Pokemon confirmed they were safe, but spread out across the valley. He'd located all the stray Mareep and was ready to lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Noctowl.\" Ash said, then turned to Melanie. \"I'll be back before tonight with all of them, don't worry. Just get well soon, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as I can. And Ash? Thanks for everything. I mean it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shiny owl soared into the air and flew eastwards, and Ash gently followed him on the ground, crook in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember your posture, Ashley!\" She called when she spotted his stride slipping, and he corrected his walk whilst dropping his head in embarrassment. Melanie never got tired of seeing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rancher leaned against the fence, stroking Little Henry's fleece and savouring the sunlight. Today was turning out much better than she expected. She thought it'd be dull, with her doing all the chores; instead, Ash's Pokemon have everything covered, and he was off to get all the Mareep back. So she could just goof off for the whole day - all for doing one satisfying makeover!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But if she could be honest with herself, she knew Ash hated it. He was a guy, after all. It was just that, for so long, she felt like a slave to work. There were no friends her age within miles, boy or girl; she could never go far to find any because she had to protect the ranch. Ash was the first person her age to have come along in years, and she had a really good time with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be better if I let him give me a makeover too?\" She asked Cyndaquil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I knew it.\" She frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shame that he'd leave the moment her foot got better, and that the work pileup would return, and this place would remain unnoticed. All she could do was make the most of the time she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd view the pictures she had taken. Those flustered looks on his face? Priceless.</span></div></div>",

Beartic, use Ice Beam!\u201d Georgia ordered, pointing at Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBear!\u201d Beartic roared, opening his mouth as icy energy began to form in front of his mouth, then a light blue beam of ice energy blasted out towards Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaxorus, block it with Dragon Pulse!\u201d said Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHax!\u201d said Haxorus. He opened his mouth wide, and a multi-coloured beam of dragon energy shot out. Haxorus\u2019 Dragon Pulse hit Beartic\u2019s Ice Beam, and the two beams of energy pushed against each other for a few seconds, before exploding, sending dust and soot into the air around them. When the dust cleared, neither Pok\u00e9mon seemed to have taken much damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Beartic, now use Focus Blast!\u201d said Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBear!\u201d growled Beartic, holding his hands in front of him and charging a light blue energy ball between his hands. He thrust his hands forward, launching the Focus Blast at Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut through it with Slash, Haxorus!\u201d Iris yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaxor!\u201d said Haxorus, as his axe-like tusks began to glow white. He ran forward, and swung his head at the Focus Blast orb, slicing through it with one of his tusks. Georgia and Beartic watched in shock as he sliced through the Focus Blast orb then continued forward. Once he reached Beartic, he swung his head again, using his tusks to Slash at Beartic\u2019s chest. Beartic staggered back from the blow, and growled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not looking good,\u201d said Georgia. \u201cOkay, Beartic, try Hidden Power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeartic!\u201d said Beartic. Green orbs of energy formed around Beartic, and he flung them at Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaxorus, use Outrage!\u201d Iris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaxorus!\u201d Haxorus roared, as his eyes glowed red. A red aura formed around him, and he charged forward. The green Hidden Power orbs struck Haxorus as he ran, but they simply bounced off, repelled by the red aura surrounding him. Haxorus lashed out with his claws, striking Beartic. He then swung his head, hitting Beartic with his axe-like tusks. Haxorus swung his head again, in a downwards motion, but Beartic dodged the blow, and the red aura surrounding Haxorus faded, though his eyes still glowed red. Haxorus\u2019 swing missed Beartic, and he hit the ground, causing one of his tusks to get stuck in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Now, while he\u2019s confused, hit him with Blizzard!\u201d said Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBear!\u201d said Beartic, taking a deep breath and forming a light blue orb of ice energy in front of his open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Haxorus, look out!\u201d said Iris, as Haxorus struggled to pull his tusk out of the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTic!\u201d Beartic roared as he exhaled. A powerful gust of wind, carrying ice and snow, shot out from the orb in front of Beartic\u2019s mouth as he exhaled, and the Blizzard shot towards Haxorus. The red glow in Haxorus\u2019 eyes faded, and he pulled his tusk out of the ground and leapt to one side, causing the Blizzard to fly past him harmlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Georgia gasped. \u201cHe dodged it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, go Haxorus!\u201d said Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHax!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s finish this!\u201d said Iris. \u201cHaxorus, use Giga Impact!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaxorus!\u201d said Haxorus, as he was surrounded by a yellow aura. He charged at Beartic, and as he ran, an orb of light purple energy formed around him, engulfing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeartic, look out!\u201d said Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeartic tried to avoid Haxorus, but Haxorus was going too fast for Beartic to dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaxorus!\u201d Haxorus cried as he slammed into Beartic. There was an explosion as the purple orb surrounding Haxorus detonated, causing both Pokemon to be obscured by smoke. As the smoke cleared, both Haxorus and Beartic were standing facing each other, though they were both swaying on their feet. Haxorus staggered forward a step, but managed to recover and straighten himself up. Beartic, on the other hand, fell backwards, and hit the ground with a loud thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBear...\u201d Beartic moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeartic is unable to battle!\u201d said Cilan, holding up a hand. \u201cHaxorus wins!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! Yes! We did it, Haxorus!\u201d said Iris, smiling and laughing as she jumped up and hugged Haxorus\u2019 neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHax, Haxorus,\u201d said Haxorus, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I don\u2019t believe it...\u201d said Georgia quietly. \u201cI... I lost...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iris hugged Haxorus, he remembered that he still had the remote, tucked safely away under some of his scales. He pulled the remote out, and pointed it at Georgia. She was kneeling next to her Beartic and helping him to sit up. While Georgia was distracted, Haxorus aimed the remote at Georgia and pressed a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to Georgia?</span></div></div>",

He looked up, and saw Georgia standing next to Iris. Georgia was no longer wearing any clothes, and Iris was hugging her and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were great, Haxorus,\u201d said Iris. \u201cGood job!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHax, Haxorus,\u201d said Georgia, blushing bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Haxorus, then gasped in surprise.

As the red light faded, it pulled Beartic back into his Pok\u00e9ball, and Haxorus put the Pok\u00e9ball in his pocket, and stood up as Iris walked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Georgia,\u201d said Iris, holding out a hand. \u201cThat was a good battle. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, you too,\u201d Haxorus said, hesitantly taking Iris\u2019 hand. He shook hands with her, and Iris didn\u2019t seem to find anything strange about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how long are you gonna hang around for?\u201d Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well...\u201d said Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if you\u2019re gonna sulk about how Haxorus and I beat you, do it somewhere else,\u201d Iris continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHax!\u201d said Georgia, nodding firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus was stunned. The remote had caused everyone to think he was Georgia, and that Georgia was him! Not only that, but not even Georgia realised anything was wrong with this situation! The only problem, at least in Haxorus\u2019 eyes, was that Iris no longer considered him a friend, since he was now Georgia, and Georgia was Iris\u2019 rival. Haxorus\u2019 hand started to reach for his pocket. Maybe he could use the remote to fix this...</span></div></div>",

Haxorus stuffed the remote into the bottom of his bag, then rolled over and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Haxorus woke up the next morning, he felt strange, and couldn\u2019t figure out why. He opened his eyes and sat up, looking himself over. He must\u2019ve been still dreaming, because he had a human body. That was when he remembered the remote. He quickly checked his bag, and found the remote right where he left it. Haxorus sighed in relief. There was no telling what might happen if he lost the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus put the remote back in his bag, then looked around. Ash, Pikachu, Iris, Georgia and Cilan were also awake, and Haxorus could smell food cooking as Cilan made breakfast. Haxorus climbed out of his sleeping bag and gathered up his clothes so he could change in private. As he got changed, he noticed that Georgia\u2019s clothes had changed size again. When he had his own body and Georgia\u2019s life, Georgia\u2019s clothes had grown and changed shape to fit his body, but now that he had Georgia\u2019s body as well as her life, her clothes had gone back to being the right size for a human, rather than a Haxorus. After he finished getting changed, he packed up his sleeping bag, which had also changed back to being human sized. Once he\u2019d finished packing up, Haxorus joined the others for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are you guys headed?\u201d Haxorus asked as he sat down for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to Pallet Town,\u201d said Iris. \u201cAsh invited us to go and visit his mom for a few days. After that, Cilan and I are going to Johto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to go to Kalos,\u201d said Ash. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what sort of Pokemon they have over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Georgia?\u201d Cilan asked. \u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well,\u201d said Haxorus, thinking furiously. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any plans at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you guys mind if I tag along, at least until we get to Pallet Town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Ash. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mom would love to meet you, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Haxorus, turning his attention to the food in front of him. As he ate, he tried to think about what Georgia might want to do. That was when he suddenly began to remember that Georgia wanted to get all the Gym Badges in Kanto and win the Indigo Plateau Conference. Georgia had planned to challenge Lance, the Champion of Kanto and Johto, and a Dragon-type specialist, so she could prove that she was the greatest Dragon Buster ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Swapping lives with Georgia must have given me her memories as well</i>, thought Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them finished breakfast, then helped Cilan clean the dishes and finish packing up. Once everything was packed away, Ash, Iris, Cilan and Haxorus made their way back to the dirt path, and started walking towards Pallet Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are we heading straight to Pallet Town?\u201d Haxorus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, we should probably head to a Pok\u00e9mon Centre first,\u201d said Iris. \u201cYour Beartic is probably still tired from our battle yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHax, Haxor,\u201d said Georgia, walking along behind Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Right!\u201d Haxorus said, suddenly feeling guilty for forgetting about Georgia\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon. Since he was now their Trainer, he was now responsible for them as well. \u201cHow could I have forgotten about that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it happens to all of us,\u201d said Ash. \u201cRight, Pikachu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPika Pika, Pikachu,\u201d said Pikachu, sitting on Ash\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere should be a Pok\u00e9mon Centre along this path,\u201d said Cilan, looking at his Town Map. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop there for lunch, then continue to Pallet Town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan!\u201d said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPikachu!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Due to their innate sense of justice and morality, Jennies despise criminals. As a result, they are often used by police forces around the world. Jennies are also very protective of their family and friends, and will fight rampaging Pokemon to protect them. Jenny can understand and speak human language. Once trained, they are allowed to perform most human jobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. So they really do let you do everything people do even though you're a Pokemon?\" Asked Haxorus. \"Wait. What can't you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. I don't know. I know Jennies like me are really good at learning people laws and helping the police, but Mom said I'd learn the stuff I can't do from a Trainer,\" Haxorus' Jenny admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to explain!\" Said Cilan. \"A Jenny can't train Pokemon because they are one, and they can't take positions that put them in charge of people, like Mayor or Pokemon Professor. Other than that, a finely aged and well-trained Jenny can perform all sorts of human jobs. Many are trained as pets for children, since their near-perfect human anatomy lets them pass as humans and protect children from danger without fear from their parents. Still, assisting the police is by far and away their most common vintage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not a police officer,\" Haxorus noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, Trainer,\" Her Jenny replied, \"I'll protect and serve you as best I can.\" She winked and added, \"As long as you follow the law, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jenny,\u201d Haxorus said. \u201cI\u2019m Georgia, a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.

She simply walked alongside Haxorus, happily humming to herself despite having no clothes on. Haxorus also managed to spot a couple more Jennies out in the wild, and they seemed to get along well with the other Pok\u00e9mon in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the group arrived at the Pok\u00e9mon Center and Haxorus saw Nurse Joy standing behind the counter with Chansey, an ever-present smile on her face. \"Good afternoon; how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just want a quick heal-up of our Pok\u00e9mon, please,\" Ash said, setting his Pok\u00e9Balls on a tray, which Pikachu also hopped on. Cilan and Iris started to do the same as Haxorus told Jenny, \"You're just gonna get a quick check-up, okay? I'll see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Jenny happily exclaimed as Haxorus put her back in the Pok\u00e9Ball and set her, Beartic, Bisharp and Vanilluxe on their own tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joy tended to the Pok\u00e9mon, Ash said, \"I'm going to call Mom and let her know we're just a day away from home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I'll go shopping; I'm not sure I packed enough food to keep us fed for the rest of the trip,\" Cilan said as he took his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll look for some berries to give my Pok\u00e9mon. What're you going to do, Georgia?\" Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus thought about it. <i>This thing is so powerful. It made me evolve into a Haxorus, made me switch lives with Georgia without her - or him now, I guess realizing anything was wrong, made Georgia and I switch bodies, and even made Officer Jenny her own species of Pok\u00e9mon!

My dad caught my Delia before I was born and trained her to take care of me, and he did a great job. When he left, she got work at a restaurant in Pallet Town to keep taking care of me. And when I became a Pokemon Trainer, I took my Delia with me while Professor Oak watched the house until Tracey became his assistant. But she's been my mom all my life, so she's still my mom to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really sweet,\" Said Haxorus. <i>And interesting.

I'm always happy to answer questions for Pokemon Trainers. Although we're not human, our bodies are similar to human bodies so it's easy for us to wear human clothing. Usually we wear clothing after we're caught in order to distinguish us from wild Pokemon of our species. That way no one tries to catch us by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need to wear clothes after you're caught? Do people want you to wear clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't need to wear clothes, Georgia, and because we're Pokemon, people don't mind if we wear clothes or not. Of course, wearing clothes in a professional setting helps people have faith that we're being professional. That's what uniforms are for, after all. That's why I'm wearing clothes right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus nodded and asked, \"Do Pokemon like you prefer wearing clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Fennel's Aurea shrugged and answered, \"Whatever our trainer prefers. We're okay with it either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about when you battle? Do you still wear clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually we undress for battling so as to not damage our clothes. On the other hand, when we're on the job sometimes we use our Pokemon Moves to help people.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my Jenny I just caught said sometimes people think it's strange when she uses a Pokemon Move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Fennel's Aurea nodded. \"Wild Jennies usually learn that from their parents because they see young kids who are surprised by it. Most adults don't think it any stranger than when other Pokemon use their Moves, and the few who do usually come to accept it as another part of our fascinating world of People and Pokemon.\" </span></div></div>",

How do they learn new moves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Fennel's Aurea answered, \"The same way all Pokemon do: with lots practice and a goal in mind, or in a flash of inspiration cemented by re-enforcement training. And of course, as her Pokemon Trainer you can be a great help, providing support and direction. I'd suggest you find other Jennies and ask them what moves they know, so that you and your Jenny can decide what moves you'd like her to learn. With enough time, I'm sure the two of you can work towards a moveset you'll both be satisfied with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where I can catch more Human Pokemon?\" Haxorus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Fennel thought, \"Wherever you found your Jenny, there are probably others. Jennies and Joys are native to every reason. Delias are a Pokemon native to the Kanto region, and Aureas like me are native to Unova, and we're usually attracted to areas of large-scale intellectual activity. Other than that, wild Pokemon decide where to live, so it's up to you as a Pokemon Trainer to find and catch them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.

Haxorus searched the magazine, finding someone the magazine identified as a Gym-Leader named Brock. Next to him was his Olivia, wearing only a necklace of evolution stones and a stone two-piece that didn't seem to encumber her in the slightest. <i>So it does work!</i> Haxorus realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to the next magazine in the pile, finding Melony and pushing the button. Now the magazine had Pryce showing off his Ice-type Pokemon, with Melony standing nude next to five other Ice-type Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl named Misty was third. With one button push, the picture changed to a blonde, a bluenette, and a pink-haired woman standing at the edge of a pool. In the pool were three Mistys, identical except for their earrings, each pair colored to match their Trainers' hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus paused when she got to Elesa. Something about the puffy sleeves and blue and yellow dress turned her off. She looked at the previous page of the magazine and saw a picture of Elesa as a blonde in a sleeker black and yellow outfit. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/c/c8/Elesa_BW_anime.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/c/c8/...</a> <i>That one looks better,</i> Haorus decided before pushing the button.

It all seemed the same, except for some new questions near the end:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Q: How do you handle being an actress, a Champion, and a mother?<br>\r\nA: Well, before I say anything else I should say that I couldn't do it without the help of my skilled assistant, Kathi Lee. It's hard work being all of those three, but each is a role I'm honored to have in my life. I'm always sure to schedule my shoots so that I have plenty of time to be at the yearly Kalos conference. Even so, I always let those I shoot my movies with know in advance that I may need to go at a moment's notice on Champion business, and I'm lucky to have such gracious co-workers. As for being a mother, well, when Georgia was young I made sure to spend all the time with her that I could. But knowing that I would be as busy as I am, I made sure to catch and train a Delia, an Aurea, and a Jenny long before I gave birth to Georgia to make sure she was raised, taught, and protected as we traveled Kalos, even when I couldn't do it myself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus paused. Concentrating, she had flashes of memory, remembering her new mother Diantha and Diantha's Human Pokemon that had helped to raise her. She resumed reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Q: I see. And where is Georgia now?<br>\r\nA: She's traveling the world as a Pokemon Trainer. I offered her my Human Pokemon to take care of her, but she said she wanted to catch her own Pokemon. I was so proud of her when she caught Cubchoo, and I'm still proud of her now. If you're reading this, Georgia, your mother misses you and hopes to see you soon!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus smiled. <i>This is incredible. I have a famous mother now, all thanks to this remote.</i> She looked at the remote, memorizing the button she had pressed by mistake. <i>So it's this button. Got it.</i></span></div></div>",

Other Pok\u00e9mon seek out Melonys to test their skill, which Melonys will help refine if they manage to defeat them. Melonys with this kind of relationship with other Pok\u00e9mon treat them like their children and can be very doting and protective. They are mainly found in the Galar region.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, the Mermaid Pok\u00e9mon. Water-type. Mistys live in any kind of water and are known for their aggressive outbursts when disturbed. They are most friendly to children and baby Pok\u00e9mon who come close, and will sing and play with them to make them happy. Despite usually accepting any Pok\u00e9mon or humans near their territories, they have an unusual hatred for Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon. They are mainly found in the Kanto region, but can be found all over the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elesa, the Model Pok\u00e9mon. Electric-type. Elesa usually have a playful attitude and strike poses to get any Pok\u00e9mon or human to cheer for them. While in Altering Forme, they use the cords attached to their ears to absorb electricity from any surface touched, even static electricity. While in Direct Forme, they continually discharge electricity from the antennae on their ears until they are drained of energy. They are mainly found in the Unova region.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So Elesa has two forms?\"</i> Haxorus thought as she looked at the two Elesas in the magazine. Apparently, the yellow-haired Elesa was the Altering Forme, with long black cables over the headphones covering her ears now part of her body. Meanwhile the black-haired Elesa was the Direct Forme, with horns on her headphones now serving as part of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So including Jenny, Joy, Delia and Aurea, there is now a Human Pok\u00e9mon for the Fighting, Fairy, Normal, Psychic, Rock, Ice, Water and Electric types.

She did remember at least some of those moments of the two being young sisters, traveling with their mother. Sometimes they were at the studio, watching her act. Other times they were being taken around the area around the shoot by Diantha's Delia, while being protected by Diantha's Jenny. They didn't have a school to go to, so Diantha's Aurea was their teacher. Haxorus remembered when \"she\" and Iris did some sneaking and were amazed to learn that Diantha's Aurea was being trained (or at least re-trained) in the same material she was teaching her and Iris. And sometimes it was just them and their mommy, together and happy. <i>Would the real Georgia remember more? But then, if I hadn't switched places with Georgia, she wouldn't be Diantha's daughter?

Melony, however, wore no clothes, which she explained as a result of her training so hard on Mount Lanakila all her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you both,\" Lusamine said. \"Melony, could you please help Lillie pack her bags?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lillie rushed off to pack her bags...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Haxorus's first pick was a picture of an unassuming Pokemon Breeder from Unova ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/d/da/XY_Pok%C3%A9mon_Breeder_F.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/d/da/...</a> ). She concentrated, <i>Okay, let's see. Some kind of food Pokemon? </i>Focusing on that thought, Haxorus aimed her remote at the picture and pushed the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture changed to show the same young woman standing naked next to someone who looked like a farmer. Two plump Tamato berries hung from her ears like earrings, their weight not seeming to bother the new Pokemon in the slightest. Haxorus decided to not waste any more time and went to check her Pokedex. <i>Amala, the Harvest Pokemon. Grass-Type. Not only does an Amala's body produce nutritious milk and eggs, her fast-growing hair can be milled into rich flour, and the move Autotomize allows her to shed unneeded body fat that is healthy when used for cooking purposes. There are many varieties of Amala; each variety is distinguished by the type of berry that grows from her ears. Amalas are mainly found in the Unova Region, but can be found near many agricultural areas worldwide.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus grinned from ear to ear. <i>It worked! Okay, I know who to go to next.</i> Haxorus dug through the stack of magazines that were on the Pokemon Center Table until she found a picture of Valerie, the Kalosian Gym Leader ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/1/18/XY_Valerie.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/1/18/...</a> ). <i>Clothing! I want a clothing Pokemon now! With silk and everything!</i> She pushed the button, then checked the Pokedex. <i>Valerie, the Weaver Pokemon. Bug and Fairy-type. A Valerie's hair, milk, and webbing can be all worked into high-quality clothing materials. Valeries learn to craft these materials into creative and brightly-colored garments with their deft hands, and many wild and Trained Valeries provide clothing for themselves, other Human Pokemon, or their Trainers. Valeries are mainly found in the Kalos region.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect! That should be enough for a special Human Pokemon Clothing store, right? Now what to...</i> As Haxorus thought, her eyes looked at the new picture of four girls dressed in lovely furisodes and standing next to the Valeries that had woven them. One of them caught her eye -  a young woman with sparkling blue eyes and long, soft red hair (or at least close enough to red for Haxorus) ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/6/61/Linnea.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/6/61/...</a> ) Haxorus thought back to Misty. <i>Hmm... maybe someone a little older so um... no one needs to breed a Misty. Okay. An evolved form of Misty... who can become human... and... uh...  </i> Haxorus thought back to Misty's Pokedex entry. <i>No more aggressive outbursts. Someone calm and polite, someone you could uh... </i> Haxorus focused, thinking back on something her Mom and Mama would do, before deciding, <i>Have tea with!</i> Haxorus aimed and pushed the button. The four Furisode girls were now three, and Haxorus went to her Pokedex. <i>Linnea, the Polite Hostess Pokemon. The evolved form of Misty. A Misty can evolve into Linnea after learning Teatime and coming to control her aggressive outbursts, which disappear entirely upon evolution. In Human Forme, Linneas are famous for their politeness and are easily trained to entertain guests, including at tea parties and traditional ceremonies. In Mermaid Form, a Linnea battles with serene grace Linneas, like Mistys, are mainly found in the Kanto region, but can be found all over the world.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Much better!</i> Thought Haxorus, smiling.</span></div></div>",

Haxorus read a note, presumably written by Johanna.<i> To my budding Pokemon Coordinator and Stylist, I hope this sketchbook can store all your inspirations.

Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn shook her head, \"No need to worry.\" We get some of that in Petalburg City, so we understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yeah, I remember Ash telling me about his father being the Petalburg City Gym Leader. That's really cool,\" Said Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Said May. \"I mean, Dad's not a Champion, and Mom's not a super-successful businesswoman, but they really love us and we really love them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn agreed, saying, \"Yeah, we wouldn't have anyone else for family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled, adding in, \"Yeah, they're a great Mom and Dad. Hey, that reminds me. How's your Johanna, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's doing great!\" Dawn pulled out a Poke Ball and opened it.

How has your Johanna been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn beamed as she replied, \"She's been great, and she's taken really good care of me and May. Right now I'm trying to train her for Pokemon Contests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know you'll do a great job,\" Said Ash's Delia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus pulled out her Pokedex. <i>Johanna, the Domestic Pokemon. Normal-type. Kind, and loving, Johanna is easily trained to cook, clean, and care for others, especially children. Many Trainers catch Johanna to take care of themselves or their family. Although very similar in temperament and capabilities to Delia, the two have been found to be separate species of Pokemon.</i> She nodded and thought to herself, <i>Good job, remote.</i> \"Wow, so you had a Delia and a Johanna growing up?\" Haxorus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay nodded and said, \"Yeah. Mom is mom, but with Delia and Johanna it's almost like we had three moms. Before we were born Mom learned that she was going to have triplets, so Dad caught a Delia in Pallet Town and a Johanna in Twinleaf Town to help raise us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus blinked. \"Triplets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn nodded and explained, \"Me, Ash, and May are fraternal triplets.That means we were all born at the same time, but we're not identical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus nodded, \"That makes sense.\" </span></div></div>",

Digging a little deeper, she pulled out another device before returning to the lobby of the Pokemon Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lobby, Haxorus looked at the three devices she had with her. One was the remote. The second was her Pokedex. The third was an expensive internet-compatible smartphone. <i>With this I can look up all sorts of people online,</i> Haxorus realized.<i> Thanks Mom and Mama. Okay. Now what kind of Human Pokemon I want to make?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's see... Mom and Mama are probably going to get here by plane, so let me look up Flying-Type Trainers... of course! Her!

Successful, she switched to her Pokedex.<i> Skyla, the Sky Companion Pokemon. Flying-type. Skyla flies using the propeller on her head. Known for their graceful mid-air movements, Skylas can be trained to pilot any aircraft and act as an airplane stewardess. Once native to Unova, Skylas have traveled the skies and now can be found worldwide.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay. Next... a ninja! Ninjas are cool!</i> With a little searching, Haxorus quickly found a Ninja Gym Leader. ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/3/31/Spr_Masters_Janine.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/3/31/...</a> ) One remote use later, Haxorus was checking her Pokedex.<i> Janine. The Ninja Pokemon. Dark and Poison-types. Janine is known for her agility and her natural aptitude in the Ninja arts. Janines are known to attack from unexpected angles, using the poison they can secrete to weaken their opponents. Janines are most commonly spotted in the Kanto region, but may be hiding in other areas.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus smiled at her creativity.<i> Alright. Now one more. Hmm... </i><i></i>Haxorus imagined her mothers arriving, no doubt bringing a lot of luggage with them. <i>If only there was someone who could help them... Maybe someone who is strong enough and could carry their luggage? Them? Carry them and their luggage? Without getting hurt, of course.</i> Haxorus took some time, scanning the internet for Pokemon that were ridden and the people who rode them. She decided on a famous Rhyhorn rider. ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/2/28/Grace_anime.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/2/28/...</a> ) At this point, the remote and the Pokedex cane quickly. <i>Grace. The Riding Pokemon. Ground-type. Grace is light enough to ride other Pokemon, but strong enough to carry many times her weight on her back without hurting herself. Grace is easily trained to race while riding Pokemon, or to run on all fours herself on any type of terrain at a high rate of speed without dropping her cargo or passengers. Graces are mostly found in the Kalos region.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright. That's three new Human Pokemon and four types taken care of,</i> Haxorus thought to herself with pride.</span></div></div>",

Best of luck on your journey as a Pokemon Trainer.</i> She then passed it to Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax took the photo and quietly said, \"Thank you.\" He stood there quietly, staring at the autograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter signing three more photos and giving them to Max's siblings, Diantha turned to Iris, \"Iris dearest, would you like some hot chocolate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris nodded and replied, \"That would be nice, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus frowned. <i>Why didn't she ask- oh.</i> In her bags were expensive hot chocolate mix made with powdered chocolate, freshly imported Moomoo Milk, pure spring water, and really fancy marshmallows. There was even a portable stove in her belongings. <i>I see. Princess Allie usually just has her Human Pokemon make hot chocolate for her. Still, if mother doesn't ask, she's free to purchase her own-</i> Haxorus closed her eyes and puckered her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Allie?\" Diantha asked with concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus took a deep breath and answered, \"No. I'm fine. If I can find a place to purchase a gas canister, I would be glad to share-\" Haxorus paused, as if the word was unfamiliar to her, \"-what I have so everyone can have hot chocolate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You'd share?\" Asked Iris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes. Of course,\" Replied Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiantha smiled with pride, \"You truly have matured, and your offer means the world to me, daughter. Unfortunately I don't think they'd allow us to bring drinks from outside, but I'd be honored if you'd share with us later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus fought off the instinct to demand to speak to someone to have an exception made. Instead, she smiled back and promised, \"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiantha passed her Human Pokemon Delia and Joy some money and gave the three of them their orders, saying, \"Jenny, please stay with us and watch our bags, Delia, Joy, please get us some hot chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, Trainer!\" Said all three in unison, before Delia and Joy walked away to get the hot chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus waited, listening to the others talk as she nursed her hot chocolate. <i>Mine is better, but... it's just nice sharing this with the family,</i> She decided. She didn't have much to say about her own life as Princess Allie, as all she had to share were her days in Parfum Palace, days of indolence that all seemed to blend into each other. Still, Haxorus couldn't help but smile as her sister Iris spoke with pride about her journey as a Pokemon Trainer and how well her Pokemon were doing. Haxorus remembered that life she had left not so long ago, and silently promised to herself that she would use that to keep her grounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi everyone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked towards the sound of the voice. It was Lusamine, her children, and their Human Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris and Haxorus walked fast to meet them, everyone else just behind them. Iris embraced her mother, \"Mama, I've missed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus bowed politely, \"It's good to see you again, mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLusamine smiled and said, \"It's a pleasure to see both of you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie said, \"Wow little sister, you really got up on the right side of the bed today. You're acting as big as you look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Little? How old is Allie supposed to be?</i> Haxorus wondered for a moment before remembering and realizing that even though she had that blonde girl's body, Princess Allie was a few years younger than her siblings. <i>Oh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladion sniffed at them, \"Will wonders never cease. It's nice to see the both of you too,\" He said with the tone of someone whose mind was on something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazorus tried not to frown, but deep down she got flashes of memory of Princess Allie not getting on well with Gladion as of late, as her soft-glove lifestyle began to clash with his broody travelling. It seemed to be connected with a fear that Lillie had gained of Pokemon that weren't Human Pokemon, a fear that made Haxorus sympathize with her sister. \"Thank you,\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiantha approached her wife Lusamine. Haxorus saw them laugh as they embraced and kissed, but she was too lost in thought to properly hear what they were saying.</span></div></div>",

It's where I grew up in my first few years of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mother, you've become Kalos Champion since then,\" Said Gladion.

Olivia are more capable of communicating with Pok\u00e9mon of different species than others, particularly aggressive Pok\u00e9mon, though they are mostly known for caring for smaller, defenseless Pok\u00e9mon. They are known for crafting intricately-made trinkets out of rocks to symbolize their connection to others, but are known to be clumsy while walking in unfamiliar terrain. They are mainly found in the Alola region.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Melony, the Stern Coach Pok\u00e9mon. Ice-type. A Melony\u2019s body can withstand the harshest winter weather, making it a valuable Pok\u00e9mon for hikers and villagers high in the mountains when foraging for food or seeking shelter. Other Pok\u00e9mon seek out Melonys to test their skill, which Melonys will help refine if they manage to defeat them. Melonys with this kind of relationship with other Pok\u00e9mon treat them like their children and can be very doting and protective. They are mainly found in the Galar region.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Misty, the Mermaid Pok\u00e9mon. Water-type. Mistys live in any kind of water and are known for their aggressive outbursts when disturbed. They are most friendly to children and baby Pok\u00e9mon who come close, and will sing and play with them to make them happy. Despite usually accepting any Pok\u00e9mon or humans near their territories, they have an unusual hatred for Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon. They are mainly found in the Kanto region, but can be found all over the world.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Elesa, the Model Pok\u00e9mon. Electric-type. Elesa usually have a playful attitude and strike poses to get any Pok\u00e9mon or human to cheer for them. While in Altering Forme, they use the cords attached to their ears to absorb electricity from any surface touched, even static electricity. While in Direct Forme, they continually discharge electricity from the antennae on their ears until they are drained of energy. They are mainly found in the Unova region.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Elesa has two forms?\" Haxorus thought as she looked at the two Elesas in the magazine.

Beck\u2019s Jenny jumped up to her feet, and faced Haxorus\u2019 Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse Leer!\u201d Beck ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen!\u201d said Beck\u2019s Jenny, and her eyes began to glow red as she glared angrily at Haxorus\u2019 Jenny. A red outline briefly appeared around Haxorus\u2019 Jenny, and she shuddered fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let her get you down, Jenny!\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cStop her from doing that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Jenny, nodding. Her own eyes began to glow blue, and Beck\u2019s Jenny glowed blue as well, causing her red eyes to disappear instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said Beck. \u201cJenny, use Leer again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d said Beck\u2019s Jenny, and she glared at Haxorus\u2019 Jenny. However, her eyes did not start glowing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! You used Disable!\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cGood work, Jenny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Jenny, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, finish this with Karate Chop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Jenny, as her hand started glowing white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny, use Karate Chop too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen!\u201d said Beck\u2019s Jenny. Her hand also started to glow white, and the two Jennies charged at each other, striking their opponents with the side of their open hands. Their momentum carried them past each other, and the two Jennies stood still, waiting for the other to move. Haxorus\u2019 Jenny winced, and staggered a step forward. Beck\u2019s Jenny smiled, but her happy look soon disappeared as she started swaying dizzily, then fell over face first into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeck\u2019s Jenny is unable to battle!\u201d said Cilan, raising his hand. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s Haxorus wins!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoohoo!\u201d said Haxorus, jumping up and down excitedly. \u201cYeah, great job, Jenny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen, Jenny!\u201d said Jenny happily, flashing her trainer a V sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, man,\u201d said Beck. \u201cJenny, return.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeck held out a Pok\u00e9ball, and a red beam of light shot out and pulled his Jenny back into her Pok\u00e9ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did great, Jenny,\u201d Beck said to the Pok\u00e9ball. \u201cGet some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeck put his Pok\u00e9ball back into his pocket, then walked up to Haxorus and her Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, thanks for the battle,\u201d said Beck, holding out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you too,\u201d said Haxorus, taking Beck\u2019s hand and shaking it. \u201cAre you and your Jenny gonna be okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Beck. \u201cI\u2019ve still got my Squirtle, Pidgey and Rattata ready to go. Congrats on the win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Haxorus, blushing. \u201cYou take care, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight back at ya!\u201d said Beck, smiling. \u201cSee you around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeck turned, and continued on his way to Viridian City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling, Jenny?\u201d Haxorus asked, turning to his Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny,\u201d Jenny said, giving a thumbs up. However, Haxorus could see some bruises on her legs and shoulder, and she was swaying slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Ash. \u201cWe should get to the Pok\u00e9mon Centre.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cI\u2019m going to put you back in your Pok\u00e9ball, now, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny,\u201d she said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus took out a Pok\u00e9ball and returned Jenny, then followed Ash, Iris and Cilan towards the Pok\u00e9mon Centre.</span></div></div>",

As they walked, Haxorus couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the powers of the remote he had, which was now sitting in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been only yesterday that he\u2019d been an Axew, but the remote had caused him to evolve all the way into Haxorus. Not only that, but he\u2019d then swapped lives and bodies with Iris\u2019 rival Georgia, and nobody, not even Georgia herself, was aware of the changes. Haxorus looked over at Iris, and saw Georgia happily walking along, as if she had always been Haxorus. Not only that, but the remote had made Iris and Haxorus best friends, getting rid of the rivalry that had existed between Iris and Georgia before Haxorus took her life and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just a few moments ago, Haxorus had used the remote to turn a human into a species of Pok\u00e9mon. Earlier that day, the Officer Jenny from Viridian City had been a police officer, but now her life had been changed completely, stripped of everything that had once made her human, and she was now caught in a Pok\u00e9ball, sitting in Haxorus\u2019 pocket. Not only that, but it seemed that every Officer Jenny in the world had become a Pok\u00e9mon as well, and other trainers had caught Jennies and used them in battle, as Haxorus had seen in his battle with Beck. In fact, there seemed to be more Jennies than before, as Haxorus had seen a few wild more Jennies, mingling with the other wild Pok\u00e9mon in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus felt a slight twinge of guilt. Was it really okay for him to use the remote to change things so drastically? He\u2019d basically stolen Georgia\u2019s body and life, and completely rewritten Officer Jenny\u2019s entire existence, without a care for how they might feel about all this. Maybe he should try and return things back to the way they used to be...</span></div></div>",

It was another thing entirely to steal someone\u2019s body and life, or to strip someone of their identity and humanity... which was exactly what he\u2019d done. Georgia had no idea that she used to be a human, and neither did Officer Jenny. In fact, every single member of Officer Jenny\u2019s family had been transformed into a new species of Pok\u00e9mon. Thousands of people had everything that made them who they were stripped away, replaced with an entirely new identity that wasn\u2019t theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kind of power... it was too much. Haxorus was worried that he might get too carried away, and become corrupted by the ability to essentially change reality whenever he felt like it. With his mind set, Haxorus reached into his pocket for the remote. He had to find a way to undo at least some of these changes. Maybe there was a button that could undo the latest change, or possibly even reset everything back to the way it was before Haxorus had found the remote. If he couldn\u2019t do that, then maybe he could manually undo the changes he\u2019d made...</span></div></div>",

As far as anyone else was concerned, it was completely normal for Officer Jenny to be a Pok\u00e9mon species, rather than a human family, and Georgia seemed to be quite happy, blissfully unaware she was living Haxorus\u2019 life in his old body. Haxorus\u2019 feelings of guilt quickly faded, and a few minutes later, Ash, Iris, Cilan and Haxorus arrived at the Pok\u00e9mon Centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them walked through the doors, and saw Nurse Joy standing behind the counter. Like Officer Jenny, the Nurse Joy of the Kanto region looked completely different from the Nurse Joys Haxorus was used to seeing in Unova, and she had a Chansey by her side, rather than an Audino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, and welcome to the Pok\u00e9mon Centre,\u201d said Nurse Joy, smiling at them. \u201cHow can I help you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just want to get our Pok\u00e9mon patched up,\u201d said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Nurse Joy, placing four trays, each with six slots, on the counter. Ash began putting his Pok\u00e9balls on the tray, and Pikachu jumped off his shoulder and onto the tray. Iris and Cilan took out their Pok\u00e9balls and filled their trays, and Haxorus did the same, placing the Pok\u00e9balls containing Beartic, Bisharp, Vanilluxe and Jenny on his tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your Pokemon now,\u201d said Nurse Joy. \u201cThey should be fully healed in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Nurse Joy,\u201d said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nurse Joy took their Pokemon to be healed, Ash turned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call Mom and let her know I\u2019ll be home tomorrow,\u201d said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll go shopping,\u201d said Cilan. \u201cI want to make sure we\u2019ve got enough food to last us for the rest of our journey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll go look for some wild Berries, then,\u201d said Iris. \u201cYou can use those to make food for our Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Iris,\u201d said Cilan. \u201cWhat about you, Georgia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll wait here for our Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, then,\u201d said Iris, as she walked towards the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded, and walked over to the video phones, while Cilan walked the other way. Haxorus headed towards the waiting area and took a seat. As he sat down, he looked at his reflection in the polished surface of the counter, and saw a human girl with rose hair and blue eyes looking back. Even though he\u2019d gotten used to moving around and using a human body, he still wasn\u2019t used to seeing Georgia\u2019s face instead of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Nurse Joy arrived, carrying the trays of Pok\u00e9balls she had been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and your friends\u2019 Pok\u00e9mon have been restored to full health,\u201d said Nurse Joy as she placed the trays on the table Haxorus was sitting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Haxorus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy curtsied. \u201cMy pleasure. We hope to see you again soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nurse Joy began to walk away, Haxorus\u2019 hand strayed towards his pocket, where the remote was.

If Haxorus had to guess, this man had taken Nurse Joy\u2019s place, now that she was a Pok\u00e9mon species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood work, Joy,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou had those Pok\u00e9mon healed up in record time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy!\u201d said Joy proudly as she took her place behind the counter, standing to the doctor\u2019s left while Nurse Joy\u2019s Chansey, which was presumably now the doctor\u2019s Chansey, stood on the doctor\u2019s right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus took out his Pok\u00e9dex, and quickly scanned the new Pok\u00e9mon he had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy, the Healing Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said his Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cDue to their kind and friendly nature, as well as their dislike for seeing Pok\u00e9mon in distress, Joys are often used in Pok\u00e9mon Centres around the world. Their kind nature also leads them to adopting young Pok\u00e9mon that have been orphaned in the wild, raising them as if they were the Joy\u2019s own children.

He figured it might be better to limit how much he used the remote, at least for now. Besides, he didn\u2019t want Ash and Pikachu to see the remote and ask questions, so he quickly put the remote back into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Haxorus pocketed the remote, he saw Ash picking up his Pok\u00e9balls and returning them to his belt. Haxorus picked up Jenny\u2019s Pok\u00e9ball and opened it, sending her out in a flash of white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really had much of a chance to get to know each other,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cI\u2019m going to let you out of your Pokeball for a while, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny,\u201d said Jenny, nodding.

He was slightly surprised by how much Ash knew about Joy, considering she\u2019d only been a Pok\u00e9mon for a few minutes. Then again, considering how nobody was aware that either Jenny or Joy were supposed to be humans, he guessed that what Ash was saying about Joy was probably common knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same with Jennies, right?\u201d said Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny?\u201d asked Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the Jennies we saw in Unova looked different from you,\u201d said Ash to Haxorus\u2019 Jenny. \u201cThey had much shorter hair, and I think their skin was a slightly different colour. Here, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh reached into his pocket and pulled out his Pok\u00e9dex. After a few quick taps, he held it out so Haxorus and his Jenny could see it. On the left side of the screen was a picture of the Kanto Jenny, which looked identical to Haxorus\u2019 Jenny. On the right side of the screen was a picture of the Unova Jenny that Haxorus was familiar with, and like Ash had said, she had much shorter hair than the Kanto Jenny, though it was still the same colour. The Unova Jenny also had a slightly different shape to her face, and was also slightly taller than the Kanto Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Jenny, looking at the image in fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh took his Pok\u00e9dex back and put it back in his pocket. As Ash put his Pok\u00e9dex away, Haxorus looked up, and saw Cilan, Iris and Georgia walking up to the table carrying several plates of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLunch is served,\u201d said Cilan as he started putting the plates on the table. \u201cEnjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny,\u201d said Jenny, her eyes wide as she stared at the plate full of Pok\u00e9mon food that Cilan placed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, Jenny,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cAll that food on your plate is yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d said Jenny happily. She began scooping up handfuls of food and shovelling it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris sat down next to Haxorus with her plate, and Cilan took a seat next to Ash. Pikachu sat on the table next to Ash with his plate, while Georgia, who was too big to fit on one of the chairs, stood at the end of the table.</span></div></div>",

It showed a young woman with dark green-black hair and pink eyes. The woman was wearing a pink tank top that showed her midriff, white pants held up by a black belt. She was also wearing pink shoes and black metal bracelets with glowing green lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSabrina, the Mistress of Psychic Pok\u00e9mon, awaits you at the Saffron City Gym!\u201d Haxorus said quietly, reading the poster out loud. He hadn\u2019t been able to read human languages when he\u2019d been a Pok\u00e9mon, but now that he had a human life, he could read it easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus was overcome with curiosity. He knew that the remote worked on real people, but would it work on images of those people? Haxorus decided to test that out, and pulled the remote out of his pocket. He pointed the remote at the poster, and decided to press the button that had turned Jenny and Joy into Pok\u00e9mon. He quite enjoyed seeing how the world adapted to the appearance of these new Pok\u00e9mon, and he figured it would be the easiest way to see if the remote actually worked on images of people, or if he needed to use the remote on real people.</span></div></div>",

Once they\u2019d finished eating, Ash, Iris and Haxorus helped Cilan clean the dishes in the Pok\u00e9mon Centre\u2019s kitchen.

Iris, Cilan and Haxorus also followed Delia inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, make yourselves at home,\u201d said Delia. \u201cI was just finishing lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great!\u201d said Ash as he put his bag down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPika!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris and Cilan put their bags down next to Ash\u2019s, and Haxorus took his bag off and put it down as well. He quickly opened the bag, and checked that the remote was still there. He reached inside, and his hand closed around the remote. He pulled it out and looked at it briefly. Maybe he could use the remote on Ash\u2019s mother...</span></div></div>",

Iris and Cilan also sat down at the table, and Haxorus joined them, and looked up as Delia walked into the room with a plate full of sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes to Delia were much more obvious. She was taller, her chest was flat, and she now had a bushy beard growing on her face. Not only that, but her outfit was completely different, as she was now wearing a long sleeved shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you guys go,\u201d said Dale Ketchum as he put the plate on the table. \u201cNothing but the best for my daughter and her friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d said Ashley Ketchum as she picked up a sandwich and started shovelling it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Dale. \u201cNow, I want to hear all about how you did at the Unova League, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley started talking about her accomplishments in Unova, Haxorus marvelled at the change he had made. Ash was now a girl, and his mother was now a man! Not only that, but no-one, not even Ash or Delia, was aware of the change. As Haxorus listened to Ashley describing one of the battles she had taken part in, he realised that, even though he was now a girl, Ash\u2019s personality and life history was still the same, and he was willing to bet that the same applied to Delia, or rather, Dale Ketchum, who was now a stay-at-home father while his wife continued to travel on her own Pok\u00e9mon journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...And even though we didn\u2019t win, my Pok\u00e9mon all tried so hard,\u201d Ashley was saying when Haxorus started paying attention to the conversation again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPikachu!\u201d said Pikachu, eating from a bowl of Pok\u00e9mon food that Dale had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d said Dale. \u201cOh, that reminds me. That reporter from Kalos you met, Alexa, I think her name was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s her,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cShe went on ahead of us when Iris and Cilan decided to tag along. She made it here alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she said she was going to see Professor Oak for an interview,\u201d said Dale. \u201cI think she should be finished by now, if you want to go and visit his lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d said Ashley. \u201cYou guys wanna come and meet all my Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Iris. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see them all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come too,\u201d said Cilan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Georgia?\u201d Ashley asked. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Everyone, this is Professor Oak. He\u2019s been looking after all the Pok\u00e9mon I have when they aren\u2019t with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m always happy to see what new Pok\u00e9mon Ashley catches,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cSpeaking of which, what Pokemon do you and your friends have with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, we\u2019ll show you,\u201d said Ashley, pulling out her Pok\u00e9balls. \u201cCome on out, guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley threw five Pok\u00e9balls into the air, sending out Oshawott, Snivy, Pignite, Scraggy and Charizard. Iris also threw her Pok\u00e9balls into the air, sending out Excadrill, Emolga, Dragonite and Georgia the Haxorus. Cilan sent out Pansage, Crustle and Stunfisk, and Haxorus pulled out his own Pok\u00e9balls and sent out Beartic, Vanilluxe, Bisharp, Jenny and Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat an amazing collection of Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cYour friends are very talented Pok\u00e9mon Trainers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Professor,\u201d said Ashley.

He turned it on and scanned the new Human Pok\u00e9mon with it, and one by one, his Pokedex listed off the fifteen new Pok\u00e9mon species he had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola, the Artsy Pok\u00e9mon. Violas have the ability to create a unique pigment from their hands, which they use to paint patterns in the foliage of forests, to communicate with other Violas. They are normally carefree and friendly, and enjoy painting pictures using the pigment from their hands, and some Violas can even control the colour of their pigment. However, when they are in battle, Violas are extremely focused. Viola is a Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Kalos region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren, the Vanity Pok\u00e9mon. Very well-known for their beauty, Karens often value their appearance over anything, even during battle. However, Karens are exceptionally skilled in battle, even without training. In fact, Karens that have become bored of living in the wild have been known to find Pok\u00e9mon Trainers and challenge them to battle, then join their team, regardless of whether the Trainer defeats them or not. Karen is a Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Johto region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair, the Tamer Pok\u00e9mon. Originally discovered in the Dragon\u2019s Den of Blackthorn City, Clairs have been known to tame even the most unruly of Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon. This has led to Clairs being introduced into the nests of Dragon-type Pokemon across the world. However, their prideful and stubborn nature, which is their greatest asset when taming Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon, also means they do not take losses in battle well. Clair is a Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Johto region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa, the Model Pok\u00e9mon. Known for their flair for theatrics, Elesas often incorporate fanciful movements into their attacks, and quite enjoy showing off. They are also capable of using the antennae over their ears to absorb and discharge electricity. When absorbing electricity, an Elesa\u2019s hair turns yellow, and returns to its natural black once the electricy has been discharged. Elesas can also use the move Transform, but, due to some unknown quirk, have only been observed turning into other Human Pok\u00e9mon. Elesa is an Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Unova region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalva, the Observant Pok\u00e9mon. Malvas are always aware of their surroundings and have excellent memories, allowing them to recall what they have seen in great detail. Their powers of observation and retention has resulted in journalists and news organisations across the world using Malvas when in the field. Malvas are also known for their fiery tempers, which can result in them becoming very hostile if they are pushed far enough. Malva is a Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Kalos region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyla, the Highflying Pok\u00e9mon. Skylas are very confident in their battle skills, especially in the wild, which often results in wild Skylas overestimating their battle prowess and getting into trouble. Skylas can use the propellor in their hair to fly, and can usually be found at high altitudes. Due to their love of flying, many Skylas spend their entire lives in the air, never touching the ground once after they have hatched. Skyla is a Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Unova region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe, the Medium Pok\u00e9mon. First discovered on Mount Pyre, Phoebes use their dancing abilities to commune with Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon, to help them pass on, or to summon them to their side during battles. Phoebes are often attracted to graveyards and other places where the deceased are laid to rest, and work to protect these sacred places from grave-robbers and thieves. Phoebe is a Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Hoenn region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardenia, the Forest Pok\u00e9mon. Gardenias are very fond of sunshine, and will often use Sunny Day to bring the sun out on overcast or rainy days. Wild Gardenias will always use Sunny Day at the start of every battle they participate in, even if this could be detrimental to them. Wild Gardenias also have a noticeable aversion of Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon and locations that are supposedly haunted, and will avoid them as much as possible. Gardenia is a Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Sinnoh region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace, the Rider Pok\u00e9mon. Capable of climbing on the back of any Pok\u00e9mon and riding it with ease, wild Graces travel in small herds, and each Grace in the herd will have tamed a different Pok\u00e9mon. Rhyhorns are especially susceptible to a Grace\u2019s taming abilities, and the leader of a herd of Graces will always be riding a Rhyhorn. Grace is a Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Kalos region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice, the Focus Pok\u00e9mon. Due to their friendly and inquisitive nature, wild Candices will often follow Pok\u00e9mon Trainers that they consider to be interesting, which usually leads to them being caught. Their studious nature means that they will often challenge Fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon to learn how to cover their weaknesses, and will give their full attention to any task set before them, even if it is something mundane. Candice is an Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Sinnoh region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenora, the Backbone Pok\u00e9mon. Lenoras will refuse to surrender when in battle, regardless of how powerful their opponent is. Wild Lenoras will only stop fighting once their opponent has fled their territory, or if they have collapsed from sheer exhaustion. Their tenacity and protectiveness has led to them being raised in museums and libraries, so they will consider the buildings o be their territory, and protect them from thieves and criminals. Lenora is a Normal-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Unova region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlumeria, the Sister Pok\u00e9mon. Though they may appear intimidating at first glance, and will often be hostile to new people or Pok\u00e9mon they encounter, wild Plumerias have been observed caring for young Pok\u00e9mon that have been lost or abandoned in their territory. Plumerias secrete poison from a gland on their stomach, and they coat their braids with this poison when they attack. When travelling on Ula\u2019ula Island, it is best to avoid young Pok\u00e9mon, as even approaching them can cause a wild Plumeria to attack. Plumeria is a Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Alola region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia, the Humble Pok\u00e9mon. Originally found on Akala Island, wild Pokemon have been known to gather around wild Olivias for protection, and Olivias will take their role as protector seriously, and rarely display fear when defending others. However, young Olivias are often clumsy and destructive, so older Olivias will teach them how to control themselves to ensure the safety of themselves and others. Olivia is a Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Alola region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine, the Defence Pok\u00e9mon. Wild Jasmines are shy and non-confrontational, but their frail appearance hides a sturdiness that enables them to take a head-on attack from a charging Tauros without flinching or moving an inch. Jasmines have a noticeable fondness for Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon, particularly Ampharos, and wild Jasmines can often be found amidst a flock of Mareeps and Flaaffies. Jasmine is a Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Johto region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly, the Pirate Pok\u00e9mon. Shellies have an instinctive knowledge of the local weather conditions, and can often be seen gathering a few hours before it rains. During rainstorms, Shellies will often frolic and play around with each other. Shellies also have gills on their necks, allowing them to breathe underwater. Wild Shellies will often make their homes in old shipwrecks, and will fiercely defend any treasure they find. Shelly is a Water-type Pok\u00e9mon, native to the Hoenn region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus smiled, and put his Pok\u00e9dex away. The world was now completely different, with eighteen kinds of Human Pok\u00e9mon out there. Haxorus couldn\u2019t wait to go out and catch them all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Haxorus do next?</span></div></div>",

As he entered the laboratory, he saw a naked blonde woman standing behind Alexa, and Haxorus realised that the naked woman was a Viola that must have belonged to Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again for your time, Professor,\u201d said Alexa as Haxorus walked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s my pleasure,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cI must admit, I was surprised to hear that the Santalune City Gym Leader was asking me for an interview.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, even Gym Leaders need to take vacations every now and then,\u201d said Alexa. \u201cAnd since I am still a journalist, I decided I might as well get some footage for a TV special about Professor Oak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look forward to seeing it,\u201d said Professor Oak. He looked up, and saw Haxorus walking towards him. \u201cAh, Georgia. Is there something I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yes,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cYou see, I recently caught a Jenny and a Joy, and I was wondering what you could tell me about Human Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Human Pok\u00e9mon are truly one of the greatest mysteries of the world,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cThe first species of Human Pok\u00e9mon, Jenny, I believe, was first discovered about twenty years ago, and we still don\u2019t know much about them. Every Pok\u00e9mon Professor I\u2019ve spoken with has been fascinated by them, and they\u2019ve captured the interest of the public as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cViola,\u201d said Alexa\u2019s Viola. \u201cLa, Viola, Vi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa nodded. \u201cViola says that she\u2019s glad more people are taking an interest in Human Pok\u00e9mon now. Speaking of which, you said there would be a summit of some sort about Human Pok\u00e9mon next week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cPok\u00e9mon Professors from around the world are coming here to Pallet Town, and they\u2019ll be bringing the Human Pok\u00e9mon native to their regions. There are even plans to give some away to everyone that attends the summit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but we\u2019ll only be giving one Human Pok\u00e9mon to each person in attendance, so you\u2019ll have to choose wisely,\u201d said Professor Oak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be at the summit, too,\u201d said Alexa. \u201cThe Lumiose Press wanted me to cover it, which is why I asked you for that interview today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting in before the rush?\u201d asked Professor Oak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVi Vi!\u201d said Alexa\u2019s Viola, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you, Georgia?\u201d Professor Oak. \u201cWill you attend the summit next week?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Wild Jasmines, on the other hand, are much more common in the area between Olivine City and Ecruteak City.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d said Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for Hoenn, Phoebes are very common in Mount Pyre,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cShellies are more common near Lilycove City, but they\u2019ve also been found inland, near Fortree City, where there\u2019s regular rainfall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn Sinnoh, Gardenias can often be found in Eterna Forest, while Candices are normally found in the north, near Snowpoint City,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cBut they both like to gather on Mount Coronet. Meanwhile, in Unova, Lenoras are most common in the Pinwheel Forest, just east of Nacrene City. Elesas can usually be found in Chargestone Cave, but they\u2019re also common around Nimbasa City. There are also plenty of Skylas flying above the Unova region, but they rarely ever touch the ground. However, they do like to make their nests in Mistralton City. In the Kalos region, Violas are very common in Santalune Forest, while Graces are often found near Vaniville Town and Aquacorde Town. Malvas, on the other hand, are more common in the mountains to the east of Lumiose City. And finally, in the Alola region, Olivias can be found on Akala Island, while Plumerias are often found on Ula\u2019ula Island.\u201d Professor Oak paused, and realised he\u2019d been speaking for quite some time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got a little carried away there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cThat was all so fascinating to listen to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it was a great speech,\u201d said Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVi, Vi!\u201d said Alexa\u2019s Viola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever considered hosting a radio show?\u201d asked Alexa. \u201cI think you\u2019d be wonderful at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the Goldenrod Radio Tower did approach me a few years back,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cMaybe I should see if they\u2019re still interested...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Oak cleared his throat. \u201cAnyway, I do believe it\u2019s getting rather late, and I believe your friends are waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus looked behind her, and saw Ashley, Iris and Cilan walking up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Georgia,\u201d said Iris. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not much,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cJust asking Professor Oak a few things about Human Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she was very interested in the subject,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cSpeaking of, there\u2019s a summit about Human Pok\u00e9mon being held here next week, with Pok\u00e9mon Professors and Human Pok\u00e9mon from around the world. We\u2019re even giving away Human Pok\u00e9mon to those who attend. Are you three interested in attending as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d said Ashley. \u201cI\u2019d love to go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here,\u201d said Iris. \u201cI hope they have some Clairs to give out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to attend as well,\u201d said Cilan. \u201cThough, personally, I\u2019d like to obtain a Grace, myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Graces are cool,\u201d said Ash. \u201cGracie\u2019s been a big help for Mimey and Dad while I was out travelling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cThe summit is in four days time, so you have some time to spare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d said Ashley. \u201cCome on, guys, let\u2019s head back to my place.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Haxorus followed Ashley, Iris and Cilan back to Ashley\u2019s house. Ash, Iris and Cilan were talking about the upcoming summit, and they were all oblivious to the fact that, a few hours ago, most of the Human Pok\u00e9mon they were talking about didn\u2019t exist. Haxorus was still having trouble believing that. The remote had changed the entire world, not only creating new species of Pok\u00e9mon that looked like humans, but also having other people filling in the roles that had been left behind by the people that had been turned into Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus remembered that, before he had found the remote, Alexa had said that she had a sister who was a Gym Leader in the Kalos region. Now, Alexa had taken her sister\u2019s place as that Gym Leader, and her sister, Viola, was now a species of Human Pok\u00e9mon. That made Haxorus wonder about what had happened to the original Viola. When he\u2019d first turned Jenny into a Human Pok\u00e9mon, he\u2019d caught the Jenny he had used the remote on, meaning he had the original Jenny. But when he\u2019d used the remote to turn Joy into a Human Pok\u00e9mon, the Joy he\u2019d used the remote on was still at the Pokemon Centre between Pallet Town and Viridian City, and the Joy he had with him was new. Haxorus had no idea if the Joy he\u2019d caught had previously been human, or if she\u2019d been brought into existence by the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Haxorus decided it didn\u2019t matter. Even if his Joy was just over a day old, she was still a Pok\u00e9mon with her own hopes and dreams, and Haxorus figured that was what really mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group arrived at Ashley\u2019s house, Haxorus noticed a Rhyhorn walking around the house. Riding on the Rhyhorn\u2019s back was a woman with blue eyes and brown hair, with a golden hair clip in her hair. Haxorus recognised her as a Grace, one of the Human Pok\u00e9mon he had created, but was somewhat surprised to see that she was wearing the clothes Delia Ketchum had been wearing before she had swapped genders with her son and become Dale Ketchum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Grace yours?\u201d Haxorus asked, pointing at the Grace and her Rhyhorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s Gracie,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cShe and her Rhyhorn belong to Dad. We didn\u2019t see her earlier because she was taking her Rhyhorn out for a walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is she wearing clothes, though?\u201d Haxorus asked. \u201cI thought Pok\u00e9mon didn\u2019t need to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cBut since Human Pok\u00e9mon look like human women, there are some people that get upset when they see a Human Pok\u00e9mon that isn\u2019t wearing clothes. Besides, some Human Pok\u00e9mon just like to wear clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cI guess that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Gracie!\u201d said Ashley, waving at the Human Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace!\u201d said Gracie happily, waving back. She climbed off the back of her Rhyhorn and walked up to the front door, opening it as Ashley walked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Ashley as Gracie held the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace,\u201d said Gracie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus followed Ashley, Iris and Cilan inside, and Gracie came in and shut the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Mime,\u201d said Mimey as he came downstairs and walked up to Gracie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace,\u201d said Gracie, smiling at Mimey. She bent over and kissed Mimey on the cheek, causing Mimey to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMime, Mime,\u201d said Mimey bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre Mimey and Gracie together?\u201d Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey sure are,\u201d said Dale as he entered the room. \u201cThey hit it off when they first met, and they\u2019ve been inseparable ever since. In fact, I think there\u2019s something you two need to tell Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace,\u201d said Gracie, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said Ashley. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie walked around a corner and out of sight, and came back a few moments later. When she returned, Gracie was carrying a brown Pok\u00e9mon egg that had a yellow triangle on the side, similar to the golden hair clip Gracie wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace, Grace Grace,\u201d said Gracie, holding up the Pok\u00e9mon egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you and Mimey having a baby?\u201d Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace,\u201d said Gracie, smiling happily as she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace,\u201d said Gracie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMime Mime!\u201d said Mimey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGracie, Mimey and I were talking earlier,\u201d Dale said, turning to Ashley, Iris, Cilan and Haxorus. \u201cWe all agreed that we want one of you to take Gracie\u2019s egg and look after it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but Gracie was having trouble making up her mind as to who would get the egg,\u201d said Dale. \u201cI think she\u2019s made her decision now, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace,\u201d said Gracie, nodding. She stepped forward, and held her egg out to one of the Trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Gracie give her egg to?</span></div></div>",

Cilan volunteered to sleep on the couch, so Iris and Haxorus could share the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris had fallen asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow, but Haxorus\u2019 mind was still racing from excitement as he thought about what he had done with the remote over the last few days. He still couldn\u2019t believe that it had only been a few days since he had found the remote, and that no-one had noticed any of the changes he\u2019d made with the remote. First, he\u2019d swapped bodies and lives with Iris\u2019 rival Georgia, then used the remote to make Iris and Georgia friends. Yesterday, he\u2019d learned that he could successfully use the remote on pictures of people, and he\u2019d discovered what was quickly becoming his favourite button on the remote. He\u2019d turned three people, Officer Jenny, Nurse Joy and Sabrina, into species of Pok\u00e9mon. While they looked like human women, the three of them now acted like any other Pok\u00e9mon. And today, Haxorus had learned that the remote could swap things between two other people, rather than just with himself and his target. He\u2019d found that out when he\u2019d swapped Ash and Delia Ketchum\u2019s genders, turning them into Ashley and Dale Ketchum, respectively. He\u2019d also created fifteen new species of Human Pok\u00e9mon, using Viola, Karen, Clair, Elesa, Malva, Skyla, Phoebe, Gardenia, Grace, Candice, Lenora, Plumeria, Olivia, Jasmine and Shelly as his targets. Now, there was one Human Pok\u00e9mon of each type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus was still wondering just how much the world had changed with the creation of eighteen kinds of Human Pok\u00e9mon. Professor Oak had revealed that, four days from now, there was going to be a summit held in Pallet Town that would be all about Human Pok\u00e9mon. Other Pok\u00e9mon Professors would arrive with the Human Pok\u00e9mon from their regions, and they were going to give away a Human Pok\u00e9mon to each Pok\u00e9mon Trainer that attended. Haxorus had to wonder just what kind of Human Pokemon he\u2019d pick when the time came. They all seemed so interesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus sighed quietly. He\u2019d need to find something to do for the next few days, until the summit came around. Haxorus rolled over, and reached down to his bag. He pulled it out and looked at it. Finding the remote had been one of the best things to happen to him, but there were still so many buttons he hadn\u2019t tried yet. Maybe he should try them out now...</span></div></div>",

Joy!\u201d said Joy, smiling as she jumped up and down in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus opened the Pok\u00e9ball, and Phoebe came out, still fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy,\u201d said Joy as she clasped her hands over her chest, and waves of blue energy emanated from Joy\u2019s body with a sound like a bell being rung.

Iris climbed onto Georgia\u2019s back, and Gracie climbed onto the back of her Rhyhorn. Haxorus returned the last of his Pok\u00e9mon to their Pok\u00e9balls, then climbed onto Rhyhorn\u2019s back behind Gracie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Gracie, back to Pallet Town,\u201d Haxorus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace,\u201d said Gracie, stirring her Rhyhorn into motion. Iris also got Georgia moving, and Georgia began walking alongside Gracie\u2019s Rhyhorn, carrying the two Pok\u00e9mon Trainers and the Human Pok\u00e9mon back to Pallet Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are we still planning on exploring Pallet Town when we get back?\u201d Haxorus asked as Rhyhorn plodded along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah,\u201d said Iris, shaking her head. \u201cNot today, anyway. I say we get our Pok\u00e9mon checked out at the Pok\u00e9mon Centre, then call it a day. We can explore Pallet Town tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Haxorus, nodding. \u201cCan you take us to the Pok\u00e9mon Centre, please?\u201d she said to Gracie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace,\u201d said Gracie with a smile and a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Gracie\u2019s Rhyhorn had reached Pallet Town, and she steered her Rhyhorn to the town\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Centre. They soon arrived at the Pok\u00e9mon Centre, and Haxorus slid of Rhyhorn\u2019s back as Iris jumped off Georgia\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Gracie,\u201d said Haxorus as Iris returned Georgia to her Pok\u00e9ball. \u201cCan you wait for us here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace, Grace,\u201d said Gracie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again,\u201d said Haxorus. She walked into the Pok\u00e9mon Centre, and to her surprise, she found Ashley was there, deep in conversation with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was Ashley talking to?</span></div></div>",

Hey, Georgia!\u201d said Ashley, waving Iris and Haxorus over. As Haxorus walked up to her, she saw that Ashley was sitting with a girl, probably about the same age as him, with brown hair and blue eyes, wearing a red shirt, a red headband, and white shorts over a pair of black bike shorts. Sitting next to the girl was a young boy with dark brown eyes and dark bluish-black hair, wearing a green shirt and a large pair of glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who are your friends?\u201d Iris asked as she walked up to Ashley\u2019s table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIris, Georgia, this is May and Max,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cThey travelled with me through Hoenn. May, Max, this is Iris and Georgia, some of my friends from Unova.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d said May, waving at Iris and Haxorus. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you.

They can also use their dances to summon Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon to assist them in battle. Phoebes are often found in graveyards, and other places where people and Pok\u00e9mon are laid to rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dancer, huh?\u201d said May. \u201cI think I could come up with a few interesting Contest routines if I had a Phoebe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoe, Be,\u201d said Phoebe, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, we need to get our Pok\u00e9mon healed up,\u201d said Iris, walking over to the counter. \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ashley, as Haxorus returned Phoebe to her Pok\u00e9ball. Once she\u2019d returned Phoebe, Haxorus joined Iris at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the Pok\u00e9mon Centre,\u201d said Doctor Jules. \u201cHow can I help you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a quick check-up,\u201d said Iris, placing her Pok\u00e9balls in the tray Doctor Jules provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Doctor Jules. \u201cJoy will have them healed up in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy Joy!\u201d said the Joy standing next to Doctor Jules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus also handed her Pok\u00e9mon over to Doctor Jules, then followed Iris back over to Ashley, May and Max.

It\u2019s getting really hard to find clothes in my size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d said Max. \u201cWish I was even half as tall as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you really don\u2019t,\u201d said May. \u201cI keep having to duck under doors, and I\u2019m always outgrowing my clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what brought you two to Kanto, anyway?\u201d said Haxorus as she sat down next to Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for the Human Pok\u00e9mon summit,\u201d said Max. \u201cProfessor Birch invited me to come with him as an assistant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019ll be talking about how Human Pok\u00e9mon have adapted to locations similar to their native habitats in other regions,\u201d said May. \u201cWhen I heard the summit was going to be in Pallet Town, I decided to meet Max and Professor Birch here after I finished competing in the Johto Grand Festival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was on at the same time as the Vertress Conference, right?\u201d said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, yeah,\u201d said May. \u201cI guess you were too busy battling to watch the Grand Festival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ended up as the runner-up, though I managed to beat Drew in the semi-finals,\u201d said May. \u201cDawn also made it to the semi-finals, but she was beaten by Lisia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s Lisia?\u201d Haxorus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a Pok\u00e9mon Coordinator from Sootopolis City, in Hoenn,\u201d said May. \u201cShe managed to beat me in the finals. I think she\u2019s also Wallace\u2019s niece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cShe must be good if she was able to beat both you and Dawn. Speaking of Dawn, how is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing great,\u201d said May. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she went back to Sinnoh to visit her family after the Johto Grand Festival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, Haxorus saw the Pok\u00e9mon Centre\u2019s Joy walking up to their table, carrying two trays full of Pok\u00e9balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy, Joy Joy, Joy,\u201d said the Pok\u00e9mon Centre\u2019s Joy as she placed the trays on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Iris as she took her Pok\u00e9balls. Haxorus also claimed her Pok\u00e9balls, and Joy bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy Joy!\u201d she said, then walked back over to Doctor Jules at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are you and Max staying?\u201d Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re staying here at the Pok\u00e9mon Centre,\u201d said May. \u201cAlthough Ashley did invite us over to her place for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll show you guys the way,\u201d said Ashley, standing up. Max, Iris and Haxorus also stood up, then May stood up, towering over the others and dwarfing her little brother. The group followed Ashley out of the Pokemon Centre, and May had to duck so she could make it through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace, Grace!\u201d said Gracie, waving at Ashley as she came out of the Pok\u00e9mon Centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Gracie,\u201d said Ashley, waving back. \u201cThanks for looking after Iris and Georgia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace!\u201d said Gracie with a smile. She then spurred her Rhyhorn into motion, and her Rhyhorn began plodding along in the direction of Ashley\u2019s house, followed by Ashley, May, Max, Iris and Haxorus.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day had passed without incident. Ashley and Gracie led May, Max, Iris and Haxorus back to her house, and later in the day, Dale and Cilan returned from Pallet House, Dale\u2019s restaurant. The group had eaten dinner at Ashley\u2019s house, and after dinner, May and Max headed back to the Pok\u00e9mon Centre, where they had booked rooms for the next few days. Cilan also headed to the Pok\u00e9mon Centre, to book himself a room, while Iris and Haxorus stayed in the guest room at Ashley\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Haxorus thought about what she had accomplished during the day. She\u2019d caught a new Human Pok\u00e9mon, Phoebe, and discovered two new functions of the remote. Haxorus had used the remote on Jessie and James, fusing them into a single person named Jamie. She had noticed that Iris had referred to the fusion, Jamie, using gender neutral pronouns, like they and them. Was Jamie somehow both male and female?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus\u2019 mind wandered to the other function of the remote she\u2019d discovered today. When she\u2019d used the remote on May, she\u2019d shot up in size, and May was now seven feet tall. As far as May was concerned, her height, while unusual for someone her age, was also completely natural, as May had mentioned having another growth spurt while she was travelling through Johto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus frowned, as a strange thought crossed her mind. She realised that, just before Team Rocket had attacked her and Iris, she had started thinking of herself as a girl, rather than as a boy. She knew she was really a male Haxorus, living in a human girl\u2019s life and body. However, nobody was aware of that fact, not even Georgia, who Haxorus had swapped with in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it\u2019s a side effect of having a female body, thought Haxorus. The longer I have a girl\u2019s body, the more I\u2019ll start to think like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat worried Haxorus slightly. He could still remember his old life as Iris\u2019 Axew, before he had found the remote. However, Haxorus was worried that, the longer he stayed in Georgia\u2019s life, the more he\u2019d start to think he was Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus yawned, and rolled over in her bed. She supposed it didn\u2019t really matter to her if she called herself Haxorus or if she called herself Georgia. As long as she could still remember how the world used to be before she\u2019d found the remote, she could live with her mind adapting to suit her new body and life. She closed her eyes, and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus woke up the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to go. She quickly changed clothes, then headed downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale had already left to go to work, but Ashley and Iris were still at the table, eating breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Georgia,\u201d said Iris as Haxorus sat down at the table for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, guys,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan for today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, after that battle with Team Rocket, we never got around to exploring Pallet Town like we wanted to,\u201d said Iris. \u201cI was thinking we could just wander around town for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re meeting up with May and Max for lunch at Pallet House,\u201d said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cHey, Ashley, did you want to come with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I was home. It might be nice to see what\u2019s changed and what\u2019s still the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d said Iris as she finished her breakfast. \u201cThen let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus and Ashley soon finished their breakfast as well, and soon set off to explore Pallet Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Ashley, Iris and Haxorus find while exploring Pallet Town?</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d been in cities and towns before, but that had been as a Pok\u00e9mon, and she\u2019d usually been in her Pok\u00e9ball or resting in Iris\u2019 hair. As a human, everything seemed completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Georgia?\u201d Iris asked playfully. \u201cNever seen a town before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cUh, well, it\u2019s just that... everything here\u2019s so different, you know? It\u2019s nothing like Unova.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s true,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cEverything is still like I remember it, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them continued walking for a few minutes, until Ashley came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Ashley, looking to one side. \u201cThat\u2019s new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus looked over at the shop Ashley was looking at. It seemd to be a clothing store of some kind, with mannequins dressed in women\u2019s clothing on display. Strangely, the mannequins were wearing the uniforms that Jenny and Joy had been wearing before Haxorus had turned them into species of Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Human Pok\u00e9mon Boutique,\u201d said Iris, reading the sign above the door. \u201cThey must sell clothing for Human Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s check it out,\u201d said Haxorus, and she walked towards the shop, with Ashley and Iris following behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus walked through the Boutique\u2019s open door, and saw a Sabrina wearing a white tunic with purple trim on the sleeves and a purple belt, as well as a pair of loose-fitting blue pants and matching blue shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrina,\u201d said the Sabrina, and she began to change. The Sabrina\u2019s eyes faded from red to an electric blue, and her dark green-black hair darkened to pure black, and began to change shape, shortening to a bob-cut, with two long jagged braids in the front. A pair of white headphones formed over her ears, and a red and white striped antenna popped out on the right side of her headphones, and a blue and white striped antenna popped out of the left side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElesa,\u201d said the Elesa after she finished reversing her Transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cThat was so cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSa, Elesa El,\u201d said the Elesa with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, thank you, Elesa,\u201d said a voice from behind the counter, and Haxorus saw an older man with a grey beard stepping out of a back room. \u201cWelcome to the Human Pok\u00e9mon Boutique. My name is Geoffrey. Can I help you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yeah,\u201d said Haxorus. She pulled out three of her Pok\u00e9balls, and sent out Jenny, Joy and Phoebe. Once the three Human Pok\u00e9mon had emerged from their Pok\u00e9balls, they looked around in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I buy clothes for my Human Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d Haxorus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can,\u201d said Geoffrey. \u201cWe have clothing for every kind of Human Pok\u00e9mon here. If your Human Pok\u00e9mon find something they like, Elesa here can Transform into them and try the clothes on, to show your Human Pok\u00e9mon what they would look like when they wear the clothes they select.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s so cool!\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cWhat do you three say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoebe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then, have a look around,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cIf you see something you like, let me know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, Joy and Phoebe nodded, and the three of them started to wander through the shop, looking for something interesting to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Jenny, Joy and Phoebe buy?</span></div></div>",

Once they had their outfits, Haxorus paid for the items, then the three Human Pok\u00e9mon rushed over to the fitting rooms, giggling with excitement. A few minutes later, Jenny, Joy and Phoebe emerged, dressed in their new outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was now wearing a red varsity jacket with white trim. The jacket had a side-on picture of a Gyarados head on either side of the zipper, with a full picture of a Gyarados on the back. She wore a black shirt under the jacket, and a short black skirt.

The dress was decorated with a white floral pattern, and an Alolan Exeggcutor on the left side.

It was a black Pok\u00e9ball with a red band in the middle, with a red circle on the top half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that your Pok\u00e9ball?\u201d Haxorus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEl,\u201d said Elesa with a nod. She reached a hand out and tapped the button on the face of the Luxury Ball, and a red beam pulled her into the Luxury Ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Geoffrey. \u201cI hope you treat her well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Haxorus, nodding. \u201cThank you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus left the Boutique, followed by Jenny, Joy and Phoebe, and they met Ashley and Iris outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kept you?\u201d asked Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the shopkeeper, Geoffrey, he wanted me to have one of his Elesas,\u201d said Haxorus, showing Ashley and Iris the Luxury Ball. \u201cI need to go to the Pok\u00e9mon Centre and sign up for the Pok\u00e9mon Storage System. Meet you two at Pallet House?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d said Iris, and she and Ashley began walking one way, while Haxorus began walking the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Haxorus arrived at the Pok\u00e9mon Centre, and quickly made her way over to one of the PCs. She found that she could use the computer easily, thanks to skills that had been transferred over from Georgia\u2019s life, and quickly made an account with the Pok\u00e9mon Storage System. Once she finished registering, Haxorus looked over at the device beside the computer that was designed to teleport Pok\u00e9balls from place to place. She knew she wanted to keep Jenny, Joy, Phoebe and Elesa on her team, so she\u2019d have to put either Beartic, Bisharp or Vanilluxe into storage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of her Pok\u00e9mon does Haxorus put in storage?</span></div></div>",

Turning around, she saw Doctor Jules (the doctor who replaced Nurse Joy when she became a Pok\u00e9mon species) looking at her behind the counter, along with Chansey and Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it's so weird. So, my Pok\u00e9mon's data now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" Jules said as he sat down in a chair behind the desk. \"When you received your Pok\u00e9Dex, it also registers the PC storage system to that region's lab.

Why don't you give her a call if you're concerned about Vanilluxe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joy, Joy!\" Jules' Joy said, wearing a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will...but if I may ask, why doesn't your Joy wear clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't feel comfortable wearing clothes, so I don't force her. It all depends on personal taste, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccepting the answer, Haxorus used the phone next to the computer to place a call to Professor Juniper, after looking up her number. When the phone on the other end picked up, Haxorus saw a beautiful woman with brown hair, a white tank top, greek skirt, red sneakers and a lab coat on the other end. \"Hello? Professor Juniper here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi, my name's Georgia. I was wondering if you got my Vanilluxe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the one who sent this lovely Pok\u00e9mon?\" Juniper asked, motioning to Vanilluxe as she floated up to the screen to see her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Vanilluxe. Sorry, but I got a new Pok\u00e9mon, and I wanted to spend some more time with her. Could you ever forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Va, Vanilluxe!\" Vanilluxe responded with a smile as Juniper got back on the screen. \"I think it will be just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Juniper?\" a voice offscreen said as Juniper turned around. Haxorus then saw a woman with long purple hair, a closed lab coat, pink shirt, red glasses and pink hair ornament holding a folder with lots of papers. \"Are you ready for the summit next week at Professor Oak's lab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost,\" Juniper replied as Haxorus...</span></div></div>",

Apparently, the remote had made Professor Juniper and Fennel fall in love with each other. As a Pok\u00e9mon, or rather, a former Pok\u00e9mon, she wasn\u2019t quite sure how to feel about that. It wasn\u2019t very common for two female Pok\u00e9mon to fall in love with each other, at least in her experience. Maybe it was different for humans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus shrugged, and stood up. She figured that if nobody else had a problem with it, then there was no reason for her to worry about it. She left the Pok\u00e9mon Centre, then began walking towards Pallet House, the restaurant that Ashley\u2019s father Dale ran. Ashley had shown Haxorus and Iris the way to Pallet House earlier in the day. Hopefully, she could still remember the way...</span></div></div>",

Iris headed back into Pallet Town, and Ashley, Haxorus, May and Max walked over to Professor Oak\u2019s laboratory. As the four of them reached the laboratory, Haxorus noticed that Professor Oak was speaking to another man. The man had brown hair and a beard, and was wearing a blue shirt and khaki shorts under his white lab coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that with Professor Oak?\u201d Haxorus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Professor Birch,\u201d said May, who was walking slowly so as not to outpace the others. \u201cHe\u2019s the Pok\u00e9mon Professor of the Hoenn region.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, you mentioned him yesterday,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cYou said he was going to be making a presentation at the summit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Max. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the other speakers are going to be, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s ask Professor Oak,\u201d said Ashley as she walked up to the two professors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello Ashley,\u201d said Professor Birch when he saw Ashley. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it has,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing well,\u201d said Professor Birch. \u201cWhat about you? How are your Hoenn Pok\u00e9mon doing here in Kanto?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve all been doing really well,\u201d said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d said Professor Birch. He turned away from Ashley and towards Georgia. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met. I\u2019m Professor Birch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Georgia,\u201d said Haxorus with a smile. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Professor Oak,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cI know Professor Birch is going to be one of the speakers at the summit, but I was wondering, who else is going to be speaking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at the moment, we have three guest speakers,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cProfessor Juniper from Unova will be up first, and she\u2019ll be talking about what we know about the origins of Human Pok\u00e9mon. Then, Professor Elm from Johto will speak about Human Pok\u00e9mon and the Pok\u00e9mon they can breed with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Birch nodded. \u201cAfter that, I\u2019ll be delivering my talk,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m planning to talk about how Human Pok\u00e9mon have adapted to locations with similar habitats to the places they can be found in their native regions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be closing out the summit by talking about how Human Pok\u00e9mon have integrated into both human and Pok\u00e9mon societies,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cThere will also be showcases of the various Human Pok\u00e9mon scattered throughout the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where exactly are you planning on having the summit?\u201d May asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re setting up in one of the fields near here,\u201d said Professor Oak, looking up at May. \u201cThe stage is being set up now, but I\u2019ll need your help to set up the chairs tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said May. \u201cYou can count on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll also need help sorting out the Human Pok\u00e9mon that have already arrived,\u201d said Professor Birch. \u201cWe\u2019ve already received the Human Pok\u00e9mon from Kanto, Hoenn, Kalos and Alola, and we should be getting the Johto, Sinnoh and Unova Human Pok\u00e9mon tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can help with that,\u201d said Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help too,\u201d said Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cCome with me, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Oak opened the door, and Ashley\u2019s Pikachu came running out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPika Pi!\u201d said Pikachu happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, buddy!\u201d said Ashley, kneeling down so Pikachu could climb up on her shoulder. \u201cHave fun visiting everyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChaa!\u201d said Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Oak led Haxorus and Max into the laboratory, and he brought them to the Pok\u00e9ball storage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where we\u2019ve been keeping the Human Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cWe plan to have a dozen of all eighteen species of Human Pok\u00e9mon to give away to Trainers that attend the summit. We\u2019re also going to have a dozen of the Unova, Kalos and Alola variants of Jenny and Joy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Haxorus, looking at the massive group of Pokeballs. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is, and we need help sorting through them,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cI\u2019ve already sorted out the Kanto Human Pok\u00e9mon, so we just need to sort out the Hoenn, Kalos and Alola Human Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Max. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the Hoenn Human Pok\u00e9mon are over there,\u201d said Professor Oak, pointing at a pile of Pok\u00e9balls. \u201cThe Shellies are all in Dive Balls, and the Phoebes are in Dusk Balls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it,\u201d said Max, walking over to the pile of Pok\u00e9balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat pile over there contains the Human Pok\u00e9mon from Alola,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cThe Alolan Joys are in Heal Balls, the Alolan Jennies are in Timer Balls, the Plumerias are in Nest Balls, and the Olivias are in Friend Balls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Haxorus as she walked over to the pile of Pok\u00e9balls that Professor Oak had pointed at. Sure enough, the pile contained four different kinds of Pok\u00e9ball, and Haxorus picked one up, a pink Pok\u00e9ball with a blue band around the middle and a blue button, with white markings around the button. Georgia\u2019s memories told Haxorus that the Pok\u00e9ball in her hand was actually a Heal Ball. Haxorus put the Heal Ball to one side, and she quickly found the other eleven Heal Balls and put them together in a neat pile. She then picked up a white Pok\u00e9ball with a red ridge on the top half, and Haxorus recognised it as a Timer Ball. As Haxorus began gathering the Timer Balls, she looked over her shoulder at Max and Professor Oak. Both of them were busy sorting out the piles of Pok\u00e9balls in front of them. While they were distracted, she could use the remote on them...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Haxorus shook her head, and turned her attention back to the pile of Pok\u00e9balls in front of her. To her surprise, she hadn\u2019t really felt like using the remote today. She\u2019d really only felt the urge to use it once, and that had been when she made Professor Juniper and Doctor Fennel a married couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Haxorus sorted the Pok\u00e9balls in front of her, her mind wandered to the changes she had made with the remote over the last few days. Last week, she\u2019d been a male Axew, but now, she was a human girl, and there were eighteen species of Pok\u00e9mon that looked like human women. Haxorus knew that, when she had turned Nurse Joy into a species of Pokemon, a new person, Doctor Jules, had taken the role of Pok\u00e9mon Centre Doctor. Who had taken the places of the other seventeen women that had been turned into Pok\u00e9mon? They had all been important or well-known figures, since most of them were involved in the Pok\u00e9mon Leagues of various regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but at least one new business had popped up due to the creation of the Human Pok\u00e9mon. People now sold clothes that could be worn by Human Pok\u00e9mon, but Haxorus was curious about when that business had been created. Had it existed when Officer Jenny was the only person that had been turned into a Human Pok\u00e9mon? Or had it been created when she\u2019d created fifteen new Human Pok\u00e9mon species at once?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the Human Pok\u00e9mon summit, which was scheduled for the day after tomorrow. The remote had obviously changed history when it had created the Human Pok\u00e9mon, but Haxorus was slightly surprised at how little was known about Human Pok\u00e9mon, even though everyone believed they\u2019d been around for about twenty years. The fact that such a big event was focusing entirely on the Human Pok\u00e9mon was proof that the world was now very different from what it had been only last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much she just didn\u2019t know about this new world she had created. Because she was so fascinated by how much things had changed, Haxorus had started using the remote less and less. On the first day she\u2019d had the remote, she\u2019d used it four times, and three times on the second day. She\u2019d used the remote the most on her third day with the remote, when she\u2019d created fifteen new Human Pokemon, one after the other. Yesterday, she\u2019d used the remote twice, and today, she\u2019d only used it once. Haxorus found that she actually really liked the world as it was now, so she didn\u2019t want to change things up too much anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter briefly checking that the remote was still in her pocket, Haxorus finished sorting out the pile of Pok\u00e9balls, separating out the Heal Balls, the Timer Balls, the Nest Balls and the Friend Balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Haxorus when she was finished. \u201cAll done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d said Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent work, you two,\u201d said Professor Oak as he organised the Pok\u00e9balls in front of him. \u201cI\u2019ll finish sorting the Human Pok\u00e9mon from Kalos myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything else we can do to help?\u201d Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not right now,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cI will need your help tomorrow morning, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Haxorus, and she and Max walked out of Professor Oak\u2019s laboratory, where Ashley and May were waiting for them.</span></div></div>",

Ashley and Bulbasaur high-fived, and Ashley returned Bulbasaur as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready for the next battle?\u201d Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet,\u201d said Haxorus, standing up as she grabbed another Pok\u00e9ball. \u201cJenny, you\u2019re up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus threw Jenny\u2019s Pok\u00e9ball into the air, and Jenny emerged from her Pok\u00e9ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d she said as she came out of her Pokeball. Once she saw she was in a battle, Jenny removed her cap, and handed it to Haxorus. She then took off her red jacket, and passed that to Haxorus as well. Finally, Jenny removed her boots and put them on the ground next to Haxorus. Jenny was now wearing only her black shirt and skirt, as well as her stockings. Now that she was no longer worried about her clothes getting damaged in the battle, Jenny moved into a combat stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d she said, ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Quilava!

She lowered her head, and a massive geyser of fire shot out from the flames on the back of her head. The Eruption hit Jenny, knocking her back and setting her shirt on fire. Jenny quickly pulled off the charred remains of her shirt and tossed it aside, exposing her bare breasts, leaving her in just her skirt and her stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny! Use Disable!\u201d Haxorus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNy!\u201d said Jenny as her eyes flashed blue, and Quilava was briefly surrounded by a blue aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, follow it up with Karate Chop!\u201d said Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuilava, use Flame Wheel!\u201d ordered Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d said Jenny as her hand glowed white, and she charged at Quilava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuilava!\u201d said Quilava, cloaking herself in flames as she curled up into a ball. Quilava began rolling towards Jenny, and there was a loud bang as Jenny\u2019s Karate Chop struck Quilava\u2019s Flame Wheel. Quilava was knocked to the side and uncurled herself, while Jenny was knocked to the other side with her hand on fire. Jenny shook her hand, dispersing the flames, but Haxorus could see that Jenny\u2019s hand had been burned by Quilava\u2019s Flame Wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s finish this quickly!\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cUse Low Kick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen!\u201d said Jenny as she began running towards Quilava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse Flamethrower to keep her back!\u201d said Ashley. \u201cDon\u2019t let her get close!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuil!\u201d said Quilava as the flames on her back grew hotter. She opened her mouth, and a stream of fire shot out from her mouth. Jenny dodged the flames, and circled around to come in at a different angle, but Quilava turned and fired another Flamethrower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like Jenny\u2019s fast enough to avoid Quilava\u2019s Flamethrower,\u201d said May, looking down at her younger brother. \u201cI think she\u2019s trying to tire Quilava out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but that burn on Jenny\u2019s hand is weakening her,\u201d said Max, craning his head to look up at May. \u201cJenny will probably be the one to tire out first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was puffing with exhaustion, and had a pained expression on her face. However, she was still able to dodge Quilava\u2019s next Flamethrower. As she used Flamethrower, Quilava\u2019s body was briefly surrounded by a blue aura as Jenny\u2019s Disable wore off, allowing her to use Eruption again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny, use Disable again, then use Low Kick!\u201d said Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d said Jenny as her eyes flashed blue again. Once more, Quilava was surrounded by a blue aura, and the stream of fire shooting out of her mouth came to an abrupt stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d Jenny yelled as she ran up to Quilava and kicked at her, aiming for Quilava\u2019s legs. Jenny swept Quilava\u2019s legs out from under her, causing her to fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, use Karate Chop!\u201d said Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNy!\u201d Jenny said as her hands glowed white again, and she struck at Quilava, knocking her over and causing the flames on her back to go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s it for Quilava,\u201d said Ashley as she knelt down next to her Pok\u00e9mon. \u201cGreat battle, Georgia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cYou did great, Jenny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d said Jenny, smiling happily. She then winced, and held up her burned hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNy...\u201d Jenny moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Haxorus, holding out a Pok\u00e9ball. Joy emerged from the Pok\u00e9ball, and she immediately saw the burn on Jenny\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy,\u201d she said as she clasped her hands over her chest and used Heal Bell. The sound of a bell chiming rang out as blue waves of energy washed over Jenny, causing her burns to heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Joy,\u201d said Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny!\u201d said Jenny, giving Joy a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy,\u201d said Joy, curtsying. Haxorus returned Joy to her Pok\u00e9ball, and Jenny picked up her boots and put them back on. Once her boots were back on, Jenny put her jacket back on, but chose to leave it unzipped, leaving her breasts exposed to the world. Jenny then put her hat back on, and Haxorus returned Jenny to her Pok\u00e9ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver on the other side of the battlefield, Ashley returned her Quilava to her Pok\u00e9ball, then pulled out her third Pok\u00e9ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Corphish! Your turn!\u201d Ashley yelled as she threw the Pok\u00e9ball into the air. In a flash of white light, the orange crablike Pok\u00e9mon emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorphish!\u201d said Ashley\u2019s Corphish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorphish, huh?\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cPhoebe! I choose you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus threw her third Pokeball into the air, and Phoebe emerged in a flash of white light and twirled around to show of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoe! Phoebe!\u201d Phoebe said as she floated down to the ground next to Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready for a battle, Phoebe?\u201d Haxorus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe!\u201d said Phoebe as she turned intangible. Her dress phased through her body and fell to the floor, leaving Phoebe naked, except for the flowers in her hair. Phoebe then stepped into the battlefield, ready to fight as Corphish opened and closed his pincers in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wins the third battle?</span></div></div>",

Elesa's hair then started to recede into her scalp, changing from black to blond as she gained a fiercer look in her eyes. The points on the top of her antennae also receded back into the headphones, leaving the wires as the only protrusions from the otherwise smooth round surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened to Elesa?\" May asked as she leaned down to talk to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elesa changed into her charged form!\" Max excitedly replied. \"When Elesa charge up electricity, their hair changes.

Staraptor closed in on Elesa and struck, but Elesa simply held onto Staraptor and started rubbing her cheek on the bird Pok\u00e9mon, discharging a faint electric shock throughout its body. Elesa then jumped to the side as Staraptor landed on the ground, it's body jerking and spasming all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that Nuzzle you just used?\" Haxorus asked, causing Elesa to smirk at her and wink. She then turned to Staraptor and winked while blowing it a kiss, causing many hearts to surround the paralyzed bird. The hearts then flew into his body, causing him to stare lovingly at Elesa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, while he's distracted, use Thunder Punch!\" Haxorus cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa nodded and coated her fists in electricity before charging at Staraptor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staraptor, use Quick Attack to escape!\" Ashley cried out.

About halfway through the battle, Gabite evolved into Garchomp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Kirlia couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being outdone by Gabite, so she evolved into Gardevoir just a few seconds later,\u201d said Diantha. \u201cSadly, neither of our Pokemon were able to get an advantage over the other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the end, Garchomp and Gardevoir ended up knocking each other out,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cWe both ended up placing in the Top 16 for the Conference that year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce the Ever Grande Conference ended, though, we ended up going our separate ways,\u201d said Diantha softly. \u201cI was planning on visiting Unova, while your Mom was going to travel through Johto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe parted ways at the same place we met,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cAt the port in Lilycove City. They had just called for boarding, and I was getting ready to leave when Diantha stopped me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was when I first confessed my feelings to your Mom,\u201d Diantha said as she blushed slightly. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t know how Cynthia would react to that. I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting her to kiss me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia giggled as she started to blush as well. \u201cYes, that\u2019s when your Mama and I had our first kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter that, we went our separate ways, though we did send each other letters from time to time,\u201d said Diantha. \u201cWhile there were a few other women in my life, I never forgot my first love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the same for me,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cI did see a few other women when I was travelling, but it just wasn\u2019t the same as what I felt for Diantha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cSo, how did you two meet up again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, about ten years ago, at the premiere of one of my films, I learned that the new Champion of the Sinnoh region would be attending,\u201d said Diantha. \u201cI had just become the Kalos Champion myself, so I was looking forward to meeting a fellow Champion. Imagine my surprise when it turned out that the new Sinnoh Champion was actually my childhood friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven though it had been nearly ten years since we\u2019d seen each other, we picked things up right were we left off,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cThe first thing your Mama did when she saw me was to leap into my arms and start kissing me like there was no tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember hearing you complaining about it,\u201d said Diantha. \u201cAnyway, after dating each other for about a year, we decided to get married and adopt a child of our own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that child was me!\u201d said Haxorus, smiling at her Mom, Cynthia, and her Mama, Diantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Cynthia, smiling at her daughter. \u201cYou were still a baby when we adopted you. We never found out what happened to your birth parents, but you were never very interested in finding out about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m proud of my Mom and Mama,\u201d said Haxorus, hugging Cynthia and Diantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re proud of you,\u201d said Diantha as she hugged her wife and daughter. \u201cNow, tell me about these Human Pok\u00e9mon your Mom says you caught recently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI caught a Jenny, a Joy, a Phoebe and an Elesa over the last few days,\u201d said Haxorus excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping Professor Oak prepare for the summit tomorrow. Oh, that reminds me, I\u2019m supposed to be meeting Professor Juniper and Doctor Fennel here at the airport, and taking them to Professor Oak\u2019s lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope you don\u2019t mind if your Mom and I wait for them with you,\u201d said Diantha. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since the three of us were all in the same place together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Haxorus, smiling at her mothers.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d used the remote on people she\u2019d recognised from the books and pamphlets she\u2019d read when creating the Human Pokemon a few days ago, since she had some idea about what their lives had been like before she\u2019d altered them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver to one side, she could see a Pokemon Professor, Kukui, from the Alola region, speaking with another Pokemon Professor. Kukui was speaking to Professor Burnet, a researcher who had been born in Unova, but had moved to the Alola region fairly recently. Earlier, Kukui and Burnet\u2019s discussion had been a more serious one about their scientific work, but now the conversation appeared to be much more romantic in nature, as Kukui leaned over and kissed Burnet on the cheek, making her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short distance away was a woman with long, meticulously styled blonde hair, talking to a man with a massive mane of red hair. Haxorus recognised the two as Lusamine, President of the Aether Foundation, and Lysandre, the CEO of Lysandre Labs. Lysandre took Lusamine\u2019s hands and leaned down to kiss her. As Haxorus watched the two, she suddenly remembered that the Aether Foundation and Lysandre Labs had been merged into a single company, Aether Laboratories, when Lusamine and Lysandre had gotten married a few years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Haxorus spotted a man with red hair, wearing a cape. He was Lance, the Champion of the Kanto and Johto regions, and he was holding the hand of another young man, who Haxorus recognised as Steven Stone, the current Hoenn Champion. Steven had recently reclaimed his title as Champion from Wallace, who had become the Champion a few years ago when Steven had stepped down to focus on his geology work. However, thanks to the urging of his boyfriend, Steven had returned as the Hoenn Champion, while Wallace had gone back to work as the Sootopolis City Gym Leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus smiled at the sight of the happy couples she\u2019d created. Everyone seemed to truly care about the people they\u2019d been paired up with, and none of them seemed to be too different from what they had been like before Haxorus had used the remote on them. There were a few changes, of course, but that was to be expected. After all, the remote could change reality itself, so a few minor changes would always be made, so that the changes Haxorus made to the world would make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Haxorus do next?</span></div></div>",

Professors Kukui and Burnet were making their way out of the airport, holding hands as they walked. Lance and Steven Stone kissed each other on the lips, then went their separate ways. Haxorus assumed that the two of them both had things they needed to do on their own. Finally, Haxorus turned her attention back to Lysandre and Lusamine. Haxorus hadn\u2019t really noticed before, but Lusamine was accompanied by two children, a boy and a girl, maybe about the same age as Haxorus. She remembered seeing their names mentioned in the books she\u2019d read when she was making Human Pokemon a few days ago, and Haxorus recognised the girl as Lillie and the boy as Gladion. Lillie was tall for her age, likely having inherited her height from her new father, Lysandre. Lillie also had bright red hair, the same colour as her new father\u2019s hair, but she had her mother\u2019s green eyes. Gladion was shorter than his sister, and had his mother\u2019s blonde hair and his new father\u2019s light blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus frowned slightly. She\u2019d seen Lillie and Gladion when she\u2019d first spotted Lusamine, and they had obviously been Lusamine\u2019s children. However, before she\u2019d used the remote, both children had been about the same height, and they had their mother\u2019s blonde hair and green eyes. It seemed that the remote had given Lillie and Gladion some traits from their new father when Haxorus had made Lusamine and Lysandre a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Haxorus found that interesting. When she\u2019d made Cynthia her Mom and Diantha her Mama, Haxorus hadn\u2019t been changed physically, but her life and memories were altered so that her Mom and Mama had adopted her as a baby. Well, it was technically Georgia\u2019s life that had been altered, but for all intents and purposes, Haxorus <i>was</i> Georgia. Haxorus wondered why the remote had made her an adopted child, but had physically altered Lillie and Gladion so that they were the biological children of Lusamine and Lysandre. Maybe she could go and talk to Lillie and Gladion for a bit, or possibly even use the remote on the two...</span></div></div>",

Doctor Fennel?\u201d said Haxorus as she walked up to the two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello again,\u201d said Professor Juniper. \u201cYou\u2019re the trainer that sent me that lovely Vanilluxe yesterday. Georgia, I believe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s me,\u201d said Haxorus, smiling. \u201cProfessor Oak asked me to meet you here at the airport for him, since he\u2019s busy getting ready for the summit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s a lot we still need to get ready for,\u201d said Professor Juniper. \u201cSpeaking of which, did you remember to send the Human Pok\u00e9mon to Professor Oak\u2019s lab?\u201d Juniper asked as she turned to face her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did it this morning, before we left. Professor Oak called me to let me know that the Lenoras, Skylas, Elesas, Unovan Jennies and Unovan Joys all arrived safely,\u201d Fennel said, counting off the different Human Pokemon with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d said Professor Juniper, before she turned back to Georgia. \u201cAre you planning on coming with us to Professor Oak\u2019s laboratory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Haxorus with a nod. \u201cI wanna see how preparations for the summit are going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, there you are,\u201d said Cynthia as she and Diantha walked up to Haxorus, Juniper and Fennel. \u201cI was wondering where you\u2019d gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Mom,\u201d said Haxorus, sheepishly. \u201cOh, Mom, Mama, this is Professor Juniper and Doctor Fennel, from Unova. Professor Juniper, Doctor Fennel, this is my Mom, Cynthia, and my Mama, Diantha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Aurea,\u201d said Professor Juniper, holding her hand out to Cynthia. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s mine,\u201d said Cynthia, shaking Professor Juniper\u2019s hand. \u201cI take it you\u2019re here for the summit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m one of the guest speakers,\u201d said Professor Juniper. \u201cAre you two here for the summit as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are,\u201d said Diantha as she shook Professor Juniper\u2019s hand. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised to find my wife and daughter waiting here when I arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve both been so busy with our Pokemon League duties, and Georgia\u2019s been on her Pokemon journey,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to have a little time together as a family again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of family, I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t mention that you were the daughter of Cynthia and Diantha,\u201d said Fennel, looking at Haxorus. \u201cWhy was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Haxorus, caught off guard by the question. \u201cWell, I guess I didn\u2019t want special treatment, just because of who my mothers are.\u201d <i>And also because they didn\u2019t become my Mom and Mama until a few minutes ago</i>, Haxorus thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an admirable attitude to have,\u201d said Professor Juniper. \u201cIs that also why you decided to start travelling through Unova, instead of Sinnoh or Kalos?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cI mean, I already know about Sinnoh and Kalos. I guess I just wanted something different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Mom and I were very proud of you when you set off for Unova,\u201d said Diantha, resting her hand on Haxorus\u2019 shoulder. \u201cWe both think you did admirably on your journey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Mama,\u201d said Haxorus, blushing at her Mama\u2019s praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose we\u2019d better get going,\u201d said Professor Juniper. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot Fen and I need to do to get ready for the summit tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Di and I would like to go with you,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve visited Professor Oak\u2019s lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d said Professor Juniper. \u201cI\u2019m sure Professor Oak would love to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and I can show you my new Human Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cThey\u2019re all really cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting them,\u201d said Cynthia, smiling at her daughter\u2019s enthusiasm.</span></div></div>",

As the group walked up the hill leading to the front door, Haxorus could see Ashley and some of her Pok\u00e9mon in a nearby field, helping set up the stage for tomorrow\u2019s summit. She could also see May in the distance, towering over Max and Professor Birch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group approached the laboratory, the front door opened, and Professor Oak stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Hello, everyone,\u201d Professor Oak said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to be here so soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuckily, there weren\u2019t any delays with our flight,\u201d said Juniper. \u201cThank you for sending Georgia to meet us at the airport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Professor Oak. \u201cAnd thank you, Georgia, for agreeing to meet Professor Juniper and Doctor Fennel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cBesides, if I hadn\u2019t gone, I wouldn\u2019t have run into Mom and Mama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello again, Professor,\u201d said Cynthia, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we last met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has indeed,\u201d said Professor Oak, shaking Cynthia\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd it\u2019s good to see you too, Diantha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine,\u201d said Diantha, shaking Professor Oak\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I was able to take time away from my Champion duties to attend the summit. And you can imagine my surprise when I find that my wife and daughter were waiting at the airport when I arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible coincidence, but I\u2019m glad it did happen. It\u2019s been too long since the three of us have spent some time together as a family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Professor Oak, nodding. \u201cGeorgia, why don\u2019t you and your parents go out and enjoy yourselves for the rest of the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Haxorus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m sure we can manage without your help,\u201d said Professor Oak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Professor,\u201d Haxorus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nice to meet you in person, Georgia,\u201d said Professor Juniper. \u201cI\u2019ll see you all at the summit tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Oak, Professor Juniper and Doctor Fennel all headed inside the laboratory as Haxorus, Cynthia and Diantha headed back towards Pallet Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Georgia, I hear you have some new Human Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Diantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right!\u201d said Haxorus as she reached into her pockets and pulled out her Pok\u00e9 Balls. \u201cCome on out, girls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus threw three Pok\u00e9 Balls and a Luxury Ball into the air, and Jenny, Joy, Phoebe and Elesa emerged in bright white flashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam, this is my Mom and Mama,\u201d said Haxorus. \u201cMom, Mama, this is Jenny, Joy, Phoebe and Elesa. Say hi, everyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen!\u201d said Jenny, saluting Cynthia and Diantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy!\u201d said Joy as she bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe Phoebe!\u201d said Phoebe, waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElesa,\u201d said Elesa with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is quite the collection,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cYou weren\u2019t joking about becoming a Human Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I do believe the people attending the summit tomorrow will receive a single Human Pok\u00e9mon as a gift,\u201d said Diantha. \u201cI wonder what I will choose; a Malva, perhaps?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSa?\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Elesa, as her skin rippled. Elesa\u2019s headphones faded away, and her black hair changed to a purple colour. Her face\u2019s shape was moulded into a new form as her electric blue eyes darkened to red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMalva?\u201d Haxorus\u2019 Elesa asked again, having Transformed into a Malva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done, Elesa,\u201d said Diantha. \u201cAdmittedly, I may end up choosing something else entirely, but at the moment, I am indeed considering picking up a Malva tomorrow. What about you, Cynthia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking I might try and pick up an Olivia,\u201d said Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVa, Malva,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Elesa as she Transformed again. Her skin and eyes darkened to brown, and her purple hair darkened to black and grew shorter, with a single curled bang in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLi, Via Ol,\u201d said Elesa once she finished her Transformation into an Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent work,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cMind you, with so many options, it can be hard to choose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Georgia. \u201cI still have no idea what I might pick tomorrow. I mean, Malvas and Olivias are cool, but so are Plumerias, and Gardenias, and Violas and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlow down, Georgia,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cYou have plenty of time to make up your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m just so excited about tomorrow,\u201d said Georgia. \u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Since Jamie was a fusion of a man and a woman, they were actually a hermaphrodite. They were, in fact, currently the only hermaphrodite in the world, and would remain so, unless Haxorus used the remote to fuse more men and women together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s picked up another one of those Human Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Meowth. \u201cBeen hearing a lot about them lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no surprise, since there\u2019s a summit about them tomorrow,\u201d said Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that gives me an idea!\u201d said Meowth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the summit tomorrow and pick up a Human Pokemon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s... actually, that is a good idea,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cI could do with some more Pok\u00e9mon, especially since I had to give Woobat, Yamask, Frillish and Amoongus to the boss yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we could go and steal all the Human Pokemon and give \u2018em to the boss! I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love \u2018em!\u201d said Meowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr I could just go in disguise and get one like every other person at the summit,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cIt\u2019d be much easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Meowth. \u201cYeah, that makes more sense. Especially since you\u2019re so good at disguises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well, I kind of have to be,\u201d said Jamie, adjusting their skirt in a futile attempt to hide the distinctive bulge between their legs. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many other people like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAin\u2019t that true,\u201d said Meowth. \u201cSo, tomorrow, we get dressed up, visit the summit, and pick up a Human Pok\u00e9mon for ourselves!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That evening, Haxorus sat down in her room in the Pok\u00e9mon Centre. Now that her Mom and Mama had arrived in Pallet Town, Haxorus was now staying at the Pok\u00e9mon Centre with her recently created family. She\u2019d said good night to her parents, who were staying in the room next door, and her Pok\u00e9mon were all safely in their Pok\u00e9 Balls, which were currently scattered across the room\u2019s desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that she was alone, Haxorus reached into her bag and took out the strange remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis little thing is amazing,\u201d said Haxorus as she examined the remote. \u201cIt\u2019s got so many crazy powers. I wonder what else it can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus still found it hard to believe that it had only been a week since she\u2019d found the remote as she went over all the changes she\u2019d made in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, this button here causes Pok\u00e9mon to evolve, and this button over here is the one that turned all those women into Human Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus, tracing over the buttons in question with her finger. \u201cThese buttons are the swapping buttons. I can use them to swap lives, bodies, genders and clothes. And these buttons here are the ones I used to create all those new relationships. This one here is what made Cynthia and Diantha my Mom and Mama, this one made Juniper and Fennel a couple, and this one made Iris and I friends.\u201d Haxorus paused. \u201cWell, it technically made Iris and Georgia friends, but since I\u2019m Georgia now...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus shrugged, then moved onto the next few buttons. \u201cAnyway, this is the button that made May grow so tall, and this is the button that fused Jessie and James together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she\u2019d finished going over all the things she\u2019d done with the remote so far, Haxorus noticed that there was still a number of buttons she hadn\u2019t tried yet, but that was okay. She knew she\u2019d have plenty of opportunities to use the remote in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus then found her mind wandering to the Human Pok\u00e9mon she\u2019d created a few days ago. Eighteen women had been transformed into species of Pok\u00e9mon, and nobody noticed the huge difference in the world. In fact, Haxorus had already caught four different species of Human Pokemon, and she was looking forward to receiving a fifth tomorrow at the Human Pok\u00e9mon Summit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was thinking about Human Pok\u00e9mon, a few ideas popped into her mind. Her first idea was to create more Human Pok\u00e9mon. Of course, since all the Human Pok\u00e9mon she\u2019d created so far were women, maybe it was time to turn some men into Human Pok\u00e9mon, so that the male and female Human Pok\u00e9mon could act as counterparts to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus\u2019 second idea involved the evolution button. She was curious what would happen if she used the evolution button on a Pok\u00e9mon that didn\u2019t have an evolution. Given that the remote had the ability to turn humans into Pok\u00e9mon, it would almost certainly create new Pok\u00e9mon. But would Haxorus have any control over what sort of Pok\u00e9mon those evolutions would be? And what sort of evolutions would the remote create for the Human Pok\u00e9mon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus then yawned, and looked out through the window. The sun had set over Pallet Town, and the moon was slowly rising in the night sky. It had been an exciting day today, and tomorrow would be even more exciting. Maybe she should just go to bed...</span></div></div>",

When the bright light faded, Haxorus looked at her Pok\u00e9dex, and saw that a new Pok\u00e9mon had been registered. Haxorus selected the new Pok\u00e9mon, and her Pok\u00e9dex displayed an image of Jenny. However, this picture of Jenny was different. This Jenny appeared to be about six inches taller, and a lot more muscular. She also had a second pair of arms, right below her original pair. Haxorus could also see flowers growing in Jenny\u2019s teal hair, and the flowers were the same amber colour as Jenny\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennyfir, the Guardian Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pokedex. \u201cJenny evolves into Jennyfir when it comes into contact with a Moss Rock. A Jennyfir\u2019s protective instincts will lead to her becoming a protector for all Pokemon living in the forest she evolves in. However, when two Jennyfirs are in the same forest, the two will fight to determine who has the right to defend the area. The losing Jennyfir will leave to find a new territory to claim as her own. Jennyfir is a Fighting and Grass type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Kanto. Unovan, Kalosian and Alolan forms of Jennyfir have also been discovered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! It worked!\u201d Haxorus said with a giggle. The remote had taken Haxorus\u2019 suggestions for Jenny\u2019s evolution, and used them to create a new species of Human Pok\u00e9mon. Jenny\u2019s new evolved form, Jennyfir, looked amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the remote in one hand, and her Pok\u00e9dex in the other, Haxorus then began scrolling through her Pok\u00e9dex. Whenever she found a Human Pok\u00e9mon, she said the first few ideas that came to her mind, then she pressed the evolution button. The remote would then take her suggestions and use them as guidelines for the new Human Pok\u00e9mon evolutions it created. After a few more minutes of this, Haxorus had finished creating her new Human Pok\u00e9mon evolutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of Human Pok\u00e9mon evolutions did Haxorus create?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Haxorus was finished, she put the remote back in her back, then used her Pok\u00e9dex to check out the new evolved forms for the Human Pok\u00e9mon she\u2019d just created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Joy\u2019s evolved form. The evolved form of Joy was slightly taller, and had a pouch on her stomach that could hold Pok\u00e9mon eggs or baby Pok\u00e9mon. Her pink hair was now much longer, and reached down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoyous, the Nursing Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cJoy evolves into Joyous when she forms a strong bond with her Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. Joyous are rare in the wild, as very few can form the strong friendship that is required for evolution. A wild Joyous\u2019 maternal instincts will lead to her finding abandoned Pok\u00e9mon eggs and placing them in her pouch until they hatch. Joyous will also fight fiercely to defend their adopted children. Joyous is a Fairy and Normal type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Kanto. Unovan, Kalosian and Alolan forms of Joyous have also been discovered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Haxorus was finished reading Joyous\u2019 entry, she moved onto the next Human Pok\u00e9mon, Sabrina. Sabrina\u2019s evolved form had a second head, next to her original head. As a result of her second head, Sabrina\u2019s evolved form also had wider hips and shoulders, to better support the extra weight. Her height was unchanged, but her hair was now very different. On her left head, her black hair was slightly longer than shoulder length, while on her right head, her hair reached down to her knees. The hair on both her heads was now formed out of solid ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSabrigid, the Frost Witch Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cSabrina evolves into Sabrigid when it comes into contact with an Ice Rock. After evolving, Sabrigid will never visibly or audibly express any emotions. The only time a Sabrigid will let her guard down is if she is with people or Pok\u00e9mon she trusts completely, or if she is alone. Anyone who stumbles upon a wild Sabrigid that is expressing herself will be frozen solid. Sabrigid is a Psychic and Ice type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Kanto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done checking Sabrigid\u2019s data, Haxorus then brought up the next Human Pok\u00e9mon on her list, Karen. Unlike the other Human Pok\u00e9mon evolutions, Karen\u2019s evolved form didn\u2019t have any new body parts. Instead, Karen\u2019s body was composed entirely of solid white marble, including her eyes and hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKarenore, the Statue Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pokedex. \u201cKaren evolves into Karenore when she is groomed to increase her beauty. After evolving, a Karenore believes her beauty will last forever as a marble statue. Wild Karenores will often gather in clearings and stand completely still in various poses, forming statue gardens. If anyone else enters their statue garden, the Karenores will come to life and pummel the offender. Karenore is a Dark and Rock type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Johto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished reading Karenore\u2019s page, Haxorus moved onto Clair\u2019s evolution. Clair\u2019s evolution had a mermaid\u2019s tail instead of legs, and her mermaid\u2019s tail was covered in blue scales that matched the colour of her hair. She also had visible gills along the side of her ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClairmaid, the Mermaid Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cClair evolves into Clairmaid during a rainstorm. Wild Clairmaids live under the surface of underground lakes, and only return to the surface to lay their eggs. Even though they live underwater, Clairmaids are far from helpless when they are on land. Clairmaids can instinctively tame any Dragon or Water type Pok\u00e9mon that enters their lakes, even Clairs and other Clairmaids. Clairmaid is a Dragon and Water type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Johto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finished checking the information from Clairmaid, Haxorus moved onto the next Human Pok\u00e9mon evolution, which was Jasmine\u2019s evolved form. Jasmine\u2019s evolved form was composed entirely of a silvery liquid metal, except for her hair, which was bright yellow and crackled with electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJasmercury, the Liquid Metal Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cJasmine evolves into Jasmercury when she is in a special magnetic field. A Jasmercury\u2019s liquid body allows her to flow around attacks, making her capable of taking much stronger blows. The electrical energy stored in Jasmercury\u2019s hair is what allows a Jasmercury to retain her human shape. When a Jasmercury\u2019s electrical reserves are depleted, she will become a shapeless blob until she can recharge. Jasmercury is a Steel and Electric type Pokemon, native to Johto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading Jasmercury\u2019s entry, Haxorus then read the information about Phoebe\u2019s new evolution. The evolved form of Phoebe was surrounded by a soft halo of pink light, and Phoebe\u2019s legs had merged together into a wisp of pink smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoebrite, the Guiding Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cPhoebe evolves into Phoebrite during the daytime. Phoebrite use their dances to guide lost souls to their final resting place. Phoebrites will wander far and wide in order to assist as many lost souls as they can. At night, wild Phoebrites will dance through the sky, illuminating the night with their glow. Phoebrite is a Ghost and Fairy type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Hoenn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Phoebrite was the entry on Shelly\u2019s evolution. Instead of legs, Shelly\u2019s evolution had eight octopus tentacles, the same colour as her hair. She also had gills on the side of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShellopod, the Octopus Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cShelly evolves into Shellopod when she is groomed to increase her coolness. A wild Shellopod will move into the wreckage of a sunken ship and claim it for her own. Shellopods can use their ability to phase through walls to pass through the corridors of their sunken homes at will. Sailors will often tell of hearing the haunting songs of Shellopods singing to each other during stormy weather. Shellopod is a Water and Ghost type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Hoenn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done with Shellopod\u2019s entry, Haxorus then started reading about Gardenia\u2019s evolution. The evolved form of Gardenia had bark for skin, and roots were growing out of her feet. The hair on Gardenia\u2019s evolution was composed of vines that were covered in leaves and flowers, and the flowers were actually composed of orange flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGardember, the Flower Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cGardenia evolves into Gardember during harsh sunlight. Gardembers overcome their fear of Ghost type Pok\u00e9mon by blasting them with fire from their new flowers. During the night, Gardembers will bury their feet and take root while they sleep standing up. Before they take root, a Gardember will burn a small patch of grass, and will absorb nutrients from the ashes while she sleeps. Gardember is a Grass and Fire type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Sinnoh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus finished up with Gardember\u2019s entry, then started reading the next entry, which was about Candice\u2019s evolution. The evolved form of Candice had a body composed of solid ice, and a pair of long icy fangs emerged from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCanditox, the Passionate Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pokedex. \u201cCandice evolves into Canditox during a hailstorm. Wild Canditoxes will stalk their prey during a snowstorm, using their icy bodies to blend in with the snow. A Canditox\u2019s venom is cold as ice, and will slow the victim down while the poison takes effect. Despite their icy appearance, Canditoxes have warm and friendly personalities, and will take great pride in something they care greatly about. Canditox is a Poison and Ice type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Sinnoh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, Haxorus was very impressed with the evolutions she\u2019d created. The remote had used all of her suggestions and worked them into the Human Pok\u00e9mon evolutions she\u2019d created in ways that seemed to make sense with the information that already existed about the Human Pok\u00e9mon. Haxorus had greatly enjoyed reading about the Human Pok\u00e9mon evolutions from Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh, and she looked forward to reading about the Human Pok\u00e9mon evolutions from Unova, Kalos and Alola.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that Haxorus had finished reading about the evolutions of the Human Pok\u00e9mon from Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh, she then moved onto the first Unovan Pok\u00e9mon listed in the Pokedex, which was Elesa. Elesa\u2019s new evolved form did not have arms, legs or neck, and her head, hands and feet were levitating with psychic power. There was a second picture of Elesa\u2019s evolution in her Charged Form, and the Charged Form of Elesa\u2019s evolution had her hands, feet and neck connected to her body by electricity that formed the shape of her arms, legs and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElesper, the Fashionista Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cElesa evolves into Elesper when she is groomed to increase her smartness. Elesper moves her detached hands, feet and head with her psychic power, and her detached body parts are tethered to her body with electricity when Elesper enters her Charged Form. Wild Elespers use their psychic powers to craft their own clothing out of whatever materials they can find, and will perform fashion shows for Pokemon Trainers they encounter. Elespers have the ability to Transform into other Human Pok\u00e9mon, and also have the ability to mimic the appearance of Pok\u00e9mon Trainers that they have met. Elesper is an Electric and Psychic type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Unova.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished reading Elesper\u2019s entry, Haxorus then started to read the entry for Skyla\u2019s evolved form. Skyla\u2019s evolution had wings instead of arms, and the feathers on her new wings were red, the same colour as her hair, which was now also composed of feathers. Her legs were now like those of a bird, with four toes facing forward and one toe facing backwards. Light blue scales covered her bird legs, which matched the colour of the ornament in Skyla\u2019s hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkyrun, the Aerobatic Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cSkyla evolves into Skyrun while she knows the move Drill Run. Skyruns are just as comfortable on the ground as they are in the sky, and can run or fly at incredible speeds. However, wild Skyruns prefer to remain airborne, and will never set foot on the ground unless they absolutely have to. Skyruns are very proud of their combat ability, but have also learned not to underestimate their opponents. Skyrun is a Flying and Ground type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Unova.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Haxorus finished with Skyrun\u2019s information, she moved onto the data for Lenora\u2019s evolution. Lenora\u2019s evolved form was slightly more muscular, and had much longer blue hair. The hair was wrapped around Lenora\u2019s body, arms and legs, forming a layer of armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLenarmor, the Defender Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cLenora evolves into Lenarmor when she is groomed to increase her toughness. A Lenarmor\u2019s hair is made of steel, and she uses her hair to protect herself during battle. A wild Lenarmor\u2019s defensive instinct will lead to her protecting a large area, as well as the Pok\u00e9mon living in that area. A Lenarmor that is raised inside a city will consider everything and everyone within the city\u2019s limits to be under her protection. Lenarmor is a Normal and Steel type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Unova.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was finished learning about the Unovan Human Pok\u00e9mon evolutions, Haxorus loaded up the entry for the first Kalosian Human Pok\u00e9mon, which was Viola. Viola\u2019s new evolution now had large butterfly wings emerging from her back, and her eyes were now solid green, and appeared to be made of thousands of tiny hexagons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cViolarty, the Artist Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cViola evolves into Violarty when she is groomed to increase her cuteness. The pattern on Violarty\u2019s wings is unique for each individual, and is influenced by the environment around her when she evolves. Violarties generate a pigment from their wings, and use this pigment to paint patterns in the sky while flying. A Violarty\u2019s compound eyes allows her to see things in much greater detail, allowing her to paint with very fine details that most people cannot see. Violarty is a Bug and Flying type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Kalos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Violarty\u2019s entry finished playing, Haxorus loaded up the entry for Malva\u2019s new evolution. Malva\u2019s evolved form had hair that was composed of pure fire, including her eyebrows. Malva\u2019s evolution also had sharp pink teeth, as well as long pink claws on her hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMalvicious, the Grudge Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cMalva evolves into Malvicious during the nighttime. A Malvicious\u2019 perfect memory allows her to remember every insult or joke that is made at her expense. Wild Malviciouses will eventually hunt down anyone who makes fun of them, no matter how far they must travel. Journalists often take a Malvicious with them, both for defence and for their perfect memories, which allows them to act like a living camera. Malvicious is a Fire and Dark type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Kalos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Malvicious\u2019 entry was complete, Haxorus then moved onto the entry about Grace\u2019s evolved form. Grace\u2019s new evolution was interesting, as she had a second torso stretching out from her backside and ending in a second pair of hips. Grace\u2019s evolution essentially looked like a centaur composed entirely out of human body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGraceful, the Ride Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cGrace evolves into Graceful while she knows the move Double Kick. A Graceful\u2019s experience riding Pok\u00e9mon allows her to provide a smooth ride when she herself is ridden. Graceful\u2019s four legs and strong back means she can carry large loads without much difficulty, which has led to many Gracefuls being used to ferry people and cargo. In battle, a Graceful will rear up on her hind legs, and use her front legs to kick at her opponent. Graceful is a Ground and Fighting type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Kalos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the Kalosian Human Pok\u00e9mon evolutions done, Haxorus then moved onto the last two, which were from Alola. First was Plumeria\u2019s evolved form. In her new evolution, Plumeria\u2019s four long braids had become snakes, with two pink snakes at the front and two yellow snakes at the back. Plumeria\u2019s legs had also fused together and stretched out into a long snake tail, with pink scales and yellow S shaped markings along the sides of her snake tail. She also had two pink fangs poking out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlumedusa, the Serpent Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cPlumeria evolves into Plumedusa while she knows the move Dual Chop. A Plumedusa\u2019s angry glare is so terrifying the opponent will be frozen in fear, giving her the chance to strike with her serpentine hair or snake-like body. Wild Plumedusas act ferocious, but this is only because their vicious appearance scares people away. Plumedusas are very friendly towards people who approach them without fear, even complete strangers. Plumedusa is a Poison and Dragon type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Alola.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished with Plumedusa, Haxorus then brought up the entry for the final Human Pok\u00e9mon, Olivia. Olivia\u2019s new evolved form did not have human legs. Instead, from the hips down, Olivia\u2019s body was composed entirely of rocks, and these rocks had formed into a huge spider\u2019s abdomen, which appeared to have small caves and crevices throughout it. Olivia also had eight spider-like legs attached to her spider abdomen, which were also created out of rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlivisect, the Hive Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d said Haxorus\u2019 Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cOlivia evolves into Olivisect during a sandstorm. Olivisects protect other Pok\u00e9mon from sandstorms by allowing them to take shelter within the small crevices in their abdomens. Their experience at navigating rocky mountains allows them to travel quickly over harsh terrain. In battle, Olivisects can also shoot webbing from their hands or their spider abdomen to trap their opponents for the finishing blow. Olivisect is a Rock and Bug type Pok\u00e9mon, native to Alola.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the last entry finished playing, Haxorus turned off her Pok\u00e9dex and put it away. She was in awe at her new creations. It was amazing how the remote had created whole new Pok\u00e9mon species for each of the Human Pok\u00e9mon to evolve into. She wondered if the new evolutions she had created would appear at the Human Pok\u00e9mon summit tomorrow. She was so excited to learn more about the Human Pok\u00e9mon and their evolutions tomorrow, as well as spending more time with Cynthia and Diantha, her Mom and Mama. She might even find a few more opportunities to use the remote... unless she wanted to continue using the remote now...</span></div></div>",

She was now completely naked, without even her hair ornaments in place. Haxorus frowned, and looked at the remote. Her thumb was definitely not on the button that created Human Pok\u00e9mon, she was sure of that. She looked back up at Cynthia, and noticed that she was still had her luggage with her, except the bag was now much smaller. She still seemed to act like a regular human, rather than a Human Pokemon, and nobody seemed to care that Cynthia was completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Haxorus softly as she put the remote back in her pocket. It seemed like the button she had just pressed made it so that the person it was used on wouldn\u2019t bother with any clothes at all, despite still being a regular human. Haxorus slowly started walking over towards Cynthia, hoping to find out more. As she did so, she saw a young boy, probably only about four or five years old, walking with his mother. The mother and child duo walked past Cynthia, and the young boy was staring at Cynthia with his eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said the boy, getting Cynthia\u2019s attention. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing any clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I told you about asking people questions like that?\u201d said the boy\u2019s mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s alright,\u201d said Cynthia, kneeling down so she was at eye-level with the young boy. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to it. And to answer your question, I don\u2019t wear clothes because I\u2019ve never been able to find clothes that feel right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know how you don\u2019t like wearing clothes that are too small, or too big?\u201d said Cynthia, and the young boy nodded. \u201cWell, to tell the truth, every piece of clothing I wear feels like that, even when it\u2019s designed to fit me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you don\u2019t wear clothes?\u201d said the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cAnd since I\u2019ve never been able to find any comfortable clothes, I decided it would be easier to simply not wear any. Besides, Human Pok\u00e9mon don\u2019t wear clothes if they don\u2019t want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but those are Pokemon,\u201d said the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they still look like human women,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cIf it\u2019s alright for Human Pok\u00e9mon to not wear clothes if they don\u2019t want to, then it\u2019s alright for humans to not wear any clothes as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess,\u201d said the young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this,\u201d said the boy\u2019s mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Cynthia said, standing back up. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said the mother. \u201cNow come on, we\u2019re going to be late for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said the young boy, who dutifully followed his mother as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus had been eavesdropping on the conversation, and found Cynthia\u2019s justification for not wearing clothes to be interesting. She found it interesting that Cynthia justified her lack of clothes by using Human Pokemon as an example. That made Haxorus wonder if there were now other people who no longer wore clothes, to further justify Cynthia\u2019s nudity...</span></div></div>",

No wonder so many humans do this. It's a lot of fun! Maybe Pallet Town has a bunch of other human things I can do,&lt;/i&gt; She thought to herself.

Let's just explore ourselves. That'll be more fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus smiled. As Axew, he and Iris had been close. But now as Georgia, they were best friends and equals. \"Yeah!

I didn't even know eating places could be like that.&lt;/i&gt; She saw that Iris was looking at the cashier and Dale while the two had their backs turned, and all the customers were either eating or watching.

Now it switched Dale's gender with the cashier next to them, turning the cashier male and changing Dale back to a Delia. The second button had been a new one, chosen at random, but Haxorus made sure to remember what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving used and put away the remote, Haxorus looked around. The restaurant had changed. The TVs were gone, windows to the outside in their place. The men and their meals had been replaced with families at large tables. The decor was a lot brighter now. <i>Wow, changing Ash's mom back really changed things here,</i> Thought Haxorus. <i>That's really neat.</i> Haxorus's thoughts were interrupted by a realization.<i> Nothing happened when I pressed the button the second time. That's strange. Is the remote broken?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now male cashier turned back to them and asked, \"Would you like to eat something while your friend works in the back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris shook her head, \"No thanks. We just ate a while ago. We'll come back later to eat. Thanks for asking.\" She and Haxorus stepped to the side as the cashier took someone else's order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia smiled, \"You're so polite, Iris. Your mother must be so proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mother?</i> Haxorus wondered.<i> I've never heard about Iris' mother before.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris smiled back, \"Thank you. Mom says hi by the way. She hopes to see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia smiled. \"I hope to see her soon too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder what Georgia's mother is like.</i> Haxorus thought about it for a moment, and then an image flashed in her mind. <i>Wait, that's Ash's mom. Or Ashley's mom. I want to remember Georgia's mom. </i> Haxorus got more flashes of memory, being raised by a woman looking exactly like Delia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia turned to Haxorus, \"Georgia? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh. Just... thinking about my mother,\" Haxorus replied, distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure your mother is proud of you too. I still have that picture your mothers sent us,\" Ash's mother replied, pointing upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus looked upwards, on the wall above the counter were pictures of several women, all of whom looked identical to Delia Ketchum, although some groups had different outfits. Haxorus couldn't help but gasp. <i>This must be what the second button did!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris raised an eyebrow and asked, \"What? Didn't you know about the family of Delias?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um. Sure!\" Lied Haxorus. \"I just didn't know it was so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia Ketchum smiled, \"Everytime Ash has found a friend to travel with, they've turned out to have a Delia as one of their parents. Our children are wonderful, and we care for them with all our hearts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really sweet,\" Haxorus replied.<i> I wonder if this remote is why there were a lot of Jennys and Joys before. But at least now I know it can do that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry kids, but I have to get back to work. But I'd love to have you for lunch,\" Delia Ketchum offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris nodded, \"That sounds great. We'll see you then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Delia Ketchum replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Delia Ketchum returned to the restaurant's kitchen, Iris turned to Haxorus and asked, \"So what should we do now, Georgia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaxorus thought, and replied-</span></div></div>",

I want to remember Georgia's mom.</i> Haxorus got more flashes of memory, being raised by a woman looking exactly like Delia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan nodded, \"As the son of a Delia myself, I can confirm that no finer family of matriarchs can be found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia Ketchum blushed, \"That's so kind of you to say, Cilan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A Delia?</i> Thought Haxorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia turned to Haxorus, \"Georgia? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh. Just... thinking about my mother,\" Haxorus replied, distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure your mother is proud of you too. I still have that picture with your mother and many of the Unovan Delias in one of my scrapbooks,\" Ash's mother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Haxorus noticed a picture on the wall of several women, all of whom looked identical to Delia Ketchum. Haxorus couldn't help but gasp. This must be what the second button did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris raised an eyebrow and asked, \"What? Your mom's a Delia too. She didn't tell you about her family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um. Sure!\" Lied Haxorus. \"I just didn't know it was so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia Ketchum smiled, \"Everytime Ash has found a friend to travel with, they've turned out to have a Delia as one of their parents. Our children are wonderful, and we care for them with all our hearts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really sweet,\" Haxorus replied, taking her seat. <i>I wonder if this remote is why there were a lot of Jennys and Joys before. But at least now I know it can do that.</i> Haxorus began eating her sandwiches. \"That was great! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure,\" Delia Ketchum replied. \u201cOh, that reminds me. That reporter from Kalos you met, Alexa, I think her name was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s her,\u201d said Ash. \u201cShe went on ahead of us when Iris and Cilan decided to tag along. She made it here alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she said she was going to see Professor Oak for an interview,\u201d said Delia. \u201cI think she should be finished by now, if you want to go and visit his lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d said Ash. \u201cYou guys wanna come and meet all my Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Iris. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see them all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come too,\u201d said Cilan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Georgia?\u201d Iris asked. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He led them around the side, following the wooden fence that went on for quite some distance.

I'm no spring chicken, but I still have some years in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly do,\" Iris said cheekily. \"Nice to meet you.

She was now dressed in a pink dress with poofy shoulders and a collar that extended halfway down her upper legs. A white apron was draped over the front of the dress, tied in a large bow behind her. White shoes adorned her feet and a pink hat with a red cross sat on her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could stay longer, but I have to get to the Pok\u00e9mon Center soon,\" Delia said after returning Ash's hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really have to Mom? Can't you take a day off being a nurse just this once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ash, but I did take an oath to help any Pok\u00e9mon I can, and I can't do that while I'm here. Mimey, be a good host to Ash's friends, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mime, Mr. Mime!\" Mimey said as he walked outside to greet everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, there's food on the table in case you need to eat something. Everyone, make yourselves at home; I'll see you after my shift!\" Delia called out as she ran into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's a nurse at the Pok\u00e9mon Center?\" Haxorus asked, not realizing she said it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I wish she didn't have to be there all the time. It's a hassle when I accidentally call the house phone instead of at her work.\" Ash said as he walked in the house. \"Well, you can meet her later; come on in, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris, Cilan and Haxorus all walked into the house. As soon as she entered, Haxorus noticed three photos. One saw many women who looked exactly like Delia standing in a large room smiling as they wore the Nurse outfit. Another had more women who looked like Delia saluting the camera in uniforms like Officer Jenny used to wear. The final photo had a woman who looked like Delia wearing a pink-purple tank top, white pants with a large belt, pink-purple shoes and odd bracelets on her arms posing with a Kadabra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Interesting; it looks like the remote made duplicates of Ash's Mom to take the places of all the women I turn into Pok\u00e9mon. If I use the remote to make another woman a Pok\u00e9mon again, will Ash's Mom replace that woman, too?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looking at the family photos?\" Ash asked, surprising Haxorus. After she calmed down, she replied, \"Yeah; it looks like a large, very successful family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh chuckled as he said, \"Yeah, well...\"</span></div></div>",

Ash was trailing a few steps behind Dawn, hoping to spot a few Pok\u00e9mon in the trees and bushes along the path. What he ended up finding, however, was not a Pok\u00e9mon but an odd remote lying beside the road.. Curious, he picked up the remote and took a closer look at it, noticing that it had many buttons that were all different colors. Not knowing any of their functions, he randomly pressed the blue button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Ash felt very different. His perspective had shifted slightly downwards and he noticed weight in areas were there had been none before, namely his chest and the back of his head, and yet other parts of his body felt lighter. Irritated by the new sensations, Ash took a peek at his chest and was shocked to see two mounds on his formerly flat chest. Taking a hand to his chest to confirm whether this was actually real, he noticed his now smaller, feminine hands and the lighter and smoother skin that now covered them. He then moved his hands to the back of his head and noticed the long hair that covered it now. Pulling a strand of it in front of his face, he noticed its familiar blue color. It then dawned on him that there was one area of his body he still had to check for major changes. He let go of his hair and moved his hand downwards. Once it reached where his manhood would have been, realization hit him, now her, like a ton of bricks: she was female now. And not just that, she now had Dawn's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her new body, she noticed that oddly enough, she was still wearing her own clothes, only re-sized for Dawn's, now her, body. When Ash looked up again, she noticed that Dawn had stopped walking and was now looking back at her. \"Is something wrong Ash?\", asked Dawn, \"You suddenly stopped walking.\" Ash looked at Dawn, immediately noticing that she, now he, was in her original body wearing Dawn's clothes, only re-sized for Ash's body. However, it seemed that Dawn was completely oblivious to what was going on as he did not show the slightest reaction to seeing his original body. Seeing this, Ash came to the realization that this remote could alter reality. By pressing that button, Ash and Dawn had swapped bodies and reality was adjusted so that only she would know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t worry, nothing wrong over here\", Ash told Dawn in order to not draw attention to the fact that there really was something off, \"I thought my shoe was untied, but it was just my imagination.\" \"Oh, okay. Let\u2019s continue to Pallet Town then\", Dawn turned back around and continued walking, Ash quickly following a few steps behind. <br>\r\nAsh was amazed at the power the remote in her hands held and was eager to see what she could do with it. Thinking back, she remembered that when she pressed the button, she was aiming the remote in Dawn's direction, so this must be how the target is selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wasn't sure how she should go on from here. There were so many possibilities in just the palm of her hand. Sure, she could just press the blue button again and swap back, but trying out the other buttons promised to be exciting. In any case, reality was going to be adjusted, so nobody would notice anyway.</span></div></div>",

Sure, she could just press the blue button again and undo the body swap with Dawn, but she needed to satisfy her ever growing curiosity. So, deciding on the green button, she took aim at Dawn once again and pressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Ash was met with another change in perspective. This time however, it was not a change in height but rather she found herself in a different position than before. Ash noticed that Dawn was no longer ahead of her, so she turned around and saw her original body, wearing her original clothes standing in the exact same position she had been in just a few seconds ago. She then looked down at herself and saw that she was now wearing Dawn's outfit, which was now once again covering the body it belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Dawn? Why did you stop?\", Ash heard her original body ask. Wait, did he just call her 'Dawn'? So Ash had swapped positions and clothes with Dawn and was now being referred to as 'Dawn' by the real Dawn. Did that mean they swapped lives? \"It's nothing, Ash. I thought I heard some Pok\u00e9mon over there, but there weren\u2019t any\", Ash answered, including his name to see if he was right. \"Well, if you do see some, tell me. I want to catch a few new team members before we get to Pallet Town\", Dawn in Ash's body said enthusiastically. Ash was shocked, this was exactly what she wanted to do originally before finding the remote. This confirmed it, now Ash hadn\u2019t only swapped bodies with Dawn, but lives as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten confirmation on what the green button did, Ash turned back around and they both continued on their way to Pallet Town. While she was walking, she noticed that interestingly, she wasn\u2019t walking the way she normally did but in a more feminine manner, just like Dawn would. This meant that the remote even helps the user act like the life they swap into. Ash couldn\u2019t believe it, she was now Dawn in any way imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, what should she do from here on out? Yes, she could undo one or both of the swaps she had made, but where would be the fun in that? There were still many more buttons to experiment with, or she could just live as Dawn for now and keep further swaps for another day. In addition, even though Ash was now living another life, the remote was still in her hand. She could now be certain that the remote would follow her whenever she performed a swap like this.</span></div></div>",

Once Nurse Joy had given them their keys, they left the lobby and headed upstairs to their rooms.

This day had been wild. Finally, she could get some well needed rest. Looking at the remote in her hands though, a different thought crossed her mind: Why not have some more fun with it?

Examining herself, she saw that while she still had the body of Dawn she was now dressed in Nurse Joy's pink dress and white apron as well as her white cap. Looking towards the stairs, where she had been standing mere seconds ago was now Nurse Joy, dressed in Dawn's black and pink dress, pink boots and white hat. Both outfits were re-sized for the bodies they now covered as reality had adjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nurse Joy in Dawn's life noticed Ash looking in her direction, she gave a friendly wave and came over to the desk Ash now found herself behind.<br>\r\n    \"Good evening, Nurse Joy!\", she greeted Ash, \"I see you're finally able to get some rest.\"<br>\r\n    \"Ah, good evening to you too!\", Ash answered politely, \"Yes, my shift just ended so I'll return to my room and try to get a good night's sleep.\"<br>\r\n    \"Yeah, I guess I should be doing the same thing,\" Nurse Joy replied, \"I don't even know why I came down here in the first place. Anyway, good night!\"<br>\r\n    \"Thank you and sleep well!\", Ash replied as Nurse Joy was already headed back to the stairs.<br>\r\nWith that, Ash made her way to Nurse Joy's, now her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside 'her' room, Ash sat down on her bed and examined the room. That was when she noticed a peculiar photo that hung on the wall opposite of her bed, just over a small table with a vase of flowers. Curious, Ash got up to take a look at the picture and was astounded by what she saw. It was a photo of Nurse Joy's family, which in and of itself wouldn't be out of the ordinary, if it weren't for the fact that every Nurse Joy in the photo looked exactly like Dawn. Seeing this, Ash realized the ripple effect her swap with Nurse Joy had. As all Nurse Joys looked the same and she swapped into the life of one of them with another body, they now all looked liked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh couldn't help but laugh at this. She didn't expect something like this to happen, but was glad that it did. Having seen once again just how powerful the remote was, Ash decided to get ready for bed and keep further experiments for tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Looking at the clock once more she realized that it was very early in the morning, which was to be expected given that it was her, at least now that she was living this life, who was running the Pok\u00e9mon-Center. So, in order not to fail the responsibilities of this life, Ash started to get ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the remote's power, Ash was able to perfectly replicate Joy's morning routine. From making her bed, over her bathroom and dressing routine to preparing breakfast for herself, it was almost as if she was running on auto pilot. Once she was done with breakfast, she cleaned her used dishes and got ready start her work in the Pok\u00e9mon-Center. She grabbed the remote she had left on her night stand while she slept and headed for the door. On her way to there, she passed a full body mirror and was able to get another glance at herself. It was still so surreal, looking in the mirror and not only seeing Dawn in the reflection, but Dawn with Nurse Joy's signature uniform and hair style. Still, she had to get going and open the Pok\u00e9mon-Center. And so, Ash turned away from the mirror, left her room and got on her way to start working as Nurse Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had now been three hours since Ash had started her shift and nothing had really happened so far. Admittedly, it was still fairly early, but she had expected there would have been a bit more for her to do. It wasn't much later though that two familiar faces came downstairs from their rooms and were heading towards her.<br>\r\n    \"Good morning, Nurse Joy\", the real Nurse Joy living Dawn's life said, \"We wanted to return the keys to our rooms.\"<br>\r\n   \"Of course\", Ash replied, \"I hope you had a pleasant night.\"<br>\r\n    \"Definitely!\", Dawn in Ash's life and body exclaimed, \"I slept like a rock.\"<br>\r\n    \"That\u2019s good to hear\", Ash smiled like Nurse Joy normally would, \"Well then, you two are good to go. Have a safe trip!\"<br>\r\nBoth thanked Ash and waved goodbye before heading towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Ash had to act fast. If she didn\u2019t want to get separated from her own life, she had to quickly use the remote and swap back with the real Nurse Joy. And so, Ash took the remote and got ready to swap back into Dawn's life.</span></div></div>",

She quickly confirmed that she still had both the body and life of Dawn, so she wondered what exactly it was that the remote did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw was that were her old body stood before was now another Dawn, this one however dressed in a version of Dawn's normal outfit that had taken on a few features of Ash's original clothes. She wore a dress identical to the one Ash currently found herself in, except for the pink parts being colored red. Her head was covered by a version of Dawn's hat that inherited the red of Ash's cap as the color for the pok\u00e9ball symbol. While her hair clips were still colored yellow, her scarf now shared that same color like the stripe on Ash's jacket did. Lastly, instead of being colored pink, her boots sported the same red color Ash's original shoes did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was dumbfounded. There were now two Dawns, but she was unsure whether that was the only thing the remote did. She wouldn\u2019t remain in the dark for long, however, as the original, now new, Dawn spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is fun exploring Kanto with you sis! Too bad there are no contests for you to participate in,\" she said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah, seems like they are only hosted in Sinnoh and Hoenn,\" Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I'm so glad that you want to cheer me on when I take on the Kanto gyms, Dawn,\" Dawn said as she smiled at Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, so apparently she and Dawn were now twin sisters and this new Dawn wanted to take on the Kanto gyms. Did that mean Ash's original life was converted into this new Dawn or was it replaced? She decided to test that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you can always count on me, Ash,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do. And you should know that I don't like that nickname, just call me Ashley,\" Dawn replied a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just teasing,\" Ash tried to laugh it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, her original life had been converted into this new Dawn. She wondered whether or not this was reversible, but decided to think about that at a later time. For now, she thought about whether she should keep experimenting with the many unused buttons of the remote or if she should keep things as they were for now and explore this new reality.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash decided to explore this new reality for now, curious about what else might have changed. She put the remote into her bag and continued her journey with her new twin sister. Along the way, she wondered about two things:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were they going to do in Pallet Town? They were originally going to visit Ash's mother, but now that they were twins they were both from Sinnoh. She just had to wait and see what Dawn, now Ashley, would do once they got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about their Pok\u00e9mon? It seemed as though neither of them had been to Kanto yet, so they both would most likely only have Pok\u00e9mon from Sinnoh. But what about their first Pok\u00e9mon? Ash probably still had Dawn's Piplup, but as they both would have started their journey in Twinleaf Town Dawn, or Ashley, probably got one of the Sinnoh starters as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours of walking, the two finally reached their destination as Ash noticed the familiar sight of Pallet Town on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there, I can already see Pallet Town in the distance,\" Ash exclaimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now we just need to find Professor Oak's lab. Can you check your Pok\u00e9tch, Dawn?\" Dawn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Ash nodded as she started to type on her Pok\u00e9tch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Ash could have just led them to the lab - this was his home town after all - he decided to use the Pok\u00e9tch as to not make her sister wonder how she knew all this. Once the Pok\u00e9tch displayed the location of Professor Oak's lab, they headed there right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope we will find many new Pok\u00e9mon that we haven't already seen in Sinnoh,\" Dawn grinned at Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, Ashley. Maybe even a few that can help me in future contests,\" Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly made their way to the Professor's lab, which was located outside of town and easily recognizable thanks to it's signature windmill. Upon arrival, they were greeted by a dark haired boy in a green shirt and red shorts Ash recognized as Tracey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Tracey, the assistant of Professor Oak. Can I help you two?\" Tracey greeted the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Ashley and this is my twin sister Dawn,\" Dawn pointed at Ash who greeted Tracey politely. \"We're from Twinleaf Town in the Sinnoh Region and want to start our journey through Kanto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be here to ask the Professor for a Pok\u00e9dex, correct?\" Tracey guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Dawn answered with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, please come with me,\" Tracey went ahead into the lab, the twins following closely behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long until they found themselves face to face with Professor Oak, who greeted them with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello you two. So, you want to start your journey through the Kanto region?\" the Professor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right,\" Ash replied. \"My sister Ashley wants to take on the Kanto gyms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about you? You don't want to challenge the gym leaders?\" he asked Ash with a look of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am a Pok\u00e9mon coordinator.\" she told the Professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, I have heard about the Pok\u00e9mon contests they host in Sinnoh and Hoenn,\" he began to ponder. \"It would be quite interesting to watch one myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they will start hosting contests here as well,\" Dawn interjected. \"Then you could show your skills to Kanto, right sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that would be great,\" Ash smiled at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the conversation returned to the main reason for why Ash and Dawn had come to the Professor's lab. The professor went to a desk a few meters across the room and retrieved two Pok\u00e8dexes, one colored red and one colored pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to help you on your journey through the Kanto region, I want to give each of you a Pok\u00e9dex,\" he said as he handed Dawn the red one and Ash the pink one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Professor Oak!\" both sisters said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you both already have a Pok\u00e9mon?\", the Professor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Dawn told him. \"My sister has a Piplup and I have a Chimchar. We both decided that we wanted to start this journey with one Pok\u00e9mon each, so we left the rest of our teams in the care of Professor Rowan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then I wish both of you the very best on your journey through Kanto,\" Professor Oak shook both of the girls to send them off on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck on your journey,\" Tracey added. \"Also, you can always send your Pok\u00e9mon here in case your team gets too big. We will take good care of them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I'm sure you will,\" Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two twin sisters made their way out of the Professor's lab and headed back towards Pallet Town. As it got progressively darker, they both decided to spend the night at the local Pok\u00e9mon-Center and start their journey the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the Pok\u00e9mon-Center and were greeted by the once again normal Nurse Joy. Other than the last time though, they now shared a room. So, after they were given their key by the friendly nurse, they headed to their room and made themselves comfortable. Meanwhile, Ash thought about what had happened today. She had turned Dawn, who was in Ash's life and body, into her twin sister Ashley and now they were going to start their journey through Kanto. She didn't know if she could reverse this, but she was intrigued by this new reality and wanted to explore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she wondered whether she should stay in Dawn's life or if she should swap back lives and live as Ashley.</span></div></div>",

In the end, Ash decided to keep living Dawn's life and support her sister while she took on the gyms of the Kanto region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where are we going to head first, sis?\" Dawn asked, pulling Ash out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the gym closest to Pallet Town is in Viridian City,\" Ash told her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that's where we're going to head tomorrow,\" Dawn exclaimed. \"I can't wait to challenge my first Kanto gym!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sounds like a plan,\" Ash agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two sisters got ready to go to bed so they could get a head start on their way to Viridian City.

Thus, just like her sister, Ash laid down on her bed and slowly began to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Ash and Dawn got up early, eager to start their Kanto journey. After a small breakfast, they returned their room key to Nurse Joy and left the Pok\u00e9mon-Center. Their destination set, they made their way out of Pallet Town and followed the path through the surrounding fields. After a while, they entered a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we'll find a few new Pok\u00e9mon in this forest?\" Dawn asked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so,\" Ash replied. \"You're pretty motivated, aren't you, Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't wait to catch my first Kanto Pok\u00e9mon,\" Dawn exclaimed. \"Hopefully it won't be too long until we find one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we'll find one soon,\" Ash assured her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the two twin sisters heard the rustling of a bush on the side of the path. Turning to face it, they saw a small green and yellow Pok\u00e9mon poking its head out of the leaves. Using her new Pok\u00e9dex, Dawn found out this Pok\u00e9mon was a Caterpie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! You are going to be my first catch in Kanto!\" Dawn exclaimed, sending out her own Pok\u00e9mon. \"Go, Chimchar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chim!\" it called out, ready to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the fire-type Pok\u00e9mon, the Caterpie retreated into the bush and fled in the opposite direction. Dawn, not wanting to lose her opportunity to make her first catch, began chasing it with her Chimchar, closely followed by Ash. After chasing the small bug-type for a bit, they ended up losing it at the side of a small river flowing through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like we lost it, too bad!\" a disappointed Dawn said. \"You did a good job anyway, Chimchar. Come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Char!\" it said as it returned to its Pok\u00e9ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get it next time, Ashley,\" Ash said, trying to cheer up her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Dawn,\" Dawn said, smiling at Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's follow the river for a bit,\" Ash proposed. \"It seems like a nicer way through the forest than the path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, good idea!\" Dawn agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two followed the river through the forest, they enjoyed the beautiful scenery while also looking for any wild Pok\u00e9mon that might be nearby. Not long after, they could see a part of the river bank that was lined by many larger rocks. On one of these rocks sat a girl that Ash was familiar with, at least in her original life. As the two sisters got closer to the rocks, they could see that the girl was dressed in a yellow top and short denim shorts, held by two red suspenders strapped over her shoulders. She wore red and white sports shoes and her orange hair was held up in a side pony tail by a blue hair band. The girl was currently fishing and didn't notice the two sisters until Dawn approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, any luck yet?\" Dawn asked the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, but I haven't been here for too long either so I'm still pretty optimistic,\" the girl answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear,\" said Dawn. \"My name is Ashley and this is my twin sister Dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you! My name is Misty,\" she told the two. \"By the way, how did you even get here, this place is pretty far off the path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister wanted to catch a Pok\u00e9mon, but it ran away and we lost it at the river,\" Ash told Misty. \"We then decided to follow the river and got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we keep you company for a bit?\" Dawn asked. \"We could really use a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be glad if you did,\" Misty told the two sisters. \"If you want, I have a spare fishing rod you can use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much!\" Dawn smiled at Misty as she handed her her spare fishing rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Dawn sat down on some of the rocks next to Misty, who then explained to Dawn how to use the fishing rod. Once Dawn had successfully cast out the rod, the three began to talk about where they were from and their respective goals. Meanwhile, Ash thought about the remote again. She knew Misty from her original life, so it might be interesting to use it on her instead of her sister. However, she could also just enjoy the time they spent together for now and use the remote another time.</span></div></div>",

First of all, Misty didn't have any clothes on her anymore and instead of being put up in a side pony tail, her hair now ran down her back freely. She was still sitting on the same rock, but neither she nor Dawn were fishing anymore as there was no sign of the fishing rods or even Misty's bag that had leaned against the rock before. Strangest of all was her interaction with Dawn, though. Before, they had been talking about what they wanted to achieve on their journeys, but now the conversation was something Ash would never have expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a cool Pok\u00e9mon!\" Dawn said with visible excitement. \"I have never seen anything like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mis...\" Misty says, slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I check your Pok\u00e9dex entry?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty, Misty,\" she answered, shaking her head to signify that it was okay if she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Dawn pulled out her Pok\u00e9dex which then displayed an interesting entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Misty, the swimmer Pok\u00e9mon. Type(s): Water.<br>\r\nMistys are most commonly found near bodies of water where they spend most of their time either swimming or resting near the shore. They enjoy the company of other water-type Pok\u00e9mon and tend to form close bonds with them, but are rather hesitant towards Gyarados. Conversely, they show a strong aversion towards bug-type Pok\u00e9mon and will try to keep them at as much distance as possible.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was dumbfounded, she had just turned Misty into her own species of Pok\u00e9mon. This remote was incredible. Still, she was interested in how Misty and Dawn now interacted with each other. Before the change to reality, the two of them seemed to get along with one another pretty well and it looked like this was still the case in this new one. Their encounter in this reality must have gone similarly to the one Ash remembered, the difference being that they had encountered a Pok\u00e9mon resting at the riverbank instead of a girl fishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, since we get along pretty well, wouldn't you like to join me on my journey?\" Dawn proposed to Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mis?\" she asked, a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to challenge the gyms of the Kanto region and compete in the Indigo League and I would love to have you on my team.\" Dawn told her with a smile on her face. \"What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty...\" she pondered for a moment before making up her mind. \"Mis, Misty Mis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Dawn happily asked before taking a Pok\u00e9ball from her bag and holding it in front of Misty. \"I promise to take good care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty, Mis,\" she said with a smile as she touched the center of the Pok\u00e9ball, getting pulled in by the red beam of energy it emitted. The ball wiggled once in her hand before dinging, signaling that Misty had been caught. Dawn looked at the ball in her hand with a smile, then struck a pose to celebrate having caught her first Kanto Pok\u00e9mon. \"Yeah, I caught a Misty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving watched the entire situation unfold, Ash couldn't help but grin at how ridiculous this all was. Her former traveling companion was now a Pok\u00e9mon, caught by her new twin sister. Seeing the grin on her sister's face, Dawn went over to her and presented the ball containing her newest team member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Dawn? Didn't I catch a cool new Pok\u00e9mon?\" she asked her sister proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did, Ashley. Congratulations!\" Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, should we get back on our way to Viridian City?\" Dawn proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we should. According to my Pok\u00e9tch we'll be there by tonight.\" Ash told her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's go!\" Dawn exclaimed as the two were once again headed for Viridian City, now with one more member in their group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had already set as the two twins reached Viridian City so they quickly made their way to the local Pok\u00e9mon-Center and got a room for the night. While Dawn made herself comfortable on her bed, Ash pondered whether she should use the remote some more. For now, she didn't want to change her twin, but as there were plenty of possible targets in the Center's lobby she could still experiment to her hearts content.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash decided against using the remote and, like her sister, made herself comfortable on her bed. Before she went to sleep, however, Dawn had a favor to ask of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dawn,\" she began. \"Before we go to the gym tomorrow, can we maybe have a training match? I want my Misty to gain some experience before she gets to fight in a gym battle, so I thought she could train with your Piplup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Ashley.\" Ash agreed, incredibly curious to see Misty fight in a Pok\u00e9mon battle. \"I believe there is a battleground behind the Pok\u00e9mon-Center, we can go there after breakfast tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best, sis!\" Dawn smiled at her sister. \"I can't wait for tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither,\" Ash smiled back at her sister as both of them went to sleep, eagerly awaiting their training match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Ash and Dawn got up early and made their way to the Pok\u00e9mon-Center's lobby to eat breakfast. Once they were done eating, the two quickly made their way to the battleground and went to their respective positions at the sides of the field. Ready to battle, they reached for their Pok\u00e9balls and sent out their Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Piplup, it's your turn!\" Ash called out as she sent her Piplup into battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pip!\" it said as it proudly stood on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, I choose you!\" shouted Dawn as she sent out her Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty Mis!\" she said, ready for her first battle with her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sisters looked at each other with a confident expression on their faces as they started the battle. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Misty, let's start off with Water Gun!\" Dawn instructed her Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty!\" Misty said as she shot a stream of water from her mouth at her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, dodge to the left and use Peck!\" Ash shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely avoiding the attack, Piplup did as his trainer said and charged at Misty, his beak starting to glow white. Not giving Misty the time to dodge, he landed his attack, causing her to fall back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang in there, Misty!\" Dawn called out to her. \"Use Double slap now that Piplup is close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty!\" she yelled as she approached the smaller Pok\u00e9mon, her hands glowing like Piplup's beak did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use Bide!\" Ash said as Piplup took the hits from Dawn's Misty, getting ready to retaliate. Once Misty began to back off from her attack, Piplup charged at her. \"Piplup Pip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump over the attack!\" Dawn shouted, her Misty able to jump at the last second and avoiding the attack thanks to her significant height advantage. \"That was a close one! Now, use Water Gun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty!\" she said as she once again shot a stream of water from her mouth, this time hitting Piplup and causing it to stagger a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piplup, no!\" Ash yelled, her Piplup now an easy target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's finish this with another Double Slap!\" Dawn shouted confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty!\" Dawn's Misty charged at her staggering opponent, landing another Double Slap. Ash's Piplup was sent flying, landing a few meters from Misty with a dazed look on his face. He was unable to battle, Misty had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won! Great job Misty!\" Dawn cheered, running over to her Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mis Misty!\" she smiled as she hugged her trainer, happy to have won her first battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh walked over to her Piplup, helping it sit back up and congratulating it on doing a great job despite not ending up winning. The disappointed Pok\u00e9mon was quickly cheered up and both trainers returned their Pok\u00e9mon to their Pok\u00e9balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a great battle,\" Dawn said to her sister. \"Thank you for training with me before taking on the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm always happy to help you, Ashley,\" Ash told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their training match finished, the two sisters headed back to the Pok\u00e9mon-Center to get their Pok\u00e9mon back to full health. After that, they could finally head to the Viridian City Gym.</span></div></div>",

Once they reached the gym, however, they immediately noticed a sign attached to its closed front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Viridian City Gym is currently closed as the position of Gym Leader is unoccupied. Challenges will be accepted again once a new Gym Leader has been found. We are sorry for the inconvenience.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was surprised. Last time she was in Viridian City, Agatha had taken over the role as Gym Leader until they found a new one. It seemed as though they still hadn't found anybody for the position though, and as Agatha couldn't fill in permanently due to her status as a member of the Elite Four, they had to temporarily close the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious!\" a disappointed Dawn shouted out. \"I wanted to get my first gym badge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be helped,\" Ash told her sister. \"You'll just have to challenge another gym. As far as I know, the closest gym aside from this one is in Pewter City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll head to Pewter City!\" Dawn decided with determination. \"There I'll really get my first badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Sis,\" Ash agreed as the two began heading towards Pewter City. \"We'll need to cross Viridian Forest though. You might want to keep your Misty in her Pok\u00e9ball because there are many bug-type Pok\u00e9mon there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" Dawn nodded. \"But Chimchar can handle them easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ash and Dawn made their way towards Viridian Forest, their first waypoint on their way to Pewter City.</span></div></div>",

Both sisters were slightly disappointed by this, having hoped to find a few additions to their teams. It didn't take much longer, however, until the two finally spotted something a little off the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting behind a bush next to a small clearing was a woman with blonde hair, dressed in a white top with green trousers and brown boots. The camera she was holding was pointed at a tree in the center of the clearing where the twins spotted a Butterfree searching for berries. Trying not to disturb either of them, they slowly and quietly made their way over to the woman. A sudden clicking sound caused by the camera broke the silence of the scene and they could see the Butterfree flying away from the tree and back into the forest. Looking at her camera, the smile the woman made showed that the picture she had taken was a good one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the photo turn out well?\" Ash asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can't wait to display it in my gallery,\" the woman answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your gallery?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me introduce myself,\" the woman began friendly. \"My name is Viola, I am the Gym Leader of Santalune City in the Kalos Region. I am also a passionate photographer, so I set up a gallery at my gym where I display my photos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Viola,\" Dawn replied. \"My name is Ashley and this is my twin sister Dawn. We're from Twinleaf Town in the Sinnoh Region.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too,\" Viola said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you come here all the way from Kalos to take pictures of Pok\u00e9mon?\" Ash asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" she explained. \"I specialize in bug-type Pok\u00e9mon and Viridian Forest is widely known for being home to many different kinds of bug-types.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we maybe take a look at some of the pictures you took?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Viola agreed. \"I'm always happy to share my pictures with others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dawn went over to Viola to take a look at the pictures she had taken, Ash thought about using the remote again. It had been a while since she last used it and Viola seemed to be an interesting target. In the end, she had made her decision.</span></div></div>",

Like Misty, Viola now had no clothes on her, but her hair still looked the same. Instead of her camera, she now showed a colorful object to Dawn, who looked at it with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this looks beautiful,\" she said as she waved for her sister to come closer to them. \"Take a look at this, Dawn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash walked over to them, she saw that the object was made from various berries and flowers and that it shone a little as it was hit by the sunlight reaching through the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, this looks amazing,\" she agreed with her sister and looked at Viola. \"Did you make this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vi, Viola!\" she nodded happily, glad that the two trainers liked her creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what the Pok\u00e9dex can tell us,\" said Dawn as she pulled out her Pok\u00e9dex. Not long after, it displayed the entry they were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Viola, the Artist Pok\u00e9mon. Type(s): Bug.<br>\r\nViolas can create a clear, glue-like liquid from their saliva which is among the strongest adhesives currently known. They use this liquid to encase and preserve various berries and flowers, arranging them into colorful artworks. The strength of the adhesive makes them incredibly robust, but it can be dissolved again if they apply more of their saliva. Violas love presenting their creations to both people and Pok\u00e9mon. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Artist Pok\u00e9mon?\" Ash began. \"With how good your artwork looks, that description definitely fits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vi Vi!\" Viola cheered at the praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dawn,\" Dawn approached her sister. \"You should ask her if she wants to come with you. I bet she would do great in a Pok\u00e9mon Contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea, Sis!\" Ash said and turned towards Viola. \"Would you like to come with me, Viola? I want to become a Top Pok\u00e9mon Coordinator and would be very happy if you wanted to join us. You could also show everyone your creations when we compete in contests together. I'm sure they will all love them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viola, La!\" Viola happily nodded, excited at the prospect of showing her creations to a larger audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'll take good care of you, Viola,\" Ash said as she took a Pok\u00e9ball from her bag and held it in front of Viola. Like with Misty before, Viola pressed the center of the Pok\u00e9ball and was quickly pulled in by the red beam of energy it sent out. After shaking once, it made the familiar sound that indicated that the Pok\u00e9mon had been caught. Excitedly striking the same pose her sister did, Ash celebrated having caught her first Kanto Pok\u00e9mon of this life. \"Yeah, I caught a Viola!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Dawn!\" Dawn said, still holding the artwork Viola had presented them earlier. \"Now we both have our first Kanto Pok\u00e9mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ashley!\" Ash replied with a smile. \"I can't wait to compete in Contests with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can't wait to watch your performances,\" Dawn said, then gave her sister the artwork Viola had shown them earlier. \"Here, you should have this. This was made by your Pok\u00e9mon after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I will carry this with me as a memory of how we met Viola,\" Ash told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new member to their group, Ash and Dawn continued their journey to Pewter City, where Dawn would challenge her first gym in the Kanto Region.</span></div></div>",

After a short stay at the Pok\u00e9mon-Center where Nurse Joy returned their Pok\u00e9mon to full health, the twins were on their way to the Pewter City Gym. As they approached the gym, Dawn got increasingly excited for her battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, my first Kanto Gym Battle!\" she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got this, Ashley!\" Ash motivated her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the support, Sis,\" Dawn smiled at Ash as they entered the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the gym, Ash and Dawn immediately noticed the battlefield at the center of the large room. Unlike the one in Viridian City, this field was very rocky with large boulders spread all over it. Across the battlefield, they saw somebody sitting atop a small stone pedestal. He had spiky brown hair and wore an orange t-shirt under a green vest as well as brown trousers and gray shoes. Seeing the two girls enter his gym, he stood up and introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Pewter City Gym,\" he began. \"My name is Brock and I am the Gym Leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Ashley, and this is my twin sister Dawn,\" Dawn introduced herself as well. \"I am here to challenge you to a battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I accept your challenge,\" Brock said. \"Is this your first Gym Battle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here in Kanto, yes,\" Dawn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, we will both be fighting with two Pok\u00e9mon each,\" he told her. \"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she nodded as she headed to her position at the end of the battlefield. While Brock and Dawn got ready for their battle, Ash headed to the stands at the side of the field. With everybody on their positions, the two opponents started their battle. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geodude, it's your turn!\" Brock called out as he sent out his first Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geodude!\" it said as is came out of its Pok\u00e9ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this, Misty!\" Dawn shouted as she sent out her own Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty Mis!\" she said, ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, you have a water-type Pok\u00e9mon,\" Brock noted. \"A good choice against my rock-types. But it takes more than just type advantage to win a battle. Geodude, use Tackle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geo!\" the rock-type charged at Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick Misty, jump!\" Dawn instructed her Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mis!\" like in her battle against Piplup, her height advantage helped her jump over the attack at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now follow up with Water Gun!\" Dawn called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in the air, Misty spun around and fired a Water Gun from her mouth at her opponent. \"Ty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to dodge it, Geodude was hit by the super effective attack \"Geodude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Geodude!\" Brock yelled as his Pok\u00e9mon found itself in a tight spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now finish it with Double Slap!\" Dawn shouted as her Misty landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty!\" Misty's hands began to glow as she charged at her opponent. Landing the two hits of her attack, she sent Brock's Geodude flying into the nearest boulder. A dazed look on it's face, it was unable to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Misty!\" Dawn praised her Pok\u00e9mon as there now was only one Pok\u00e9mon left to beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it up, Misty!\" Ash cheered from the stands. \"You can do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Geodude, return,\" Brock said as Geodude was pulled back into its Pok\u00e9ball. \"Your Misty is a really good fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Dawn said as she gave a confident smile. \"We trained hard, together with my sister and her Pok\u00e9mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that, but you still haven't won. There's one more Pok\u00e9mon you have to beat,\" Brock said as he reached for his second Pok\u00e9ball. \"Go, Onix!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Onix!\" the huge Pok\u00e9mon towered over the field as it was sent out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, start with Tackle!\" he instructed his Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, jump!\" Dawn yelled as Brock's Onix charged at her Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's Misty was barely able to avoid the attack, but unlike before, her opponent was prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time! Onix, use Wrap!\" Brock had predicted what his opponent was trying and knew how to react. The airborne Misty was an easy target as Onix grabbed her with its tail, trapping it in its tight grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miiiiis!\" the trapped Pok\u00e9mon cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, no!\" Dawn yelled as Onix tightened its grip on her Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing the same thing twice makes your opponent able to react to it,\" Brock lectured his challenger. \"Now your Misty is unable to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn had to think fast. If she didn't come up with a strategy quickly, her Misty would lose the battle. Suddenly, she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, use Rain Dance!\" she called out to her Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty Ty!\" Misty yelled. Her arms not constrained by Onix's grip, she formed a light blue sphere between her hands and launched it at the ceiling. As clouds began to form under the gym's roof, it started to rain, irritating Onix just enough for it to loosen its grip on Misty. Using her chance, Misty freed herself and positioned herself before her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A clever idea,\" said Brock as he looked at the clouds. \"But it won't be enough. Onix, use Tackle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodge!\" Dawn shouted as the large Pok\u00e9mon came charging at Misty, who was once again able to dodge the attack. This time, however, she was much quicker than before and was able to avoid ending up in Onix's grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now use Water Gun!\" Dawn followed up as she saw that her Pok\u00e9mon was free to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty!\" Misty fired a stream of water from her mouth, this one being more powerful than the one that hit Geodude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Onix, no!\" Brock shouted as his Pok\u00e9mon was hit by the attack. Realizing what was happening, he turned to Dawn. \"So your Misty has the ability Swift Swim. She gets faster and her water-type moves increase in strength in the rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the Swimmer Pok\u00e9mon after all,\" Dawn answered. \"And now, we're going to finish this battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty!\" her Misty agreed, ready to take down her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that,\" Brock answered. \"Onix, get her with Wrap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Onix charged at Misty, she once again dodged the attack, circling it and getting behind it at incredible speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done Misty!\" Dawn yelled. \"Now finish it off with Water Gun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty!\" Misty shouted as she fired one final stream of water at her opponent. As it got hit by the stream, Onix began to tumble and finally collapsed on the battlefield, unable to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it Misty, we won!\" Dawn cheered as she ran to her Pok\u00e9mon and hugged it tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mis, Misty Mis!\" Misty joined her trainer's cheers, proud of how she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, Misty, congratulations!\" Ash called out to the two victors, running over to them from the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recalling his Onix into its Pok\u00e9ball, Brock made his way to the celebrating trainers. Reaching out his hand, he presented the reward for beating the Pewter City Gym Leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a great battle, you two have truly earned the Boulder Badge.\" he said as he handed the badge to Dawn. \"You and your Misty are a great team and I hope that you will do just as good on the rest of your journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Brock!\" Dawn happily said as she accepted the badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you have the Boulder Badge, you should probably head towards Cerulean City,\" Brock suggested. \"I think challenging this gym next would be a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, now we know our next destination, right Misty?\" she asked her Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty!\" she nodded in approval before being returned to her Pok\u00e9ball to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck on your journey, Ashley,\" Brock said with a smile, then turned towards Ash. \"And good luck to you too, Dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Ash smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ash and Dawn left the Pewter City Gym. Having won her first gym badge, Dawn was looking forward to challenging the other gyms of the region. Their next destination in mind, their journey continued.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After leaving the Pewter City Gym, Ash and Dawn made their way to the Pok\u00e9mon-Center to have Nurse Joy take care of Misty. Once Misty returned from the nurse's care, they were planning eating together with all their Pok\u00e9mon. However, that meant that they first had to get Misty to be more comfortable around Ash's Viola. It took the two trainers a while, but they finally managed to get Misty to sit at the same table as Viola. On opposite sides, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group enjoyed their break as they all happily ate, Ash and Dawn sharing a plate of rice balls while their Pok\u00e9mon each had their own bowl of Pok\u00e9mon food. As they were eating, Viola tried interacting with Misty who was still rather hesitant, but over time got more comfortable around the bug-type Pok\u00e9mon. It seemed as though the two Pok\u00e9mon slowly grew closer with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their meal finished, the two twins returned their Pok\u00e9mon to their Pok\u00e9balls and went back to the Pok\u00e9mon-Center lobby. There, they noticed a poster on the wall next to the reception. As they got closer to the poster, they saw that it was advertising the underwater ballet of the Cerulean City Gym Leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you also interested in the underwater ballet?\" they heard as two girls approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl was dressed in a dark gray top with a white collar and a red skirt as well as black stockings and shoes. Her honey-blonde hair reached down to her shoulders, covered by a dark pink hat with a black bow. Next to her stood a girl with tan skin, her brown hair kept in curly pigtails. She wore a dark pink T-shirt with three black bows at the front, fairly small denim shorts with black frills at the bottom and pink heeled shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just noticed the poster,\" Dawn replied. \"But it does look interesting, right Dawn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does,\" Ash agreed. \"We're headed to Cerulean City anyways, so we could definitely go watch it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind if we joined you on the way there?\" the brown-haired girl asked. \"It should be fun if we traveled as a group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Dawn told the two, then turned to Ash. \"What about you, Sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that too,\" said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'm happy to hear that,\" the honey-blonde girl smiled. \"My name is Serena, and this is my friend Shauna. We're both Pok\u00e9mon performers from the Kalos region.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, I'm Ashley and this is my twin sister Dawn. We're from the Sinnoh region,\" Dawn introduced herself and her sister. \"While my sister is a Pok\u00e9mon coordinator, I want to challenge the gyms of the Kanto region and compete in the Indigo League.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you came all the way from Kalos to watch the underwater ballet in Cerulean City?\" Ash asked the girl that had introduced herself as Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In part, yes,\" Serena began. \"We want to travel through the Kanto region to find inspiration for new elements to include in our showcases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Dawn?\" Shauna asked Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mainly want to support my sister on her journey,\" Ash told her. \"But I also want to find many new Pok\u00e9mon that I can compete in contests with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, could you tell me a bit about Pok\u00e9mon showcases?\" a curious Dawn asked. \"I haven't really heard about them before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Shauna agreed as the two Kalosians began telling Dawn about Pok\u00e9mon showcases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ash thought about using the remote again. The two girls seemed to be interesting targets, but she could also just leave the remote aside for now and enjoy the journey with them normally.</span></div></div>",

Other than her last uses of the remote, however, there were now more visible changes to be noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Serena's loose pony tail was now held together by a small ring of fire, Shauna's hair had taken on a slightly more green shade and had small leaves growing out of it. Ash was a little surprised by this, wondering if this might happen more in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that the remote had done its work, she walked over to her sister and the two former trainers. Instead of being told about Pok\u00e9mon showcases, Dawn was now gently stroking Shauna's head. Ash soon did the same for Serena, the two new Pok\u00e9mon visibly enjoying this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are very pretty Pok\u00e9mon,\" Dawn said as she stroked Shauna's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shauna Na!\" she said with a joyful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are definitely right about that, Sis,\" Ash agreed with her sister, stroking Serena's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Se Serena!\" Serena said, leaning her head to the side a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about the changes that had taken place, Ash reached for her Pok\u00e9dex and looked for their entries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Serena, the Treat Pok\u00e9mon. Type(s): Fairy, Fire.<br>\r\nSerenas are very kind Pok\u00e9mon that use their fire abilities to create sweet treats to share with other Pok\u00e9mon. This makes them very popular with caf\u00e9s and bakeries, where you can often order their creations. They value their appearance highly, resulting in fiery outbursts if they get dirty. Serenas often form close bonds with Shaunas and love joining their performances.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shauna, the Performer Pok\u00e9mon. Type(s): Fairy, Grass.<br>\r\nShaunas are cheerful Pok\u00e9mon that often stage performances for other wild Pok\u00e9mon, creating intricate and colorful costumes from flowers and foliage. In battle, their strong spirit makes them capable fighters, especially when protecting those close to them. Shaunas often form close bonds with Serenas and enjoy helping them create their sweet treats.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where is your trainer?\" Dawn asked, looking around the lobby. \"As far as I can see, there is no one here besides us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't have a trainer,\" Nurse Joy approached them, having overheard their conversation from the reception. \"They are wild Pok\u00e9mon that live here in the Pok\u00e9mon-Center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How long have they lived here now?\" Ash asked the friendly nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've been here for quite a while now,\" Nurse Joy continued her explanation. \"A few trainers have offered to take them with them on their journeys, but they always refused as none of them wanted to take both of them. They're pretty much inseparable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe these trainers would be willing to separate the two,\" Ash fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you two are the first trainers they approached by themselves,\" Nurse Joy told them. \"I think they want to come with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true?\" Dawn asked Shauna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sha!\" Shauna nodded with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena!\" Serena happily agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll gladly take you with us,\" Dawn told the two of them with a smile. \"Which one of us do you want to join?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Pok\u00e9mon, already having made their decisions, walked towards the trainer they wanted to travel with. Serena decided to join Ash's team, while Shauna wanted to join Dawn's team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are sure you don't want to both join one of us?\" Ash asked the two fairy-types. \"You would be on the same team then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serena Na!\" Serena nodded happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shauna Sha!\" Shauna also nodded, her decision final.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with us being sisters, it's pretty unlikely that they will ever get separated for long.\" Dawn reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will gladly welcome you on my team, Serena,\" Ash told her, taking a Pok\u00e9ball from her bag and holding it in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also happy to have you on my team, Shauna,\" Dawn said as she too held a Pok\u00e9ball in front of Shauna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Pok\u00e9mon happily pressed the center of the Pok\u00e9balls and got pulled inside by the red beam of energy. After shaking once in their hands, the balls signaled that the two Pok\u00e9mon had been caught. Excited to have new members on their teams, the two twins shared a happy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy that the two of them have finally found trainers that will keep them together,\" Nurse Joy said as she smiled at the two trainers. \"I can see that they're in good hands now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Nurse Joy,\" Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their two new Pok\u00e9mon in tow, Ash and Dawn said goodbye to Nurse Joy and set out on their way to Cerulean City, where Dawn was going to challenge her second Kanto gym.</span></div></div>",

He took a look at the remote, trying to remember what button he'd pressed so he could avoid pressing it again, not wanting for Misty's problem to get any worse then it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Ash set his sights on a button that was on the top left corner of the remote, which wasn't labeled, like any of the other buttons, but it wouldn't hurt to give it a try...hopefully. With the button that he had in mind Ash turned around and faced the remote at Misty once again, making sure that it would be in range to hit her as his thumb slowly inched towards the button. \"Alright, Misty, it's time to change you...I hope.\" He reluctantly said, giving the button a press as a beam shot out, going straight towards Misty's brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's eyes had instantly closed as the beam went for her brain, changing her mind's process of thought as she soon woke up, blinking as she looked around for a couple of seconds with a sense of curiosity before staring at Ash, or rather, her 'daddy'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" Misty angrily shouted, crossing her arms as she stared at Ash, \"You haven't changed my diapee yet! You better not have weft my diapees back home!\" She pouted, speaking in a more childish voice as poked at her diaper, clearly wanting out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh couldn't help but facepalm, knowing that the situation was, unfortunately, not fixed. He could always just try and use the remote again, but at this point, was it even worth it? What would he do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She moved toward him and squatted with a face full of adoration.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201eI have no idea why I never noticed that glorious fact, but your Pikachu\u2019s raw power is magnificent. Did you know that in Alola a plan was recently announced to gather many Pikachu and make an electric power plant? Doesn\u2019t this sound like a marvelous idea for increasing the Alolan power grid effectiveness?\".<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201ePika?\u201d - said Pikachu bewildered from hearing all that word salad coming out of Misty\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you sound like a Pokedex!\" - Ash exclaimed - \"Hold on Misty!

I urgently want to meet the famous Professor Oak and ask him a few distinctive questions.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs soon as she finished the sentence her jean shorts started to expand downward until they transformed into regular jeans. Shortly afterward, just as fast as before those jeans changed into khaki pants. Yellow crop top she was wearing did the same, but horizontal. Buttons appeared all over, changing it into a yellow, long-sleeved, buttoned shirt. Her physique also got thinner and more scrawny.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201eOh no! It\u2019s getting worse!\u201d - Ash said ignoring Misty's question and still holding the remote, hoping that the right answer will come to him sooner or later on its own.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe changes continued as her suspenders and sneakers lost their original color and became brown. Brown, dotted bow-tie appeared under the chin. Her short, side ponytail broke loose as her hair grew slightly longer and became a little more greasy. Freckles, that had the same color as her hair, started to appear one by one on her face. At last, she reached to her shirt pocket and pulled out the case which held her glasses. Misty put them on naturally like she was doing that every day. The black, square rimmed frames fitted her round face nicely.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAsh stood there shocked with his mouth in agape. He couldn\u2019t believe that the device was powerful enough to change a person so drastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Ash? Do any unwanted piece of material got in my hair?\" - said Misty in a slightly more high pitched voice. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Not knowing any of their functions, he randomly pressed the blue button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Ash felt very different. His perspective had shifted slightly downwards and he noticed weight in areas were there had been none before, namely his chest and the back of his head, and yet other parts of his body felt lighter. Irritated by the new sensations, Ash took a peek at his chest and was shocked to see two mounds on his formerly flat chest. Taking a hand to his chest to confirm whether this was actually real, he noticed his now smaller, feminine hands and the lighter and smoother skin that now covered them. Upon seeing these changes, Ash got a suspicion of what had happened and needed to confirm it. He reached behind his back and felt... hair, a lot of it. This was enough to confirm his suspicion, he had actually turned into Serena. Then it dawned on him, there was one area of his body he still had to check for changes. Not daring to look, he pulled his hand away from his hair and slowly moved it towards that part. Once he reached it, realization hit him, now her, like a ton of bricks: she was actually female now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally managing to look downward again, she notices that, oddly enough, she was still wearing her own clothes, only re-sized for Serena's, now her, body. Looking back at where Serena was standing, Ash saw that she, now he, was in her original body, wearing Serena's clothes re-sized for Ash's body. However, it seemed that Serena was completely oblivious to what was going on as she was still talking to Clemmont, who also seemed not to notice anything. Seeing this, Ash came to the realization that this remote could alter reality. By pressing that button, Ash and Serena had swapped bodies and reality was adjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was amazed at the power the remote in her hands held and was eager to see what she could do with it. Thinking back, she remembered that when she pressed the button, she was aiming the remote in Serena's direction, so this must be how the target is selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wasn't sure how she should go on from here. Unfortunately, she couldn't remember which button she pressed to swap with Serena, so if she wanted to swap back, she had to guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not knowing any of their functions, he randomly pressed the blue button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Ash felt very different. His perspective had shifted slightly downwards and he noticed weight in areas were there had been none before, namely his chest and the back of his head, and yet other parts of his body felt lighter. Irritated by the new sensations, Ash took a peek at his chest and was shocked to see two mounds on his formerly flat chest. Taking a hand to his chest to confirm whether this was actually real, he noticed his now smaller, feminine hands and the lighter and smoother skin that now covered them. Upon seeing these changes, Ash got a suspicion of what had happened and needed to confirm it. He reached behind his back and felt... hair, a lot of it. This was enough to confirm his suspicion, he had actually turned into Serena. Then it dawned on him, there was one area of his body he still had to check for changes. Not daring to look, he pulled his hand away from his hair and slowly moved it towards that part. Once he reached it, realization hit him, now her, like a ton of bricks: she was actually female now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally managing to look downward again, she notices that, oddly enough, she was still wearing her own clothes, only re-sized for Serena\u2019s, now her, body. Looking back at where Serena was standing, Ash saw that she, now he, was in her original body, wearing Serena\u2019s clothes re-sized for Ash's body. However, it seemed that Serena was completely oblivious to what was going on as she was still talking to Clemont, who also seemed not to notice anything. Seeing this, Ash came to the realization that this remote could alter reality. By pressing that button, Ash and Serena had swapped bodies and reality was adjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was amazed at the power the remote in her hands held and was eager to see what she could do with it. Thinking back, she remembered that when she pressed the button, she was aiming the remote in Serena\u2019s' direction, so this must be how the target is selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wasn't sure how she should go on from here. Unfortunately, she couldn't remember which button she pressed to swap with Serena, so if she wanted to swap back, she had to guess.</span></div></div>",

Lillie had wanted to see Ash's home, so when he went home for a break, she asked to come along. Ash was happy to have her, and it gave him someone else to talk to besides Pikachu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see your home town, Ash!\" said an exited Lillie. \"Yeah! It'll be great to be home again!\" said an equally enthusiastic Ash. Pikachu chimes in with an excited \"Pika Pika!', as if he agreed. Ash continued \"My mom is expecting us. She's prepared the guest room for you to stay in while we're here\" \"That is so sweet of her, but she didn't have to go to all that trouble\" said a bashful Lillie. \"Nonsense!\" said Ash \"She can't wait to meet you. I think the two of you will get along great!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there's a rustling in a nearby bush. \"What's that??\" asked a scared Lillie, moving close to Ash. \"Probably a Pokemon. Hey Pikachu, go check it out!\" Pikachu jumps off his trainers shoulder and runs over to the bush. As soon as he is about to look in the bush, a rattata darts out of the bush, starting Pikachu and Lillie even more so. \"AHHHHH!!! What was that??\" she exclaimed, clinging to Ash's arm. \"Just a Rattata. There's pretty common around here\". Lillie loosens her grip on Ash, \"But that one was purpl... oh!! that's right. Rattatas here aren't like the ones in Alola\" an embarrassed Lillie says, letting go of Ash. \"You're fine Lillie, those little guys come be pretty shocking. Come on Pikachu, let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Pikachu is messing with the bush. \"What is it, buddy?\" Pikachu takes something out of the bush and brings it over to Ash. It looks like some kind of remote, with several buttons on it. \"A remote?\" said Lillie \"What's that doing in a bush?\" \"I'm not sure\" says Ash. The remote has several buttons on it. They are labeled as Body, Head, Clothes, and a few others, \"I wonder that this does?' asked Lillie. \"Well, only one way to find out!\" Ash says as he pushes a button<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was Ash pointing the remote at when he pressed the button?</span></div></div>",

Wait, what's up with my voice? I sound like-\" but before he can finish, he is cut off by a loud scream, which sounded an awful lot like his own voice. Spinning around to find the source, Ash sees... Himself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Mallow had been standing, was a carbon copy of his own body, dressed head to toe in Mallows outfit. Strangely enough, the outfit seems to fit his body perfectly, though it isn't filled out as nicely due to the lack of curves and breasts on Ash's body, as well as the slight bulge filling out the front of the overalls. Glancing down at his own body, Ash finds his view obscured by a pair of breasts pushing out of his chest. He can feel his now long hair tickling the back of his neck as well as the fact that he is now much lighter. Pulling his shorts out at the front, he can see that his \"little friend\" is now gone, causing him to blush profusely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ash is that you?\" his old voice calls out. Glancing at his own body, Ash sees that Mallow is starting to tear up, clearly upset about the situation. \"Yeah it's me\" he replies, still not used to his new feminine voice. \"What the heck happened Ash?!? I'm you! This isn't normal!\" Mallow yells, on the verge of crying, \"It must have been that weird remote!\" she realizes, cheering up slightly. \"You're probably right, let me take a look..\" Ash says, as he looks over the remote, though without any distinct markings, he can't work out which button they pressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no good, the only difference with these buttons is the colors... Uhh, what are you doing\" he says, as he looks over to see Mallow checking out her new body, currently with her new masculine hands on her overalls encased ass. \"Hmm? Oh nothing, I just like how I look in this outfit, so I thought I'd check out how you look in it\" She replies, giving her ass a small slap. \"Oh yeah? Well how would you like it if I did this?\" He responds, as he grabs his new breasts, squeezing them slightly, which causes him to moan and Mallow to blush. \"Ash that's not the same at... AH! What the heck? Why is... Ewwwww!\" She yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Ash looks down and can see the formerly slight bulge in Mallows overalls has now grown, causing a rather large tent to have formed. \"Hehe, seems like somebody likes what they saw\" Ash chuckles, though it comes out as more of a giggle. \"Ash this is so not funny, change us back right now!\" Mallow says, blushing and trying to cover the growing bulge in her shorts. \"Damn, Ash is pretty big down there...No, bad thoughts!\" She thinks to herself as she can feel her panties tightening even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you at least try to cover up a bit? If anybody sees my body in your outfit, I'll never live it down!\" Ash says to her, glancing around to see if anybody else is in the area. \"Oh come on Ash lighten up, I think this outfit is pretty cute\" she says, striking a girly pose. \"And besides, we've all seen you dressed up as Nurse Joy, what's so different about dressing up as me?\". \"It's just not the same, who knows what people would think if they saw me like that\" he replies, gesturing at Mallow. \"Hmmph, well I think you look better than ever\" she replies, sticking out her tongue. Rolling his eyes, Ash sits down on his slightly plumper butt and starts tinkering with the remote. \"If it weren't so embarrassing I might have asked Sophocles for help... I suppose there are worse people to be stuck as, Mallow is pretty cute\" Ash thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what to do about the remote, the pair decide that their only option is to test out the remote to get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when they try out the remote?</span></div></div>",

Oh, great\" Ash thinks to himself as he looks clears his eyes and looks down, seeing that his regular outfit has been replaced by Mallows tight grey overalls, her sleeveless red top, green shoes and, although he can't see them, he can feel that he is wearing her panties and bra. \"Oh man... Well, I've worn worse, though it's a first for the bra and panties, they don't feel too bad I suppose\" he thinks to himself. Glancing over at Mallow, he sees her having the same reaction, rolling her eyes briefly as she focuses on the remote again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, this is getting worse. We either talk to Sophocles, or we keep going and things get worse before they get better\" Mallow says, a bulge still slightly visible in her new shorts. \"I know I know, but can you imagine how embarrassing it would be if the others found out? And what if Sophocles can't help? I think we're better off trying this ourselves\" Ash argues, not wanting to involve others in their issues. \"And besides, if we can figure out what all of these buttons do, can you imagine the fun we could have with this? We could switch all of our friends bodies!\" He says, with a grin on Mallow's cute face. Grinning slightly, Mallow can't help but agree. \"Alright that could be fun, but can we at least go to somewhere more private in case anything weird happens? My house should be empty right now\" she offers, to which Ash agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair make their way back to town, with Ash constantly adjusting his outfit as they go. \"Mallow seriously, how do you walk around in this thing? These overalls are so short and tight, it feels like my ass is about to pop out\" he says, pulling the back of his shorts up. \"Excuse me Ash, but I happen to love those overalls, and if you so much as think about flashing anyone while you're in my body I don't know what I'll do! And don't even think about feeling my body up again either!\" She says as she slaps Ash's hands away from her ass, adjusting the shorts herself. \"Alright geez I'm sorry, I've never worn overalls before\" Ash mutters to himself. During the walk, he can't help but enjoy the breeze on his bare skin, as well as the jiggle of his breasts and ass with each step he takes. \"Well, I may not be able to touch anything, but I can enjoy this body.\" He thinks to himself with a slight smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair make their way through town, dodging any familiar faces to avoid any embarrassing situations that may arise, eventually arriving at Mallows house. Making their way inside and up to Mallows room, they find one or two changes. In particular, every picture of Mallow has been replaced with pictures of Ash, and every outfit in Mallows wardrobe has been replaced by one of Ash's. \"So do you think reality changed or something?\" Ash asks, looking around the room at the various minor changes. \"Maybe? It could be that we still have our own lives, only with each others bodies...\" Mallow reasons. \"This remote is amazing, we have to keep playing with it\" she mutters to herself as she picks up the remote to examine it. \"I'm just going to run to the toilet\" Ash says, getting up and leaving the room while she's distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the bathroom, Ash can't help but grin to himself as he locks the door behind him. He gently slips the straps of his overalls off of his shoulders, shimmying the tight shorts down his legs, leaving him in nothing but a green pair of silk panties and Mallows tight red top. \"Hot damn...\" Ash think to himself as he turns to check out his tight new ass. Pulling his panties around his ankles, he takes a seat on the toilet and lets nature take its course. Cleaning himself up, he can't help but get slightly curious about his body. \"I wonder... If I were to just-\" but he was cutoff by a banging on the door. \"ASH KETCHUM GET OUT HERE RIGHT NOW\" He hears coming from his own voice, as Mallow realized that he had left. Cursing slightly under his breath, he flushes the toilet and redresses himself in Mallows overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, he finds a furious looking Mallow who drags him back to her room. \"Ow ow ow Mallow okay ow I didn't do anything I just needed to use the toilet\" Ash exclaims, rubbing his arm where she had grabbed him. \"I swear Ash that if you did anything I will never forgive you! Now sit down, we're testing this thing out right now\" she says, forcing Ash to sit across from him as he readjusts the straps of his overalls. \"Look Mallow, I know we were going to test it out, but what if something goes wrong? Maybe we would be better-\" Ash begins but is cutoff by Mallow. \"Oh no no no, don't start now, I'm not trusting you with my body any longer than I have to anymore, this is happening now\" She says as she grabs Ash's hand, reaches over and pushes a button.</span></div></div>",

After clearing his eyes, he glances over his body, though finds himself still in the body and outfit of Mallow. Looking to his side, he sees a rather peculiar sight. Sitting atop his own body, is Mallows head! Pushing himself off of the ground, he runs over to Mallows mirror only to see his own masculine head atop Mallows slender body. \"Well this is certainly different\" He mutters to himself, though it comes out in Mallows melodic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to sit back down, he finds that Mallow is once again studying the remote. \"Ash this thing is incredible! Look at how messed up we both are! And I bet that nobody would even notice\" Mallow exclaims, clearly quite giddy about the situation. \"That's great Mallow but can we... Fix this?\" Ash says gesturing to his own head. \"Swapping bodies is fun and all, but we look like freaks\"  Grinning slightly, Mallow picks up the remote and rapidly fires the remote at Ash a few times. \"Of course Ash, whatever you say\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinded once more by the light, Ash clears his vision, slightly annoyed though he can't help but giggle a bit. Looking over Mallow again, he nearly bursts out laughing. His once masculine body is now adorned with a number of Mallows limbs, including both of her arms, her left leg and her left hand. Along with this, his own hair is sitting atop Mallows feminine head, and there was a clear lack of a bulge within his shorts. \"Alright alright we can keep messing around with the remote, just swap back our genitals, I'm spilling out of your panties here\" Ash says as he readjusts himself, laughing as he does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, after what you pulled in the bathroom earlier there's no way I'm swapping that back\" Mallow replies, bouncing her breasts in her hands slightly \"And besides, I don't know how you control that thing, I was constantly getting hard\" she giggles, seeing the bulge in Ash's overalls growing substantially. \"Yeah well I'm not faring much better\" Ash mutters, trying to readjust himself with a slight blush on his face. \"At least fix the rest of our bodies\" he says. Agreeing, Mallow goes through the process of swapping their bodies back to \"normal\", though she refuses to swap back their groins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ash, we don't have too many buttons left to press\" Mallow says, looking over the remaining buttons. \"One of them will switch our bodies, we know that much.\" Ash chimes in \"What else could happen though\" he wonders, still feeling slightly uncomfortable in the groin. \"Well there's only one way to find out\" Mallow says, taking Ash's hand once more as they press another button.</span></div></div>",
