I hope you will enjoy reading this</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is now cursed. Not long ago, as Emily was still enjoying her day of school, things changed. Dark cloud suddenly appeared in the sky, as if a storm is coming. The cloud becomes thicker and thicker, eventually the whole city is covered in darkness. To Emily, as the beginning, this was just a storm coming, even though it is oddly too fast. However, such change is happening all over the world at the same time. As the earth is being enshrouded by darkness, the clouds gets lower and lower. Within a few minutes, the dark clouds are over the top of the school buildings. Shortly, the whole school is enclosed by the clouds. Actually, the whole world is enclosed by the clouds. Just as Emily and her whole class are being nervous and trying to seek help from the teacher, the teacher disappears as if he has never appeared. Next, the boys in her class disappeared just the way the teacher did. As all the males and girls over the age of 28 has been gone - around 5 minutes after the clouds cover everything - the clouds become thinner. A couple of minutes later, all the clouds are gone. But same time, all the teachers and boys are no more in the school either. Emily, like other girl, shouts out her boyfriend's name, \"Dave, Dave! Where are you!? C'mon Dave!\" But no response seems to appear. As she is worried, she looked around and suddenly found out that words are appearing on the screen:<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Girls, beauty, immortality, fairness, all what you want is coming! Appreciate this! I eliminated all what I do not like; now, it is time to build up our world; it is time to build up my playground, my park of ticklishness! From now on, nature will tickle you, especially your little feet. Be careful with that, Ha--Ha--Ha! No, \"Ha--Ha--Ha\" is probably what you will say soon. Enjoy your eternity here! My name? Call me Claire the powerful witch!</font> <br>\r\nThen nothing more is displayed. But just as Emily finishes reading the words, she feels a slight tickle on the instep of her feet. As it is nearly the end of the spring semester, summer is coming. Emily is wearing her favorite flip-flops to school. She looks at her feet, but seeing nothing that is touching her feet. Also, since the sense of tickling is so slight that it does not affect her much. With the teacher in school no more, staying in the classroom is not necessary anymore. Emily decided to go out of the campus and see what Claire the witch meant by \"eliminating all what she did not like\". As she starts to walk; as her sole is no more tightly touching the sole of her flip-flop, a sense of tickling struck Emily's sole. The sudden tickle almost made Emily fall. \"If my guesses are true......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Ten Years Later</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is messed up, because of Claire's curse.  Only a few millions of people are still in the world. At the beginning of the ten years, young girls have not found out that there is a penalty for exposing their feet to the nature for too long. Until one day, a girl went camping with a few friends in a mountain lost her flip-flops during the trip uphill. She, at the beginning thought that it was fine not to have shoes on for some time. However, she senses a stronger and stronger tickle all over her feet since the moment she lost her shoes. Her friends did not take the girl's speech about the tickling feeling seriously, but regarded as \"crazy\", \"non-sense\". However, two days later, the girl who lost her shoes could not bear the tickling anymore that she laughed crazily, itching her feet to weaken the sense of tickling. Her friend finally decided to take care of her and sent her to a hospital nearby. However, on their way to the hospital, the girl starts to turn into an illusion, or in another word, an illusory image. Even right by the girl, her laughing sounds like from a place far away. Slowly, the laughing of her goes \"farther and farther\" and eventually faded away. But as the girl disappears, an image is sent to the girls nearby, an image that she is in a forest, with her arms and legs are chained to trees, her feet are bare, having only lingerie on, with floating feather all around her, tickling her. Occasionally, little fairies come and tickle her with their tiny fingers. Sometimes, even the grass and branches of the tree strokes her body and feet. Grass ties onto her toes so that her feet cannot move around to avoid the tickling. The girl was in great happiness but same time in pain. She is laughing but she would rather not to laugh. The image shocks the girls that were with the disappeared girl. They reported that to the hospital they were going to, and the hospital reported that to the temporary local government set up by young girls. At first, no one believed in these girls, but later on, as more cases similar to the first one was reported, the gov. decided to take it seriously. Two years later, as more girls realize that exposing their feet to the air will end up being very pathetic, a mess started. Since the industry was all  discarded after the \"Witch Claire affair\", clothes, shoes, and a lot of the normal goods becomes consumable goods and luxury. Fear among the girls make them robbing shoes off others' feet, and keep their feet covered securely in sneakers or boots. Distrust bursts out among the girls. Soon, flip-flops become very rare to the girls, as they are very unsecured and it is cannot fully stop the ticklishness from the air. Later on, flip-flops becomes a sign of power and wealth, as the girls with power and wealth do not truly afraid of getting their shoes robbed. Nowadays, people are more settled down and accept the reality that they are meant to be tickled. However, Emily and a few of her friends are still seeking a way to escape the madness. Finally, on the ten year anniversary of the \"Witch Claire Affair\", another sentence formed by clouds appeared, saying:<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"All girls who oppose me, wanting to escape from you fate, come and defeat me, with my way - tickling!\"</font><br>\r\nFrom that day, Emily and her friends went on the way of escaping their fate.<br>\r\nHowever, at the same time, with no one knowing, creatures meant only for tickling are created....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom whose perspective do you want to keep on the story?</span></div></div>",

Obviously, Emily lives a fairly good life even in this cursed world. In such a world that footwear is just so precious that it is the most expensive thing on the market. Still, Emily gets to keep a few pairs of sock, which can be interpreted as wealthy and unbelievable. Emily got herself some cereal as breakfast, and then started her plan about defeating the witch. She looked around, searching for a backpack or suitcase that is just the right size so that it is easy to carry but still but enough to contain all what her friends and she need. She had some food, water, a pair of long boots and a pair of flip-flops and a few pair of sock put in the backpack. To Emily, everything is ready; the only thing that still remains unknown how to find the witch. She had talked to her friend Eliza, Cathy and Chloe, and all three girls have hated the curse enough that they are willing to risk their ticklish body on this dangerous mission. Although she had no clue where exactly the witch is, depending on her sixth sense, Emil guesses that the witch should be somewhere near New York city. As living in New Jersey, close enough to New York, Emily suggests that she should probably drive to New York with her friends. After calling each of the three girls, a decision is made: All four of them will gather in a park near Emily's house, then come to Emily's home to take the car, so that they are able to drive to New York.<br>\r\nHowever, as Emily went out from the front door of her house, she senses something unusual. Girls on the street are running around, trying to keep away from some red things. After having a close look, it turns out to be.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Emily went by all the people who tried to run away and finally had a chance to look closely on the object, she noticed that the red object is a slime. To be honest, this slime looks somewhat cute. It is small, just the same size as a basketball, shaking slightly like a giant piece of jello. However, apparently, the slime is terrifying to all the girls around. About five feet away from the slime, a girl is so terrified that she is sitting on the ground, shifting away from the slime. Being confused, Emily determines to have a peek on this red little cutie thing. And she carefully moves to roughly a foot away from the slime, the slime suddenly moves the front half of its body, extending it rapidly to get Emily's left foot. Emily was stunned by the move of the \"cutie\" slime. When she tries to react, it is just too late. The slime has extended enough of its body to cover the instep of Emily's left boot. Emily tries kicking her left foot to get the slime away, but she failed miserably. As she found kicking a waste of time, she turns her head back and looks at the slime, thinking that she may find a way to get the slime off her boot. By now, the slime has extended its body so much that it covers Emily's whole left foot, but same time, its so extended that it becomes a lot more transparent than before. Looking at what is inside the slime, Emily finds two things interesting - a nike sneaker and two hand-looking items. Since the slime has a scarlet color and its body is very much stretched, it is quite hard for Emily to figure out what the hand-looking things are. However, that is not too good of a time to do research on what is inside the slime, for the slime's stretched body has climbed to nearly the top of Emily's left boot. Emily is not sure what the slime wants to do, but she is nervous - who knows what may happen in this messed-up world. But life just happen give special care to Emily all the time. An accidental glace and the girl that is shifting away from the slime gave her a idea what the slime want to do. It is her boot! The glace at the girl's feet gave Emily one clue - the girl has only a pink ankle sock on, but on the other foot she has a nike sneaker just like what is inside the slime. The slime is clearly not very strong to rip apart or disolve her boot, but it can totally go to the zipper and zip off her boot. Emily panics, for finding the clue about what the slime is going to do does not help her with solving her problem. Contrarily, Emily  is so afraid of getting her boot off, show her cute little foot and get tickled that she cannot think calmly anymore. At this very moment, she did something insane, something that a normal person would never do - I am saying that sometimes terror is very powerful, and it can lead to positive result. Emily bents down, putting both of her hands into the body of the slime. Suddenly a great tickling on her arms and hands strikes her. It was so strong that even in a dangerous situation like this, the corners of Emily's mouth rises up - she barely stops herself from bursting into laughter. Her hands get deeper into the slime, and eventually she successfully touches the hand-looking thing inside the slime. Oddly, the slime trembles; its whole body suddenly leaves Emily's left boot and tries to get away from those hands. Right before this moment, the slime has already reached the zipper and it is half way down the boot. With all such happening in just a few seconds, everyone is stunned and confused. Same as Emily. Without realizing what is truly going on, she grabbed the hand-looking items and pulled them out. A loud screaming sound comes out from the slime; the next moment, the slime melts into a tiny pool of scarlet water.<br>\r\nIt is not until one minute later before Emily awake from her madness. The girl on the ground has been gone, so has the nike sneaker that was in the slime. Shaking her head, Emily decides to just forget what happened. But the things on her hands tell her that what happened just now were totally real.<br>\r\nLooking at the items on her hand, she realizes that they are....</span></div></div>",

They were large and bulbous, almost like catcher plants, with large flower like middles, and  lashing out at the running girls with long, feathering looking vines and it seemed the instant a girl was caught, she was wrapped up and instantly sent into a fit of laughter and giggles, as if just being touched by the vines was ticklish! She than watched a  recently captured girl, who was flaling like crazy at the ticlking, was stripped nude and slowly dragged towards one large bublous flowers, and Emily swore she saw a tounge come out of the plant and lick it's \"lips\" as the girl drew near.

They want to \"eat Us\" so they can send us to tickle hell! Once they get you there's no escape... So many girls have been swallowed whole already!\" She pointed to the stem of the plant that had just swallowed a girl and Emily noted it was still wiggling as if the girl was being tickled on her whole way down into the ground, where no doubt a digestion pod awaited her.... but knowing this world, Emily imagined it as more of a tickling pod than digestion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at the girl she was running with. \"What happens if they swallow you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't hear the announcement?

She was confused by the paper, how could red paper cause such a panic to everyone. Emily caught one of the papers in her hand and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Why Do You Fight The Ticklish Pleasures of Life? Why Do You Live To Avoid The Gift I've Placed In The Air? Why Not Take Off Your Footwear &amp; Accept? Why? Why? Why? But Enough Of That, Ten Years.... It's Close To Our Anniversary, Why Not Celebrate Together? In A Weeks Time, It Will Have Been Ten Complete Years... So Join In The Festivities, There Will Be A Party, All Are Welcome, Please Stop By For A Drink, &amp; Have A Laugh.... Hahaha.... I Know You Want To Be There, Emily....                  ~Claire, The Powerful Witch</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was startled on how here name magically appeared, she looked at her boots, that covered her feet. Emily thought to herself to stick to the plan, New York was still the destination. As she finished clearing her thoughts, a tingling feeling covered her hand that held the red letter. Her serious complexion, turned into a grin, and a smile washed over her face. Emily quickly figured, it was the letter making her laugh, she tried to throw it, but her hand only clenched it. That caused the tickling sensation to increase. Her own hand was betraying her, the papers could be seen flying towards the girls in fast speeds. Then a sudden realization hit her, the red papers were somehow alive and trying to find a victim to tickle. Emily giggled at the hilarious feeling, and tried shaking the paper off, but while she attempted to rid herself of the ticklish burden, other red papers had seen her and flew at her hoping to hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured to get back inside and wait for the red paper storm to pass, she dodged the red papers, as they zipped by, nearly missing her. She opened the door in a panic, and shut it quickly, the sound of papers hitting the door could be heard. After that, she focused her attention on the red invite attracted to her hand, but noticed it was gone. The paper must of released her hand in the midst of the panic, but soon she knew it was hiding, and she looked cautiously around for any red sticking out. Emily knew this paper was going to hide well, until it saw an opening to get her. So with that, Emily needed bait, and she took a crazy risk. She slipped off her right boot, along with her sock. The cold air invaded her warm bare foot, she shivered at the sudden freezing in the house. Emily's home was equipped with a special filter that kept the contaminated air outside, that's why Emily only was barefoot in her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily waited for the red paper, she leaned against the door with her foot out in the opening, ready to be tickled. She wiggled her toes and waited... just then a familiar sound of paper in the house is heard, causing her to become alert. Suddenly, the red paper floats across from her, the paper sat on the other side of the room. Emily smiled, knowing her crazy plan was working, now to catch it. She put on a pair of gloves that she kept in her possession, and stared at the red paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, my poor helpless, ticklish, bare foot is out in the open... What will I ever do? I hope nothing tickles my foot.\" Emily said, while she pretended to be a damsel in distress, \"Look at those toes... I hope nothing tickles them...\" She implied, and she wiggled her toes, she giggled at herself for doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red paper shot at her, and Emily moved her foot out of the way as the paper overshot it into Emily's gloved hands. Emily raced to the kitchen sink, and shoved it in the garbage disposal, grinding the red paper into a million pieces. Emily sighed, and placed her boot and sock back on. She walked to her room to lay down, and wait for the red paper storm to end.</span></div></div>",

As Emily got ready for her nap though, she happened to look outside one of her windows an witness a terrible fate. Outside, in the raging storm, there was one poor girl who had the misfortune of not being able to find shelter. Her long and thin arms were covered in the red papers, causing the girl to cackle like mad as they sent ticklish impulses into her. It was not long before she collapsed on the ground, overwhelmed by the ticklish sensations. It was then that her own arms betrayed her; the papers took control of her arms, forcing them to reach down to her boots and slowly begin untying them. Emily could hear the brunette girl cry out for mercy and help as her own hands removed the laces from her boots and then the final shield that were he thick socks from her feet. Her hands then were able to do one last thing, namely tie her very own big toes together with her shoelaces before a hoard of the red papers decended on her bare and hyper-ticklish feet. Emily's own feet almost felt the ticklish sensations themselves just watching the poor girl explode into hysterics as the papers mercilessly tickled her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really gave Emily a terrible fright was how that within minutes of the girl's feet being bombarded with the red papers, she started to fade away! It would seem that the \"invitations\" were quite literal: those red papers vastly accelerated the rate at which a girl would be summoned away to whatever hell the girls are sent to. As that poor girl dematerialized, Emily saw a vision of her tied to a revolving wheel, completely naked, with what looked to be like the shoelaces from her boots used to tie every part of her to the wheel. Every arm, leg, finger and toe was tied and impossible to move, and the girl cried out with horrible laughter as millions of red feathers brushed against every part of her body. And then, just as the vision had come, it had faded, and the girl was gone from this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shirvered, deeply sorry for the girl, but took solace in the fact that she could have done nothing to help. To Emily, it only proved that this madness had to stop, at any cost. With that, Emily removed most of her own clothes and settled on her bed to nap through the remaining storm.

Emily yawned, looking around tiredly, and looking at her clock revealing the afternoon nearly passed. Emily sighed, as she looked at her self, with only a bra, and panties. Emily wasn\u2019t one to always to take her socks off, but only when she felt completely safe, she always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily rose out of bed, noticing the house stood still while hearing the rage of the storm claim the outside, as she peeked through her curtains to see red papers still flying and passing by. She gave another sigh of annoyance as this pesky storm interrupted her plans, but also couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the invite she had received earlier that day. She walked to the kitchen almost naked, hearing the sound of her own bare feet against the floor with a slapping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily went to the kitchen to see the sink, where she had shredded the invite, but what she saw only shocked, and startled her. The invite had somehow repaired itself, and Emily jumped back, preparing for the paper to attack, but it only stayed still. Emily eyed it with suspicion, then she approached it with paranoia expecting the paper to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon getting close to the paper, she examined it. Revealing that the red invite had changed its lettering, even changed from an invite to a letter. Emily touched the paper, noticing it must\u2019ve died, or something, as it was an ordinary piece of paper now. She picked it up, reading it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Emily\u2026..\u201d She said with a worried tone. \u201cI\u2019m a friend who\u2019s going to help you defeat, Claire, the witch.\u201d The letter wasn\u2019t a threat, but a letter of assistance to help her. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right, help you, not harm you in any way, in fact I\u2019ve watched you from afar, and you seem like the only one, along with your friends who wants to save this world, and rid it of the ticklish hell Claire has created.\u201d Emily felt relieved to see help, but was concerned for if this was real or fake, but nevertheless she had to find this mysterious help. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me at the moment, but soon we shall meet, and I will teach you things, bringing you closer to defeating the dreaded witch, I will send you another message when it\u2019s time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily finished reading the letter looking around her home feeling strange, but finding nothing. She didn\u2019t know what to make of the letter, only that it was a letter of help. Emily walked to her room, and got dressed slipping her socks, boots, and winter clothing feeling the cold air enter the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down in the living room, but heard banging on the window of her home, then heard a scream of laughter. Quickly she sprang up, running to the window, seeing a girl fighting a couple of red invites. She seemed to holding off quite well, until more were jumping in, and taking the poor girl by surprise. Emily witnessed earlier a girl being taken by the ticklish invites, but soon her conscious debated to help or leave her on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahaheeeelllpppphahaha!!!\u201d The girl screamed, while laughing in hysterics, as the invites attacked her relentlessly sending the ticklish impulses into her with great accuracy. The invites stuck to the girl, but with a fast motion, and quick reflexes this girl pushed them off with swiftness. She somehow lost her footwear, having being barefoot, but she managed to keep them off her feet, but for how long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily paced back and forth looking at the poor barefooted girl doing her best to keep from falling into tickle hell, forever to be tickled.

But only by guys. It used to make her so horny when a guy would over power her and tickle her raw. But when the witch took over... there were no more guys to tickle her and it became less of a turn on and more of an ordeal. She didn't want to be banished to some tickle hell, never to see a hot guy ever again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe missed those days, but more than anything else she missed the hunky guys she used to date. So it was no surprise that when she heard her friend Emily was starting a resistance that Chloe was one of the first to sign up. The constant tickling in this world was making her so uncontrollably horny that she needed to get it stopped. Other wise she might explode...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was preparing for their journey when she heard a knock on her door. \"That must be Emily.\" She thought as she went to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she opened it, she got a full blast of some weird pink mist. Coughing and falling to her knees she started giggling and laughing. She fell to the ground writhing on the floor as her whole body was tickled from head to toe, despite being fully clothed. Soon she passed out and everything went black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later she woke up, feeling very groggy and looked around... Somehow she'd been transported to what looked like a locked room in a dungeon! She looked at her self and found that she was wearing only a pink bikini and all her super ticklish spots were exposed. She started to freak out... was this tickle hell? Would any minute that door in front of her open and she be dragged off to an eternity of tickling... the thought both terrified her and aroused her... But she shook the arousal thoughts off to try and figure a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Chloe.\" A voice said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...Who's there... Please let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in due time my dear, all in due time... You and I are going to play a game, Chloe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.... What kind of game?\" the scared brunette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've watched you and your friends for a long time Chloe...And I simply must have you all in my collection of writhing ticklish cuties. I want my fingers on your belly and feet BAD.\" Chloe instantly recognized the voice of the Witch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never! We will never submit to you you sicko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall see... What is it you desire most? Ah yes... To be tickled by a hot guy!\" the witch laughed and than gagged. \"Men are disgusting... Why want one of them to tickle you when you could have a goddess dance her fingers along your tender belly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe said nothing and merely blushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, the game. Behind that door is a maze. It a few seconds it will open and the game will begin. Your task is simple... Make it to the end of the maze in 24 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the catch?\" Chloe asked, knowing it can't be that simple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The maze, my dear, is filled with ticklish traps meant to catch you and ensare you... Might be a hot guy or two in there,I'm not telling. But! Should you submit to one of the traps and be tickled for more than 2 hours. You are mine forever!you will be banished to my private collection in tickle hell and will be mine to play with for all eternity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I win?\" Chloe asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win, that I will let you and one friend of your choice leave... Not just the maze or whatever, but Leave my world. You will be sent where I sent all the men, free of the 'torment' for the rest of your misarble lives... It'd be such a shame though, to send such a hottie like you off to guys...\" The withc sighed. \"So...Shall we begin?\"</span></div></div>",

Her feet were well taken care of for a witch.

Her hair was messy, and her clothes seemed a bit messy, her boots were also covered in mud. \"Magistra, please forgive me.... I didn't.... mean to be late...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, assistant... you're late by twenty minutes, what were you up to?\" She crossed her arms, and changed her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uhhh.... kind of lost your....\" She hesitated, and stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out with it!!!\" Claire demanded, with great impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I misplaced your beginners spell book.... so I was looking for it.... and when I checked the time.... it was time to....\" She stopped talking, as soon as she saw an infuriating fire in her magistra's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove your boots, and socks now!\" She calmly said to her assistant with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magistra.... please no....\" She begged the witch, but only was given a glare that warned her to do it. In a quick haste she removed all her footwear, and was now barefoot just like her magistra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go to the stocks, and receive your punishment. Five hours of constant tickling, no rest. While you are laughing, think about how you're going to find my book. Now go!!\" Claire ordered and sentenced her assistants punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.... magistra.\" She sadly said, disappointing her magistra made her feel horrible. She walked to the room, known as the punishment room, with a pair of stocks in the center. The room was very magical, once a pair of bare feet were set in the room, and in stocks. It would magically close and lock, then items would take turns tickling the victims feet. She entered the room, knowing what was going to happen. She placed her feet in the stocks, and quickly they closed and locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your worst!!\" She yelled, but now her feet were at the mercy of the room. She saw string quickly tie around her toes pulling them back against the board. Once that was done, she saw a feather glide to her feet. \"One feather, I thought this room was scarier.\" She smiled, but then a swarm of feathers barraged her feet, engulfing her soles and attacking in between her toes, she broke into hysterical laughter, shaking her head, and attempting to move her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun....\" Claire said, while she giggled, and closed the door to the punishment room. Once the door closed, she heard the laughter of her assistant, and gave a small chuckle. \"All in a day's work of tickling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire walked to her room, and jumped on the bed. She laid there thinking of what to do. </span></div></div>",

Have I slept that long?\" Claire questioned in a tired voice, giving a yawn, while she sat up facing her assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I finished nearly an hour ago, but I found your beginners book. And you've been asleep for about six hours... but hey! I still found your book!!!\" She waved it in front of the witch, giving a smile, she was happy to find the book before her magistra awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, assistant... Now we must find a victim for you to practice on. Now go, and do this and report what you have learned.\" Claire ordered looking at her assistant who was still barefooted. As her assistant turned and left, she saw her soles were red from the five hours of constant tickling, Claire only grinned, the punishment was a nightmare for bare feet that were sensitive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked at her toes, curling them, and remembering her first time experiencing the ticklish sensations, her body shivered at the thought. She knew the feeling of soles being exposed, and helpless, the feeling of fingers teasing the sensitive heels to the very tip of the toes. A playground in which your feet were right for the tickling, no rules, no mercy. That's how she remembered it, and Claire knew the feeling all too well. She then snapped out of the memories of the past, and looked up at the clock. It was an hour after noon, Claire felt the need to do some tickling of her own, while her assistant did some as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Let's see I'm not sure what I want to do, but I wonder how my assistant is going to do? Well time will tell, she's still a beginner. In the mean time, what will I do?'</i> Claire thought, sitting on top of the bed, while tapping her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can either stick with Claire's Perspective, or Follow The Assistant's Perspective, or Your Choice. </span></div></div>",

The assistant understood, that her feet needed to be protected, and she kept a pair of black jeans on, along with a shirt, that was covered by her signature dark grey sweater. The only uncovered parts of her body were her hands, and face, but that's all she would allow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked and looked in the neighborhood, searching for a victim to practice on, her search lasted half of an hour. When she spotted a girl, who was completely covered, even her face was covered from the air. The unknown girl was sitting on a flight of stairs that was in front of a house. The mysterious girl had seen the assistant, and waved her covered arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant out of instinct, waved back. For an assistant of the witch, she was quite bubbly and kind, that many wouldn't consider her to take the witch's side. The assistant walked over to her, with a happy go lucky attitude. She approached the covered girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, I know that I'm a stranger, but can I go into your house to warm up, I'm freezing.\" The assistant asked, making it up as she went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is quite cold, isn't it?\" The mysterious girl said, with a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is cold, but why are you out here, when it's warm inside?\" The assistant's curiosity peeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, before that damned witch plagued us, I was happily living with my husband, and daughter. My life was absolutely perfect.... Then it happened, my husband and daughter went to the back to swim, while I decided to stay inside, and watch a little T.V.\" She stopped, and took a deep breath. The assistant was interested, and decided to listen. \"While I was sitting there, I heard laughing, and joy from outside. They were having a blast, ten minutes later, I heard a scream, then followed by laughter. At the time, I thought nothing of it, and when I looked out there, I saw my daughter laying on the floor in hysterics. While my husband was nowhere to be found.\" She stopped again, giving a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to your daughter?\" She asked with sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She yelled at me that something was tickling her feet, which was strange. When I stepped out there, I felt tingling in my feet, and I couldn't stop smiling. The feeling was intense, I looked down at my bare feet, wondering what was going on. My daughter then suddenly disappeared in front of me, as I just heard the echo of her laugh. So now I sit out here, and wish to go back to the days, when I could feel the grass between my toes. I still wish....\" She looked down at the wet grass, most of it was dead, but her memory of seeing green was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, to hear about that....\" She felt sorry for her loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, that was ten years ago. Oh! Sorry, you're cold, please step inside. A guest hasn't visited me in a quite awhile.\" The covered woman stood up, and continued inside, motioning her to come inside.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The place was roomy for more than one person, as she was led into the living room, she sat on the couch. The clothed woman slipped off one of her many jackets, and set the fireplace, bringing more warmth to the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a nice place.\" The assistant complimented and slipped off her jacket as well from the warmth. She saw the mysterious woman take off another sweater, and finally revealed her face, arms and hands. She only had a shirt, along with a scarf as she unwrapped, revealing her whole face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better, now we can properly meet, I'm Christie.\" She walked towards the assistant lifting her hand for a proper shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me assistant, please don't ask.\" She said sounding a little suspicious, while reaching her hand towards christie's bare hand, and shook, then pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie raised a brow, but didn't want to pest her about her name. As she stood there, and smiled. \"So, you want hot chocolate, or tea?\" Christie asked straight forward to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... oh, I'll take tea, please.\" The assistant said confused about her quick response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just give me a quick minute.\" She said, and disappeared into the kitchen, and hearing the sound of silverware, and glass. While christie prepared the drinks, she spoke to the assistant wanting to continue their talk. \"What brings you here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard christie's voice from the kitchen, and also heard clinks of glass. \"I'm passing through, just looking for something that I'm not sure of.\" She said, thinking of her true task, but felt guilty upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... so you're like a traveler, I take it.\" Christie tried to guess, as she finished the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant nodded, and looked at the fire. \"Yeah, something close to those areas, but yeah...\" She didn't want to talk about it, even she seemed lost, and confused. Her real name was many things, but she never told anyone for some apparent reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026. so you\u2019re traveling looking for something, and your name\u2019s assistant?\u201d Christie replied back, while walking into the living room, carrying drinks, and handing her tea to the assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant only nodded and took a drink, the tea was warm the instant it touched her throat soothing her body from the coldness outside. \u201cYeah\u2026. I\u2019m a strange one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie sat in front of her giving a warm smile, and drank her tea as well. \u201cIndeed, but I don\u2019t judge, only that you do cause a bit of suspicion, if I say so myself.\u201d She informed her, taking another sip from the tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant thought of her observation, and wondered why she let her in then. \u201cIf I\u2019m a suspicious figure to you, why did you let me in?\u201d She took another drink of the tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained silent for a moment pondering on the question, and sat back in her seat giving a look of interest. \u201cBecause how else do I find out more about a person, if I don\u2019t let them warm up, or show my hospitality.\u201d She smiled more warmly after that response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant noticed her attitude change slightly to a more happy tone, she felt a bit tired as she gave a yawn, and looked at christie, returning a smile. Christie just crossed her legs, as she noticed the girl give off a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTired\u2026. feeling sleepy?\u201d Christie teased taking a sip, now acting more weird than before. Her smile stayed on her face, while she sat there, as if she was waiting for a signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant noticed this right away, as she looked at her more concerned than ever, as her body felt heavy. Her eyes began to droop, while she struggled to hold herself up. \u201cWhat\u2026.. did\u2026.yo\u2026\u201d She faintly said, as her body slumped over dropping the cup. Her body fell from the couch, onto the floor looking up, and seeing a blurry figure stand over her, realizing that this wasn\u2019t a good situation to be in, before closing her eyes, and falling asleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The warm fire is still going, as she hears the fire crackling. She looks around the room to see she\u2019s still in the living room, but is tied to the couch with her feet tied to the table. Her feet are bare, and out in the opening, she\u2019s also been gagged so she can\u2019t make a sound as she felt a moist sock in her mouth, and knowing it\u2019s hers. She shook in disgust, and tried spitting it out, only to be stopped by duct tape holding it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes of sitting there helpless, steps could be heard getting closer to her, and shaking in fear from what might happen. Christie entered the room with her same smile, humming a tune to herself. She held a small wooden box that fit in her hand, and sat in front of the assistant giggling at her helpless friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to see that you\u2019re awake.\u201d Christie happily said, while placing the box down on the table. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me taking your clothes off, and making you comfortable, but those clothes looked unbearable on you, even your shoes, so I took them off too, leaving your bare feet to rest on the table, and might I say, you have very cute feet, especially those toes.\u201d Christie stated while rubbing the assistants toes in a smooth motion, causing the assistant to enjoy the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant attempted to speak, but all that could be heard was muffled sounds, and the occasional loud sound. The assistant tried moving, but nothing worked, even her feet were bound to the table by strong rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk, tsk\u2026. don\u2019t do that, not if you want to be tortured.\u201d She said giving a sly grin, as the assistant halted, knowing full well what she meant. \u201cGood, now I\u2019m going to ask you questions, but you have to answer them honestly, or else\u2026.\u201d She paused giving a dramatic effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant knew to cooperate, so she nodded her head in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask yes or no questions, and we\u2019ll go from there. Here we go.\u201d She sat back against the couch, giving a look of determination. \u201cAre you really passing through, or no that was a lie? Yes means you are, no means you\u2019re a liar.\u201d She asked, watching closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant hesitated for a bit, but decided to lie to her, and nodded yes, but quickly saw Christie jump to her feet and lightly scratched her soles, her toes curled twitching to the itching fingers playing on her soft soles, causing her to cackle and try to kick as her feet were only teased, not experiencing actual tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie, I know a lie, when I see it.\u201d Christie stopped scratching her fingers lightly on the assistants feet and sat back thinking of more questions. \u201cOkay, is your name really assistant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant was caught it was and wasn\u2019t, but for the most part it was. So she nodded, and Christie slowly stretched her hands over to her feet, inching forward teasing her, as they hovered over the air. The assistant shook her up and down furiously speaking the truth about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie noticed her face, and saw that her look meant it was the truth, she sat back and smiled. \u201cNow then, have you seen this box before?\u201d Christie lifted the small box, and smiled kissing the wooden box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed it, and tilted her head at the strange item, she shook her head no at Christie, and her heart began to race, fearing it. Wondering that questioning time was already over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie smiled deviously, and placed the wooden box in front of her bare feet. \u201cWell, you\u2019re in for a treat, this box contains a creature that loves to tickle exposed areas, and as you\u2019ve noticed you\u2019re almost naked.\u201d Christie paused looking at the box, and her seeing the connection of what the assistant had exposed which was almost everything. \u201cI figured you\u2019d be a perfect candidate for this box, but I think we\u2019re both about to learn what\u2019s inside, good luck, assistant.\u201d Christie pulled on the latch and stepped back, as the box\u2019s lid started to crack open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant stared in fear, her bare sensitive feet were in front of the box, that could contain anything that could easily get her. She tried pulling on her bonds, but only failed seeing the lid trying to push itself open. </span></div></div>",

It is okay to conclude that these girls are cursed, as they are all limited by the curse. They are cursed to be ticklish; they are cursed to be cute; they are cursed to stay young and immortal. It does not sound like they are cursed but blessed; however, to these girls, the curse is the most cruel thing in the world. Under the curse, the girls are ticklish everywhere, especially feet. Same time, the air is cursed to tickle their feet once exposed. Besides, if the girls expose their bare feet in the air for over 72 hours, they will be damned to the \"tickle hell\", in which they are restrained and tickled for all the life. Since they are immortal, the tickle hell is a lot worth than death. The curse also states that pain is no more, on the other hand, pain is replaced by tickle. Different creatures appear because of the curse, and all of them are born only for tickling the girls.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>What will the girls do about it?
