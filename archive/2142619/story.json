Even heading into his penultimate year of magic studies at the famed Citadel Prepatory Academy for Rites and Sorcery, he didn\u2019t stand out next to his fellow young mages. There were teen wizards that knew more spells, budding warlocks with more prestige, co-ed witches that would not regard him for too long. Phineas was a remarkably bright student, yet outshadowed by the most eminent magical geniuses of the age and his introspective tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventeen year old Phineas spent just too much time in his head. It came from being the middle child in a vast family of magicians to pour out of the famed school with illustrious careers. Big things had been expected of Phineas, attention he found stifling just as he was coming into his own at the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas loved puzzling out riddles. He had an analytic mind, obscure tastes, and tended to do well in the face of magical mysteries. He wasn\u2019t good with natural magic in practice, by the book he was a swell student. He was clumsy around horticulture and supernatural creatures. He coasted through academy life at the Citadel not having many plans for the future, true passions or potential of any measurable kind compared to his peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his looks were kind of awkward. Bowl haircuts, dark hair and eyes, little in the realm of muscle on his lean frame. He was a fastidious dresser but kept to a stringent uniform of tie and robes, lacking any style beyond that of a bookish nerd. Even his family\u2019s inclination towards a tall stock skipped Phineas\u2019 conception, as he was of average height and build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas didn\u2019t have many friends, acquaintances rather. His awkwardness extended to socializing as well, he constantly scrutinized each word he said in hopes of sounding different than he felt. Trying to sound clever or cool or tough when he was, in all honesty, kind of pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas would continue drifting through life as a face in the crowd, an unremarkable wizard, be forever marked as average were it not for one of his deepest secrets:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved fat women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas couldn\u2019t be sure just where his attraction had started. Roughly around the time he heard boys his age really talk about the kinds of girls they liked (or occasionally the other boys they liked, although that wasn\u2019t where Phineas\u2019 orientation lay) the young mage found that his ideals of beauty didn\u2019t mesh with the common consensus. Skinny, high arched features, a tight petite feminine form. Phineas\u2019s private fantasies drew to the curvy, the thick, the chubby, the chunky, the weighty, the huge, the obese, the massive\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, the larger the girl, the more Phineas started to get carried away. Citadel Prepatory Academy for Rites and Sorcery had its fair share of ample females. Magic carried with it an air of elitism and hubris, with some taking it too far with indulgences. Even if the feelings were mutual, Phineas feared he would never be able to express his desires towards the plus sized opposite sex without facing ridicule and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Phineas kept his love of the large and fat secret into the start of his penultimate year at Citadel Prepatory Academy for Rites &amp; Sorcery. Up until the moment he arrived at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsider it a change of destiny or happening of circumstance. Phineas was about to see his wildest hopes met in ways he never considered possible. Phineas was about to find the love of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPity they were all vying for his attention, what with all of these weighty females coming out of the proverbial woodwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where do we find Phineas Fortescue just as he finally catches a break with the large ladies?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Citadel Prepatory Academy for Rites &amp; Sorcery prided itself on its extensive magical education. A slew of courses covered every conceivable topic at the fortress, from uncovering the ancient secrets of magic, improving the known body of spells and potions, and delving into the ecosystems of pure fantasy. Courses were challenging and prone to the mishaps to grace a school as young witches and wizards got a handle on their magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Phineas Fortescue, it was a bittersweet time at the start of a new semester. On one hand, there were the thoughts of what might happen. What would be the newest topic to strike his curiosity? How would this class change his understanding of magic? And who would be in it, and would any of the girls have gained weight since last year...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas felt himself get distracted. That was a tad optimistic. While he generally had decent first days in new classes, it wouldn't be long for his difficult subjects to rear their ugly heads. Try as he might, Phineas was not good with the practical side of natural magic, as it extended to magical plants and animals. His reflexes in dueling were sub-par. Overall Phineas was far better with theory and book learning, especially the dry sorts of classes like ancient history, languages and such that deceptively appeared to be the least magical classes of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it wouldn't do making too many assumptions about the upcoming year before Phineas even attended his first class of the day, first day of the week. He quickened his pace through the old halls of the fortress, not wanting to be late. Phineas had rushed breakfast and barely managed to get his second-hand books and magical tools ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered his first class of the day, Phineas checked his schedule to remember what subject it was:</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A mixture of relief and stress would course through Phineas's mind as he realized that he was heading off into Alchemical Potioneering II. The class was based on Transmutations and Elixers, potions which in their nature allowed for the ability to transform people and animals into other things. In and of itself, the class was pretty easy as there was no danger in a elixer unless it is used up in someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill though, Phineas still felt a twinge of fear, not for the subject of the class, but more towards the teacher of the class, known to the students as one of the harshest teachers in the school. This teacher, named Delilah, was a rather harsh teacher, known for only giving students one chance for every assignment, as well as for testing potions on herself during her off-days. While he hasn't seen her in person yet, Phineas was still worried about actually meeting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the door, Phineas would open it up and take a seat, noticing that the teacher was currently gone. Sitting down, he would begin to notice some of the students within his class, smiling a bit as he saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first student to catch the apprentice's eyes was a rather shy and meek Inchling girl, sitting on her desk due to coming up only at a few inches tall, by the name of Mei. Inchlings were somewhat rare within the magical world, but Phineas had seen her around within the Kunok Quarters last year, struggling to fit in with other students and as such deciding to stay by herself. She had managed a bit of a perky and rounded ass, but with her minute size the mage mostly didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Mei would be a slacker of a student from the Meldelvian Dungeon, by the name of Teresa Mignon. Phineas barely knew anything about her, but he did know about her family, since they were pretty important in the magic scene. The Mignon family was very important in finding recipes for new potions and spells for the magic world for use in everyday life, and they sent their kids to the Citadel in order for them to learn. Teresa in particular had a pretty thin figure, but Phineas could imagine her putting on quite a bit of weight due to her attitude, lying at her desk and eating a bar of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Teresa though would be one last student that would catch Phineas's notcie, a druidess he recognized as May Tresfluer. The older sister by one year to her more popular sister Siv, she was the more intellectual sister, and as such had better grades than the hip-heavy younger druid. While she did not share her sister's hips, she did manage to have some heavy and rounded breasts however, which pushed against her leaf-woven sweater shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Phineas could think any more though, Delilah would walk in, tucking in her wings as she sat within her desk. Having tested with her potions all of her life, she had grown a few permanent traits from trying to perfect them, including a angel's wings and patches of scales going down her shoulders and arms. She even had a bit of height over most of the students, standing around 6 feet tall while most of the students, Phineas included, only stood around 5'6\" or less, though May seemed to be the sole exception, being about a inch taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her notes out, Delilah would point to the chalkboard, writing down her name. \"The name's Delilah Langtree, and this is Alchemical Potioneering II. In this class, we are learning about transmutations and elixirs, and we will not only be making them, but using them on animals too as a test! I expect only the best out of all of you, and if your left behind, don't expect me to help you back up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, open up to Chapter 1 of your textbooks, so we can learn about what Transmutations are in the first place, and once we are done with that we will have a live example in making a transmutation potion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phineas would think about the three woman who had caught Phineas's eyes fattening up, toning out Delilah's voice...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sour mixture of regret and fear shot through Phineas's spine as he suddenly remembered his first class of the semester: \"Extraplanar Studies: Contact, Vergence, &amp; Summoning\". Extraplanar Studies was a special subject; though technically a continuation of other interdimensional classes, it was closed off to all but the most accomplished students due to its inherent danger. Many of its lessons involved direct contact with demons, spirits, and other ne'er-do-well ethereals hell-bent on messing with those foolish to contact them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere we many stories of those who did not make it out of the class in one piece. One such tale was that of Alarian, one of the top students of his day. The cocky young man had made a sly quip at a demonic entity, prompting the creature to drag him across the veil to his own realm. By the time the attending teacher intervened and pulled him out, the handsome young man had been reduced to a fat, brainless goblin. Demon-magic being powerful as it was, it is said that he never returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why then was Phineas of all people going there? A few years before, one of his most accomplished cousins had managed to seduce and bind a succubus during the middle of a lesson; a feat never thought possible. He became the talk of the town and yet another addition to his family's massive legacy and for that reason Phineas's own parents had forced him into the class as a means to get his own glory, even at the expense of his own well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stumbled awkwardly into the room, he scanned the tiny crowd of students for some familiar faces. He recognized them all, but only cared about a few; all of them girls, and all of them the object of his affections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was Cassandra Betteridge, a member of the Betteridge noble family. Like many of her older sisters and relatives, Cassandra was rather chubby (most of her weight was in her waist) and growing bigger with each passing semester. This was due to her family's view on vain magic: only a truly insecure fool would bother to \"perfect\" their appearance. TRUE witches and wizards did not care about their looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next was Lysandra Sosanna, a brown skinned girl from a foreign land. One of the brighter pupils of their year, she was well regarded for her naturally curvy figure: thin, yet hourglass. But most of all, she was regarded for his kindness. Lysandra was the kind of person who wouldn't even raise a hand to a fly, let alone one of her fellow students. Considering the occacsional cut-throat nature of the school, Phineas really adored that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final was Regina Celene, a short witch with a tomboyish body. Her personality was like the opposite of Lysandra's; whereas the former was polite and courteous, Regina was utterly cutthroat. She forgone study for cheating and bullying her way into success. She sought to bring others down; not raise herself up. The total opposite of what Phineas was attracted to, both in body and mind. Yet his dislike of her only fueled his desire to see her fattened, preferably against her will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFantasies of the three girls growing bigger and bigger occupied his mind as the class dragged on, before...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The class wasted no time in starting some practical summoning. Students were paired up, to his amazement Phineas found he had been partnered with Cassandra Betteridge. The chubby plump witch was a bit of a stunner, even though the Betteridge witches cared little for their looks. Or perhaps just to Phineas she was a stunner, with a cute dimpled face and long blonde curls snarled in a twisted weave. Cassandra would keep her quills, wand and other instruments in her hair for holding as she worked on a warding circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circle was mainly for the students' protection, in each pair one was to work on setting up the wards while the other researched more on the entities and their home dimension. Demons, in this case, that Phineas should be reading about more intently given his share of the coursework. But he kept getting distracted watching Cassanda at work. She had sat on the floor with legs bent to one side, her pudgy knees just under the hem of her skirt. Her uniform was collecting chalk dust and soot, contrasting powders across across her plump form. Her chubby, pooching belly folded over itself as she bent over the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was the arrangement in sixes or sevens,\" Cassandra asked Phineas absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sixes,\" Phineas caught himself staring and focused back on the reference tome. \"You'll want to intermingle barrier and restraint glyphs.\" At least Phineas had earned decent marks in past runic language classes, a help when crafting glyphs and sigils. And he was fair in early planar theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Yet another piece of chalk snapped in Cassandra's hand. It joined the growing pile of spent useless ends. \"Can I get another--oh, thank you Fortescue.\" Phineas had immediately been ready in more chalk in hand. Cassandra sat up to take the offered chalk. The movement was just enough, Phineas was sure he could see a centimeter of skin from where her sweater had risen up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud crack and an increased smell of brimstone. Next to where Cassandra and Phineas were working Lysandra Sosanna and Regina Celene had been paired together. Only something had gone wrong, as a pillar of hellfire ate through the ceiling from above their broken circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice going Lysandra!\" Regina jeered, more annoyed than properly terrified like the rest of the students backing away as <i>something</i> was primed to emerge from the beyond. Lysandra was frozen in fear, wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just moments before whatever had gone wrong was about to get a whole lot worse, with the demonic entity fully materializing in the midst of the classroom. Phineas felt he had to do something...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Citadel's Extraplanar Studies classroom grew hot and dark, the belching smoke of otherworldly fires pouring out as something took form in the pillar of brimstone. The classroom was a small pocket freed from the usual protections of ancient wards abound in the great fortress, able to pierce into realms beyond comprehension. While the rest of the school was safe the students of the classroom were not. Only the glowing white runes of Lysandra's broken protection circle keeping the demon from fully materializing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe runes! Phineas had it, if he could just complete the glyphs in time the aberration would be abated. Against his normal instincts he dived toward the circle with a fistful of chalk, willing the crumbling utensil to hold together as he starting drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" In his haste, Phineas didn't realize he had tripped over Regina, knocking her further towards the intruding calamity. A horrid arm of red scarred flesh grabbed her from within the limited range of the broken circle. Black nails pierced her muscles, Regina's screams drowned out as sound was sucked into the incursion from another realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you!\" Lsyandra reached out to grab hold of Regina, although this proved to be a mistake. The brash lithe girl's mouth was twisted in agony and her eyes glowed strangely, something flowing within her veins. This corruption was contagious, as Lsyandra's mouth also went slack as her eyes turned an unnatural color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuckling down, Phineas hurriedly scratched out the remaining words of the circle, hoping it would be enough to abate the demon's entry. He heard a cry of his name and by the time Phineas comprehended the warning it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortescue! Those aren't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching the error, Cassandra tried to warn Phineas of what he had done. The completed runes glowed for a decidedly different reason as Phineas felt his throat close tight with trepidation. He hadn't completed binding runes but rather explosive ones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagical disasters tended to be spectacular, explosive affairs. Botching an already broken extraplanar circle with explosive runes certainly took the cake and threw it under the path of frenzied breeding dragons. The Citadel would have been destroyed numerous times over if its stones weren't used to the most violent demonstrations of magical backlash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fine layer of soot covered everything, the smoke of the wrecked room decidedly of this world rather than the next. Desks, books, personal belongings and more had been damaged badly in the blast. Witches and wizards tended to bounce back from most injuries, thankfully, whether from inner magic or artful use of magical medicine, so nobody was hurt beyond bumps and bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the derelict settings around him, Phineas had managed to land someplace soft. The traumatic encounter was ignored as he tested this odd softness. Plush, giving, yet jiggly. He kneaded it joyfully. If he didn't know any better he expected this was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand shot up from Cassandra Betteridge's pampered plump middle, as he realized he had dreamily been groping her stomach! The awakening came with a harsh cough from the ash in the air, a mix of sounds from other students coughing as the professor began going about the room, responding to the emergency that had occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a sight of the demon anywhere, although a crater was left where the demonstration had gone awry. Two bodies lay prone within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra also coughed as she sat up. Phineas kept his mouth shut up tight, although the Betteridge girl made no motion to recognizing that he had been feeling up her belly. She was caked in soot and her clothes were shredded, thick midriff bare as she hurried to her feet, light shooting from her wand as she went to check on the two in the crater. Guiltily, Phineas followed after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra hefted Regina up with surprising strength. \"Cold. But she's breathing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing suit, Phineas bent over Lysandra's prone form. She had fallen face forward in the blast, oddly, and was also victim to her clothes being decimated. Phineas was conflicted whether to look away or keep looking at Lsyandra Sosanna's shapely buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, all right, calm down!\" A voice of authority pierced through the confusion of the aftermath as the professor approached. Conjured blankets wrapped up every victim of the blast. \"Fortescue, glad to see you're alive for the words we'll have later.\" Phineas felt his heart sink, already anticipating what kind of a reprimand he would be facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you four checked out at the medical wing, no exceptions, clear a path please!\" The unconscious pair were taken to safety, with Cassandra assisting the professor. That left most of the eyes turned towards Phineas, well aware that he had just made a dangerous situation all the worst as he sheepishly trotted behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his roving eye couldn't help but pick up on a peculiar detail. Was it his imagination or did one of the girls seem bigger?</span></div></div>",

Word traveled fast, with each of his other professors hearing of the debacle. The first had noted he was late because of having to be checked at the medical wing, while another forbade him from any practical demonstrations lest more improper explosive runes happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a good first impression for his penultimate year at the Citadel. Phineas shrunk through each class, what with the ire of the teachers and the spreading gossip. Worst, he hadn't seen any of the other girls from that fateful class as the day wore on. How were they doing? Phineas felt he needed to apologize for his mistakes during the incident, he was so focused on trying to think of ways to make amends he hadn't been up to his usual classroom pastime of ogling the other hefty females on campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould Cassandra ever want to work with him again, that disheveled genius whose pampered middle sent his mind racing? Could he ever make it up to Lysandra, the hourglass foreigner too nice to be subjected to demonic intrusion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it hadn't been intentional, Regina was quite the b-witch if there ever was one. That didn't bother Phineas all that much. All this time agonizing over his mistakes during his first class had left him oblivious to the late hour. Classes were over for the day and Phineas had to report to detention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sure hoped attending detention didn't become a habit. Normally, students facing attention had to report to one of the unused classrooms. Various members of the Citadel faculty oversaw detentions, no student ever knew who was administering their punishment until that instructor arrived. Sometimes you lucked out, with a teacher only demanding lines or quiet study, but others were a lot more intensive. Grueling menial labor, tedious chores, or more oblique challenges that tested mettle. Usually no magic was allowed in detention. If it was an instructor that did allow magic, those frequently in detention would have rather died than faced the oncoming punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with gloomy anticipation that Phineas arrived at the quiet classroom five minutes before the indicated hour. It had been quite some time since he had last served a detention, so he had no clue what could possibly be in store for him. Surely this day was going to get a whole lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat apprehension soon vanished once Phineas saw who else was present in the otherwise empty classroom. This was a surprisingly small detention, to say nothing of the other occupant(s)...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phineas stood stunned in the doorway to the detention classroom. He recognized the girl seated at the desk right away. Everybody at the Citadel knew who she was, from her auburn shoulder length hair to her most outstanding feature...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of the classroom faced the doorway, so Phineas could gawk without having to change position. The stunner was Chelsea Morgana, currently at work on her nails. Red ones she filed delicately dressed in her pink cardigan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sitting on her desk were the biggest pair of breasts Phineas had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite obvious just what drew so much attention Chelsea Morgana's direction. Puberty had left her quite overdeveloped, what with her impressive knockers that left most males at the Citadel speechless. On top of that (or maybe because of those) she was one of the most popular girls at school. Any second of the day found her talking through large cliques of friends, laughing at in jokes and wrapping people around her little finger. It was all the more shocking that the buxom beauty was sitting alone in detention, quiet as a church mouse, and she hadn't noticed Phineas had entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas caught himself staring at her expansive chest for a bit too long. Chelsea's more crude nickname of 'Chesty' was an apt one. Phineas didn't have many classes with Chelsea during his years at the Citadel but the looker turned enough heads in the hallway so that everyone knew she was coming. He did remember her being one of the first of their grade to develop (just about the time Phineas realized he loved chunky females) and she had only grown bigger since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pink cardigan looked quite snug, the buttons of her undershirt looking a bit strained. Almost immediately Phineas had a private fantasy about the extremely top heavy Chelsea hitting all the more full upstairs, her clothes suddenly unable to constrain her meaty mammaries...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea looked his direction, her gorgeous perfect face and hazel-green eyes with just a hint of eyeliner. Phineas did his best to act like he had just entered, averting his gaze as he crossed to the second desk over from hers. He sat staring straight ahead, only looking Chelsea's direction with his peripheral vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buxom student went back to her nails, bored, as they sat waiting on the instructor to oversee their shared detention. That was right, detention! Phineas couldn't believe that here he was with one of the universally hottest girls at the school, both of them sharing a detention together. For once the reason for Phineas's attraction towards Chelsea, her top-heavy figure, wouldn't be one of ridicule. There were people who would willingly go to detention for a chance to sit next to Chelsea Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Phineas hadn't intended to louse things up so much during class that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of sweat formed on his brow as the silence stretched on, him and Chelsea waiting for detention to get underway. He should say something, shouldn't he? This was his only chance to talk to her before life moved on, him the loser nobody and Chelsea the voluptuous knockout. He'd already screwed up enough today so how could it get any worse than what he had already done?</span></div></div>",

Phineas finally worked up the nerve to talk to the incredibly busty Chelsea since their overseer had yet to arrive. He had already loused up today enough, so even if he embarrassed himself further the sting would be mild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So,\" Phineas began, catching Chelsea's attention from two desks over. \"I botched a ritual circle in class today. What got you stuck here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea blinked her hazel eyes. \"Potions, regrettably. Melted my cauldron and most of the classroom floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at the darkest hour things were starting to look up! Chelsea was not as perfect as she appeared, even capable of the same types of screw ups as an average bloke like him! He even kept his eyes fixed to her face and not the wobble of her turning breasts! With any luck, her scrutinizing-yet-ethused look meant she might be taking a fancy with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you say 'botched a ritual circle' are you talking about that blow-up in the first period of Extraplanar Studies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other shoe had dropped. Phineas coughed. \"Yes, well, I made things a whole lot worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off, stunned at who else appeared at the classroom door. Not the instructor to dole out their detention but Regina Celene! She noticed Phineas and returned his gaze with a murderously sharp stare. That was fair, Phineas decided, even if she hadn't nearly been possessed by a demon today. Although technically the issue had been her and Lysandra's fault before Phineas had accelerated the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Lysandra Sosanna was at the door, after Regina had found a desk far enough away from Phineas. This surprised Phineas, as he thought both she and Regina would have still been in recovery in the medical wing. She looked more favorably towards him, seeing a familiar face compared to the icy Regina that had been through the same event. She crossed over to set to Phineas's left at the end of the row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you, Lysandra?\" Phineas asked, breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling somewhat better, thanks.\" When she wasn't in a panic her voice was so melodious. And she had changed to more informal clothes, given her uniform had been destroyed. Phineas felt his heart flutter at the memory of her exposed if soot covered buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Phineas was most surprised, turning his head back from talking with Lysandra that even Cassandra Betteridge was at the door. Trully, only Lysandra, Regina and Phineas had been at fault for the incident, right? The same thought process was going through the plump Betteridge's face as she regarded Phineas behind her tangled hair falling over her eyes. She initially greeted him with a cold expression, although not with the disgust Regina's had. Yet, as she regarded that all of them in detention had sat in the first row thus far, she was more open to amending fences about the situation as she sat between Phineas and Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here too?\" Phineas asked, amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thought as well,\" Cassandra sighed. \"More by proxy than anything, I suppose. I was lectured for not helping well during the incident, along with moving Regina too soon that she actually had one of her ribs fracture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An easy restoration,\" Cassandra replied, but she stayed quiet as an ailing faculty member came in with a stoop, signaling the start of detention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The misshaps you children get into just because you're learning magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas sighed.It had been some time since his last detention but he knew of this professor's outlook. He had lumped them all in the same category of 'dunce' without referring to what had happened. He looked towards the other girls, sitting at rapt attention, except for Chelsea Morgana turned his way with a look of inscrutable mirth. Phineas grinned stupidly then turned his head to his desk, glum. Was she having a laugh at his expense? Or was she somehow impressed by the degree of which Phineas had gotten himself and the others in detention, given the gossip that had circulated the Citadel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well clearly you can't be trusted with magic,\" the professor continued, the same tireless speech he'd probably given over detentions for the past century. \"So some good hard labor will teach you had to better approach the privilege of having magic. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a collective groan. \"The detention was elsewhere?\" Chelsea said, ignored by the professor. \"Why not have us meet there instead? I've wasted twenty minutes sitting here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, few students were about the halls of the Citadel at this time as the parade of shame lead Phineas and the girls to the source of their detention. Phineas had estimated the destination given the professor's old school method of punishment. The arrived at the kitchens, an immense space to match the population of the equally large dining hall, freed from the hobs' evening labors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to wash all these pans without magic,\" the professor instructed as he confiscated wands, trinkets and any other paraphernalia or yantras to enact spellwork. \"And you are not permitted to leave until the task is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drudgerous detention yet doable. Phineas was used to many dishes when his large family had get togethers, as dishwashing spells were frequently forgotten. Yet the task was suitably arduous. Not only was the cookware used for that evening's dinner present but many plates had been returned too half-eaten. Phineas had been forbidden from making an appearance at dinner and it sounded like the girls might have as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas caught the sound of a grumbling stomach echoing among his fellow students in detention. He looked about in anticipation, trying to determine which girl it had been. Cassandra? Lysandra? Maybe even Chelsea? Whoever had her stomach betray her had remarkable composure, as did everyone else who didn't want to show that they had heard the stomach grumble or been the one to cause it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cassandra rolled up her sleeves. \"This pile of dishes isn't going to diminish itself. Girls? Fortescue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas and Lysandra joined her, as did Chelsea and Regina more reluctantly. And with that the detention was underway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The five students, the four girls and Phineas, split up the duties to wash that evening's dishes. Cassandra began sorting through the dishes in the pre-wash, dragging Regina into the task, as Phineas and Lysandra did the full wash in the sink, with Chelsea talked into doing the drying. The popular, buxom witch had a bit of a lazy streak, growing bored of the task as she waited for dishes to come, then finding herself quickly overwhelmed once Lysandra and Phineas sent cleaned dishes her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to be here forever!\" Chelsea Morgana eventually complained, after several minutes where it looked like nary a dent had been put in the mountain of dirty dishware. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe the stuff the other students just toss aside,\" Cassandra Betteridge said, finding a plate half covered with potatoes, pasta salad, and a bit of remaining lamb shank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Regina Celene grunted, taking a stack of dishes over to the sink where Lysandra Sosanna was scrubbing the inside of a pot, with Phineas working on cleaning silverware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was washing he heard Regina exclaim, \"how can you be eating that stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas snapped his head back across the kitchen. Cassandra, with the Betteridge plenitude of magic and wit being more important than appearances, was currently eating the remnants of the dinner plate she had found, much to Regina's disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfectly fine food,\" Cassandra said, \"that would be chucked in the bin regardless. Scraped off or eaten off, it still preps the plates for the rest of the cleaning process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas heard another telltale growl of an empty stomach, right next to him in fact. He turned back to look at Lysandra, with a brief glance as he noticed how hip to her wide hip they had ended up in the process of working at the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I could do with a break,\" Lysandra said, \"they didn't get us anything to eat during our time in the hospital wing and I haven't had anything to eat since breakfast. Do you mind, Fortescue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, n-not at all,\" Phineas replied, watching Lysandra turn with a 'thanks' as she walked over to join Cassandra, an ever-present sashay to her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?\" Regina said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysandra had ignored her. \"Is that shepard's pie over there? It's one of my favorites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina snarled. \"Don't slack off too much, or we will be here all night.\" She dumped another load of plates into the sink, splashing Phineas with some of the suds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, we can take breaks?\" Chelsea said. She had a pile of wet dishes at her station, as the act of drying with a towel was apparently too taxing for her. Phineas got a glance as to why, as Chelsea's cardigan and blouse had absorbed as much of the water as her towel. Not enough to make her blouse translucent, her cardigan covered that anyways, but the gradual soaking around her tremendous breasts gave a comical sight, as Phineas bit his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Chelsea had joined the other two with scavenging dinner through the leftovers. Regina still tried to stay on task, although behind her strict veneer she looked somewhat jealous. Another echo of stomach rumbling punctuated her return with more plates. Although Phineas didn't fancy her, and she was rather cutthroat in class, he did pity her situation at nearly being possessed be a demon earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was Lysandra right, about the two of you having nothing to eat in the medical wing?\" Phineas found himself asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of it?\" Regina retorted with a sharp look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't work on an empty stomach. Nobody will care if you have some of the leftovers or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPragmatism eventually won out, as Regina gave in to join the rest of the girls at the kitchen table. Lysandra noticed that Phineas remained at the sink. \"Aren't you going to find something to eat too, Fortescue? That's only fair if we're eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, actually, not really that hungry,\" Phineas said, making a show of continuing with the wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody should stay on task,\" Regina said curtly, although through bites of a hastily made sandwich of beef tips on an uneaten bun. \"We can't slack off for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen quieted to the sounds of eating and washing. Phineas continuously snuck glances the girls direction, finding unexpected fortune in seeing his thick-figured peers (minus the boyish Regina) soon set to scarfing down the remnants of the dinner they had missed. If only the sink didn't face the wall, Phineas could have positioned himself to stay on task and keep his voyeurism less obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as the other stations were abandoned, Phineas switched to catching up on Chelsea's lackluster drying, where he could turn while wiping down plates and bowls. None of the girls paid him any attention at this point. Given the small portions of the salvageable leftovers, the four had already stacked up quite a few plates removed of food-stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tantalizing scene for Phineas, imaging their plump bodies plumping further. Even Regina might fill out, as she was a surprisingly fast eater and had caught up to what the other girls had managed to polish off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sink was ignored in favor of Phineas finding a better angle to view the impromptu meal, as he switched to the intake station with a show of putting dishes in to soak. Barely paying attention to his work at this point, Phineas was caught off guard by a wrecked pot falling out of his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Phineas exclaimed, taking in the ruined piece. The stout pot looked to have caved inwards, with a third of it missing. Phineas realized it was a potion cauldron, remembering Chelsea's story about the destruction of hers in her Potions class getting her detention. There was still some residue of the inert dregs of the potion in the pan, a strange magenta color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phineas moved it to the sink more of the remaining fouled brew dribbled out of the dissolved bottom of the pan. The young wizard reflexively avoided having it splash on his clothes. The action made him realize that a trail of the ruined potion zigzagged around the stone floor of the kitchen to the initial pile of dishes, where the girls had cleaned off one end for their dinner break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Phineas wasn't sure if he should say something. Chelsea's story had the potion melt through the cauldron and floor, and the ruined cauldron proved that. Although that effect appeared to have subsided. Still, wouldn't it be bad if he others got into contact with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody would actually eat food tainted with unknown potion. Phineas made up his mind that there was little risk at this point. Noticing the hour, he refocused on cleaning dishes in the hopes that the girls would help finish the task.</span></div></div>",

So hidden, in fact, that the only way to and from the school was by a locomotive steam engine. The train almost had the amount of comforts the Citadel boasted, spread across the cars that transported the students to and from school each start and end of term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lengthy ride, on average about six hours to get to the Citadel. It was a time for students to catch up with friends, for newcomers to learn about the famed Citadel, for those that liked to study to cram before school began, and for the rowdiest of the academy to have their last hoo-rahs before they faced the discipline of the institution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Phineas Fortescue, the ride on the locomotive had become boring. There wasn't much to do during the wait until the Citadel loomed in the distance. The landscape passed by in a blur, with few scenic landmarks. Most students clustered up in the carriage cars with their friends, friends Phineas didn't tend to have. Few had the patience or interest of riding the train with him if they had a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then once the locomotive arrived at the Citadel, it would be business as usual for studying magic. Phineas remembered how fun learning magic had sounded when he first attended the Citadel. Now that it was his penultimate year, that spark had diminished as the studies proved to be challenging, draining and taxing to both body and mind.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phineas had been sitting by his lonesome on the train for a half-hour when he remembered the letter. The letter that had been addressed to him from his father. The letter he'd thrown with everything else into his suitcase because he'd been too tired to deal with the words of a man who had barely acknowledged him his entire life. Now that he was more rested though, he decided he had better read it. One disregarded the words of a wizard like Nicephorus Fortescue at their own risk, even if the one happened to be one of Nicephorus's children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time for Phineas to trek over to the cargo car, and even longer to look through the accumulated luggage of an entire school's worth of students before he found his own suitcase. Thankfully, after that it was a simple affair to retrieve the letter from the suitcase, before Phineas trudged back to the passenger car and seat that he had abandoned. It was still empty, thankfully. Phineas would rather he have no audience for what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe envelope the letter was in was made of a simple-looked yet elegant paper, one evidently resistant to being crumpled since it had survived the trip in Phineas's luggage without so much as a crease. One side of the envelope bore his name. The other had a wax seal with the crest of House Fortescue upon it. After looking at the envelope for what was likely too much time, Phineas took in a breath and muttered the incantation that would let the envelope know that the person intended to receive the message had gotten it. If he had gotten the spell wrong, the envelope would have burst into flame in Phineas's hands, destroying any message within. Instead, the wax seal faded away, and Phineas was able to open the envelope and retrieve what was within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was within was a letter. Phineas hadn't received too many of them, but he could still recognize his father's elegant script right away. At first, the message seemed formulaic enough. Words about doing well in school and upholding the honor of the Fortescue family seemed ordinary enough. It was right around the middle of the letter that Phineas read a sentence that would change his life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">... and so to ensure the continued prosperity of the Fortescue family, you have been brethothed to a scion of the Forsyth family...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Phineas to remind himself to breath. Betrothed? He was going to be married off? He hadn't even managed to ask a girl out on a date yet, and then this out of nowhere? Suddenly, his not enough breathing problem had been replaced with a too much breathing problem, and he had to take a moment to reorient himself before he started hyperventilating. He wasn't sure how long he spent trying to calm himself down, but finally Phineas was breathing not too fast and not too slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he could start to think again, Phineas looked back at the sentence. He was to be married to one of the Forsyths. Looking at it from a purely rational perspective, Phineas could see the logic in it. The feud between the Fortescues and the Forsyths had been one of the longer-running rivalries in the magical world, and he knew that his father had been negotiating some kind of alliance with the head of the Forsyth family. In families with as much history as Phineas's had, a marriage between members of the two families was still considered to be a good way to seal an alliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a pawn in a political game did not seem like a fun idea to Phineas, and he imagined it would be even less so to the Forsyth girl who was now his fianc\u00e9. There were two he could think of, both in his year. He'd kept his distance from the Forsyth twins for the reasons he'd kept his distance from most everybody, but he supposed that would have to change if he wanted any semblance of happiness in a marriage that had been decided for him. Of course, that would depend upon which of the twins he was set to marry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older of the two sisters by an hour was Farah Forsyth, who comported herself with the grace and dignity one would expect of a noblewoman. She was one of the top students in their year and had a small but respectable circle of friends. Many knew her as \"the Ice Queen of Vinixvue Tower,\" but it would appear that the gossip of lesser students didn't get to her. That or she had very impressive poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Faye Forsyth, who had started her school career much like her sister had but soon had veered off into her own circle of friends and interests. It had been a minor scandal when she'd been moved into Wrocklehurst Cellar with the other \"problem\" students, but it didn't seem to slow her down. While she wasn't as academically talented as Farah, Faye made up for it by trying to befriend everyone around her. She'd even tried to get to know Phineas, though he'd shied away from her outstretched hand like he'd shied away from everyone else. Quite a few students whispered about her supposed promiscuity, though Phineas suspected that many of the rumors were fueled by jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas shook his head. He was stalling. Better to read the rest of the letter, and get on with a life that was now inextricably linked to one of the Forsyth sisters.</span></div></div>",

He could already feel that this situation wasn't going to end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought over what he knew about the girl. She was considered to be one of the most beautiful girls on campus, and Phineas supposed that her long brown hair, violet eyes, and full lips were pleasant enough to look at. However, her figure was thin and willowy, and while many other students at the Citadel found her attractive, Phineas simply... didn't. There were some curves to her, yes, but not enough to really catch his attention. Phineas could already imagine a lot of her admirers lashing out at him in jealousy, and the thought did nothing to reduce his anxiousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was her personality.

Was she a snob who didn't talk to people she thought were beneath her? Did she have some of the same social anxieties that Phineas did that led her to forgo speaking to new people? Did she think that she needed to focus on her studies and thus disdain making friends as a waste of time? Phineas didn't know, and he wasn't sure how he was even going to start figuring it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he supposed he'd have to. Phineas didn't ask for this situation, but he found himself in it regardless. The way he saw it, he had two ways to react; either resign himself to it (and thus ensure his life would be miserable), or seek out Farah and maybe try to make this work. His mind made up, Phineas got up from his seat. It was time to actually introduce himself to Farah Forsyth.</span></div></div>",

Faye had violet eyes, full lips, and brown hair she'd cut short and dyed (it was green last time he'd seen her, but she tended to change the color once in a while) as a way to distinguish herself from her more straight-laced identical twin sister. While she'd started her schooling with the classical Forsyth willowy build, over the years Faye had added some extra fluff to her body. Not enough to make her outright fat, but Phineas had caught himself staring at her a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye was also outgoing. She never had an unkind word for anyone around her, except those who went out of their way to provoke her or her friends. Really, the only people who seemed to actively dislike her were some of the snobs from Vinixvue Tower who'd celebrated after her \"exile\" to Wrocklehurst Cellar.

Still, there were worse people he could have been shackled to, he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas supposed that if he were more prideful, he'd be insulted. He was being married to the \"defective\" Forsyth twin while golden child Farah would be free to match with a wizard with actual talent and influence.

Because that's what his father's letter seemed to be implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when they'd started their schooling at the Citadel, the Forsyth twins had been close. Phineas remembered feeling jealous of their bond; while he liked his siblings well enough, he hadn't had the kind of closeness that Farah and Faye seemed to possess. As the years went on, the two seemed to drift apart until the year when Faye had been moved out of Vinixvue Tower and into Wrocklehurst Cellar, which seemed to be the point where their relationship had been completely severed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarah continued on as the perfect noble daughter, with a carefully curated group of friends, excellent grades, and a lithe figure that most of those students who were attracted to women found irresistible.

The young wizard was not a big fan of drama in his personal life (it was one of many reasons why he tended to keep to himself), and yet this decision of his father's seemed like it would result in a year of nothing but drama.

He'd been so lost in his own melancholic thoughts that it took him a moment to recognize the source of the voice. When he did, he went over to the seat where the voice had come from, dragging his luggage along with him. He smiled as he did so. The voice belonged to... a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still a novel concept to him. He, Phineas Fortescue, knew people who wanted him around them. He'd been pretty much a loner through his first years of schooling. And yet, during the last year, a unique set of circumstances had led him to striking up a friendship with the two girls who were now sitting on the seat across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who'd called out to him was Ruby Summers. She was red-headed and brown-eyed with a short and stocky figure, and possessed a loud voice and strong determination. She needed to be determined, since she hailed from a family of low-income farmers. Ruby could only attend classes at the Citadel because of a scholarship she'd earned through much reading and hardship, and she wasn't about to let this chance at making a better life for herself slip away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl who was on the seat next to Ruby, meanwhile, had an entirely different background. Azul de la Mar was the third daughter of the eminent de la Mar family, whose ancestral home was a castle built on a private island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Like all true-blooded members of the family, Azul possessed eyes and hair of the deepest blue as well as dusky skin and a curvy figure.  Azul had never needed to truly try hard at anything; no one in her family expected much of her, since she was so far down the line of succession. It was a shame, since she had enormous magical potential. Even putting in a bare minimum of effort allowed Azul to easily succeed in all of her classes. Fortunately, her laid-back and easygoing personality made it easy enough to get along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last year, Phineas, Ruby, and Azul had all been in many of the same classes. Said classes involved a lot of group projects, and it soon became clear that no one wanted any of them in their groups. Phineas was ostracized because social anxiety, Ruby due to her lowborn background, and Azul because she didn't get involved in the cliquishness that defined the social hierarchy of the noble children. The three had to work together, because there was literally no-one else who would. At first, Ruby and Azul's differing natures had made work difficult, but Phineas had managed to provide the cement that allowed the three to work together effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they had been effective. Phineas had never had a more productive school year than the one he'd had last year, and he had his two partners... his two <b>friends</b> to thank for that. All of a sudden, a boring and dread-inducing train ride felt a lot more bearable. After giving Phineas a moment to settle in, the three began to catch up, talking about how their summers had gone as well as referencing several in-jokes that only the three of them got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the conversation went on, Phineas began to notice a certain tension the air. He wasn't that good at reading social situations in the first place, but even he couldn't help but notice when Ruby began to wax poetical about her mother's home-cooking, when Azul complained that she'd needed buy a new wardrobe just before school since none of her old pants fit, and when both began talking about what kind of delights might be had at the welcome feast. Phineas shifted uncomfortably as he heard all this talk. He had to clamp down on his imagination before it ran away with images of Ruby stuffing herself full of steak and potatoes and Azul's butt getting big enough to ruin another pair of pants. He'd only just managed to make his first real friends! He was not going to screw this up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their first year of acquiantance with one Phineas Fortescue, both Ruby Summers and Azul de la Mar had come to know a lot about him. Both girls appreciated his sensitivity, thoughtfulness, and even found his awkwardness endearing. They had also both found out, in their own ways, about Mr. Fortescue's preference for larger women. So each had decided, on her own, of her own volition, to try getting bigger to win his heart. Furthermore, in the conversation they'd had before Ruby had called \"Finny\" over, each had learned that the other girl had come up with the same idea. And in the end, both Ruby and Azul decided that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In their earlier conversation before Phineas had arrived, Ruby had been the first one to bring up her crush on the boy. She'd hoped that Azul, who she now saw as one of her closest friends, would help her try to win Phineas's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem that you already found the best way forward, I think,\" Azul had responded, with a teasing poke at Ruby's soft midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby swatted Azul's hand away with a blush on her face, though she was glad to receive confirmation about her theory. For once, she was glad that she'd inherited her mother's stout build. If she hadn't seen the way Phineas had stared at Margot Francois's thunder thighs in Intermediary Binding last year, she might not have believed he was into chubbier girls like her. Nonetheless, she couldn't let Azul's teasing go unanswered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I haven't noticed how your butt's gotten bigger!\" Ruby retorted hotly, causing Azul's lazy smile to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I <b>have</b> put on a few,\" Azul responded, though her tone was clearly unapologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Ruby shouted back. \"So don't... don't...\" Ruby's voice died away, as a dreadful feeling crept into the pit of her stomach. There was a brief silence between the two, before Ruby asked, \"You... you like him too, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirth disappeared from Azul's face, as she looked Ruby in the eyes. \"I do,\" she said in a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to appear in the corners of Ruby's eyes. It just wasn't fair! She'd seen how other girls at school who had appeared to be the closest of friends went to becoming bitter enemies as soon as love became involved. Was her crush on Phineas about to ruin everything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby then felt someone grab her hands, and looked up at Azul. \"None of that,\" Azul said, her voice warm and sincere. \"Just because we both like the same boy doesn't mean that we have to stop being friends. I know it can work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Ruby gasped, desperately hoping to believe that this might all work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These new pants I'm wearing? I got them as a birthday gift from my sister's girlfriend,\" Azul said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's brain stopped for a moment. \"Isn't she married to the Duke of Milan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is. Judging by the way he looks at them when he thinks no-one is looking at him, I think he knows and approves,\" Azul responded, her smile becoming a slight smirk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Ruby murmured, not quite sure what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we do this together. We help each other and him. I don't think he'll mind, once we loosen our belts a few notches,\" Azul said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby paused a moment. \"Once we can no longer wear belts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul snorted. \"That's the spirit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had then discussed their strategy for winning him over, which was tabled once Phineas had arrived. The first part of the plan, which involved making Phineas flustered by discussing their growing waistlines, seemed to be working out pretty well. Azul enjoyed being a gadfly, and it was all she could do to keep from bursting out into giggles at seeing how hard Phineas was working to keep his reactions to their discussion hidden. Even Ruby, who wasn't as fond of teasing as Azul was, found it rather funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the train arrived at the Citadel, and after everyone had gotten everything settled (thankfully, Phineas, Ruby, and Azul had all been assigned to Kunok Quarters, like they had been last year), the Welcoming Festival began. Ruby, in a flash of inspiration, challenged Azul to an eating contest and had declared that Phineas would be the judge. Azul naturally accepted the challenge, and the two dragged a confused Phineas to one of the tables that had been laid out on a pavilion, and soon many plates laden with food were placed in front of them. A small crowd soon gathered as Phineas nervously told them to begin. Some of the gathered students soon left, though some of the onlookers began to place bets about which of the two girls would emerge victorious (Phineas, wisely, was not one of the gamblers).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winner, eventually, was Ruby, although hers was a hard-won victory. Scattered around the table were many, many plates, and the formal robes they were both wearing were both stained (contests not being very conducive to well-mannered eating). As bets were being paid to those who'd won, Phineas helped both Ruby and Azul to their feet, and then accompanied them back to their room in Kunok Quarters. Both were feeling rather bloated and not up to any more festivities at the moment, and truth be told neither did Phineas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lounged in the Kunok Common Room, listening to the shouts and music outside, a stray thought popped into Phineas's mind. Were Ruby and Azul... trying to gain weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dismissed the idea as soon as he considered it. That was ridiculous. All that was just Ruby being her usual competitive self and Azul going with the flow, as it always had been, he decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day classes began, and as the three friends began their penultimate year of magical schooling, Ruby and Azul's plot to seduce Phineas began to get underway. Unfortunately, the pair's plan would soon hit a very significant snag.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took Margot Francois a while to put herself together in the mornings, which was the way she liked it. She liked to use her morning routine to help sort through the various problems and challenges she faced, and come to a solution. After all, who was going to sort her problems out if not herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd just gotten out of the bath and was styling her golden blonde hair as her mind turned towards one such problem that had been bothering her for a while. Like all children of the nobility who attended the Citadel Preparatory Academy, one of Margot's goals was to interface with the other children of important magical families in search of a marriage alliance. It was a surprisingly feudal way of matchmaking, but both Margot's parents had met during their schooling at the Citadel, so she supposed it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargot's problem was that her pedigree just happened to be one of the best in the school. The Francois family could trace its lineage all the way back to Francis of Normandy, who had been Court Wizard to the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne. As such, many of the young men vying for Margot's hand were, quite frankly, not worth her time. Few students at the Academy were. There had been one she'd had her eye on, but just thinking about the memory brought a frown to Margot's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio de Panettone had been in line to become the Duke of Milan when he'd begun his schooling at the Citadel, and had actually gotten the title when his father had unexpectedly died during his last year. Seeing the advantage of the match, Margot had spent much of her time at the Citadel trying to woo him, only to be beaten out by Cerulea de la Mar. Last she'd heard the two had gotten married right after graduation. Just the thought of having wasted all that time made Margot's blood boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brought her back to a display she'd seen last night, at the welcoming feast; the impromptu eating contest between Azul, Cerulea's little sister, and some peasant she hadn't bothered to learn the name of. An eating contest that had been judged by one Phineas Fortescue. The quiet young man could present an interesting opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fortescues were, after all, one of Europe's most illustrious magical families. No one could say that she'd be marrying down by marrying a Fortescue. She also knew that she'd have an easy time seducing him, if it came to it. Margot wasn't blind, after all. She always made sure to keep an eye on her surroundings, and had seen Phineas staring at the heavier girls in their year (herself included) when he thought no one would see him. Margot smirked as she ran a hand up her plush body. It would seem that her extra fluff was going to be nothing but an advantage for this latest scheme of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what made Margot truly decide to commit to her plan to seduce Phineas was that it was clear as day that Azul wanted him. The way that she'd deliberately plumped herself up over the summer and that gratuitous display at the welcoming ceremony left no doubt in Margot's mind. She couldn't directly get back at Cerulea, who had stolen the man she wanted, but nabbing the boy her little sister was interested in would be at least some kind of revenge, and Margot supposed she could be satisfied with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her preparations for the day were done. She was wearing a modest blouse with a skirt that was not quite short enough to be considered scandalous. Margot's green eyes twinkled as she flounced out of her room. She'd have Phineas eating out of her hand within a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul could tell that she and Ruby were in trouble right away. She'd just arrived at Advanced Animation with Phineas and Ruby (the three having coordinated their schedules so that they'd have the same classes), when Margot Francois entered the classroom. She walked right by where they'd been sitting, with a deliberate sway in her wide hips. Phineas had been awestruck, and only looked away after Ruby \"accidentally\" jostled him. Before sitting down, Margot looked directly at Azul and had shot her a smug smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul frowned pensively. She was well aware of the animosity between Margot and her older sister. A big part of the reason she'd been forced to partner with Phineas and Ruby last year had been Margot's efforts to socially isolate her from the other noble children as an indirect way of lashing out at Cerulea. Not that Azul minded; she found that she liked the two people sitting near her much more than the many children of counts, dukes, and bankers that she'd interacted with for the majority of her school career. So Azul had been content to let Margot play her games, since they really had only made her life better once she'd gotten to know Phineas and Ruby better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now it looked like Margot was after Phineas, and that Azul couldn't allow. She looked back at her table mates. Phineas was staring down at his desk, muttering something to himself. Meanwhile, Ruby was shooting her a worried look; it looked like she'd reached the same conclusion that Azul had. Azul mouthed the word \"Later,\" and Ruby nodded. There wasn't much they could do now with class starting. But something would have to be done, else Phineas might slip from their grasp forever before they had a chance to tell him how they felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of that day proceeded much the same, with Margot never saying anything to the three, but always staying within eyesight. Always doing something that would keep Phineas's chubby chasing eyes on her, whether it be swaying her hips as she walked, surreptitiously pulling out a snack in the middle of class, or once or twice bending down to pick up a pen of hers that had \"accidentally\" fallen on the floor. It was a maddening experience for Azul, who really couldn't do much to stop the blonde's assault on Phineas's psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, though, classes were ended for the day, and there was some time until dinner. Phineas, Azul, and Ruby all headed off for different parts of the canvas, to try and figure out just what was going on after the day they'd had.</span></div></div>",

Although Margot's manner of teasing and knowing looks shot Azul's way made it clear that this was just as much an attack against the de le Mar family on account of her sister, Cerulea. Something Azul was not going to let slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with that determination that Azul made her way up the marble laden steps towards Vinixivue Tower. Each of the dormitories left its impact on the Citadel's surrounding architecture, and the higher one climbed Vinixivue Tower the more opulent the construction. Diamond and gem encrusted stained glass circled the tower, with golden banisters and silver-wrought lattice work that was polished to perfection, especially on the opening week of the term. Centuries old oak made up the big doors to the common room. Azul opened the doors and immediately looked around for her quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shining, palatial student quarters were quite lavish and large. The year's new students were getting settled by student authorities, several cliques were mingling about and getting reacquainted, old friends trading in-jokes. The blonde Margot Francois wasn't too hard to miss, with her thunder thighs spilling out of her skirt as she sat on a leather armchair next to two of her catty friends eating teacakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargot didn't miss the dusky skinned, brilliantly blue haired Azul as she made her way closer. \"Look who it is, Miss de le Mar,\" Margot giggled, echoed by nearby students. \"Missing out on the posh life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another loaded barb underneath pleasantries. For the first several years of her schooling Azul had roomed in Vinixivue Tower before she had gotten tired of the snobbish games of one-upmanship that permeated the elites of the dorm. It was moving to simpler quarters, Kunok Quarters in fact, that Azul had eventually formed a genuine friendship with Ruby and Phineas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I have a word,\" Azul said sourly. \"Privately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing you wanted to share publicly?\" Margot said, faux-taken aback to a new chorus of titters. \"I suppose I can honor that request to a former roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, in their younger years Miss Francois and de le Mar had even roomed together, and that thin veneer between politeness and fierce rivalry had existed since then. Azul was happy to have been freed of it since changing her living arrangements but she could still go toe to toe with the most stuck up Vinixivue had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Azul began when she and Margot had retreated to a quiet corner of the tower next to the windows overlooking the lower parts of the Citadel, after drawing the chic curtains, \"Phineas is my friend and neighbor I truly care about. He's not some piece of meat to sink your claws in over some petty feud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't the foggiest what you're suggesting, Azul,\" Margot kept the same friendly smile, although her tone was anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come off it,\" Azul said, \"just because Cerulea was betrothed to Antonio doesn't mean you can take it out on us. I'm not my sister and you don't even know Phineas all that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're not your sister,\" Margot said, true intentions showing, \"but you blue haired de le Mar's do let your feminine charms weave their way into the most eligible of relationships.\" Part of the candid rivalry with Margot and Azul had been the interactions of their lineage, as the exotic de le Mars had often been the upset in several marriage arrangements throughout the year. \"Yet it should have been my hand with Antonio before your sister ruined it when he inherited his title. And turnabout is fair play if you're trying to get in with the Foretecues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no part in the arranged marriage and you know it, it was out of our control,\" Azul said. It was only a marriage for appearances anyways. Azul didn't want the truth of relationship with her sister Cerulea and Antonio de Panettone getting out. Azul had shared that tidbit to Ruby in confidence on the train, with Cerulea and Antonio incompatible in orientation with Cerulea having a girlfriend. The de le Mar women had far more open minded concepts of relationships than many of the social elite, hence Azul's agreement to share Phineas before Margot stomped her way into the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deflect all you want,\" Margot said, \"because I shall have my revenge with wooing Fortescue away from you, and if it secures my relation with one of Europe's most important families that's the cherry on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You barely know him,\" Azul challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargot smugly put one hand to her outset hips, brushing her other hand over the edge of her skirt with her tremendous thighs. \"Oh, I know what little Phineas fancies.\" Besides her stellar lineage, Margot was quite attractive if on the heavy side. Hers was a classic rubenesque figure with wide hips and filled thighs, perhaps the one flaw in the eyes of any other potential suitor but a boon to enchant the heart of the shyest Fortescue lad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargot stepped to the side with a pointed look to check Azul's profile. \"And while that ass of yours looks a little more porky, I must outweigh you by what, fifteen? Twenty pounds? You've seen the way he lusts after the biggest.\" She squeezed her plump thigh for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And while Mr. Fortescue doesn't look like much now, he could do with some polishing up. Admit it, I'd be better for him in every way. Really, that display of yours and your silly other friend at the Welcoming Feast was a hopeless attention grab, whatshername is such a lower class lout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby Summers,\" Azul corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Margot replied, the name not even worth her notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to you, Margot,\" Azul challenged, \"mess with Phineas or my friend and you will come to regret it! I'll show you just how 'meddlesome' a de le Mar can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try,\" Margot retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an electric stare between the two young witches before Azul turned to leave. \"Just remembered I did warn you, Margot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you at class, then,\" Margot finished. \"Unless dinner tonight will have a repeat performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul knew she would have to change her strategy with Ruby with Margot entering the game as their opponent.</span></div></div>",

Azul had brought along some fancy chocolates, something from home as a treat to start the new term at the Citadel, as she asked Ruby to meet to update her on the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, big-headed, ego-centric,\" Ruby had several choice words in mind, although Azul shushed her. \"--skank, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She certainly intends to meddle,\" Azul fumed, popped several more chocolates in her mouth. In past year, Azul would have savored the chocolate assortment to let it last a few weeks, but in one sitting she and Ruby had nearly polished off the extra large box. As to their original intention, both of Phineas' friends had upped their snacking, although that motivation went into overdrive now that there was an outside competitor in the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does stupid, Miss Perfect High-and-Mighty-Toitier than thou,\" Ruby talked with her mouth full of chocolate, enraged to the point of spitting but wouldn't because of the delicious chocolate, \"even see in Phineas? She's never even given him the time of day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Azul said, having not told Ruby the full story of Morgot's twisted aims of vengeance. A fact that would complicate their own aims at sharing Phineas' affections. \"The real problem is I think she's right on outweighing me, perhaps both of us. When's the last time you weighed yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby swallowed. \"Um, before I left home I was nearly 12 stone.\" Even though her goal had been to gain more weight to be more attractive in her love's eyes, Ruby wasn't used to the idea of scrutinizing her size just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that much?\" Azul was surprised, taking in Ruby's appearance. With all of her weight concentrated in the middle, the freckled redhead's pudgy figure was dominated by her doughy belly. That plumpness had left Azul thinking Ruby outweighed her, until she took in account their difference in heights. \"Because I'm not even twelve and a half stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's eye grew wide at that metric, as she reciprocated Azul's sizing up as she looked to her friend's taller, exotic form. Azul was a knock with her namesake blue hair and eyes with how they contrasted her darker skin. And while she had the bulbous backside, there wasn't that much fat on the upper parts of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm the smallest in all of this?\" Ruby asked, ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there,\" Azul gave her friend a comforting squeeze on the shoulder. \"You'll outpace me soon enough with that appetite of yours. What's more concerning is that places Margot close to 200 pounds if she's telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby felt her heart sinking, as she reached for more chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She may be the biggest now,\" Azul said, \"but we have the advantage of being friends with Phineas. We can keep her from trying to charm him and play to our strengths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Ruby said, confidence returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sooner we can get rid of her influence, the better,\" Azul said. The two friends began planning their strategy in this all out game of love and war.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"If we're both in this together,\" Ruby said after she and Azul had finished the chocolate, \"then that'll be our source of strength, two against one.\" In some respects Ruby had spent the past couple of days coming to terms with the idea of sharing Phineas. It was fun to talk about the matters with Azul yet some part of Ruby had still pined for Phineas as a solo act of courtship. This had thrown her off her game, especially as Margot Francois stated her intent to interfere, leaving Ruby a bit weepy in the process of understanding what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she knew Azul had the best of intentions to confession their joint love for Phineas, unlike Margot, it grounded Ruby back to her fierce Summers determination. Plenty had looked down on her origins before, working class compared to most of the blue bloods at the Citadel (if not blue-haired like Miss de le Mar) but that grit and gumption had got her this far into her schooling, about to ask Phineas out herself before the approach became sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be like nursing new babes back at the farm,\" Ruby suggested. Her family earned most of their income domesticating various magical beasts. \"Whenever there's a unicorn foal or a hod pup born, we're there alongside the mother. Doubly so if it's a rescue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So neither of us should leave Phineas alone?\" Azul summarized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, preferably both of us should be with him as much as possible so Margot can't get to him. And if we need to switch one of us should be available as the other departs. That could free up time to continue our efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for school, of course,\" Azul said, earning a titter between them. Their schemes still became the forefront of their thoughts as they continued discussion. \"I might have a word with the professors about switching my classes around. That'll also let me see if I can sus out Margot's schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't happen to have more chocolates, would you?\" Ruby asked, feeling peculiarly famished. Her height didn't do much for her stature, although her robust appetite would soon be dramatic results to catching up to the metaphorical \"heavyweights\" in terms of Margot as a rival and Azul as a co-girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I'll order some more,\" Azul said, as she continued with their options. \"We have the advantage of sharing a dorm so we can always convince him to come back for a study session. Or more. Maybe we can join in on a club Margot will avoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good ideas,\" Rub said, mind elsewhere. \"My parents packed some cookies in a care package, I feel like a taste of home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a new addition to her morning regimen, Margot Francois added scrying after she had done up her blonde locks into bouncy ringlets. She had somewhat of a skill in divination, although most matters of the future at the Citadel were tricky to determine given the magical wards built into the foundation of the school, along with the sheer potential of its students. However, Margot could still determine something as simple as which way one Phineas Fortescue walked towards breakfast in the mornings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Margot said as she mentally noted the results from her crystal ball, taking the moment to do up her stockings. The hem ending just above the knee, it left plenty of flesh for Phineas to feast his eyes on, given how her plump thighs filled out her skirt. An easy way to charm the shy youth. It would be as easy as 'bumping' into him on the way to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe execution turned out to not be that simple. Margot considered it a straight shot down from Vinixivue Tower to where she planned to interact Fortescue coming from his dorm. Yet unlike her portents in the crystal ball he wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul de le Mar was walking beside him, cracking jokes in what appeared to be an impromptu pop quiz, as Phineas read out questions from one of his textbooks as they carried their school supplies. And Azul was very pointedly not looking at Margot, although she had crossed to the other side of Phineas as if to block him from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargot frowned. It would require her fallback plan later that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Finny!\" Ruby greeted as Azul and Phineas sat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Phineas was a little bleary eyed, having been woken earlier than usual as Azul asked him to help her review material they had learned last year to best prepare for their new classes. \"Have you...been at breakfast this whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two emptied plates and a bowl with traces of porridge at Ruby's place setting, as she merrily ate at some bacon. \"That early? I guess so, we're often up at the crack of dawn when I help on the farm. Morning chores before getting fuel for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr in this case for Ruby, the morning chore had been the fuel for the day. She had just about beat out the rest of the Citadel for showing up to breakfast early, her large appetite given a renewed drive to make herself more attractive in the eyes of her metal crush with Azul. Azul smiled knowingly as she tucked into her own breakfast, as Phineas was more careless in keeping his gaze flitted between them for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many studied the Law &amp; Government of magical societies to this advanced a degree, so Margot knew that their class was a handful of students, herself and Fortescue included. Margot's machinations for influence weren't only from family reputation alone, as she had political ambitions alongside marrying well, creating her new fascination in luring Fortescue away from her rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small chamber for this class had raised benches and longboards along each wall before the lectern, so as Fortescue entered Margot prepared to shift her weight over a few seats to find a 'new seat mate.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, apologies for being late.\" There was de le Mar yet again! Huffing slightly, the bulbous reared blue-haired harlot obvious wasn't used to brisk jogs. She didn't even take this class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even take this class,\" Phineas said after Azul sat down after a word with the professor, although he was pleasantly surprised to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I asked to transfer last minute as I've been thinking about what to do after graduation,\" Azul replied, winded, as she sat her own wide hips closer to Phineas' seat than she had at any of their previous classes. \"You make it sound much more interesting, Finny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the only thing that made this interesting. Truthfuly, Azul found the class to be an actual bore, a lot of the material stuff she had learned second hand from her family's own political interests. Azul excelled far more at her spell work than anyone in her family thought, although alliances and clan loyalties were seen as more important. This class was going to be horrendous. But besides more time with Phineas, it was well worth the look on Margot Francois' face when she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care for a drink, Phineas?\" Ruby asked as the trio of friends met that evening. She had talked Phineas into joining her and Azul out on one of the balconies off of the Kunok Quarters commons. Azul was basking along one of the benches, catching the last of the suns rays, as Ruby pried open the crate she had been carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pixie Malt?\" Phineas read on the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a favorite back home,\" Ruby said, having snuck around some of the Citadel's larders. \"Non-alcholoic, don't worry, but it is said to lift your spirits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-kayy...\" Phineas took the bottle. The drink had a warm, fruity, fizzy taste that did make him feel a bit giddy. He took a seat perpendicular to Azul's bench, as Ruby handed her a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's to another great year!\" Ruby toasted as she cracked open her bottle. \"Look at us, think to when we were the young sprouts at the Citadel, and now we are much more mature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd message but Phineas raised his bottle all the same before taking another swig. Things sure were different than when they were younger, when he hadn't gotten to know Ruby or Azul personally. But it was odd how much of the day they had spent together already...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was distracted in noticing that while he and Azul had taken a sip, Ruby had raised her head back over the railing as she continued drinking, great gulps passing from her throat down past her chest to her stomach. And drinking, and drinking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!\" Ruby gasped, refreshed, after finishing off her Pixie Malt in one long draft. Phineas looked stunned as Azul laughed. \"I could go for another, there's plenty more if anyone wants.\" She stooped to fish out another bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul had been surprised how forward Ruby had been in this endeavor but it was looking to pay off. If they kept this up, they would secure Phineas' heart in no time. It was almost a shame this side of Kunok Quarters didn't face Vinixivue Tower, because this evening's exhibitions would send Margot a clear message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere may not have been direct line of sight but Margot fumed over her crystal ball over her evening scrying, as she began to plot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been three weeks since the school year started, and Azul thought that things were going well. Her classes, while challenging, were not too difficult. She'd managed to slide back into the partnership she'd shared with Phineas and Ruby with little trouble. And, of course, the plot to share Phineas was moving along as well. Azul knew it was going to take time, but she felt that the polyamorous relationship she envisioned among the three of them would soon be a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would appear that reality was going to impose its wishes upon her rather than the other way around, as Azul found herself sitting in a private room in the administration wing wearing one of her formal robes. It had been made for her at the beginning of the school break, which was why it felt rather tight around her bust and hips. It certainly seemed to catch Phineas's attention when she had told her friends about the meeting she needed to attend this morning. A meeting with someone she'd rather not see right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't surprise Azul that Lord Cobal de la Mar would be late to a meeting he'd arranged with his own daughter. The man was always busy with his duties, and what time he did find to spare seemed to be spent on Azul's two older sisters. A part of her had wondered if he'd noticed her steadily putting on weight the entire time she'd been back home during the break. He apparently didn't, not that she'd really expected him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he deigned to appear. Lord Cobal's hair was the same shade of blue he'd passed down to his daughters, albeit streaked through with grey. The man's face was clean-shaven and severe, with age lines starting to etch their way into it. His robe was lighter shade of blue, marked with the wave emblem of the de la Mar family. At his side was his wife, the Lady Sarah de la Mar, wearing a robe similar to the one her husband wore. She lacked the dusky coloring and blue hair of the family she'd married into, but it was thankfully the softer features of her face that Azul had inherited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for the delay, Azul,\" Cobal said as the two of them sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's understandable, my Lord Father. I know that your time is <i>valuable</i>,\" Azul responded, with a little more venom in the last word than she had intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf her father noticed, he didn't show it. \"Indeed. As you know, my daughter, our family has kept its position over the centuries by marrying well. Your eldest sister, Sapphire, and her husband are set to inherit Isle de la Mar. Cerulea has married the Duke of Milan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul didn't like where the conversation was going. \"I know, Father. And I am looking for a similarly prestigious match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you?\" Cobal asked, \"Because it is my understanding that you moved out of Vinixvue Tower last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul could feel a lead weight in her stomach. After she'd started working with Phineas and Ruby, she'd requested a transfer to Kunok Quarters. It was partly so they'd have an easier time collaborating in their classes (that was the reason she'd put on the paperwork), but mainly so that she could get away from the other noble children she'd never really gotten along with. But of course, it was those noble children her father would want her to be interacting with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobal continued speaking, his face as stony as ever. \"I would have been content to allow you to try and find a prospective husband, as I had for your sisters. But leaving Vinixvue has lead me to question your judgement in the matter. So your mother and I have decided to make the decision for you, so that you may focus your attention on your schooling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul looked from her father to her mother, but Lady Sarah's expression remained unreadable. Of course, what could her mother say? In the end, Cobal was the head of the household, the patriarch of the family, and his word was law. Once he'd made a decision, it was final. Only rarely did Cobal de la Mar change his mind once it was made up. Azul could feel something inside her shatter, as her dreams for a future together with the two people she loved most in the world were revealed to be just that: dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Thank you, Father, Mother,\" Azul said in a quietly defeated voice, because what else was there <b>to</b> say? \"And who is my husband going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobal gave a satisfied nod, either not noticing his daughter's distress or not caring. \"The name of the man you've been engaged to is...</span></div></div>",

Had she heard he father right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" she asked, her voice almost coming out as a squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phineas Fortescue,\" Cobal repeated. \"It should prove an ideal match. He is in your year, I believe. When I asked your sisters for their input on potential matches, his was the first name mentioned by both of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took everything she had not to break down crying right there. Azul knew she would need to pull out all the stops to thank both Sapphire and Cerulea for this; if it wasn't for their strategically-placed suggestions to father, she might have been truly trapped in an unbearable situation. She looked up and saw Cobal looking at her and realized he was probably waiting for her answer on something. Not trusting her voice for the moment, she simply nodded at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" Cobal said with a satisfied nod. \"I believe that concludes everything we needed to discuss with you.\" After that, it was the perfunctory goodbyes, which Azul managed to struggle through with a straight face (though her mother sent her a concerned look). Once the elder de la Mars were out of the room, Azul took a moment to let the tears of relief wash out of her. She knew she couldn't stay in the room forever though, and left to see if she could find a more private place to break down in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Phineas Fortescue was leaving a different room in the administration wing after facing a similar meeting with his own father about his future. The reedy young wizard was feeling conflicted. There was definitely a part of him that didn't like the fact that his father had decided as important an aspect of his future as who he was going to marry. At least it was going to be to Azul, he supposed. He wasn't entirely sure if the blue-haired witch liked him as more than a friend, though there was a corner of his brain that suspected that maybe she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put those musings on hold when he saw the witch in question in the corridor in front of him. Phineas picked up the pace to a light jog to catch up to her. His heart sank when he saw the puffiness of her eyes and some tear tracks down her cheeks, clear evidence that she'd been crying. Was she sad about the arrangement, Phineas wondered. She was so caught up in her own head that she hadn't noticed him yet, so Phineas loudly cleared his throat to catch her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing... you learned about the... uh... the engagement?\" Phineas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul nodded, caught a little off guard by Phineas appearing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... I want to know that... If this isn't something you want, we can... we'll figure something out...\" Phineas said, but before he could continue his rambling mess of an answer, Azul grabbed him by the front of his robes and kissed him on the mouth. Thankfully, the hallway was empty, so no one was around to witness Phineas become the speechless one. After the kiss ended, Phineas merely continued to stare back at Azul, still not able to form words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I've been waiting to do that for months now. None of this is going to how I planned it, but... I'm glad, Phineas. I'm glad it's you.\" Azul said after it was clear Phineas wouldn't be able to form words on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the dark-haired young wizard a little more time to put his thoughts back into working order. \"You mean... You're fine with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Phineas, I am. Truth be told, I've been trying to find a way to tell you for a while now. I love you, Phineas Fortescue,\" Azul responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas wasn't quite sure how to respond to that, so he simply pulled his fianc\u00e9e into an embrace. The two remained there for a time, before Phineas said, \"I, uh... I think we should get going. Ruby's going to wonder where we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby...\" Azul felt the lead weight in her stomach return. She'd been so elated over this unexpected turn of events that she'd forgotten the girl whom she'd promised to share Phineas with. The girl who she was fairly certain she loved as much as she loved Phineas. There was no telling how she might respond to the news of this engagement, but the consequences for putting off telling her might end up being catastrophic.

She owed the other girl that much, at least.</span></div></div>",

That they were open to turning their friendship into something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the morning after the eve of the new term did little to reciprocate the plans the two girls had to declare shared love towards Phineas. Azul had gone to breakfast with a new outfit, having eyed her wardrobe to find which clothes had the most give, settling for a silky soft pink blouse and taunt silvery skirt, a contrast to her unusual shade of skin. The skirt clung to her generous curves, leaving her cherubic buttocks on display in a tantalizing fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby did not have as many clothes as her friend's lavish wardrobe, although she had a patterned vest and work slacks that would be suitable for their classes. More importantly, a bit painfully, the results of her victory at last night's eating contest still sat heavy in her stomach. It would be worth the pain, Ruby knew, if it got Phineas to reciprocate her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the pair walked in tandem to a table where Phineas was sitting, a textbook opened next to his breakfast plate. Each girl positively beamed and the prospects of showing off to their friend turned potential lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Phineas!\" Azul greeted, striking a pose once she reached the table. \"What do you think of my outfit?\" She specifically stood in side profile as she stretched, her long deep blue hair cascading the small of her back, knowing that the impressive curve of her hip and rear would be undeniable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look, um, swell!\" Phineas said, suddenly nervous. Having debated his friends motivations last night, he had written off their potential of meaning to gain weight. He was happy to have the two girls as friends and classmates going into their penultimate year, and would rather not risk losing them as friends even if he had imagined them getting fatter a few times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in disbelief of this change in his friends, Phineas quickly looked back to his text on the properties of magical minerals to avoid gawking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, Azul looked to Ruby before taking a seat, displeased that her showing off didn't have the desired reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*oof*\" Ruby lowed herself into a seat gently, playing up her performance from the welcoming feast. \"I'm still feeling stuffed, I ate too much last night.\" She rubbed her stomach for emphasis and to relieve some pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Phineas grunted noncommittally, willing all of his effort to keep reading the classification of metallic alloys on the page of his textbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's what you get for overeating,\" Azul teased jokingly, although there was no malice among the conspirators to jointly sway Phineas Fortescue's heart. \"I may have lost last night but I'm feeling rather famished this morning. As you would say, Ruby, having a hearty breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas felt the sweat form on the back of his neck over the sounds of Azul loading up her plate with each type of food the breakfast table had to offer, as his eyes bored into the page he had not turned in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's hardly fair!\" Ruby said, making her own effort to build a breakfast plate even if her stomach complained about being full. \"You have such form and grace, Azul, and those good genetics that I'm sure anything you eat only settles in your lower half tastefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged,\" the de la Mar daughter grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meanwhile, I'm so stoutly built that everything just settles in the middle.\" Ruby was looking intently at Phineas now, trying to catch his eye, further kneading her taunt belly at the risk of having to belch again. \"I'd hardly be able to make it to my Practical Enchantments course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas, ready to explode internally and getting hard just at the odd recognition of was was said, suddenly bolted from his seat needing to find a cool spot to think before he embarrassed himself. \"Well, sorry to run, Ruby, Azul, see you all in Advanced Alchemy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed out of there carrying his books low to block a stiffie, leaving the girls to bemoan his obliviousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could he not react to anything?\" Azul sighed, forking her plate of eggs, sausage, toast and hash and eating in big bites out of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finny is hopeless when he gets stuck in his own head,\" Ruby said glumly, familiar with how Phineas exercised care to make sure his lustful looks towards the chunky females at the Citadel were hidden. \"Just teasing him with the talk isn't working, we'll have to hit him over the head with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Azul said after swallowing some grapefruit juice from a goblet. \"What classes do we all share this term? He'll have to notice eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Azul spent the rest of the breakfast topping off as they examined their schedules, plotting new ways to get Phineas to see the truth of their efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next phase of their plan took place in Advanced Alchemy in second period. Ruby and Azul deliberately directed Phineas towards a work station on the side of the classroom, next to a wall of cabinets and shelves stocked with materials the students used for alchemical coursework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how we aced Intermediate Alchemy last year together?\" Ruby beamed. \"We're unstoppable team because we know each other so well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite so,\" Azul continued, as the class broke out into groups for their first assignment. Phineas was practically pinned between the two beauties as they took seat on either side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul looked at their syllabus. \"Now let's begin: we'll first need a copy of <u>Restricted Processes For Improved Alchemical Redistribution</u> on the top shelf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it!\" Ruby loudly announced. The choice of student for the task was completely impractical. Shorter than the average, other students could easily reach the shelf where the texts for their grade of studies were kept by Ruby ended up falling short. She stretched and stretched with her arm, making a show of it, her plumped up midriff becoming bare as her clothes shifted, unable to cover her increased girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas was confused. \"Shouldn't I help you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Ruby announced, having worked the book off the high shelf with her fingers. She was breathing heavily, winking at Phineas as her belly grew out and in with each breath, having yet to tug down her vest as she took her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for the transmutation will need a block of marble and a lead plate, I can get that,\" Azul said. Sitting on the far side away from the supply cabinet, her getting up and brushing past Phineas and Ruby made even less sense than Ruby being tasked with the top shelf. The ingredients were in the bottom cabinet, causing Azul to stoop low to retrieve them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe act was a deliberate ploy to emphasize her expanded rear, as the twin cheeks of her lovely rounded bum tested the limits of her skirt. She risked bumping her butt into the faces of her friends. The other downside to reaching for the heavy base materials was that Azul, having a pampered life, didn't have as strong of muscle tone as Ruby's stout build. She struggled to lift the marble block and lead plate together, butt flexing with each failed attempt to right herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe just one at a time?\" Phineas suggested, his brain currently at critical confusion as to what had come over Azul and Ruby's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Azul breathed heavily, her dusky skin hiding the beads of sweat that had formed on her face from the exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she brushed past Ruby and Phineas to return to her seat, the two girls nearly squishing Phineas they were sitting so close. The rambunctious display of exhibitionism had failed to capture Phineas's attention again, as he hurried himself in the alchemy assignment after the materials were gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day proved fruitless. From trying to have Phineas get a feel for their bodies in a midday Dueling course, to playing up how hungry the schooling made them at lunch, to trying to explain what love Phineas had in his future during a Divination Symposium, nothing got through Phineas' thick skull that not only did his best friends have feelings for him, they also shared in his kink. By supper the girls were desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we just tell him?\" Ruby said after Phineas had failed to show for the evening meal. \"I mean, privately, of course. He's too nervous in public displays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul drummed her well manicured fingers on the table. \"If he's panicking at our teases, I don't know if he could take an outright declaration of love. Even if jointly presented. He'll probably not want to hurt either of our feelings.\" Phineas' lack for social graces and lack of self esteem were becoming hindrances for the girls' efforts. It would be torture keeping this up for an entire semester if Phineas never got the hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll have to step up our game,\" Azul suggested.</span></div></div>",

I think we both know that Finny doesn't like talking about himself. I think he's been denying what he really wants for so long that he's not sure how to talk about it. And I think it's important that he needs to figure out how to do that,\" Ruby said. \"I don't think trying to force an answer out of him is going to be healthy for any of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul let out a frustrated sigh. \"Ah, you're probably right. I guess I'm so used to having an easy solution for any problem at hand that I didn't really think there might not be one in this case. I guess we just have to keep at it. I mean, he's definitely interested. I saw his expression when you brushed up against him in Dueling this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby grinned and replied, \"He couldn't keep his eyes off your butt in Advanced Alchemy! It's like he was in a trance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a well-known fact that the butts of the de la Mar family have induced trances in many people. It's one of our most infamous family magics,\" Azul said in a faux-haughty tone. She was able to keep her serious expression for a few more minutes before it dissolved into giggles along with Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter catching her breath, Ruby said, \"Maybe we should lighten up a little on the teasing, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Azul conceded. \"But you know what we shouldn't lighten up on?\" As she spoke, Azul cast a minor teleportation spell, transporting a just-finished cheesecake from the Citadel Kitchens to the table near the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby stared at the confection for a moment, before looking back at Azul. \"You gotta show me how to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should,\" Azul responded. \"Because this one's all mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas decided that life was going okay for now. The first day of classes back at the Citadel had been kind of weird, but afterwards Ruby and Azul seemed to go back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not quite normal. While they definitely weren't doing so as much as they had on that first day back, there were instances in the day where one of them would do something... distracting. Phineas tried his best to be a gentleman, he really did! But when Azul leaned over in such a way that Phineas got an eyeful of her cleavage, or  Ruby used her hips to close a door due to her arms being full, it was hard not to be distracted! The weirdest part was when he caught one or both of them noticing him staring. He expected to be told off or slapped or <i>something</i>, but nothing ever came of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Azul nor Ruby had ever been the skinniest girls in his class. Even last year, they both had had eaten well, not subscribing to the diets that those students who wanted to lose weight went on. But this year, it was like they couldn't get enough. Hearty breakfasts, heavy lunches, seconds at dinnertime, and plenty of snacks to graze on when they studied, wether as a group or solo. And it was definitely starting show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's had always had a figure that the more polite students would call \"stout,\" and now it was beginning to round out. Her belly was acquiring more mass, though it could be hard to tell how big it naturally was sometimes due to the fact that Ruby was constantly stuffing herself. The real expansion was happening down below, with Ruby's enlarging hips, thighs, and butt giving her a pear shape. Not to say that the rest of her wasn't getting softer, but that wasn't where the main show was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul, meanwhile, was widening on both top and bottom. Phineas had overheard her talking to Ruby about needed to be fitted for a bigger bra, and her bustline definitely seemed to be expanding. At the same time, her hips were also getting wider and softer, giving her more of an hourglass shape. Like Ruby, her belly was usually kept full, but it didn't seem to be expanding at the same rate the redhead's was. It wouldn't be unfair to call her downright Rubenesque these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, Phineas was conflicted. The two of them were definitely getting fatter. They had to know, right? Except that there wasn't any of the usual complaining about gaining weight that Phineas had heard from most of his heavier classmates. In fact, they seemed... fine with it? Or were they just in denial? If they were, then it was Phineas's job as their friend to talk about it with them, wasn't it? Only, even someone with as little social grace as Phineas knew that asking a girl about her weight was not what one did. And then of course there was that more lustful part of him that wanted to see just how big his friends would get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot to think through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, things continued on as they had. Phineas, Ruby, and Azul continued working together in their classes. The girls continued to flirt with the confused young man, and continued to eat themselves bigger. And Phineas continued to be confused, wondering just what he was missing. This tenuous status quo finally changed during one of the last weekends of summer, when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all started on a Friday evening after dinner. Phineas, Ruby, and Azul had been studying for an exam they were going to have in their Alchemical Potioneering class next week for close to two hours, and the snacks that were now the a fixture girls' study sessions were starting to run low. This was all after an already tough week; their schoolwork was getting more difficult, the girls were getting more frustrated at Phineas's obliviousness, and Phineas was at a loss when trying to understand their behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ruby set down her textbook and groaned, \"That's it. I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul set her book aside too. \"Agreed. I don't think another hour of this is going to be helpful at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas was the last to put his down and said, \"Yeah, I guess that's enough for one night. But we've still got that project we need to do for Extraplanar Studies and that essay on river monsters for Supernatural Creatures.\" He winced when he heard his friends let out dejected sighs, and even he had to admit he was starting to get a little burned out. He glanced out a nearby window as the sky began to darken, the sun having already dipped below the horizon, and had an idea. \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" Azul asked after Phineas took a little too long to organize his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, if we could get all that stuff done tomorrow... then that means we'd have a free Sunday,\" Phineas said. \"The weather's supposed to be pretty good, I think. We could just hang out down by the lake or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A day by the beach, huh? How.. forward of you,\" Azul said with a smirk and a suggestive eyebrow waggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Phineas could get too distracted, Ruby interjected, \"It feels like its been ages since I've been swimming. I like this plan. Tomorrow's gonna suck, but we can handle it, can't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we definitely can!\" Phineas responded. Though, as it would turn out, Ruby's prediction was true. Saturday did indeed suck, since essay-writing had never been the strong suit of Phineas or Azul. Thankfully Ruby had gotten a knack for it (she'd qualified for her scholarship thanks in part to her writing skills), and with her help they managed to get the papers done without needing to resort to outright plagiarism (not that any of the three would stoop to something like that!). The rest of the day was spent on their group project for Extraplanar Studies. It wasn't complete by any means, but they'd made enough progress that they could justify taking a day off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday dawned with all three of the friends sleeping in and sharing a late brunch. Then it was back to Kunok to get changed, before they headed down to the lake. The official name for the body of water was Citadel Lake, although it was also often referred to as Challenge Lake or Conjure Lake. The story, as Phineas had heard it, was that few centuries back two rather talented students had challenged each other to see who could summon the best thing. Both had independently decided to summon a huge amount of water from one of the elemental planes, and the result had been the creation of a large lake in what had once been a valley. These days, the lake was one of the premier places for students from the nearby school to unwind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lakeshore was indeed crowded by Sunday afternoon, but it didn't take too much time for the three to find a semi-secluded spot under a big tree. The three set up a picnic blanket there, and with a snap of her fingers Azul caused a large spread of cheeses, crackers, salamis, small sandwiches, and even a few drinks to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, how do you do that?\" Ruby growled with a glare at Azul. \"I know you're using Tinsal's Timeless Transportation, but that spell only works if you know where the object you're going to teleport is going to be ahead of time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul merely gave Ruby a cheeky smile and bit into a sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe she already knows where the food is going to be,\" Phineas suggested. \"Maybe because someone's been letting her know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul's tried to keep her poker face up, but soon relented. \"All right, you got me. I did some favors for the kitchen staff a few years back, and in return when I ask them to they put some extra food on one table in the corner of the kitchen that I marked with a magic circle. Once it's there, I can bring it anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cheating!\" Ruby said in mock outrage, which lasted only long enough for her to begin eating a second sandwich (she'd eaten her first during Azul's explanation). Azul merely stuck out her tongue at the redhead before getting back to her lunch. Soon, the spread had been demolished, and the three spent some time just sitting and chatting about nothing in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Ruby declared that she wanted to go swimming and Azul agreed. The two removed the outer clothes they'd been wearing to reveal the swimsuits beneath. Phineas felt his mouth go dry, and he swallowed. Both Ruby and Azul were wearing bikinis (Ruby's in green and Azul's in red), and there was no denying just how large both of his friends had become. He found it impossible to tear his eyes away from their overripe curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so,\" Ruby said (trying to project confidence she didn't really feel at the moment), \"How do we look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... great. Stunning... uh...\" Phineas's brain was trying to kick itself back into gear, but it looked like his more lustful side wasn't going to let that happen anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he needs a minute,\" Azul murmured to Ruby, smiling. She then shouted, \"Join us in the water when you're ready, Finny!\" She then headed into the lake, her wide hips and backside swaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We'll be waiting!\" Ruby added, following Azul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas remained on the beachside for some time, trying desperately to do something. Anything! Unfortunately, the event that would prod him back into motion was not going to be pleasant, for Phineas or for the two girls secretly in love with him.</span></div></div>",

A few yards from the water's edge, Phineas was doing his best to remember to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind had paused to play out that heavenly image of his two best friends in their swimsuits since putting on some weight after the start of term. The moment he remembered the physique of one of his friends, the other silhouette would enter his mind's eye. Given his predilections, it was hard for him to subjectively say who wore their bikini the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, ruddy-skinned and stout framed, had her stomach and hips wide with her increased poundage. The simple, green bikini stood out against her freckled skin as the bottoms pinched her lower rolls. Her gut and thighs, acquiring most of her mass, now formed two rolls underneath her smaller but still swollen chest, the bikini tied off above the swell of her belly. Her gain was undeniable from the back view as well she wadded into the lake, her back ripples of fat and her broad, doughy rear testing the limits of her bottoms because of her thick legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul, black-skinned and blue-haired, had her red swimsuit as a sharp contrast to her usual color scheme. Her build could be considered the more conventional bikini babe, although rather outsized to other beach-goers. Her breasts had filled out tremendously and her ripe, juicy rear was inflated yet kept its signature de le Mar alluring shape. These exaggerated curves also had a potbelly between them, not as large as Ruby's of course, but a swell of a stomach that indicated that Azul's gain was not limited only to her hourglass curves. And the way her butt had bounced when she entered the water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery bulge, every shimmy was burned into Phineas' retinas as he sat there in heat, forgetting that the point to this excursion was the chance to swim and have fun after a busy week of classes at the Citadel. The exhibition of his friends, the two blimping beauties, had so overtaken Phineas he appeared unable to take the metaphorical and literal plunge into the lake to join them, affirming his feelings towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Phineas, Phineas...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad they said his name when they left to swim? Yes. His mental imagine of Ruby and Azul's plumped, natural beauty echoed his name as he lost himself to his delusions. Time seemed to rewind as he would track the wobble of their curves as they back-walked out of the lake, turning again towards him, then the scene of them heading off to swim would play out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Phineas! Phineas!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had the best friends in the world! It was as if a deep truth had been revealed, at once their intentions were made clear towards him. The bulging beauties, Ruby with her hefty appetite and Azul with her rubenesque padding, both gaining weight for their delight and his delight. Their figures had reached out, inviting him, the turn of their bodies where he could see every fold of new fat on the forms spun about. Their love towards him. Their eagerness to please him. Their abject terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PHINEAS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dual screams broke Phineas out of his trance. He had been sitting there, dazed by the weighty beauty of his friends, as he looked across the water to see that they were being attacked by a writhing mass of tentacles! The idyllic, waterside vision shattered as the illusion it was as Phineas came to realize that some sort of lake monster was attacking his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Not as good with his magic in a crisis, Phineas dug for his wand as he flung himself towards the waters edge to rescue his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the water's surface, like a mirror he could see the long reflection of Ruby and Azul in candid poses, burgeoning bulges taxing their bikinis. <i>\"Glad you finally joined us,\"</i> Azul said, blowing him a kiss. <i>\"It's been great swimming, showing off my results to you,\"</i> Ruby said, patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were fine? No, Phineas shook off another probe of the invasive mental force playing on his subconscious, now able to recognize the phenomena for what it was. In reality, the girls kicked and grappled with the aquatic limbs that were trying to drag them lower into the lake's depths, the tentacles connecting to a large, blind beast with baleen plates within its horrid mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas gasped, losing some air, as he recognized what the creature was after their extensive study binge the previous day. Having researched river monsters for his Creatures course, he identified the monster as a dwarf freshwater aboleth. The inland cousin to seawater aboleths, leviathans of the deep known to mentally snare the minds of sailors and drag people away to be tortured before they were consumed, minds first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let them go!</i> Phineas willed, swimming towards his friends and firing off an agonizing ray in hopes of causing the aboleth to drop one of the girls. The sting caught the creature on one tentacle, its horrid cry digging into Phineas' psyche like a razor, the underwater realm becoming a dizzying display of lakebed, fantasy, and swirling astral images as Phineas felt flung to another time and place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas bubbled another incantation, aiming to free the girls, feeling himself drown as he was assaulted on both the physical and mental planes by the aboleth's power. He couldn't give up. He couldn't let something bad happen to Ruby and Azul, now that he realized how much they truly meant to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phineas felt his consciousness draining, squeezed in one of the monster's many appendages, brought before that eyeless face that seared into his soul, he knew this could be the end. Struggle as he might, he didn't know how to save his friends. He nearly blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when the sea lion swam out of nowhere and thwacked the aboleth on the head with its tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas breathed deeply, getting a second wind, even though that should normally be impossible underwater as he was. His senses becoming clear, he felt the odd sensation of gills having grown on his neck, his body adjusting to underwater survival as he felt the aboleth's coarse mucus on his hand. Of course! Aboleth mucus would adapt its victims to an underwater existence for its continued abuse when dragging them away to their lairs. Phineas caught sight of the sea lion again as it launched itself at the aboleth like a torpedo. He could feel the psychic shock of the creature's cry as it was struck, the hit causing it to lose grip on Ruby. Seizing his chance, Phineas swam to catch his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unconscious, dead weight but her buoyancy from her body fat making it easy for Phineas to drag her in the water. He saw the sea lion attack the aboleth's main body, always too nimble for the monster to grasp. Taking advantage of this distraction, Phineas caught sight of the tentacle that held Azul and fired off another spell to sever that limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother piercing mental shriek. Phineas gritted his teeth, pushing to reach Azul so he could bring his friends to the surface. They crested out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad idea!\" Phineas wheezed, finding his aquatic mutation from the aboleth mucus making him unable to breathe air normally. Perhaps the girls were similarly affected. Unknowing, he kicked off and swam towards shore now that they were free of the creature. As the water shallowed, he could feel the oppressive wake of the aboleth subside until he felt his mind ultimately clear. Turning back, Phineas saw the creature had vanished, as mysteriously as it had arrived in the lake. 'Conjure Lake' indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas brought Ruby and Azul to the shoreline, keeping them in the water as his fears were confirmed. They too had been cursed by the aboleth, to return them to land would be a death sentence. How exactly were they to get out of this situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, the sea lion swam up next to them again, carrying in its mouth a hunk of the tentacle from the monster. Bopping it towards shore, the sea lion emerged onto land. To Phineas' astonishment, the animal morphed into a human form! A girl arched out of the sea lion's body, dingy blond hair cascading down her back. Her skin was pale with a slight tinge of grey. Phineas got an eyeful as she turned towards him. She looked to be the size of a sea lion herself with that blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat this,\" she proffered the flesh of the aboleth. Phineas, tearing his eyes away from her fuller figure, did so. The flesh was horrid, slimy, and disgusting. He felt the change occur over his body as he returned to normal, crawling onto the beach as he gasped for air. He turned back to the sea lion. Or girl? She looked like a Citadel student, clothed in nothing but the pelt of her animal form, as he was bewildered by this development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The aboleth flesh removes its curse,\" said the girl, in an accent Phineas had heard before. That puzzle was for another time, as Ruby and Azul had to be rescued as well. Forcing pieces of the flesh into their mouths in turn, Phineas forced them to chew the antidote. Azul returned to normal sputtering, only Ruby remained breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby! Ruby!\" Without thinking, Phineas leaned to put his lips to hers, giving her air and then pushing his hands under her chest. The life-saving maneuver caused her to cough up water. \"Ruby! Azul! Are you both okay?\" They muttered weak replies but they were okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you-\" Phineas turned to address their rescuer, although he just caught sight of the bulky, grey skinned blonde pull up the entirety of her pelt, again a sea lion as she swam off towards the other side of the lake. As Phineas helped the other girls to their feet, he realized who the girl was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Freja. A student a grade behind him he had seen about the school. And what she was he recalled now too, given her sea lion pelt. Phineas had never figured that a selkie attended the Citadel!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phineas sat in the waiting room outside of the infirmary, trying to get some work done but finding himself distracted. It was the morning after the incident at Citadel Lake. As he waited to see his two friends awake and well again, his mind couldn't help but wander back through the past 12 hours that had gotten him to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Freja had saved Phineas and his friends from being bound to the water by the aboleth's cursed mucus, he had managed to get the three of them to back to the school. There had been an alarm raised about a monster in the lake, but Phineas had been more concerned about any lasting damage the foul beast might have done to Ruby and Azul. It wasn't long before the three had been brought to the infirmary to be looked over by the skilled healers who worked there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prognosis looked optimistic, at least according to the cleric who had looked the three of them over. While the trauma the aboleth had inflicted upon their psyches had been severe, all of them would likely recover no worse for wear. Phineas had been cleared to return to Kunok Quarters for the evening, while Ruby and Azul had been required to stay in the infirmary overnight. The psychic attack on the girls' minds had been much more intense than what Phineas had experienced, and thus the healers had decided to keep them close to monitor their recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas had found sleep elusive after returning to his room. When he had fallen asleep, dreams of dark waters and his friends gasping for breath had woken him up. And that hadn't even been the strangest part of the night, because his mind soon began to wander towards odd ideas. Not unpleasant ones, but odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself sitting on a grassy plain he'd never seen before with Ruby. The redhead smiled at him, her brown eyes filled with an intense desire that Phineas couldn't look away from. Ruby closed her eyes, and leaned in towards him. Then he found himself by the sea with Azul, feeding the blue-haired witch a bunch of grapes like she was a Roman noblewoman. Azul reached up, grabbed his arm, and brought him to sit down by her, encouraging him to lean against her. Then he was below the waters of Citadel Lake again, looking at himself. Only he wasn't sure that the Phineas that he saw was really him; had he ever looked that determined and powerful in real life? He didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid that the visions were going to overwhelm him, Phineas had gotten up. Not sure what else to do, he went back to the research materials that the three had used to write up their papers on river monsters. He soon found a book that had an entry on aboleths, and looked it over. He felt himself freeze up for a moment after reading one particular part; if Freja hadn't been able to get the severed tentacle to them as quickly as she had, it was likely that none of them would have been able to leave the lake. Once the \"landbreather's curse\" had established itself in its victim, it was almost impossible to dispel. He supposed he'd have to track the selkie down and thank her properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued reading, he came upon something else that gave him pause. While a rare phenomenon, there were evidently some sorcerers who claimed that contact with an aboleth had awakened in them the potential to perform psychomancy, magic that could directly affect the mind. Skilled psychomancers could read minds and dominate the wills of their rivals, though the more benevolent of them used their magic to help others overcome trauma and recover lost memories. It was, like most magic, a discipline that could do both great good and great evil. And now Phineas might be able to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight was the keyword though. He'd have to do more research and maybe talk to some of his professors before he made that call. According to one text on the subject he dug out, it was easier to use psychomancy on those one had a deep emotional connection to. Which likely meant that the images he'd seen earlier had been taken from the minds of Ruby and Azul. It was thoughts about this first experience with psychomancy which ironically caused Phineas's mind to wander again like it had before. Soon, he came upon more ideas he'd never thought of before. A blue-haired woman who looked similar to Azul, hand on her belly and a radiant smile on his face. A sturdy-looking red-headed farmer, his eyes sparkling with pride as he watched his daughter get on a train to fulfill her potential. Azul staring longingly at Ruby before kissing her, their soft bodies pressing together-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas tore himself away from the thoughts. Where the heck had that last impression come from? Because, yes, he could admit to himself that he did find his two friends very attractive. But seeing them together like that was... it wasn't something that had ever occurred to him. So where had it come from? Feeling frazzled, Phineas decided to try and go to sleep again and figure it out in the morning. Thankfully, no more nightmares troubled his rest, though he didn't feel particularly well-rested when the sun rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick meal, he headed for the infirmary waiting room to meet Ruby and Azul as soon as the two girls were discharged. He definitely wanted to see them again, though he wasn't sure how exactly to broach the topic of his possible new affinity for psychic magic and the fact that he <i>might</i> have been reading their minds. Just a little. Still, he'd find a way. He was sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the door to the infirmary opened, and out walked Ruby and Azul. The two plump witches looked tired, but otherwise fine. Phineas got up to join them, still wondering how to bring up his new ability as he was engulfed in a group hug.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Summer was drawing to a close and with it came the talk of the fall curriculum at the Citadel. Not only the academics, of course, but naturally the talk about seasonal events. There were the harvest festivals, of course, the farms beyond the Citadel bringing a bountiful crop. The equinox would bring with it the time of year the veils of the living world and that of the dead would become thinner. Ghouls and ghosts and wicked magic were popular topics at the magical academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ruby and Azul's machinations, they were about to enter the big leagues. Yes, even for as big as they had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prospects of autumn didn't mean summer was over, though, and the last of the summer months decided to end on a scorcher. A heat wave not seen in over a decade. The old stones of the Citadel for all intents and purposes soaked up heat so that crossing a hall felt like a desert trek and classrooms became ovens. Glacial spells were swapped about and the pegasi from the stables had been trained to fly around the complex to drum up stronger air currents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the two bulging beauties, it was beastly hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo,\" Ruby wiped the sweat from her brow. \"These iced juices are the only thing keeping me cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul was focused on maintaining some concentration on the six hand fans she had levitated around her upper form, two trained solely on each prodigious breast. \"We should have waited until winter to gain extra weight. Curse another year of summer semester until we graduate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul said that but frozen treats had been the duo's main solution both to combat the heat and keep with increasing their figures. It was far to hot to shift into their fall/winter wardrobe. Which would need considerable alterations, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, already vertically challenged, had her fat plump out a massive backside and broadening hips, rounding out her overfed tummy. Her farmers' muscle had been covered by bulging curves, given her her a shape much like the dumplings she had take to eating as one of her favorite meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul was far less wide yet not to be considered that far behind Ruby in mass. Due to her family's phenotype, her signature bum had remained rounded and wobbly with more form than Ruby's lardy ass and thighs. Her rounded curves continued up from a smaller, yet thick gut to her enlarged breasts. Azul felt she was close to the upper echelons of bra size across the Citadel that included Chelsea Morgana, the girl with the largest breast size at the school. Thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul was keeping a scandalous amount of cleavage revealed in the privacy of her room with Ruby to radiate the excess heat of the weather that kept in her weighty breasts without fail, it would appear. Ruby, likewise, was finding her stockings stopped lower on the knee these days and her skirts weren't prepared for her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast,\" Ruby said, finding another button had broken off from where her shirt barely contained the swell of her stomach. \"Would you mind, Azul?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe task becoming far too routine, Azul let one of her fans fall from fanning orbit as she focused her magic to patch up the wayward button. As the two girls increased their poundage, quick magical fixes became the norm to deal with the inevitable results of them not fitting into their clothes. Jeans were patched, rips were sealed, and extra give to the fabric was charmed out in order to remain presentable at the school. It was obvious the two were larger, there was no denying that, but Azul kept them looking fresh and enchanting. Any day now Phineas would catch on to their wiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I can't do anything with my hair in this humidity,\" Azul groaned, her stunning blue locks frizzing out despite her best efforts at grooming. \"I hate the heat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But doesn't your family own an island in the Mediterranean?\" Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but the ocean is quite a heat sink. We always have a refreshing sea breeze cool off our home. This is stifling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling drenched,\" Ruby agreed, her sweat along choice parts of her fattened body making her shirt less opaque. A series of drying charms, spells and glamours got the pair feeling far more put together and attractive before they set out for their classes, well covered and dry. They were sure to give their mutual love an eyeful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar more than they bargained for in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of the most powerful magic is the cancellation and outright nullification of magic,\" explained their professor, the Chair on Wards &amp; Guards. \"These 'anti-magical' zones are paradoxically created by magic yet disrupt and prevent any magic from operating within their bounds. There are naturally occurring anti-magical areas and materials that ward off magic, yet powerful enough magic may even dispel these zones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To demonstrate you know the fundamentals of setting up such wards,\" the teacher continued, \"your practical test is to render these magical effects inert and then test the zones that no further magic can be cast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the chamber, localized spells spiraled in columns of scintillating sensory detail. Jets of colored flame harmlessly hit the ceiling, crackles of magical bolts pinwheeled inside narrow cylinders, and other such chaotic effects. Phineas, himself in rolled sleeves and the thinest pair of trouser he owned, was thankful that he, Ruby and Azul were assigned to a chilling geyser of strange liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is almost a shame to remove,\" Azul said, feeling some sweet relief from their magical pillar. Phineas stared with budding arousal as he watched Azul open the first fold of her coat. Her mighty breasts were two perky, blubbery balloons in her blazer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly, this is for the grade,\" Ruby said, although not before taking a laborious spin near the pillar of cold as if to cast off her excess heat. Phineas was amazed how Ruby's clothes maintained her blimping form, her great gut checked by a leather belt and her dress covering meaty thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYe gods was it great to watch Ruby and Azul pork up. Each passing week, once it had been established that they had continued growing since starting their penultimate year at the Citadel together, had been tantalizing for the closeted fat admirer to gaze at the blossoming of his two dear friends. Given how comfortable they appeared with it, he wanted to tell them they looked nice. Real nice. But therein lied the rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknowing of their mural agreement, Phineas wasn't sure which of his friends he should confess his feelings towards. Ruby, who was notoriously pudgy, had grown into a weighty pear, her stomach daring to contain larger and larger meals in the passing days. Charmingly rustic with a smattering of freckles and hair almost the color of her namesake gem, she was a diamond in the rough to Phineas' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Azul carried her newfound weight very shapely. Phineas constantly had to keep his gaze focused on Azul's face, as the dusky skinned, blue haired witch went up another bra size. She had become quite top-heavy, yet her bodacious booty remained as round and juicy as ever. He loved watching her coming from the front and leaving from behind, both of her best features the signature of whatever direction she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finny, are you with us?\" Ruby asked. Her loud voice brought Phineas out of his thoughts. The two were posed on two points of the space they were meant to set up the anti-magic ward, with Phineas' assistance to counter the present magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, of course,\" Phineas said, flustered, and his mind elsewhere as he tried to focus on their practical final. Which proved to create a cascading, unraveling effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do any of you feel a draft--?\" Ruby began, before she was a sharp ripping sound. \"GAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to properly focus the direction of the anti-magic ward, a small part of the spell they were to quash weakened as Ruby was caught within the zone. And with it, the magic used to maintain her outgrown clothes failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belt, a size too small, was wrought by the tension of her proper girth before it exploded off with a shower of buttons! As she moved to cover herself, her stumbling furthered the frayed cloth of her dress as it unwrapped around her tree-trunk legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby!\" Azul gasped, rushing to salvage her friend's dignity before thinking through the situation. She also stepped into the anti-magic zone, her own glamours undoing her taxed clothing. A sharp rip down her pants and underwear brought her dark skinned buns on display. Almost simultaneously, there was a mighty snap as her breasts burst forth free of shirt and ruined bra. Before she could help Ruby Azul found herself having to clutch her breasts, just in time to avoid a black nipple from showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense silence as the two girls stared at each other, and Phineas and the rest of the class all looked at them. The cascade of the failing cold surge of the dispelled magic had left what little clothes the pair had remaining drenched, leaving more plush, flabby skin exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the chorus of laughter and jeers, of the harsh authoritative voice of the instructor trying to quell the situation, reprimanding the trio for their failing. Getting out of the anti-magic zones, the half nude witches hastily tried to spell some proper coverings. The incident, regrettably, became the talk of the student body in the following periods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if anyone had noticed, Phineas had his own wardrobe malfunction in the form of soaked patches on his slacks, that hadn't been from the wayward spell, draped over a pinched tent.</span></div></div>",

The potion that makes the person who drinks it unable to lie for 24 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul nodded. \"I think that poor Finny has been so repressed all his life that the only way he'll admit what he really wants is if he is compelled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Ruby added, \"We can also drink some too, so that when we tell him he'll know that we're serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Risky,\" Azul mused.

Which is, admittedly, something of a sticking point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you <b>can</b> get some,\" Ruby pressed. \"Otherwise, why bring it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thing is,\" Azul said, her fingers drumming on her soft thighs (something Ruby recognized as a nervous tic of hers), \"To get some would mean having to make... a bargain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like, a Faustian deal? A deal with the devil?\" Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzul took in another death breath, and then responded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day after class, Azul headed over to a part of the Citadel most students called the Telepathy Tower. Most of the Citadel was warded against mental magic to keep the students inside safe from all manner of evil sorcerers and mind-reading monsters, but there also had to be a way for the families of the students sent to the school to keep in contact with them. Hence, one tower in the Citadel where telepathic messages could be sent and received. In fact, many of the sigils and enchantments on the building made it easier for students to mentally connect with whomever they wanted to talk to. So it wasn't long at all before Azul had made contact with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Cerulea de Panettone, Duchess of Milan, always did like going the extra mile when it came to her beloved little sister, and so instead of simply talking through a telepathy spell, she created an illusory image of herself in the private room Azul had reserved for the conversation. It was easy to see that the two were related, since they shared the same blue eyes, blue hair, dusky complexion, and curvy build that was emblematic of the de la Mar bloodline. Cerulea was a little taller than her younger sister and her eyes a little bigger. The main difference between the two at the moment was the pregnant swell of Cerulea's belly, the new duchess having recently reached the second trimester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation naturally began with the two sisters catching up. Azul talked about how her schooling was going while Cerulea mentioned some of the more irritating politics that she and her husband the Duke had needed to deal with, as well as an update on the state of her pregnancy. Eventually, the topic turned towards Azul's romantic plans, which Cerulea had helped her concoct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't told him yet. I... It's proving to be more difficult that I thought it would be,\" Azul confessed, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I've been where you are right now, Little Sister, and I remember being an anxious wreck before I was able to work things out with Antonio and Bernadette,\" Cerulea said, her voice soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, I also... I haven't been able to tell Ruby how I truly feel either,\" Azul continued. \"I know that without a doubt she's in love with Phineas, and I've been trying to find out if she might also be receptive to... me...\" The normally confident girl's voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's difficult, the kind of relationship you're trying to build,\" Cerulea said. \"But if you want it to work, you need to be honest with both of the people you love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honesty... That's a big reason why I called you, actually, Big Sister,\" Azul said. \"I was wondering if you might be able to help me get some of Tobias's Tincture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth serum? That seems rather extreme,\" Cerulea said with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only way I can think of to get Phineas to admit to what he really wants! He just... I know he's attracted to both Ruby and me, but I think he's so afraid of hurting us that he'll never make a move on his own! And... I think it's the only way Ruby will know that I'm just as serious about her, too,\" Azul explained. \"So... please! You said I could ask you if I needed anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Internationally regulated potions are a pretty big ask, Azul,\" Cerulea said. After taking a moment to gather her thoughts, she said, \"I... think I can persuade my dear husband to part with a single vial. But you're going to have to do a favor for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Azul answered. \"Name it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerula then explained what she needed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Azul's classmate Margot Francois, who had tried to woo the Duke of Milan and failed, had been sending continuous love letters to the Duke urging him to divorce Cerulea and marry her. Azul's mission was to make her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Azul needed to find a way to convince Phineas's father to agree to trade deal between his holdings and Milan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.)

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The namesake Citadel of the Citadel Prepatory Academy for Rites &amp; Sorcery was an immense fortress hidden away from the rest of the world. It had countless halls, courtyards and rooms. Many students warned against straying too far along less traveled hallways as it was very easy to get lost. The fortress was a boarding school, of course, providing every possible amenity to its students as they spent their formative years in one of the five dormitories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach dormitory selected its students from each incoming year. The process was vague, with contradictory explanations. All that was known was that by the time the students got off the locomotive in time for the Welcoming Festival, they had already been assigned to their dorms. Each dormitory banded together as a family of sorts, as they would compete with each other throughout the year in marks, sports and contests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach dormitory prided itself on its traits and accommodations. The dormitories were as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuanata Loft sported the wittiest, cleverest, and most imaginative students at the school. Those with the passions of learning and self-expression tended to make their way here in the cozy attic loft reaching towards the heavens. Their tastes were eclectic, as was the decor. Students with big dreams, new ideas, natural philosophers and those with an artistic eye made the loft a certainly eccentric place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrocklehurst Cellar was an ancillary building in the Citadel with erstwhile students. Ones that made plenty of effort and didn\u2019t take much credit for their efforts. Yet while none of the resident mages were stupid, there was the constant impression that \u2018problem\u2019 students ended up in the cellar. The reasons varied, from poor performance in one class, physical handicaps, or esoteric living arrangements needed as a result from obscure parentage. Wrocklehurst Cellar strived to make all welcome and had decidedly rustic architecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeldelvian Dungeon had a gothic and sometimes sinister reputation. Those with interests in the macabre side of magic and a killer fashion sense crowded the gloom of the darkest dungeons. Many cultivated a frightening personality to make an impression. Few were inherently evil in this dormitory, although the stereotype of being the strange and scary kids did little to foster a positive image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinixivue Tower championed have the best of the best. The most elite, the boldest, bravest and rising stars in the next generation of the magical world. The tower was one of the more imposing in the citadel, clade with opulence that spoke of past celebrities. It was a big name dormitory at the school, popular and prone to partying. Perhaps with a devil may care attitude, as many students of the dorm felt they could do no wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunok Quarters, unlike many of the other dormitories, did not boast over having better accommodations or better students. The dorms were practical, simple and functional above all, never letting flash and panache get in the way of school life. Kunok students tended to be self disciplined and very loyal neighbors, drawing accolades from their collective efforts rather than a number of individual standouts. You were never without a friend or assistance at Kunok, or so it was said. As welcoming as they were Kunok was not the dorm to cross, as they could be as hard and resolute with a grudge as the stones of their corridors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough students tended to be associated with their dormitory for the rest of their life at the Citadel, the school also encouraged dormitory exchange. The upperclassmen were able to live in a different dormitory for the year. This helped broaden horizons and also brought new perspectives to the next generation of magic folk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phineas Fortescue collected his luggage, he contemplated what the results of his dormitory exchange would be. He had been in Kunok Quarters since his first year at the Citadel. Unlike most of the dormitory he tended to keep to himself, staying out of the limelight. Phineas wasn't too sure about entering dormitory rotation. His family had suggested it, they thought it might help foster some ambition in him with a new outlook. Unlike his family's hopes, Phineas had a more dour outlook. Moving into a new dormitory would be such a change, he wasn't sure it would be for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust where was Phineas Fortescue going to room this year?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phineas\u2019 typical dour attitude turned towards the positive once he read the postings for the dormitory rotation at the gatehouse. There in the \u2018F\u2019s was his name listed as a move to Quanata Loft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the best news he could have heard! Phineas had always wanted to board in the lofty attic where witches and wizards of great intellect, witticism and whimsy had lived before. His more scholarly interests were in the dry, language and mathematical avenues of magical theory, subjects that seemed a shoe-in to the dormitory catered to the sharpest and brightest. When he spent his younger school years in Kunok Quarters, however, Phineas considered he didn\u2019t possess the other key characteristics seen in many residents of Quanata Loft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t consider himself creative or artistic by any means. It was enough to write an essay, rather than poetry or fiction, nor did he fancy the visual or musical arts, unlike the collective subset of Quanata Loft geniuses. He could appreciate art but any deeper emotions meant to be conveyed by the art were lost on him. This drive to innovate made the \u2018think tank\u2019 of Quanata Loft a source of the most inventive, ambitious minds of the next generation seeking to push the boundaries of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an individualist mindset in Quanata Loft, like a paradoxical pack of lone wolves, as many tended to be more outgoing than Phineas was. The true loaners of that dorm became eccentric in other ways, rumored to be mad and contrary to a fault. It boiled down to the lofty minded of the student body often had outlandish personalities, more personality than what Phineas had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Phineas hoped to find more of a niche for himself at Quanata Loft, compared to how he just blended into the background at Kunok Quarters. With this new optimism for his penultimate year of magical study, Phineas made his way to his transfer accommodations after his luggage was directed to the same destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas had only passed by the dorm briefly in his past years at the Citadel, although he paused to fully take in the entrance to his new residence. The steps up to the entrance were old polished oak with brass railings. There was a faint rumble of the grinding clocktower gears, as Quanta Loft was adjacent to the Citadel\u2019s great pentagonal-clock. Welcome banners had been put up along the twinned helix steps to the dorm\u2019s main door, each appeared to be hand made by current residents. A variety of colors and patterns could be seen. Gathering his courage, Phineas crossed the threshold into the dormitory he felt he might have excelled at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far more open than Phineas had expected. In the way that most halls of the Citadel were made as a regiment of stone rooms, blocked off by their walls, there was no further exterior wall within the high vaulted roof of the loft. Phineas could make out the highest reaches of the dorm\u2019s commons at their dizzying height, as each level was made on a \u2018skeletal\u2019 support structure of more wood and brass. A few beams of sunlight shown down from broken patches of shingles from the roof, adding to the glow of numerous candles, solar crystals and windows. The eclectically structured loft was dotted with bookshelves of thick tomes, display cases of strange gleaming contraptions, along with artistic decor in the form of murals, statues, and kinetic banners. Each balcony of the loft already had students milling about, catching up, although most were on the lower levels gathered to organize new students and greet each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Phineas could puzzle out the chaotic structure of Quanata Loft, he realized that no bathrooms or bedrooms could be seen, indicating that the more private rooms were along the interior of the elaborate loft\u2019s supports, thus out of sight. So he would have a quiet place to sleep, although some students could be seen hanging up hammocks along the public walkways. The outer tiers of the loft were arranged so that there would be at least two ways to look out towards other platforms of the loft. It sorta reminded Phineas of a treehouse, only if the \u2018treehouse\u2019 had been built within the entirety of a steep, spiralling Citadel roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was too much to take in at once, with the echoes of other student conversation and the myriad of structures and colors. Once he got his bearings, Phineas could see some other faces he had seen from his years of schooling. Including some he considered attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Cassandra Betteridge, a plump blonde with glasses and several quills and wands stuck in her hair. Witches of the Betteridge estate valued wit over vanity, so Cassandra cared little for her disheveled appearance compared to getting top marks. Another blonde, bubbly overachiever was Bella Lovejoy, chubby and wide hipped. She had a kind heart as sweet as the treats others got for her to thank her for her tutoring efforts, Phineas had gotten her help when they had shared a class last year and was smitten when she had eaten the entire blueberry pie he got for her in one sitting. In a crowd of people Phineas could make out the pasty white Misty Lune. A witch with albinism, a sharp intellect and flirtatious sense of humor, making jokes with a posse of friends, she was dressed in blues and lavender, enhancing her substantial chest on an otherwise thin frame. Another weighty chest was seen on May Tresfleur, one of the practicing druid Tresfleur sisters, whose clothing was woven from leaves and petals, a somewhat unusual sight for the attic dormitory but no more stand out than the rest of the colorful cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching sight of these beauties, Phineas smiled. Living in Quanata Loft this year was definitely going to be the best year of his life. He might actually strike up the nerve to get to know one of them better, rather than just watch from afar. Perhaps he would make his own worthwhile mark on the dorm, as the trappings of Quanata Loft spoke to the variety of witches, wizards and warlocks that had called this space home. However, there were more practical matters to attend to first. He had to settle into his new quarters, ready his schedule, and ease back into life at the Citadel. His fat admiration would have to take a back seat to schooling, as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that would be an \u2018average\u2019 year at the prestigious preparatory magical academy. It turned out that Phineas would find his chubby chasing tendencies on the upswing shortly after setting foot into his new dorm\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>You have been assigned to Wrocklehurst Cellar this year.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas had done his best to ignore the note he had been mailed in regards to his dormitory rotation results as best he could during the train ride to school. Still, it sat with a sour note in his head. The Cellar wasn\u2019t a horrible dormitory to have by any means. Recessed into the grounds underneath the Thaumaturgy Annex adjacent to the greenhouses, it looked like a charmingly rustic place to be. Hardworking, earnest students were known to collect there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Phineas, and for a select few in the Citadel, being \u2018transferred\u2019 to Wrocklehurst Cellar carried with it an edge of disappointment, of failed potential. Dropouts were rare at the school, a small number below the small percentage of expulsions, but Wrocklehurst Cellar had an outsiders\u2019 reputation of housing the problem students. Sometimes the dumb, sometimes the difficult, sometimes the...weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know why he had been assigned there this year, as he didn\u2019t consider himself that down to earth nor atypical of a student. He had above average marks in most of his subjects after all. However, a mild dislike to the boarding accommodations came from the Cellar\u2019s adjacency to the greenhouses, with the magical horticultural arts being his worst subject. Phineas was unfortunately a grade behind compared to most his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while he tried to find the positive in the situation, he couldn\u2019t help but notice the ivy growing down the weathered stone steps into the sunken cellar entrance framed by two glowing lanterns. That was another unusual thing, Wrocklehurst Cellar was the only dormitory to have its main entrance open out into the grounds. Or rather, dug into the grounds, Phineas supposed. Each other dorm was built between at least two other buildings, their residential access from public halls. Certainly there had to be some other access points to the Cellar for when the weather was poor? He\u2019d only be able to find out for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did\u2026?\u201d Phineas was caught off guard by the size of the door once he went down the outer steps to Wrocklehurst Cellar. What had appeared to be an average sized door was a trick of forced perspective. Few doors across the Citadel were 15 feet in height and this was one of them. In fact, Phineas noticed there was an average sized door built into the rightmost door within the oversized frame. He found it a puzzling detail. What dorm would need a door this large?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon properly entering the dormitory in question, it was altogether more quaint and pleasant than Phineas had expected. The dorm had an earthy, hearty sent like that of a well stocked larder. Warm colored hewn bricks framed each room and hallway as rounded alcoves that certainly brought to mind the dormitory had once been a cellar to age large barrels of mead and wine. For being underground is was very well lit from the recessed windows and greenhouse skylights overhead. Simple yet colorful cushions adorned communal sitting spaces and several potted plants hung from pots and half walls. Cheery music could be heard from somewhere, perhaps a student\u2019s wireless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe close connection to his least favorite subjects aside, Phineas found himself surprised at how comfortable a place Wrocklehurst Cellar appeared to look. Even his former Kunok Quarters, one of the plainest dormitories at the Citadel, carried its own image and pretentious for how student mages looked and acted. The Cellar looked rather unpretentious in that regard. He could tell from seeing the outgoing, friendly half of the Forsyth twins pass by; Faye Forsyth usually kept her hair short and dyed different colors to stand out from her twin Farah at Vinixivue Tower. For move-in day it was violet to match her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the more he saw as he navigated the recessed dorm, the more Phineas realized what sort of \u2018problem students\u2019 populated the dormitory. In the magical world non-human lineage was not that uncommon. Across the Citadel, each dorm carried its own share of witches, wizards and warlocks descended from the likes of vampires, trolls, elves, dwarves, tieflings and stranger things yet. Chalk up Wrocklehurst Cellar to house a disproportionate amount of those of strange lineage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a boy with scaly skin and sunken black eyes, another trailing an colored aura wherever he moved and other such oddballs. Phineas, however, found himself staring at some of the girls in particular. He couldn\u2019t help but stare, especially for ones he should have remembered seeing over the course of his previous schooling. Because there were a few that fit Phineas\u2019 predicilitions about the female form in ways he had never dreamt up until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne lanky, dingy hued girl with dishwater hair looked like a kind of merrow? Mermaid? Some sort of aquatic mix given the webbing on her bare feet and hands. There was a girl who was a half-giant, currently seated but obviously taller and bigger than the average human, with some meat on her bones to go for it. A trio of chubby hobbits passed by, giggling about some sort of private joke. Then Phineas saw a girl his own age with an absolute boulder-sized belly carried in front of her that caused him to blink several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust...huh?\u201d Phineas was beginning to feel rude. Everyone else in the dorm, especially those with more unusual features, greeted each other happily. Obviously, the Cellar brought with it a warm, accepting community of students no matter their troubles. Especially ones starting to drive Phineas\u2019 more basic instincts wild. Looking back to an alcove where several students shared a move in treat of cupcakes, Phineas saw that the girl with the boulder belly was eating a shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou new here, buddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice startled Phineas, as he turned on the spot wildly, catching his forehead on the wrong side of a hanging basket with a THONK to the head. \u201cOw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d said an older boy, a resident advisor. \u201cNicolas Crestwell, I\u2019m meant to get the younger years sorted but you looked to be lost. Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Phineas nursed his head. \u201cPhineas, Fortescue. I\u2019m here on dormitory rotation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see,\u201d the RA smiled. \u201cAny medical records of yours that had to be transferred from the hospital wing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon?\u201d Phineas asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it you\u2019re not a student in need of accommodations for your livelihood outside of the norm,\u201d he winked. \u201cWell, welcome to Wrocklehurst Cellar. Make yourself at home. Excuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas left to address a cluster of children, newly indoctrinated Citadel students as it were, a few of the young mages looking to be in the midsts of puberties Phineas had never fathomed. Growing hormonal attraction towards fat females and the mistimed exhibition of said arousal had been enough form him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDormitory rotation?\u201d Phineas found himself addressed by a new voice from another student introducing herself to him. He turned, finding that he was looking at one of the girls he had noticed earlier...</span></div></div>",

Or something more sinister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Phineas sound like a conspiratorial loon but sinister motives were not off the table when it came to the rumors and stereotypes of Meldevian Dungeon. Many of the students with dark personalities, gloomy outlooks, or lax views about questionable magic, congregated within the depths of the Citadel\u2019s lower floors. It was the lowest point underground the school complex, or so it was said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Phineas, he would have to go there despite his apprehensions. His personal effects would have been delivered to the dorm for safe-keeping and he would be required to check in before he could even begin the process of trying to appeal the decision to transfer to said dungeon. If there would be boarding elsewhere in the Citadel available at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnease filling the pit of his stomach, Phineas headed down towards Meldelvian Dungeon. Usually, the lower floors echoed along the stone walls as much as any other crowded corridor of the Citadel. Approaching the lone dormitory, however, that sound gave way to eerie stillness. Suits of armor made from brackish metals and gargoyles carved from stone lined the hall to a large, gothic door. Steeling his nerves, Phineas opened the door, wincing at the creak of the hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe initial view inside the dormitory certainly lived up to its name of a dungeon. Cold, slate bricks and bars built the walls and pillars of the dungeon, the ceiling arching high to honest to goodness stalactites from the ceiling. It should be a place of torture, that vibe was somehow still present, even though it had been converted into living quarters long ago during the Citadel\u2019s founding. Leather armchairs, low light lamps and black, silvery and dull hued furnishes populated the commons with the wings leading to other rooms. Animal skins covered the otherwise bare floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an odd mist in the air, the stalactites looked hazy with this condensation surrounding them. Phineas noticed this was due to the bubbling of a large fountain set back in the commons with a strange, foul looking liquid pouring out from it into a pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d A brusque, severe faced wizard older than Phineas brushed past him, not at all sorry. Phineas realized he had been blocking the entryway, muttering an apology to the other student that didn\u2019t give him a secondary glance. Supposing he better get this over with he made his way into the recessed floorplan of his new dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entirety of the decor carried gothic tones. Phineas noticed shelves of odd, pickled ingredients on the walls, more taxidermy in the form of hunting and fossilized trophies. Diagrams of arcane devices and sigils that gave sinister vibes were also seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were low murmurs of conversation from students gathered together around leather armchairs and sofas. The dorm wasn\u2019t quiet but the volume subdued, with a faint hint of an echo. Many dressed in black, neutral and dark shades of hue. Phineas felt more eyeballs staring at him then there probably were...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like every evil student at the Citadel Preparatory Academy lived here. Phineas knew that was too broad of a generalization. Being the loner and closeted fat admirer that he was, he didn\u2019t feel himself socially equipped to navigate this new environment in a dorm of gothic, counter-cultural and alternative views on the worst of magics permeated. He thought he heard a few giggles at his expense. He certainly didn\u2019t look like the typical Meldelvian Dungeon resident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApprehensions aside, Phineas eventually noticed a few names and faces he could put together from the girls residing in this dorm. One, Matilda Torenza, was a curvy latina punk with wavy hair who made a name for herself causing incidents during the welcoming festivities. Then there was the full figured, rounded white Lillith Zabala, a witch with albinism and a very macabre sense of humor, who stood out even among other Meldelvian Dungeon students. He also noticed the prim, poshly dressed Olivia Montague, a bit of an elitist with blonde-brown hair and a wide, flaring bottom. She was sitting next to Teresa Mignon, the scion of a famed linage of portioners. Teresa had the thinner figure of the two but a more lavish appetite, as she chewed on teacakes where the two looked up from Phineas' passing. That didn\u2019t account for a few other chubby girls he saw about, including one he considered had to be a tiefling on account of her colored skin, horns, and opaque eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas supposed he\u2019d have a few weightier beauties to fawn over from afar. He still felt like he was in the deep of it, out of his element in the lowest dungeon of the school. He honestly felt like he was transferred to this dormitory by mistake, although fate had conspired against him at this critical point of his schooling, as he found himself thrust into meeting his \u2018darkest desires\u2019 head on\u2026</span></div></div>",

He then walked over and sat down next to the person who had called him over. \"Hi. Long time no see, Charity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTieflings were people who had one of the fiends of the lower planes somewhere on their family tree. Some were lucky and could disguise the manifestations of their hellish heritage with proper clothing, makeup, or minor illusions. Charity Brightbell was not one of those lucky tieflings. Her skin was lavender, her eyes were solid red orbs, she had a pair of dark violet horns extending out of her forehead and curving back over her skull, and she had a tail for crying out loud! Her horns naturally kept her long black hair out of her face, which made her decision to tie it back into a low ponytail an easy one. She was also rather chubby, with a sizable bosom, belly, and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings a distinguished wizard of your pedigree down here with us freaks?\" Charity asked, her purple tail swishing lazily in the air behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I don't really know,\" Phineas answered. \"I'm trying to think about what might have prompted the move. I don't <b>think</b> I put the dungeons on my transfer request...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you really saved my ass when you helped me out with Magical Theory last year.

Thank you,\" Phineas said, feeling a little better about the situation he found himself in. Charity might look scary at first glance, but he knew she took her promises seriously. After a moment he looked around, realizing that Charity hadn't been sitting by herself before calling him over \"So, uh, who are your friends?\" he asked. Charity then proceeded to introduce the other two witches sitting near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a girl with pale skin and long black hair done up in a series of complicated braids. Her name was Mina Bloodraven, and she was a dhampyr, half-human and half-vampire. Mina appeared to be more interested in reading than in conversation, though Phineas could see her fangs when she opened her mouth to give a short introduction to herself. She dressed in an elegant red dress (Phineas thought the name of the style was gothic lolita?) and was rather petite, clearly the smallest of the three girls present. A part of Phineas couldn't help but wonder if a half-vampire could even get fat, and what that might look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl had pointed ears, obsidian-colored skin, and long silver-white hair that marked her as one of the underground-dwelling dark elves. Phineas had learned all about the elven wars in his history classes, and even though those conflicts had been over for years the dark elves were still generally mistrusted by most who lived on the surface. Della d'Waite seemed friendly enough, though Phineas got the sense she was holding something of her true self back. The dark elf was about as chubby as Charity was, though she tended towards a more hourglass distribution of her weight with enlarged breasts and hips rather then Charity's general bigness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Phineas's first day in Meldelvian Dungeon didn't go so badly. He actually thought he got along rather well with his unusual new dormmates. As it would turn out, these three girls, who many would consider to be monsters, would play a key role in the next major experience that Phineas had at the Citadel.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, classes began. As it turned out, Phineas shared his morning class, <i>Magical Theory V</i>, with Charity. The two walked over to the class while falling back into their old routine of bantering with each other. It was rather odd, Phineas reflected. With most other girls of Charity's size he'd be a mess, either stammering over his words or slobbering over their bodies. Somehow, he felt at ease with the tiefling girl in a way he didn't with most other people. His eyes would occasionally stop on Charity's round belly or bountiful breasts, but she either didn't notice or didn't care. He tried to keep such staring at a minimum anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two found some seats towards the back of the class, and got out everything they needed to learn. And then, Professor Natasha Nocturne walked into the classroom. The slavic witch had a severe expression, her blonde hair almost a platinum color neatly coming out from under her black pointy hat. She was also wearing a smart dark blue blazer which was tailored to her relatively petite upper half, and a black pencil skirt that covered her wide lower half. Phineas could almost literally feel Charity freeze in the seat beside him. Professor Nocturne had been their teacher for last year's magical theory class too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Phineas was honest with himself, he hadn't learned a whole lot from the Professor during last year's class. Sure, he'd been looking up front, but that was mainly because it was hard to look away from Professor Nocturne's wide bottom. He'd done well nonetheless because the theory of magic was honestly one of his favorite subjects in school. He was a scholar at heart, and reading about the various ideas that wizards had come up with about the nature of magic over the centuries was something he found legitimately fascinating. He picked up all the necessary lessons through bookwork alone, and thus was free to essentially zone out during class and not have to bother trying to listen to the Professor's lectures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity didn't have Phineas's same intuitive grasp of the subject matter, and had at first attempted to absorb it through Professor Nocturne's lessons. Sadly, the professor's lectures were considered to be some of the most boring in the entire school (Phineas had even heard a few professors gossiping about them when they thought no student had been listening to them), and Charity tended to learn better by hearing information rather than by reading it. Thus, her first few months in <i>Magical Theory IV</i> had been absolutely miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been when she'd been at risk of flunking the class entirely that Charity had approached Phineas and asked for his help. Knowing what he did about her now, Phineas realized that she'd essentially had to swallow her pride to ask anyone for help. He had agreed to help her, of course; Phineas had asked other students for help in classes he'd had trouble with, so how could he say no to someone doing the same for him? Plus, it had been a good excuse to spend some time with a girl he found rather attractive. It had been too late in the term to raise her grade any higher than middling at best, but Charity had taken \"not failing\" as a win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as Phineas glanced aside at his tiefling friend, he could see some nervous sweat appear on her brow and and her wide hips shift about in her seat. The young man didn't need to be a mind reader to feel the anxiety rolling off of Charity like some kind of aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it won't be so bad this time,\" Phineas whispered in what he hoped was a reassuring tone. \"I'll help translate her boringese into actual ideas for you from the start this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to do that,\" Charity whispered back, looking strait ahead to the front of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave Phineas pause. \"You don't want my help?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still haven't paid off my debt for last time,\" Charity responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas felt his brain stop for a moment. \"You haven't... Charity, I didn't help you last year because I was expecting some reward for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity looked like she wanted to say something back, but before she could a loud \"<b>A-hem!</b>\" could be heard from the front of the room. Both Phineas and Charity looked up to see Professor Nocturne giving them an annoyed look. The two mumbled out apologies, and settled into their seats as the class began. The first part was, of course, an introduction where the syllabus was passed out and the general shape of the class was laid out. But once she'd gotten that out of the way, the Professor decided she still had enough time to begin the first actual lesson of the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would normally be the part where Phineas would zone out and start looking around at some of his heftier classmates for the remainder of the class period, but his eyes found their way to Charity for a different reason. If he thought she'd looked anxious before, now Charity looked positively scared. She was taking notes and looking at what the professor was writing, but it looked like she was no closer to understanding what was being taught. Seeing her look so helpless solidified in Phineas's mind what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully enough, class was eventually over. The Professor left, and the other students left, and soon it was just Phineas and Charity packing up their last few possessions. Thankfully, Phineas finished first and managed to make it over to the doorway where he blocked Charity for leaving. She stopped in front of him, staring at him. Phineas was now feeling a little nervous himself. Charity was at least 50 pounds heavier than he was. While a lot of that mass came front fat and not muscle, Phineas had no doubt that Charity could bodily shove him out of the way if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, that wasn't what she did. \"Move, Fortescue,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you admit you need my help again,\" Phineas replied, standing his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you I'd be fine,\" Charity said, not able to meet his eyes as she repeated the obvious lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to spend half a bloody semester failing tests again?\" Phineas asked. That question seemed to get to Charity, and the tubby tiefling fell silent. \"Look,\" Phineas said after a moment, \"I get it. You don't like relying on anyone. But... I'm your friend, Charity. I <b>want</b> to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words seemed to make something in Charity break, and she lunged forward to grab Phineas into a hug. It was rather unexpected, and for a moment Phineas felt himself frozen before he hugged her back. He could hear her take in some deep, shuddering breaths; she'd evidently been a lot more anxious about this class than Phineas had realized. The two stayed that way for some time, giving Phineas some time to appreciate just how soft the tiefling was. Finally, they broke apart, Phineas pretending not to see Charity wipe at her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... Phineas,\" Charity said after composing herself. \"I guess I will need your help after all. I will make it all up to you. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't-\" Phineas began to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I will,\" Charity interrupted. \"One way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that this wasn't a debate that would end any time soon and that both he and Charity had other classes they needed to get to today, he decided to let the matter drop for now. As the two went their separate ways towards their different classes, Phineas began to wonder. Evidently, helping her for half a semester in magical theory last year was balanced out by her essentially being his bodyguard in the Meldelvian Dungeon this year. What was she going to do as payment for helping her out in magical theory this year?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it turned out, the hardest part of adjusting to life in the Meldelvian Dungeons was needing to relearn the directions to his classes. Phineas found more than once that his feet instinctively tried to take him back towards Kunok Quarters before remembering that he wasn't living there anymore. While he had been worried about the reputation of the kind of students who called the dungeons home during the school year, it turned out that they mostly left him alone. Though that was likely due to the friends he made during that fateful first evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it too early to start calling them friends? Phineas felt fairly certain he could call Charity a friend. She was much kinder than her demonic appearance suggested she should be, though she did have a habit of teasing him. He tried to give back as good as he got, and she always acknowledged when he'd scored a point in this odd game with good-natured cheer. The one thing about her that Phineas was still getting used to was how transactional-minded she could become. In Charity's world-view, nothing came for free. If you did something nice for her, she felt obligated to return the favor no matter what. Phineas didn't complain too much, since it was this sense of obligation that led to her befriending him in the first place, but it could get a little tiring if he wanted to try doing something nice for her just because he felt like it, only to lead her to do something for him because she felt she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina, he was a less sure about. The dhampyr was just so quiet all the time! Phineas felt like he could relate to wanting some time to oneself to destress, but he felt like he hadn't learned much more about her than he had the day they'd been introduced. She did converse with him or the others from time to time, but quite often he would find her with her nose stuck in a book. Sometimes the book was a textbook required for class, sometimes it was a romance novel, and one time Phineas was sure he saw her perusing a cookbook in the middle of class. Phineas supposed he'd just have to be patient with Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Della d'Waite. The busty dark elf turned out to be one of the most competitive people that Phineas had ever met. She liked to turn the most innocuous things into games. When she learned that she'd be sharing a spellwork class with Phineas, she'd taken it upon herself to declare him a rival of sorts. Each class became a race between them to see who could master the spell or charm that the teacher had set before them each week. While Phineas supposed having someone pushing him like that had made him work harder, he definitely felt more tired after each of those classes. On the other hand, Della's competitive tendencies could also be turned to more interesting ends. One evening, Phineas had managed to turn a question about favorite foods into an impromptu eating contest between Della and Charity (Mina had abstained, not wanting to get food stains on her novel). Charity had won, though Della had said something about having a gluttony demon as a great-something-grandmother had given her opponent an unfair advantage (Phineas had also resolved to look up gluttony demons later).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night after that particular incident, Phineas returned to the Meldelvian common room to find Charity and Della arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- not your decision to make!\" Charity growled, her tail lashing behind her in with aggressive whiplike motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't say that if you saw her face!\" Della replied, her fists balled in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas sidled up to Mina who was impassively enduring the argument while reading <i>An Orc in Bloom</i>. \"What's going on?\" Phineas asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina looked at him, then closed the book. \"Della and Tania ran into each other today,\" Mina said in her usual monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Phineas sighed. Tania Skyblossom was the daughter of wood elven nobility, and had carried her family's grudge against the dark elves with her into the Citadel. To call Della and Tania archenemies would not be an unfair assessment of their relationship thus far. \"And what was their confrontation about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tania and some of her friends signed up for a competition of some kind,\" Mina said with no further explanation. There was really none necessary. Based on his knowledge about Della's competitiveness and her relationship with Tania, Phineas had a good idea about what was going on. He then tuned back into the argument again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have told us!\" Charity said, her voice now much less heated. \"We're happy to help if you ask us, but just making a unilateral decision without even asking our opinion is <b>seriously</b> not cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess...\" Della murmured, before seeming to pick up steam again, \"But we can't back out now! We'd be laughed at for cowardice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may,\" Phineas interrupted, causing the two girls to look at him. \"What exactly has Della signed us up for?\"</span></div></div>",

He'd gone his whole school career without getting into a fight, and he liked that record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Brighteyes! Deep breaths!\" Della said (Brighteyes being the nickname she chose for him, on account of Phineas's dark eye color. She was weird like that.). The dark elf waited for Phineas to calm down a little before continuing. \"I admit, I may have been a little impulsive,\" she said (eliciting an amused snort from Charity), \"But I think we've actually got a real shot at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we?\" Charity asked, her question actually genuine rather than snarky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Brighteyes here have been rivals in Spellwork IV for weeks now,\" Della confidently replied, looping her arm around Phineas's shoulder and dragging him close to her. Phineas did his best to ignore how soft the side of her chest felt. \"He and I, we're always among the first to master a new curse or concept! Except for that pudding spell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Phineas responded, looking down at the ground. Both Charity and Mina looked at the two for some explanation, but none came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I know he's a little jumpy, but he's got talent!\" Della said, plowing over the awkward pause in the conversation like a charging bull. \"All we need to do is help him channel that talent into some proper dueling spells, and bam! Victory is ours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't possibly be that easy,\" Phineas muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think that! But!\" Della said, letting Phineas loose and heading over to Charity, puller her close in a side-hug similar to the one she'd used on Phineas, \"Cherry here is actually one of the best duelists in the school! She's learned how to do some of the somatic spell stuff with her tail! So while the enemy's looking at her hands, wondering what she's gonna do, she's hiding her whammy behind that big butt of hers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger than yours, skinny,\" Charity responded, knocking Della away from her with her hip. Phineas hoped his face wasn't as red as it felt at the talk of big butts. Thankfully, it seemed that he was being ignored as Della moved on to the last member of their little group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Min-Min!\" Della began, pulling Mina close to her in the same way she had Phineas and Charity. She then paused, seeming to realize something. \"Um... I've never, uh, actually seen you duel before... But I'm sure you'll be great!\" Phineas and Charity shot disbelieving stares at Della, while Mina continued to read her book as if they weren't even there. The dark elf let her arm drop from around Mina's shoulder and coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence among the four for a time, which got broken by an exasperated sigh from Charity. \"Look you two,\" she said, speaking to Phineas and Mina. \"I've known Del for a long time, and once she gets an idea like this in her head, it's hard to get it out. How about we head over to the practice fields and we can get an idea about what we need to work on. Worst comes to worst, we just won't show the day of if you're not really feeling it.\" Della began to protest at that, but backed off when the tubby tiefling shot her a red-eyed glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to save face, Della said, \"That... that sounds like a good idea! Let's go practice!\" Which was how the four found themselves heading towards the dueling practice grounds in one of the Citadel's many courtyards. It looked like quite a few students were taking the time to brush up on their skills. Phineas now found himself wishing that he hadn't spent those past weekends in his earlier school years avoiding going to the tournament to brush up on his studies. It would have been nice if he had a better idea about just what his new friends had roped him into. Well, he couldn't change the past; in the present, he'd see just how terrible he was at dueling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No sort of divinatory magic, astrological sign, horoscope, or winning lottery ticket could have indicated how lucky Phineas Fortescue was to board at Vinixivue Tower given this year\u2019s dormitory rotation results. It was quite the unexpected surprise for the lad going into his penultimate year of magic studies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinixive Tower was hard to miss. When it came to the skyline of the Citadel Preparatory Academy for Rites &amp; Sorcery, no tower was taller. Indeed, nor was any more ostentatious. A shining jewel of opulence at the wizarding school, a golden globe laced with rare magical minerals, its brilliant stained glass windows seemed to declare to the magical world at large that the best, brightest, bravest and boldest of the next magical generation earned their stripes here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, if you took credence of all of the Tower\u2019s grandiose image at face value. Phineas knew of a few noted noble families whose progeny called Vinixivue Tower home. House Fortescue was a long standing, storied family of similar prestige. Not the most blue-blooded or richest, when it came to politics within the great magical clans, but a populous house of many witches and wizards with notable accomplishments across all avenues of magic life. Such was the breadth of the family\u2019s past that none of the Fortescues had a \u2018default\u2019 dormitory to find lodging at during their years at the Citadel. That he hadn\u2019t landed at Vinixivue earlier was no demerit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Phineas was finding the ornate staircase up to the tower to be far too posh. Was there a word for that he hadn\u2019t used already regarding Vinixivue Tower? The marble laden steps were fenced by a golden bannister with silver-wrought ironwork as ornate as the gem encrusted stained glass windows encircling the tower. This brought Phineas to the landing, just in time to see a golden glass cage perpendicular to the dormitory entrance descend down the spiral steps, held up by nothing by skyhooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Phineas sighed. He had missed seeing the elevator. Even the other outlying dormitories by height or depth didn\u2019t have such options, although he supposed Vinixivue Tower was really high up in the Citadel, rivalled only by Quanata Loft. Passing through the old oak doors, Phineas himself in the dormitory he had least expected he would ever stay at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of the Tower\u2019s commons were quite palatial. High vaulted ceilings supported by elegantly sculpted columns showed the painted, slightly moving ceiling frescos over a posh, gilded accommodations. Fine furniture and velvety curtains separated rooms were elite snobs rubbed elbows and wide-eyed newcomer kid mages marveled at the gleaming trophies and view over the Citadel. Phineas initially felt small next to these hubristic rich kids, big name partiers and the ambitious, boundary looking sorts seeking to woo prestige worthy of their magical might by name, guile or charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost felt underdressed, seeing as most others were moving in with their finest clothes. Which seemed impractical to Phineas but then he had never thought he\u2019d wind up in a dorm where image was everything. It sure looked nice. And, as his mind started to wander and some warmth entered his nether regions, there were a smattering of fine, plush lovelies he was ogling as much as others would ogle exquisite art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his long time, from a distance crushes had been Margot Francois, of a very ancient noble family. Thick thighed since their intermediate school years, the thunder-thighed honey was far weighty than most of the campus\u2019 prettiest girls tended to be although no less beautiful for her curves. Her perfectly coiffed, blonde ringlets framed her rounding face, as her plumping middle sat in her silken dress, her great thighs spilling out from under the hem to her white stockings. Upon hearing a chorus of laughter, Phineas noticed another girl within a clique of friends. Chelsea Morgana turned a lot of heads on campus and she did not disappoint the image of seeing her in person. A witch with short, platinum blonde hair, she had the largest pair of breasts on campus. They almost looked comical inside her pink sweater, although several eyes followed Phineas\u2019 stare as her audience watched them bounce to her mirthful laughter from a joke, fitting her affectionately-derogatory nickname of 'Chesty' Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to feel hot under the collar, Phineas supposed he better get his affairs in order. Even though he had an unerring knack for noticing overweight girls at the school, he wasn\u2019t sure about his chances with girls that had been popular with the student body for most of their lives at the Citadel. Yet maybe arriving at Vinixivue Tower was the opportunity for something new? Perhaps he might even find his own boldness. Nevertheless, living at Vinixivue Tower was certainly going to be different!</span></div></div>",

So, he headed of to the boy's dorms, found the room that had his &amp; some other boy's name written on the door, and headed inside to unpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas whistled as he looked around. The room was actually a fair bit bigger than the accommodations he'd had back in Kunok Quarters, and the four-poster beds with their immaculate sheets looked comfier than the bed he'd slept on for the first years of his schooling. It looked like he was moving up in the world. He was about to start hanging up his clothes when he looked at his bed again. Sitting atop one of the pillows was a letter that had his name on it. Curious, Phineas picked the letter up and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message contained within the writing was rather strange. Evidently, the writer had pulled some strings to have him moved here from Kunok Quarters, and proposed a partnership of sorts. The writer would help Phineas move more easily in the elite social circles of Vinixvue Tower, in return for Phineas supporting them with a project of their own. Annoyingly, the writer hadn't really included any details about what the project was and what kind of support he'd be expected to provide. The whole thing seemed rather suspicious in Phineas's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was tempted to throw the letter away and forget he'd even seen it, but he decided to read through to the end. The big shock was when he saw the signature of the person who had written the message. Why the heck would a witch as influential as the writer think Phineas had anything to offer them? Why would they even have noticed him in the first place? Phineas would admit he thought that the person in question did have some rather alluring curves, but he thought he'd been careful about not staring too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Phineas knew he couldn't really turn the writer of the letter down. He'd heard plenty of rumors of what had happened to those who disregarded the whims of Vinixvue's most influential mages. Getting kicked out of the tower would be the least of his worries; he'd seen some students' lives become absolutely miserable. Phineas tried to suppress a groan; he'd not even been here one day, and already he was caught in the middle of the cutthroat political world of the Citadel's most illustrious dorm. Why couldn't he have gone to Quanata Loft?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought was derailed when he heard someone knock on the door to his room. \"It's open,\" Phineas said, expecting that it would be his roommate coming to get their side of the room set up. Thus, it was a surprise that the voice he heard spoke behind him was feminine rather than masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you read my letter,\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas spun around to see the form of the weighty witch who had gotten him into this mess.</span></div></div>",

He just hoped he'd be able to not entirely make a fool out of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargot Francois was a girl that Phineas had been crushing on for a long time. It wasn't just her curves, though they were rather enticing (especially in the dress she was wearing right now). There was no shortage of curvy girls in the Citadel. After he had figured out what he found attractive in a potential girlfriend, Phineas had thought that was all there was to it. But he'd come to realize that wasn't the whole story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat attracted Phineas to Margot over other girls in her weight class was her confidence. He'd been moving in the background for a long time, and Phineas had come to realize that most of the weightier women on campus hated their size. To them, it was an indication of weak willpower, a badge of shame that needed to be hid. There were others who were simply indifferent to their size, treating it like it was their hair color or height, something not to be worried about. But Margot Francois owned her body, her immensity, and reveled in it. Whether she was intimidating small students or speaking in public, Margot made sure that you couldn't ignore her. Sometimes, Phineas wished he could put himself out there the way Margot did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas then realized that while he had been thinking, his eyes had been looking at Margot's luscious legs. He quickly moved them up to the girl's eyes. There was a small smirk on her face, but she didn't address the faux pas. Phineas wondered if it might not have been better if she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What do you think of your new accommodations, Mr. Fortescue?\" Margot asked. Though her family was French, Margot spoke English without a hint of an accent, a testament to how thoroughly she had mastered the language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's good. Thank you,\" Phineas said, trying to keep calm. \"So... uh... what can I do for you, Miss Francois?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargot's smile widened. \"I'm <b>so</b> glad you asked that.\"</span></div></div>",

There was no way that <b>she'd</b> noticed him, was there? But then he turned around, and it was indeed Tania Skyblossom there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTania was rather famous for being the first wood elven princess to attend the Citadel. For centuries, the elven kingdom had kept itself isolated from the rest of the world. But after its wars against the dark elves, the wood elves had emerged to try and create closer ties to some of the human nations. One of the ways they attempted to foster this relationship was to send one of the princesses of the wood elf kingdom to the most premiere human magic school in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid Princess's face was bright and cheery, with big eyes the color of the afternoon sky. Her cherry blossom-pink hair fell down from her head in waves, kept out of her face by an expertly-crafted circlet. It was out of the pink cascade that Tania's pointed ears, the most obvious indicators of her heritage, poked out. From the neck up, Tania looked like the perfect elven princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one went down... well. Tania had started out her schooling with the lithe frame that most elves were known for, but years upon years of human food had greatly added onto it. Added in interesting ways, Phineas thought; she had a rather sizable chest, a wide set of hips, and a waist that was narrower then both, though it couldn't be called narrow in a literal sense. Tania's hourglass shape was usually on display too, since she favored elven clothing which tended to be skimpier then the styles favored by humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Pixie got your tongue?\" Tania asked with a giggle, making Phineas realize he'd been staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. I mean, I read your letter. I'm just wondering what I did for such kindness,\" Phineas responded. Maybe he was laying it on a little thick, but he figured when dealing with royalty that too much respect was better than too little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been observing you for a while, actually,\" Tania said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... have?\" Phineas asked, feeling a sinking pit in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I have a problem I think you can help me with,\" Tania answered.</span></div></div>",

Bolka Goldhammer was a dwarf, standing at around four-and-a-half feet tall. She had hair the color of a cardinal's feathers, done up in a series of elaborate braids, and slate-grey eyes. Her frame was stocky and solid, as most dwarves tended to have. Hers was rather softer than the typical dwarf's was though, and she sported a potbelly that she didn't really bother to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" Phineas said in response to Bolka's statement. \"What can I do for you, Miss Goldhammer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop the 'Miss Goldhammer' crap, Phineas. My name's Bolka. Use it,\" Bolka said, somewhat irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course. What do you need, Bolka?\" Phineas asked, trying to puzzle the answer out for himself before Bolka answered. From what he recalled in his history classes, the dwarves were split up into a number of clans that vied for money and territory. The Goldhammer Clan was obviously one of the most successful, since Bolka had been considered eligible for Vinixvue Tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might not know this, but I wasn't always living up here in the sky,\" Bolka explained. Phineas nodded; he now remembered that at one point, she'd lived in the Meldelvian Dungeon. \"I got moved up here last year, and it's been miserable. All the people up her have their clans... er, cliques, would be a better word, I guess? Well, there's not a lot of room for a newcomer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you need allies, then?\" Phineas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart lad. Got it in one!\" Bolka said, smiling. \"It won't be so bad with us looking out for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just us two?\" Phineas asked, wondering if this was the start of something wonderful or something terrible. Probably both at the same time, considering his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolka shot Phineas an odd look, but then responded to his question.</span></div></div>",

He must have missed the cutoff date to apply for the dormitory transfer, much as he had last year. Only then it had been family pressuring him to better his prospects. This time Phineas had actually considered he might do with a change. There were wild, elaborate stories about how some of the students lived at the Citadel's other dormitories, quite the change of pace to an otherwise unremarkable wizard with a fat fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't a slight against staying at Kunok Quarters by any means. They were perfectly fine dorms, although a tad 'average' compared to the eclectic mix of types in the premier magical academy. That was according to the dorm's detractors, although those who flocked to Kunok Quarters weren't picked for udders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the community fostered at the long building of student housing suites saw its orderly design and basic fulfillment of needs as a strength. The Citadel Academy was a boarding school, after all, and with education as diverse and chaotic as the magical arts could get, there was something to be said for having the quiet comforts of home to retire to after a day of classes. Other dorms claimed to have the cleverest, the slyest, the most accommodating, or the boldest of their generation. At Kunok Quarters age, background, disposition towards magic and expertise hardly mattered. Your magic proved how could of a witch or wizard you were, so the students of the dorm banded together with neighborly friendships, at the very least as positive acquaintances, rather than relationships built solely on their dormitory's image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wings of the building that housed Kunok Quarters, stretched between the main assembly courtyard the Citadel's array of temples to various deities of magic, were patterned over a familiar template framed in stone and timber. Student bedrooms were often shared with private commons for dorm mates, with public gathering halls in-between. Most floors had balcony access on one side. The furnishings were plain, functional and meant to be a solid foundation as students focused on their magical studies. Kunok Quarters was strategically located as close tot eh center of the Citadel campus as possible, making it easy to reach any class building and other hotspots in the complex. It didn't take long to walk down to Challenge Lake, for example, or to access the Great Hall, Gatehouse, Hospital Wing or Mail Office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phineas approached the dorm he could hear excited conversation, the crackle of magical sparks or firecrackers, and music played on those talented with instruments. The dormitory was at its liveliest during holidays and special events, such as competitors between the dorms. Welcoming day was no exception. He offered himself a small smile knowing that he'd be returning to a well worn niche at the school. Not the most stupendous but perfectly acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finishing his checking in during his return to Kunok Quarters, however, that showed Phineas that his year was going to decidedly be unlike his previous years of schooling at the Citadel.</span></div></div>",

It introduced students to the wonders of life at the ancient magical fortress. In many ways it was the last chance for fun before the serious approach to studies was enforced by the teaching staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all the Welcoming Festival was quite compact. It lasted from the time students arrived on the locomotive to an official cutoff point of about 10 pm (22 hrs) although several students had their own ideas for festivities that could easily last until midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Citadel did not disappoint during a party. There was a grand feast, the first big meal of the year. There were numerous displays and marvels, from swarms of trained bats to choirs of nymphs, performing ghosts, dancing skeletons and other such supernatural entourages. In the center pavilion there would be tents with demonstrations as to the varied courses in magic the Citadel offered. Student leaders also had booths for various student organizations and clubs. New students were typically lead into icebreaker games at whichever of the five dormitories they had been assigned. The festivities were closed off by a spectacular fireworks show at 22 hrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the more rambunctious students had their own plans for the Welcoming Festival, activities that were never effectively quashed. Smuggling in booze was quite common, the magical world having several strange and potent brews. Those longing in their freedoms would sneak into unauthorized areas or plan elaborate pranks against a disliked teacher or student. Some would try to find a private area for impromptu make out sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Phineas Fortescue knew was that the Welcoming Festival was loud. It wasn't a celebration one could sit out (he'd tried before) as the noise and atmosphere from the event permeated the whole Citadel. Anyone hoping for a slow progression into academy life or someone as introverted as Phineas wasn't going to find much of interest in the various distractions of the Welcoming Festival. At its worst, all the hullabaloo was just annoying to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into his penultimate year at the Citadel, however, Phineas had finally settled on the notion of not trying to fight the festivities. True, the Welcoming Festival was not his cup of tea but this was one of his last festivals. Perhaps this outlook was a sign that Phineas was finally coming out of his shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does Phineas try next? </span></div></div>",

It was more crowded and noisy than he was really comfortable with, but he reminded himself that he was going to try and be a little more social this year. So he spent some time looking at the demos and striking up conversations with some of his fellow students. Nothing went beyond the surface-level niceties, but it was still progress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Phineas decided to try some of the games. He actually did fairly well at one of the target-shooting stalls where participants fired colored lights out of a provided wand. He was awarded with a few tickets that he was told he could redeem at one of the other tents for various prizes. He didn't fare so well at a quiz game, though the chubby witch who won it hadn't really had any competition anyway. He played a few more games in this way, ending up with a respectable number of tickets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut games weren't the real reason he'd come this way. One corner of the pavilion had been set aside for the various student-run clubs to recruit new members, and it was proving to be one of the busiest places in the festival. Phineas recalled avoiding this part of the festival in his earlier years for precisely that reason; so many voices all chattering at once were likely to give him a headache. Still, he had to persevere. So he steeled himself, and started looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student government booth was the biggest booth around, and was covered in posters extolling the value of the organization. Well, not entirely, seeing as there were going to be student council elections fairly soon, which meant that many of the posters were extolling the values of the various candidates for President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer. It seemed like a lot of work to Phineas, but being a part of student government might be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other big booth belonged to the Spellball team. Phineas knew the sport was a fairly popular one among his peers, though he wasn't exactly a big sports fan himself. If he remembered correctly, the most important rule of spellball was that the players weren't actually allowed to physically touch the ball with their bodies. He'd watched spellball games a few times, and dizzying array of different magics that players used during play could get confusing. Still, he might end up having some talent, and being a sports star might help if he wanted to try getting a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond those two were booths for many other clubs. It seemed like there was a club for everything at the Citadel. There was a dueling club, a chess club, a theater club, even a club devoted to magical baking. But while some students seemed to be able to juggle two or three clubs and their grades simultaneously, Phineas knew that he wasn't one of those students. No, he was going to join one club so that he'd be able to keep up with everything. It took him some time to work through which organization he wanted to join, but before the end of the night he made his choice about which organization he wanted to join.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phineas slowly felt his mind stir. His eyes were closed as he was splayed out on the bed. It was a comfortable, cozy feeling, rising out of sleep without a care in the world. His dreams were a slurry that he couldn't decipher with a half awake mind but something had felt good about them. He shifted, his arms reaching out into the cushions. The surface was warm and fleshy under the cloth, jiggling from his touch, and he gave it a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmmm...\" a pleasurable moan came from the other occupant of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline jolted Phineas awake as his eyes shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't his room. This wasn't his bed! He tilted his head furtively, looking from side to side. Under the sheets two massive forms sandwiched him in the middle of the bed. He heard snoring. To his right was the rising stomach of a rather fat girl. Phineas was stunned, feeling himself grow hot and it wasn't from the covers. He'd dreamed about putting forward the effort to talk to one of the fat, weighty women of his affections and here he was, impossibly waking beside one. He had to pinch himself to see if he was still dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother low moan of ecstasy escaped from his left side bedmate. He had forgotten where his hand had strayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas was waking up in bed next to two fat beauties!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning',\" came the purr from his left. Phineas was face to face with a round, freckled face framed by auburn hair and adorned with sparkling green eyes. A girl about his age smiled at him, peeling herself free from the bedsheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock in face continued as Phineas found his eyes looking down the length of her horizontal body. While her face was round not too much of her was out of proportion...until he saw her wide, fat thighs spilling out of her white nightdress, each thigh as thick as his waist. They were as freckled as her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, revealing a slight gap in her teeth. \"Gosh, you look more frightened than pixie about to be eaten by a bugbear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-h-h-h...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, even though this was exactly where Phineas wanted to be he felt very uncomfortable. He backed up, wanting to put more appropriate distance between him and the thick thighed godiva in the bed, forgetting about the other occupant that had him trapped on the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large bellied behemoth snorted awake. \"Huh? That you Siv?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No silly,\" said the freckled, leg heavy girl Phineas had squeezed in his sleep, presumably Siv. \"It's our new friend, Maeve, he's all flustered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cutie?\" Maeve turned over, catching Phineas off guard. Maeve had big lips, blue eyes and a small mole just off her chin, framed by sandy brown hair. She probably had fifty or so pounds on Siv, mostly resting in her middle. \"You're still here! Last night was so much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Last N-Night??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas had completely blacked out about last night. He recalled getting off the train upon arrival at the Citadel. The welcoming festivities had been underway...but he couldn't remember anything else. What was he doing in a bed shared by two other, if very attractive, weighty girls? Suddenly Phineas realized himself, finding that he thankfully had slept in his uniform but it was in disarray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here,\" Maeve continued, rolling over with an arm outstretched to hug Phineas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever destiny had gotten Phineas into this situation failed him now that he was back to his senses as he tried to scramble back, hoisting himself upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't crush him, Maeve,\" Siv chided, \"you're scaring him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm t-terribly sorry,\" Phineas tried to begin, mind racing as he tried to make sense of the whole affair. Caught off balance, both mentally and physically, he felt himself teeter as he tried to step over Siv and found himself instead falling over her and off the bed, the floor rushing up to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the landing was soft. Not only from the carpet, as Phineas had landed face first into a perfectly pliable, peach shaped bum of someone passed out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up!\" came a singsongy voice that soon faltered. \"Ooo dear, I've had too much to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas scrambled up. The broad, lovely shaped bum shifted to reveal the blonde that blinked his direction. \"Who are you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiv giggled from the bed, before helping Phineas sit up with a pair of strong yet soft hands. \"Calliope, honestly, you were the first to meet him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh ho ho~,\" Calliope turned, leaning in far too close as Phineas realized she was half dressed in the Citadel's uniform and a pair of pale yellow tights. Her skin was bronze and her teeth gleaming white. Her voice carried that musical quality again. \"The Phinery, right? Phin-phin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phin-phin?\" Phineas mouthed, worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Siv, you've had too much time to cuddle with him,\" the hefty Maeve complained, dressed in a red bathrobe now that she emerged from the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuddle?\" Phineas felt the blood drain from his face as every impossible fantasy he'd had in his years of coming to this school went off in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help it that the draining blood decided to enter a certain other body part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" Calliope, the bottom heavy blonde, put a hand to her lips as she looked down. Phineas followed suit and quickly flung his hands to cover his arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the bedroom door. \"Ladies, aren't you up yet? Gods, I had way too much to eat last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fourth girl entered the room. She had long black hair trailing down her back and sultry, heavily makeup'd eyes. Unlike the rest she was dressed but not in the school uniform. Her blouse was loose and her slacks unbuttoned for good reason. Her hands cradled a burgeoning potbelly from her otherwise slender frame. \"I can't go to classes looking like...\" She caught sight of Phineas, staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gird?\" Said Siv, the playfulness in her voice dropping into concern. \"Oh no, class! I have a full morning of druid rituals!\" The freckled, thick-thighed honey jumped out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo!\" said Maeve, as her stomach rumbled. \"Please tell me the morning back breakfast will be as good as the feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm due back for my apprenticeship,\" said Calliope, groaning, \"but last night was so much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGird, the black haired newcomer, stifled a belch. \"Gotta admit, Fortescue, I always thought you were too much of a dud.\" She flashed him a brief smile before turning serious. \"But I think it's best if you don't say anything more about what all happened yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" Phineas said. What in the hells had happened yesterday? He couldn't have loose lips about events he couldn't personally remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of the three large ladies and the potbelly vixen getting themselves ready for the first lessons back at the Citadel, Siv paused as she looked at Phineas's bewildered confusion. \"Wait. Do you not remember what happened last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas froze.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At Siv's question, all four of the girls stared directly at Phineas. This unbelievable dream would turn into a nightmare if Phineas admitted he couldn't really remember how he had wound up sharing a bed with two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night?\" Phineas replied, thinking fast. \"Of course. Well, mostly, I've got a bit of a headache actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing,\" Siv said, feeling his forehead, as Phineas stared into her eyes to avoid looking down at the heft of her thighs as she knelt beside him. \"The drinks were my and Gird's idea, I'm sure we're all a little hungover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The drinks, yeah,\" Phineas caught on, \"I'm honestly not much of a drinker.\" Truthfully, Phineas had never had more than the occasional wine if at a fancy meal, he had never fancied the taste of alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all weak-livered!\" Maeve chuckled, heaving herself up from the bed. \"Still, not unexpected when you decide to cross mugs with a cleric of the Divine Harvester.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDivine Harvester? Phineas wasn't as versed on his religions, although several divine domains had their respective temples about the Citadel for the purposes of instructing their followers. He remembered there was a goddess of food and drink but the name escaped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think that prank of yours almost backfired,\" Calliope said. \"Has anyone seen my flute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prank?\" a new mystery caught Phineas off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Gird said, waving her hand as a magical portal briefly appeared in the air as a silvery flute passed out of it, as she handed it to Calliope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Calliope smiled. \"Although I'm glad to have met you, Phinny, you've got a raw but lovely tenor voice that could do with some training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks,\" Phineas said. He had been singing, too?? Phineas could understand music theory well enough, he had never fostered the talent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although sneaking up to the south tower roof was a better spot to view the fireworks from,\" Siv said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, enough chit-chat,\" Gird said. With a clap of her hands a crackle of eldritch fire appeared above them, with a winged impish quasit appearing in the flames. \"Ready my Enchanting Workbench,\" she instructed, and the quasit disappeared. She prodded her stomach. \"This belly is a little more problematic, do we have any bloat-away potion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There might be some in the bathroom,\" Calliope said. \"Gosh, I have to tune my lute today too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeve heaved a heavy sigh. \"And there's morning rituals for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right, today was the first day of classes at the Citadel. Phineas felt almost forgotten as the girls hurried about the business. \"So, the four of you are roommates, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Siv said, opening the window. With a soft gesture she encouraged the vines outside on the castle walls to blossom into small flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just, uh, surprising I guess given your various magical aptitudes.\" Through observation and brief explanation, Phineas learned that the four students focused on the clerical, druidic, bardic and summoning branches of magic. That is to say, Maeve channeled her faith with her goddess into divine miracles; Siv was greatly attuned to the natural world with reverence; Calliope practiced how magic was much like music, it had patterns and improvisation; and Gird focused on the aspects of reality, summoning verges and aid from other realms of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your expertise, Phinny?\" Calliope asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing in particular, I guess I'm more scholarly,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, maybe we can meet up for some study groups, I'm quite lousy on my history--\" Calliope trailed off, the situation dawning on her. \"Wait, you're still here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" and then the same concern dawned on Phineas. \"It's been great meeting you all, but how do I get out of here unnoticed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four student witches paused. \"We didn't actually think of that,\" Maeve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, where are we?\" Phineas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Kunok Quarters,\" Siv said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas let out a whistle. \"*phew*, that simplifies matters I guess. I belong in the boys' dorms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral ideas for how to help Phineas leave unnoticed came up, from having him crawl along the window ledge, turn him invisible, turn him into a frog or such to smuggle him out, use a broom, all ideas quickly shot down as they grew more and more ludicrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How good are you with tight spaces,\" Gird asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not claustrophobic, if that's what you're asking,\" Phineas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me, you have to promise me you won't say anything about this,\" Gird said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And promise you'll stay in touch with us!\" Maeve said. Phineas had managed to skate out of there with his neck intact, fancied by each of the girls as much as he was intrigued by them, yet still horribly confused as to how he got into this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGird led him into the girl's shared living room, crossing to a curtained closet. \"I've got a traveling trunk,\" she said, parting the curtain to reveal a large box chest. \"It's how we've been sneaking things inside the Citadel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right,\" Phineas mouthed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got another one that's still housed in receiving luggage by the gatehouse,\" Gird explained, \"so that gets you outside the doors where you'll draw less attention. That sound okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, um, thanks again,\" Phineas said. Compared to how he felt this morning, lying down in a magical trunk was the least awkward and unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfectly harmless,\" Gird said before she shut him in, giving Phineas a wink. \"Catch you later sometime, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Phineas said. The lid closed and he was plunged into momentary darkness, enough to hear Gird call out <i>\"Can I borrow a corset--\"</i> before he was transported into a different trunk interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas cracked open the lid, finding this trunked wedged onto a shelve with several other pieces of luggage, but with enough room for him to squeeze out. The ploy had worked. As he snuck his way out of the gatehouse, Phineas tried to make sense of all that must have happened during the Welcoming Feast. This was a far different start to the year compared to his previous years of magic schooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Phineas could only piece out some of the details of what had transpired during the night of the welcoming feast. Maybe if he got closer to one of the girls, he could get a more direct account. Each of the roommates were rather nice, and had helped him sneak out of their dorm without notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where there was a break after classes, Phineas went to see...</span></div></div>",

Urg-ent message for Phineas Fortescue!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's me,\" Phineas waved down the Citadel messenger. He was promptly given a rolled up parchment by the strange little imp who immediately began calling out another message. Phineas no longer paid attention to the imp's cry. He held the parchment nervously, unsure about opening it. He couldn't recall having done anything to get himself in trouble with the school authorities. If there had been a previous need for correspondence he would have received it at home over the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalking at the rolled up message wasn't going to get Phineas anywhere. Hesitantly, he unfurled the message and began reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"Dear Mr. Phineas Fortescue,<br>\r\nThe Citadel Academy for Rites &amp; Sorcery is pleased to inform you that your scholarship has been selected for advancement into apprentice studies. You are check in at administration for any changes in accommodations, and then report to your--\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas took big gulps of air in surprise, going back to reread over the first few sentences again. He'd been made an apprentice?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Citadel shepherded students through eight years of magical education, with Phineas entering his penultimate or second to last. That was the majority of the student population. However, the Citadel also had its own version of graduate level coursework or apprenticeships to some of the most powerful wizards, witches, warlocks and other magical beings that taught at the school. Becoming an apprentice was an arduous, grueling task. Many students fancied themselves as being capable young magicians yet numerous failed to make the cut to work under the scrutinizing masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be some sort of mistake,\" Phineas said to himself. Becoming an apprentice had sounded like so much work he had never considered it. Each master or mistress focused their apprentices on a specific niche of magic, studies that could extend life at the Citadel anywhere from an average of two to four years. That's if any of them survived. It was a rare but gruesome truth that in the past apprentices had gotten themselves killed from magical accidents or challenges they were not yet prepared for, amongst other dangers with learning such advanced magic directly from a master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas had certainly never signed himself up for it. Apprentices were commonly contacted during the summer and he had just received this message after getting off the train. Yet here the message was on official Citadel parchment. The fact that he was now an apprentice worried Phineas, as the risk far outweighed the positives in his mind. Apprentices were regarded with awe by the lesser study body, with access to privileges most at the Citadel didn't even know existed. It all depended on your master or mistress, each selective educator having their own quirks and reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCripes! Phineas hadn't finished reading the message yet. He still didn't know whomever he was pressed into apprenticeship for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phineas scanned the note one more time, but the only other real useful piece of information on it was the name of his Master - Janus Dao. Of course, that set off another wave of disbelief in Phineas's mind. Professor Dao was one of the foremost sorcerers in the world today, a wizard who focused his studies on the dualities inherent in many magical traditions. Fire &amp; water, light &amp; dark, life &amp; death - Professor Janus had made many discoveries in how they interacted with each other. It was a great honor to be selected as his apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Janus Dao, like many powerful magicians, had his own eccentricities. In Dao's case, it was an obsession with the number two. He always trained two apprentices when he took them on, and they either passed together or failed together. Which meant that if he screwed up now, it wouldn't only be his ass on the line anymore. Another student's future would now ride on how well Phineas did as an apprentice to one of the most renowned mages in the world. Phineas groaned as he felt his stress continue to build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way towards the accommodations office, Phineas saw several other students moving along with him. All of them had been chosen by other powerful wizards to be their apprentices. All except one, who would be Phineas's parter. Phineas wondered who it might be. As his eyes roved over his classmates, three in particular caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was Bella Lovejoy. She was one of the most popular girls in his year, because she was both incredibly smart and incredibly generous. She had helped many of her classmates who were struggling with their coursework without a second thought. In fact, Phineas was fairly sure he would have failed Intermediary Elementalism without her aid. She was also rather pretty, with blonde hair and blue eyes. Best of all, in Phineas's opinion, was her softness. Bella was known for having a sweet tooth, and many students had repaid her help by giving her candies and pastries. Phineas himself had gone ahead and gotten her an entire pie when she'd helped him, and to his surprise had eaten it all in front of him. Naturally, her hips had been getting wider as time went on. Yes, having Bella Lovejoy as a partner would be rather nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also Gladia Storm, who was widely considered to be the smartest girl in his year. She had consistently earned top marks in all of her classes, and excelled at any task she set her mind to. As one might expect, she was very competitive and abrasive, which explained why she was not as popular as Bella was. Gladia occasionally shot a dark look at the blonde, and Phineas knew she considered Bella one of her biggest academic rivals. What might happen if she turned that intensity on him? Phineas shuddered as he remembered how intense she could be when she competed with anyone. Her black hair, grey eyes, and lithe figure were considered attractive to many, but not to him. Yes, Phineas would rather not be paired with Gladia Storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the others to catch his attention was Misty Lune. Misty was, in one word, a tease. She enjoyed joking and flirting with everyone around her, which made her the life of the party. She was never too mean-spirited about it, though, which was why she still as popular as she was. That and the fact that Misty Lune was widely considered to have one of the best pair of breasts on campus. Even Phineas, who preferred his woman with thicker waists than Misty had, could appreciate them. Misty's white hair and pale skin, products of her albinism, also gave her a mysterious air. Being partnered with Misty Lune could be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Phineas and the rest arrived in the accommodations office, which was already full. Not with other wizards, but with various animals, demons, and spirits. Familiars, Phineas realized, contracted servants of their new masters. Each of the assembled familiars had signs floating by them with names on them. The signs all had names written on them - the familiars would guide the new apprentices to their teachers. After looking around, Phineas finally found his name on a sign that was floating by a two-headed hellhound puppy. There was also another name on that sign:</span></div></div>",

She was dressed smartly for the day of becoming an apprentice, making Phineas feel like he should have dressed up for the occasion, even though he had only just learned of this prestigious opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty wore sleek lavender and midnight purple robes, fitted around her impressive bust. Her milky white skin had a hint of blush from her blood, and she carried herself with an almost airy countenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas gulped at the coy greeting. They weren't strangers by any means, although weren't friends either. Phineas and Misty had schooled together for many years, a frequent face in shared classes. There was a brief time, early in their second year when they were very much still children, that Misty had called Phineas her 'beaux' for half a semester. Puppy level crush that had not been one to last, one before Misty became a flirtatious partier and Phineas developed his attraction towards chubbier girls in their grade. Yet some of that old magnetism towards Misty had lingered, as she became quite beautiful with not only her face and charm but her natural figure with a perfect pair of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reunion was broken by a trail of slobber spilled on Phineas' shoe from their joint familiar. Misty giggled as he struggled to wipe it off on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Misty, I must admit I don't quite know why I'm here. Or why we're both in possession of a drooling orthus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's cute,\" Misty said, bending to scratch behind the ears of the other head of the two headed puppy, more receptive to her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know she's a sh--?\" Phineas asked, although stopping himself as he noticed that he had a stunning view of Misty's pale cleavage given the position she took to pet the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She and he, Mr. Fortescue,\" spoke the sage tones of their new master, Janus Dao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas immediately straightened himself, not wanting his first impressions with the permanent sorcerer to be looking lustily at his co-ed fellow apprentice. The whole situation was still surreal to Phineas, although as a budding scholar he knew the honor of having this chance. Janus Dao had long grey hair tied in a bun with two chopsticks, along with an impressive mustache drooping on either side of his mouth towards his chin. His hands were folded in the sleeves of his exquisite robes. Dao's obsession with duality extended to his wardrobe as well, with each half of his robes having a different intricate pattern in contrasting color schemes, with accents of the opposite pattern on each part of the robe. It was a dizzying outfit to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orthus are often born with male and female personalities in the same form,\" Janus Dao explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they are natural guardians,\" Misty said, also standing, cradling the two-headed pup close to her chest. \"As hellhounds they patrol the barriers to the nether realms, and occasionally other areas of great magical significance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Miss Lune.\" Janus Dao regarded the both of them. \"Together, you and Mr. Fortescue will be helping me research into the great dichotomies. And the balance of masculine and feminine is perfect with your position as my newest pair of apprentices and your familiar's own two sexes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Phineas said with a nervous, small sound that made Misty giggle. Phineas didn't consider himself the strongest, handsome, or bravest and as such not the obvious example of masculinity, short of his gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not downplay your accomplishments, Mr. Fortescue,\" Janus Dao explained. \"While others of your year have accolades to their name that you do not, you have shown a consistent intelligence and stellar ethics towards your coursework that is suitably for this level of magical advancement.\" He turned to Misty. \"And Miss Lune has a vitality and exuberance towards life, society and magic that finds enjoyment in all she does. Together I could consider no better pairing given your aptitudes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled and Phineas just grinned, thinking there had to be more to it than that. Yet the crowd of apprentices in the accommodations office shifted, as various academics and their personal pupils settled into arrangements and gathered familiars. Janus Dao spoke briefly as to what life for Phineas and Misty would now mean, as there were many elements of schedule and logistics to work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the pair of fresh apprentices were lefty alone. Long enough that Misty dropped her smile and sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Phineas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, *ACHOO*\" Misty rubbed her nose, which only made the sneezing fit worse, as the hellhound pup was thrust into Phineas' hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the two heads of the orthus unsure as to the expression of the brother-sister heads as they were upset at the sudden movement. And then a thought came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you allergenic to orthus?\" Phineas asked Misty as she pulled a handkerchief out from under her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"n-N-no...\" she replied after blowing her nose, although Phineas could see that her eyes had watered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Phineas had to guess, maybe Misty was as ill-prepared for this apprenticeship with Janus Dao as he was feeling. Only that was just the beginning, as Phineas and Misty soon learned the full terms of this apprenticeship.</span></div></div>",

Phineas carried the yet-to-be-named two-headed puppy against his chest, both heads looking about while their tongues lolled out of their mouths. Misty, meanwhile, was taking care of the luggage, levitating both her and Phineas's bags without any noticeable effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they found themselves at their destination; Quanata Loft, the dormitory that was home to some of the Citadel's most brilliant and most eccentric students. It was little surprise to Phineas that this had been <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Professor</span> <i>Master</i> Dao's home when he'd been a student at the Citadel. It was also where he housed the students apprenticed to him, one of the agreements he had with the school as a teacher in the mentorship program. And now Phineas was moving here, after years of hoping he could be here! Today was getting better and better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hadn't been there long before the pair were approached by a young woman who looked oddly familiar to Phineas. Misty enveloped the newcomer in a hug, and they chatted for a bit before the other woman inquired about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I suppose introductions are in order. May, this is my partner apprentice, Phineas Fortescue, formerly of Kunok Quarters. Phineas, this is May Tresfluer, future archdruid and my roommate last year,\" Misty said with melodramatic flourishes. Well, that explained why she looked familiar. May's sister, Siv Tresfluer, had been one of his dormmates back when he'd lived at Kunok Quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay rolled her eyes, apparently used to this behavior. \"I would like to apologize to you on Misty's behalf, Fortescue. I promise you that not all students here in the Loft are as crazy as she is.\" Misty stuck her tongue out at May, but didn't exactly refute the characterization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's, uh...\" Phineas began, before deciding to change the topic. \"It's actually really nice up here. I've wanted to move to Quanata for years now. I guess me and the doggy here will get settled soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of the dog, May looked closer at it, then moved up close to her former roommate to stare at Misty for a long moment. Misty didn't move at the invasion of her personal space, evidently as used to May's quirks as May was to her own. The druid-in-training held up a finger to Misty, then walked over towards the girls' dorms. She soon returned with a potted plant, a small bush upon which several small berries were growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a panaceaberry bush,\" May explained as she handed the pot to Misty. \"Eat one of those each morning, and they'll help with your allergy symptoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Misty gasped, looking genuinely touched at the offered plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you're apprenticing under Professor Dao, right? You want to be at 100% if you want to succeed at whatever lessons he throws at you. And what kind of friend would I be if I let you suffer when I could help? Besides, I can always grow more of them,\" May responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty took the plant, picked one of the berries off, and popped it into her mouth. After a moment, she set the plant down, and tentatively gestured Phineas to hand her the two-headed puppy. The albino witch held the little dog in her arms for a few moments, but no sneezing took place. The pups did take the opportunity to cover her with slobbery kisses. Giggling, Misty handed the pooch back to Phineas, and used a quick cleaning cantrip to get the dog saliva off of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that's taken care of,\" May said. \"Just be careful about what you eat. Panaceaberries can have some... odd interactions with certain foods. If you like, I can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, May, but I think I'll be fine. Phineas and I still have to get our room set up,\" Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay shrugged. \"If you say so. I'll be around if you have any other questions. I'll talk to you both later.\" And with that, the student druid headed off, and Phineas and Misty were soon busy with their own tasks. Specifically, setting up the room that they would both share in the wing of Quanata Loft specifically set aside for apprentices. Phineas was rather hesitant when he saw that he would indeed be sleeping in the same room as Misty, though each did have their own bed. In-between both of the beds was a small doggy bed, which the two-headed puppy curled up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, this is a little more... intimate than I was expecting...\" Phineas said as he unpacked his clothes into one of the dressers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm the one who's supposed to say that,\" Misty responded as she set her newly-acquired panaceaberry bush on the nightstand beside her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's not what May said,\" Phineas asked, trying to be a little daring and tease Misty back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty laughed out loud at that. \"Anyway, I'm sure it will be fine, Phineas. I know you. You're a good guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... thanks,\" Phineas blushed at the straightforward compliment, and went back to unpacking. As he did, his mind wandered back to the instructions <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Professor</span> <i>Master</i> Dao had given them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Consider this orthrus puppy your first true test. I have found that living in proximity and needing to work towards the same goal will either break a team apart or create a bond that will enable you to rely on each other for everything. I will check on your progress with the puppy a month from now. If you have trained it to my satisfaction, then the real apprenticeship will begin.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas looked back the sleeping puppy. Well, half-sleeping at this point; one of the heads was still snoozing, while the other (the female head, Phineas thought) was looking at him curiously. Everything about both his and Misty's future apprenticeship rested on that puppy. He just hoped that he and his partner would be able to meet Master Dao's expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first night at the shared room in Quanata Loft didn't actually go all that badly, Phineas thought. Soon, though, the two new apprentices would have to face an unexpected challenge.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In two weeks time, Phineas Fortescue and Misty Lune would begin their biggest trial under their master, Janus Dao. The grandmasters of the Citadel had their own number of apprentices and their own methods of training them. Given his obsession with dualities and the number two, Dao trained pairs of apprentices and as such had one of the larger rosters of personal students, yet there was very little interaction given the specific polarities each set of partners were studying. His other pair of newcomers this year were a pair of witches, one bubbly and one morose, furthering his research into light and dark magicks while it was rumored that an older pair of apprentices, ones mastering the elements of fire and water, couldn't get along and were very close to failing if they didn't shape up this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas still wasn't quite sure what he and Misty would be doing in master Janus Dao's lessons. He had paired them specially as male and female, down to a sister-brother two headed hellhound (with the female as the right head of the orthus, the male as the left head). And while this brought Phineas into close proximity with the opposite sex, one he knew and found rather attractive in personality and physique, the implications troubled his indecisive, hormone addled and introspective tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you thought of names yet,\" Misty asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Phineas snapped out of his thoughts. He and Misty had met up during a nursing session for the hellhound, until their final living arrangements as apprentices were finalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Names for our dear familiar when we present them to master Dao,\" Misty giggled. \"You're such a scatterbrain, Fortescue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" It was bit perplexing for him to think of their shared familiar as two personalities in the same body, a bit of article confusion that he would have to get used to. \"I'm not too sure with two names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could always go with the classics,\" Misty said as she stooped down with two bottles of formula, Phineas begrudgingly trying to keep the heads apart so they could be properly fed. \"There's Artemis and Apollo,\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The twin gods, yeah, url--\" Phineas had to move his hand quickly before it got bit by the male head. \"I had thought of Artemis as both males and females have had the name, but if we need two for the orthus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or there's Eros and Psyche, if you'd prefer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the god of sex and--\" Phineas felt his face grow crimson. In Greek Mythology Eros and Psyche had been the most notable lovers. Misty's eyes were level with his, jittering a bit slightly due to her albinism, but full of mirth and a spark of amusement at making Phineas so uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the moment ended suddenly as Misty stood up to sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas was left scrambling to keep the bottles of formula at each head of the hellhound. \"A-Are you alright, Misty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll be alright,\" she said with a stuffed noised, teary eyed, as she fished for her handkerchief from her bosom again to dry at her eyes and clear her sinuses. Despite the sudden jolt of her sneeze Phineas had witness her perk breasts bounce majestically from the motion, and image he would keep in mind when alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you're allergic, how exactly are we going to make this work out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's eyes, usually somewhat colorless, were growing red from the sinus aggravation. \"We never did keep pets at home after my parents once got me a puppy. It was its fine fur, you see, it causes irritation and puffiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that his attention was brought to it, Phineas could see that Misty was looking puffy. Her cheeks were a smidge wider, hinting that hers would be an aptly named moonface if she ever put on weight above her bust line. Her arms and fingers also looked a bit puffy, and maybe he was imagining it but her clothes looked a little ill fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like swelling?\" Phineas suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhat,\" Misty said. \"I'm generally better with dogs once they've grown older, less shedding.\" She blew her nose. \"Orthus grow up fast but in all honesty I may have to ask you to handle more of the nursing *AAACHOO!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll sort it out, don't worry,\" Phineas replied, mind already racing with responsibilities and possibilities. \"Things will shape up before we enter our trials with Master Dao. In fact, do we have more formula?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing to a sink to wash her handkerchief, Misty said, \"Yes...why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two heads were fed, Phineas got up to root around the medicines in the cabinet in their stall where young familiars were kept. \"Well, whenever me or my brothers and sisters would get a cold, mum would usually put our medicine in milk. The only home remedy I know, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this point I'm willing to try anything,\" Misty said, \"I suppose this is close enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong dose of allergy medicine was added to the nutrient rich, milky formula the pair of fresh apprentices were using as Phineas gave the glass to Misty. \"Bottoms up, as they say,\" she replied, thanking Phineas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the milky skinned, white haired Misty Lune drink the medicine through the thick formulae, Phineas was hit with a spark of inspiration. \"What if we went Persian on names? Like Zaal and Rudabeh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the epic of Shahnameh?\" Misty mused. \"Hmm, I'm not against it. The source names are contrary to our own complexions, wouldn't you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be our own twist on it, ah,\" Phineas found himself losing his voice, unable to vocalize to Misty that she had a drip of formula running from her lips to the prestigious swell of her right breast.</span></div></div>",

Warning bells were sounding off in Phineas' head. This was worse than being thrust into an apprenticeship without advance notice. But Phineas was tasked to apprentice to a new patron?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many spheres of magic, and innate magical power sufficed most through their lives as witches and wizards at both the Citadel and the rest of their lives. But Warlocks were of note as well. It wasn't forbidden knowledge, rather an uncommon occurrence, where magic practitioners made pacts with magical entities for more power. One could argue that the acolytes of the holy, divine 'gods' who altered their magic through devotion and worship was the more acceptable practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Phineas had been sent to report at the 5th Sanctum, a justly named five times warded bastion where both professors and students at this level contacted the strangest realms known to magic. Areas that, with one wrong incantation or lack of fortitude, might spell the doom of the entire Citadel let alone the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how had Phineas been made an apprentice in this way? Surely this must be some sort of mistake! Once Phineas had arrived at the cloistered entrance to the 5th Sanctum, he told the proctor in charge of admittance that they must have the wrong student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortescue, Phineas,\" the proctor read from a scroll. \"No, you have indeed been summoned. Requested, in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas gulped. \"Requested? By whom, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proctor just stared at him. \"Discretion is of upmost importance with the 5th Sanctum. You will be protected during your contact within these walls, but we can no more explain to you the aspects of your patron better than they can explain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas felt his stomach turn into a knot. This did not sound like it was in his skillset at all! This was a task for a different Fortescue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come this way.\" The proctor led Phineas past an unsealed vault door into the 5th Sanctum. Low light glowed from flameless candles set in sconces along the strong, heavy pillars in the Sanctum, the very foundations of the greater Citadel in some respects. He was told to stand in the center of a large, warded circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas could identify the glyphs along the circle for the most part, noticing ones of protection, summoning, and transportation but unable to discern the target realm this circle contacted. Overwhelmed, Phineas tried to protest but he was too late, the runes of the circle glowed brightly and Phineas found his consciousness shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, young Phineas! I shall be your new teacher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Phineas could have possibly thought of, whatever he had feared, absolute nothing could have prepared Phineas for what he found within the magic circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially not a classroom. Rather, the simple furniture of a classroom. A student's desk, a professor's desk, a blackboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was before he could fully comprehend the razor-toothed, golden eyed, fuzzy black demon lady looking back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...teacher?\" was all Phineas could mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was doubly surprised that this response appeared to catch the demon off guard as well. \"Is it too much? The graduation robes, the mortarboard? Definitely the latter, I knew I didn't have the horns to pull it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorns was the understatement of the year as said by this husky voiced, feminine demon, as she looked to have a pair of antlers! The tassel of the mortarboard got caught as she tried to extract it from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, close your mouth kid, I wasn't trying to scare you or anything. Think of our future prospects like any other of your classes. Only with a vastly different commute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliteness and sincerity is not what Phineas expected to experience when talking to a demon, let alone so casual of conversation. \"I'm sorry, wait, what is going on here? Why do you want to teach me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat, Phin. That cool for a nickname? 'Forts' sounds way too dorky,\" the antlered demon turned to hang up her robes on a coat rack made of bone spurs Phineas hadn't seen earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phineas took the offered seat at the student's desk, he got a full look at his patron. A real <i><b>full</b></i> look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like keeping things as casual as possible, Phin, so don't worry your mind all that much about the infernal magicks at work.\" Instead of taking her chair behind the desk, this demonic patron sat on the deck. Although she could have passed for remaining unclothed given the thick, scratchy black fur along most of her body, she was tightly squeezed into a vest that gave shape to her curves. Plump chested and tremendously hip heavy. Phineas found himself starring at how each mammoth cheek of her weighty but and thighs overhung the corner of ornate professor's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon caught him staring. \"Mm, my form is pleasurable to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas was both horribly ashamed and aroused at the same time, trying to gather his thoughts. \"Are you--some sort of succubus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I a succubus?\" the demon lady laughed, a mirthful jiggle in her lower regions. \"Oh, that's a good one Phin kid. You're too kind, no really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--huh?\" Phineas, in the entirety of his magical education at the Citadel, had never expected his life would take a turn like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me cut straight to the chase, kid. I need someone of your predilections to get me out of a jam. That which inflames your passions; The allure of a weighty female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas coughed. THAT's what this mysterious apprenticeship was about??!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desperate times call for desperate measures,\" the demonic patron said, introducing herself. \"My name is Hesbeth. Although you can call me Beth, probably won't raise as many flags if you refer to me as such in the mortal realm. Co-Sloth and Gluttony demon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hes-err, Beth?\" Phineas was confused. The demon's name was Beth? \"Co-Sloth and Gluttony demon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to let you in on a little secret, Phin kid. You know of the demonic hells, places of internal punishment and booming figures of pain, hate, and monstrous appearances? That's us overplaying it, making a show out of the lower reaches. The demonic hells have become far more bureaucratic as of late. And the flow of demonic power comes down to a simple equation. We encourage sin to be spread throughout the world to gain power from the acts of sin in others. More sin, more power, capiche?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, think I understand,\" Phineas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's been some, restructuring,\" Hesbeth or Beth continued, \"us demons used to have to worry only about one category of sins. Too much overhead, it turned out, and a lot of departments were culled. So although I stated out as a demon of Sloth, I got into the Gluttony gig as well after several jobs with that sin. Which is where you come in, my new and only student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple, Phin kid. I need you to advance the cause of Sloth and Gluttony. I'm sure that latter one is right up your alley. That increased sin will get me more power, and more influence for your future lessons. Its a deal we can all benefit from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas had to be sure he was hearing this right. A glowing eyed, antlered, bottom-heavy fuzzy demon wanted him as a student to further the sins of Sloth and Gluttony?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get to live out your fantasies and I'll teach you magic no one has dreamed of yet. That is a pretty sweet deal, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there a catch?\" It was said to be weary dealing with demons, as they always had ulterior motives. As much as the full explanation somewhat excited Phineas, he was ever a cautious one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No catch,\" Hesbeth said. \"Well, not one that's easily explained from your side of the equation. Think of it more as forging new ground. As long as you magic folk have contacted demons, its been a even heavier workload trying to damn your souls along with that of the magic-less populace. I'm willing to bet there's a more lucrative avenue of sin to be had if I have a student, a partner on the other side to advance the cause more subtlety than the next 'Demonic Dark Lord' that gets his ass handed to him by a bunch of heroic champions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Hesbeth was downplaying this arrangement, Phineas couldn't help but think of the complications. Yet, for once in his life Phineas felt that his attraction wasn't something to be embarrassed by. If he looked at it like any other apprenticeship prospect, his 'predilections' as described by this patron had made him as viable a candidate no different than needing high marks in dueling or runes, for example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long pause of weighing his options, Phineas gave in. \"Alright, I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Hesbeth lumbered off her desk. \"I could squeeze you right now, kid, but its only our first meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squeeze?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, hug. That's what you heart-havers call it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heart-havers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're just getting distracted,\" Hesbeth said, scratching behind one of her antler-horns. \"The Citadel where you school isn't aware of what our arrangement actually entails, so you need to keep it on the down low. Start looking for people with sins that need attention. Areas where a hint of Sloth and a pinch of Gluttony can take hold. Make friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can do that, although what do you mean by future lessons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be scheduled in future, once you've opened some avenues, Phin kid. Remember to keep this on the hush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Professor, umm, Hesbeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth, kid,\" Beth corrected. \"Draws less attention my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Beth,\" Phineas said, as the sudden lurch of magic brought him back into the 5th Sanctum under the Citadel, his demonic patron having disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing back at the familiar Citadel was a little disorientating, although now Phineas had been entrusted with a special mission, one that played to his desires. His life was about to change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After meeting with his new teacher, Phineas decided he needed some time to figure out how to feel about his new situation. The reedy young wizard eventually found himself sitting down in one of the Citadel's many courtyards, and he proceeded to think. There was a part of him that was very happy about the kinds of assignments Hesbeth was going to have him do, but it was currently being shouted at by the part of him that was afraid of putting himself into social situations and the part of him that remembered what the usual fate of people who made deals with demons was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny for your thoughts, Fortescue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question brought Phineas's inner argument to a screeching halt, and he looked up at the one who asked it. \"Oh, Charity. Sorry, I didn't notice you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity Brightbell was one of the more distinctive students at the Citadel, on account of her being a tiefling. While some of the fiendish-blooded folk could pass for a regular human, Charity's hellish heritage manifested itself in her lavender-colored skin, solid red eyes, her dark violet horns, and her tail. Her long black hair was tied back into a loose ponytail, and she was currently dressed in casual clothes which did little to disguise her general chubbiness; she had caught Phineas's wandering eye more than once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked like you were deep in thought there. Let me guess...\" Charity said, before leaning over so her face was inches away from Phineas's, her cleavage on the same level as his eyes. She then whispered, \"You're wondering how to fulfill your obligations to your new teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas leaned away from her in surprise. \"How do you know about that?\" he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity chuckled. \"Why, because dear old Grandma Beth told me.\" She paused for a moment, musing. \"Well, technically Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandma, but that's splitting hairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas stared at her a moment, as his mind processed what she'd just said. \"You mean, you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity nodded and pre-emptively answered, \"Yup. I'm the first one in the family who took after her in several generations. Mom &amp; Dad wanted to keep me hidden away, but Grandma Beth always had a soft spot for me. Well, as much as someone in her line of work can have a soft spot for anyone, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Phineas said after some more thought, \"You know about my... uh, apprenticeship. So what brings you over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeell,\" Charity replied, her tail swishing behind her, \"I maaaaaay owe Grandma Beth a favor for... it's not important. Anyway, she told me she thought you had potential, but that you might need some convincing to accept the apprenticeship. So, if I can get you to make your mind up, she'll consider my debt to her squared away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... being awfully blunt about this,\" Phineas pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only about 2% demon. I never claimed to be great at the whole 'tempting' thing,\" Charity answered with a shrug. \"But, I do think you should take her up her offer. Grandma Beth's been around a long time, and has forgotten more about magic than we'll ever learn. Despite how many wizards summon demons to learn about magic, an arrangement like her's is actually pretty rare. And if she thinks you can hack being her student, then you definitely can, if that's what you're worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told her I'd be her student. I'm not the kind of guy who goes back on his word,\" Phineas said, a little offended she thought so little of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity raised her hands. \"Yikes. Sorry, didn't realize you'd already made up your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's fine. Thanks. For, uh, telling me my new teacher believes in me, I guess,\" Phineas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Now that I think about it, I guess <b>I</b> still owe <b>you</b>, don't I? For helping me out last year,\" Charity mused. The help the tubby tiefling was referring to happened during a Magical Theory class the two had shared the year before. Charity had been having trouble with some of the more esoteric concepts covered in the class, and after failing a test had asked Phineas, one of the better-performing and more approachable students, to help her bring her grade up. Phineas's tutoring had helped raise Charity's grade from failing to solidly middle-of-the-class, and she'd promised him after seeing her final grade that she'd find a way to repay the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you last year, you don't need to worry about that. I was happy I could help,\" Phineas patiently explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <b>I</b> told you last year, I always balance the scales,\" Charity responded, equally as patient. \"Besides, tell me you don't want any help with whatever Grandma Beth wants you to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas found that he could not tell her that, and sighed. \"Fine. I guess I really could use a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Charity said with a sharp-toothed smile. \"Now, knowing what Grandma Beth's job entails, it probably relates to sloth or gluttony, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" Phineas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how can I help?\" Charity asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The idea seemed to strike at Phineas out of nowhere, and he decided to ask before he completely lost his nerve. \"Well, do you want to get dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity just looked at him for a moment, apparently taken entirely off-guard by Phineas's question. Then she laughed. It started off as chuckling, but soon Charity was letting out a loud belly laugh, which caused all of her to start shaking. Phineas wasn't entirely sure what was going on, so he remained where he was, doing his best not to stare too much at the tiefling's jigglier parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Charity got herself under control. \"Gotta say, Fortescue, I didn't realize you were that ballsy,\" Charity said, wiping a tear out of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't exactly what Phineas had been hoping to hear, but it wasn't an outright rejection either. So he decided to push his luck. \"Is that a yes? Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity looked like she might start laughing again, but she managed to stop herself. \"You know what? Dinner sounds nice. I'm guessing we've still got to unpack, so I'll meet you at the Great Hall at 7, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. See you then,\" Phineas said. With that, Charity headed off. It took an effort of will for Phineas to tear his eyes away from the tiefling's swaying backside, but he knew he'd need to finish moving. Like in his previous years of schooling, it looked like he'd be back in Kunok Quarters. Hesbeth had told him that staying there would enable him to keep a low profile better, and so back to Kunok Phineas would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough it was 7:00, and Phineas and Charity found themselves in the Great Hall. Phineas had actually gone all the way down to the Meldelvian Dungeons, the dorm where Charity lived, to get her. She was bemused when she saw him at first, but quickly fell into place alongside Phineas like she'd known him meeting her would be the plan the whole time. Phineas found that conversation came easy with Charity, though he wondered how much of that was because he felt he didn't need to keep his new teacher a secret from her. After they got to their destination, it was a matter of loading their plates and finding a place to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas did his best not to stare when Charity sat down with a plate laden with all kinds of foods. Pasta, steak, greens, several chicken wings, and more. The grin she shot him indicated she'd noticed anyway. Then, the two laid into their dinner. Though Phineas hadn't gotten that much food for himself, he still found that he finished around the same time Charity had. The tiefling let out a sigh of contentment as she polished off the last speck of food on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince not overthinking his ideas had been working for him so far, Phineas decided to go for it. \"Do you want seconds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity look at him with a raised eyebrow, but soon a mischievous smile appeared on her lips. \"You know what? I do. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Phineas got up, and filled up another plate with everything that Charity had put on her plate before sitting down. He soon found his way back to the small table they shared, setting down the second dinner in front of her. Charity looked at the plate, then back to Phineas, a smile still on her face. \"Don't want you wasting away,\" Phineas said, hoping the line came out as smooth as it had sounded in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity laughed out loud, and then dug into her second dinner. She wasn't quite the eating machine she had been the first time around, starting to waver about halfway through her second course. Still, she managed to clean her plate again, though Phineas noted that her belly was quite bloated. He could even see some lavender midriff where her shirt wasn't quite up to containing the tiefling's tummy. And after all that, she was still up for some dessert, polishing off the slice of cheesecake that she asked Phineas to bring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all good things must come to an end, and soon Phineas found himself helping Charity back to the dungeons. Again, the action was not something that Charity seemed to have been anticipating, but she that she nonetheless appreciated. At the doors of Meldelvian Dungeon, Charity pulled Phineas into a hug, and whispered something into his ear. Phineas couldn't quite understand what it was, his brain focused on keeping himself upright as he felt himself pressed into a softness he very much appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas hoped the smile on his face wasn't too goofy as he made his way back to Kunok Quarters. Today had gone rather well, and he was actually looking forward to the future for once. Maybe Hesbeth's belief in him wasn't misplaced.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The following is a weight gain and expansion related story set at the Citadel Preparatory Academy for Rites and Sorcery. The Citadel is a mysterious fortress set away from the rest of the world where the extensive study of magic occurs for the next generations of witches, wizards and warlocks. At this preeminent magic school we have our teenage protagonist Phineas Fortescue, an otherwise unremarkable young magician about to enter his penultimate year in magic studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas has been a lifelong closeted fat admirer thus far into his magical education. The story enters his life as his private fantasies become realized, as he could potentially meet the weighty love of his life. Several weighty loves, actually, all vying for his affections. School drama and wayward magic coincides with several romance options with the gaining, overweight and massive females the Citadel has to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst this tale of love of weight gain, the Citadel is a cosmopolitan magic academy where just about anything is possible. Inspirations include not only Hogwarts from the Harry Potter series but also Unseen University from the Discworld series and the magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, amongst other inspirations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we begin, a few guidelines:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Central Character:</b> Phineas' life as a fat admirer and expansion enthusiast is a cornerstone of the story. Should the focus of a storyline drift away from having Phineas as a main character, his presence should still remain central to the plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Feminine Weight Gain:</b> Although the Citadel is a co-ed magical education facility, the other main emphasis of the story is on female weight gain. This is not to sale fat males are non-existent or male gain is forbidden, but it would only be allowed from a mutual gaining scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Restrain Magic:</b> Magic is an important part of the series, allowing many magical, supernatural or occult means of weight gain and expansion. While magic follows deliberate patterns and paradoxically still cannot be fully explained, as exceptions to the 'rules' always exist, magic should not be leaned on as the easy solution. It takes a lot of magical power to trigger spectacular events, so refrain from massive instantaneous gains and such if there is no significance to the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Write Your Best:</b> I encourage you to write your best and be creative. I may pass through chapters to fix typos or add chapter prompt options but I will not overwrite your additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>However...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust because this story is harem genre, it is not a free pass for overly explicit entries. In regards to potential girlfriends for Phineas (17 at the start of the story) the youngest any love interest can be is 15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease mind the overall rating of the piece, 13+, when crafting your addition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/2230943-PFBFH-Setting--Character-Guide\" title=\"Story notes for Phineas Fortescue's Big Fat Harem\" target=\"_top\">PFBFH Setting &amp; Character Guide</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"Story notes for Phineas Fortescue's Big Fat Harem\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/2230943-PFBFH-Setting--Character-Guide\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></td>",
