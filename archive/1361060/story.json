The Elven Labyrinth was huge and daunting, carved out of the very base of a mountain itself. Within it was said to be the treasures accumulated by the Trix'ar, the famous Elven Amazons who once ruled over a Mighty Empire before it eventually fell. Treasures such as the jade statue of the Orc King Glorak and the emerald of Tansor are said to lie in the Labyrinth if the legends are true. But the legends also speak of the horrible fate which awaits those who are captured, their tortured screams are said to echo throughout the mountain and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of that, Tracia was determined to risk it all and get her greatest payment yet. The entrance to the Labyrinth was wide open with no guards in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do?</span></div></div>",

Just before she reaches it however, Tracia feels a weight striking into her and she is thrown to the ground, another figure tackling Tracia to the floor. The two struggled on the ground, rolling over and try to get the upperhand when a second figure came out of the shadows and grabbed Tracia's arms, pulling them back and dragging her across the soil, forcing her on to her knees. Tracia could now see clearly, even as she was trapped in her captor's vice like grip. These were Trix'ar alright, their muscular bodies and beautiful looks confirmed that as well as their Elven features. Tracia also noticed their lack of armour, only a helmet and a small breastplate on each one, it struck her as quite odd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, another thief trying to get our treasures? She looks as if she'll be fun...\" Came a voice from a third figure who stepped out of the shadows, much like the other two in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia glowered at her captors \"I am Tracia the Queen of Thieves, it would do you good to remember it long-ears!\" She knew she was heading for a lot of trouble doing this, but she wasn't going to let these three think that they could get away with trying to frighten her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elven guard raised an eyebrow, \"The Queen of Thieves herself you say? Well, that makes it very interesting to us, we've never had a Queen as a toy...\" The other two guards sniggered at this, thinking of all the delights they were going to get from Tracia...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia glanced up, a little worried, what did they mean by toy? Trying to show no fear still, Tracia responded by acting as if she didn't care what the guard had just said \"Toy? And what sort of games do you have in mind? Nothing too complicated I hope, I don't think your minds would be able to take the strain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard merely smiled in response and put her hand over Tracia's stomach while the other two took up positions beside Tracia, grabbing an arm each and holding it firmly in place. The third guard then began to twitch her fingers, pinching the skin underneath Tracia's tunic, her long fingernails scraping right on highly sensitive spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia's eyes bolted wide open as she felt the sensations run across her torso. They were going to tickle her? Ever since she could remember, Tracia had been hugely vulnerable to tickling, with her feet and stomach being her worst spots. If this was ledgendary torture that the Trix'ar inflicted on thieves, Tracia had a lot to worry about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden movement behind the guard tormenting Tracia caught the thief's attention, another figure was darting towards the entrance, another thief trying their luck while Tracia was the centre of attention. Tracia had to decide, should she call out for help to distract the guards and divert them to get the other thief while she escapes? Or should she remain quite and hope for the other thief to help her with a surprise attack against her tormentors?</span></div></div>",

Help me out here!\" Tracia calls out to the shadowed figure beside the entrance, causing everyone to look at the way you were shouting. The figure also turned towards you upon hearing the shout and you can make out that it's a rather handsome young man although his features are generally marred by the state of shock on his face right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving out a snarl of sheer fury, the Elven guard previously teasing Tracia lunged for the stranger, tackling him and knocking him down onto his back as she gained the element of surprise. The young man let out a whoosh of air before his mouth curled up and he started to break into laughter as he felt the Elven Woman's fingers dig whole heartedly into his sides, tickling without mercy. The young man cackled long and hard as he struggled to get away but to no avail. One of the Elven women holding onto Tracia grinned and let go, running up to the man and grabbing onto his feet as she prepared to attack them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two Elven guards distracted, only one is left holding onto Tracia, providing a much needed opportunity to either escape or help the young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you advise Tracia to do?</span></div></div>",

When she reached the edge of the forest from which she had emerged earlier, Tracia risked a backward glance before stopping as she realised why she wasn't being chased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man who had been tackled to the ground was now the attention of all three guards, the obvious temptation to go after him as being greater than chasing after Tracia. Looking on at the scene, Tracia gave a shudder of horror at the thought of being tormented like the young man was right now. His boots had been torn off with one woman sitting on his ankles and raking her fingers up and down the exposed soles, grinning evilly while doing so. The guard who had first tackled him was tickling up and down his exposed ribs as she trapped his arms beneath her legs, the tickling causing the man to scream from the torment. But the worst was from the third Elven guard at his hips as she unbuckled his trousers, pulling them down while tickling his hips with glee. When the man's penis was exposed, the guard ran one of her long fingernails right up it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting shriek of tortured laughter was enough to bring Tracia out of her stupor and she turned to flee out of her situation. The screaming laughter following her for quite some time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour advice has led to Tracia without the treasure, but at least she got away without falling into the clutches of the Elven guards. If you want to try your luck further, go back and try again.</span></div></div>",

Tracia' grabbed at the one at his feet, pulling her off and trying to throw her out the way, not noticing the guard reaching into a pouch on her belt and pulling some powder from it before throwing the substance into Tracia's face. Almost in an instant, the thief started to become drowsy and she started to drop to the ground, asleep before she even reached it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** ******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Tracia wakes up, stirring from her deep slumber and groggily raising her head, the sound of insane laughter echoing through her skull. With her mind clearing, Tracia realises the laughter is a man's and is coming from right next to her. Turning her head, she saw the young man from earlier, completely stripped naked and chained to the wall with in-built manacles on the right side of the entrance. Two of the Elven guards were delighting in tickling him as well as sexually teasing him as well. As one guard tickled the man's armpits with his fingers digging in deep into the pits, burrowing hard, her tongue lapped at his chest licking nice and long with little flicks across his nipples for extra sensation. Added to this is the second guard who took interest in the man's thighs, flicking her fingers up and down across the insides of them while teasing his erect manhood with little soft breaths, causing it to quiver. The man's face was contorted with laughter, his face screwed up and bright red as tears streamed down his cheeks, babbling madly as he tried to beg for mercy through his laughing, to little effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a poke in her belly to bring Tracia down to Earth as she brought her gaze forward to the third guard who had dropped her helmet and was exposing a fine head of raven hair that fell down to her hips \"Now that I've got your attention.\" She said evilly while stroking Tracia's bare belly, an action that brought the fact that Tracia was naked to her attention as the thief blushed deeply whilst tittering at the soft touch \"For trespassing in the Labyrinth, you and that handsome man of your will be punished for a long, long time. And for your little transgression earlier, we'll start it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia could only burst out laughing as the tickling over her bare stomach began, struggling desperately to escape from her manacles as the long fingernails of the guard scratched lightly below her navel to no avail. Both Tracia and her new companion were to be guests of the Labyrinth for quite some time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou advised Tracie unwisely, go back and try again.</span></div></div>",

The other person is bound to help her and you wouldn't want them to lose the element of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia remains silent (At least, as much as she can as her belly is softly tickled) as the figure gets closer and closer to them... before darting into the doorway and into the Labyrinth. The sheer shock of this is enough to break her walls of resistance and she instantly begins to shriek with laughter, too surprised to even shout out to the figure as the tickling became harder. Her stomach was the main target as the Elven guard mercilessly attacked her belly, running her fingernails across the area. Tracia bucked and shrieked at the tickling, unable to control of herself as the fingers poked, prodded and scratched her sensitive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia positively howled with laughter as the tickling continued before it suddenly stopped. Tracia breathed deeply before looking up at her tormentors \"She'll do great.\" The one who had been tickling her said \"Take her to my quarters. I want a little bit of fun before she's sent elsewhere.\" The guard leaned down right down and smiled like a wolf \"And if you so muh as make a peep on the way there, you'll definetly regret it...\" Tracia was pulled to her feet and was dragged along to her tickly fate, cursing the person who had refused to help her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou advised Tracia wrongly.

Tracia agrees with the desicion and waits a moment to see if there are any dangers. It isn't long before something does indeed happen, a figure suddenly bursts fom the shadows to the right, another thief it seems. This one, unlike Tracia, is male. He wears no mask and looks to be quite young, just barely an adult and is rather handome with a dashing face and hair tied back in a ponytail. Tracia eyes him with a keen eye as his well muscled body runs to the entrance of the Labyrinth while also realising that he could be a blessing in a disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis belief rings true when the thief reaches the entrance to the Labyrinth only for a voice to shout \"HALT!\" Before he reaches the door. The thief stops and twists around, looking for the source of the voice \"Put you hands up and stay where you are!\" Came the strong voice again. Two figures stepped from from the shadows near the entrance of the Labyrinth, they were two female Elven Archers. Tracia looked at the two with interest, these were the legendary Trix'ar? They certainly lived up to the rumours, both were over a foot taller than the average man, were beautiful (As all Elves are) and were very well armed, carrying a crossbow with a quiver full of arrows with a sword and several daggers. Curiously enough, their armour only really consisted of a helmet and small breastplates which left their midriffs bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do we have here?\" One of the warriors asked as she walked around the thief until she was right behind him \"A lost little boy perhaps?\" Her mocking tone of voice helped the thief overcome his fear for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no boy!\" He shouted \"I'm twenty years of age and my name is Celan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the guards looked impressed and the one in front of him laughed \"Oh you are precious aren't you? Hey Leoner,\" She called out to the other Elven guard \"Since there's just the three of us, why don't we have a little fun with our guest? You know, show him what's in store for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeoner gave a sadistic grin, the affect on her beatiful features was enough to make Tracia flinch in horror \"Why Salier,\" She said \"I do believe that that's a magnificent idea.\" With that, Leoner dropped her crossbow and then drove her hands deep in Celan's armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second before Celan realised what was happening and reacted accordingly \"NO NOT THAAAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!!!\" He roared as the ticklish sensations got a hold of him, causing his knees to buckle and he fell to the ground. Leoner followed him, still tickling his armpits hard enough to prevent Celan from fightin back. Salier also dropped her crossbow and dove at Celan, grabbing his boots and tearing them off. The young thief was helpless as Sailer stripped his feet completely, leaving his feet vulnerable to be tickled sadisticaly \"NOTTHEFEEEEHAAHHAHAHAAAAA!!!\" Celan screamed as Salier began to rake her fingernails up and down his soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia looked on in confusion, tickling? Was that it? The horrible torture that people were subjected too? Well regardless of that, should Tracia aid Celan and attack the two guards or wait until they take him into the Labyrinth and enter safely?</span></div></div>",

Tracia agrees and begins to creep up on Celan and his tormentors. By now, Leoner had stripped the young man of his tunic, leaving him naked from the waist up and vulnerable to Leoner as she tickled his bare ribs with one hand and used the other to tickle his bellybutton by putting a finger in and wriggling it hard.Tracia couldn't help but notice Celan's rather well muscled abs, he was quite well built for his age. Sailen was still at his feet, holding them under her arm and tickling his soles madly. Celan was laughing hysterically, his handsome face contorted with with laughter as his tormentors showed no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia gradually sneaked up of the two Elves and was about to launch into action when a movement out the corner of her eye distracted her. Tracia turned and saw another guard facing her, this one had some odd coloured powder in her hands. Before Tracia could react, the guard flung the powder in her face, causing the magic within it to make Tracia fall to the ground and into a deep sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia woke up to the sound of hysterical laughter that was overpowering in its sheer noise levels. The thief groggily opened her eyes and gasped in shock at what she saw. A huge cavernous room lay before her, the roof of it was almost out of sight such was the rooms height. Tracia then noticed what lined the walls of the cavern, hundreds upon hundreds of people, completely naked, bound by shackles and all were screaming with laughter. A sudden shrill laugh to her right made Tracia made look and gape at the sight of Celan, stripped naked and bound to the wall being tickled wildly by six long, stiff and scarlet coloured feathers. Two were at his armpits, twirling quickly at the very centre of them. Another two were slowly brushing up and down the soles of his feet, occasionally stopping to flick his toes in a cruel manner. But the worst torture was reserved for his penis and balls as one feather slowly dragged up and up and down his shaft as the other tickled his balls through quickly brushing its tip against them. Celan was moaning and shrieking with laughter at the same time, his sexual energies mixing with the torture of the tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful isn't it?\" Said a surprisingly clear voice in front of Tracia. The thief turned and was greeted by the sight of a beautiful Elven woman, tall with noble features and golden hair \"This is the fate of all those who try to steal from us, bewitched feathers tormenting them into laughter and a sexual frenzy.\" The Elven woman held up six feathers much the same as the ones tickling Celan. They glowed for a moment and then began to float towards Tracia \"Don't bother trying to resist,\" The woman said \"You'll be here for a long time...\" As the feathers descended and began to tickle Tracia's naked body, the truth of the woman's words hit her and all she could do was laugh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guided Tracia unwisely. Her quest ends with her on the wrong end of a feather. Try again.</span></div></div>",

But at least Tracia won't be bored...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Celan had been stripped of his upper tunic and his nicely toned upper body was under attack still. Leoner had moved from the young thief's underarms to his belly, using both hands to dig in and tickle with wild abandon. Salier had trapped Celan's feet by sitting on his ankles and was now using one hand to pull back the toes of his right foot and tickling the bottom of them with her other hand. Celan was in ticklish agony, with both his belly and feet under attack, he was powerless to even move, the tickling sapping his strength to even put up a physical resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of ticklish torment, Celan collapsed into silent laughter, all of his energy drained from his body. Leoner and Salier mercifully stopped tormenting him and stood up \"Well that was fun.\" Leoner commented before turning to face the shadows and shouting \"Hey Jaye! Give us a hand taking him to the Cavern!\" A third Elven guard stepped out from the shadows near the entrance of the entrance to the Labyrinth, her beautiful face scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you two had your fun.\" Jaye muttered bitterly. She walked over to where Celan was lying and bent down \"Well you won't be needing these anymore.\" She said, indicating his trousers. With those words, she bent down and ripped them from Celan's lower body before giving the thief an admiring look \"Well, you are a man aren't you?\" Jaye said, indicating Celan's well endowned manhood. The Elven woman reached down and gave Celan's package a quick tickle, causing the young man to give a scream of laughter, it was obviously a very sensitive spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaye stood up, an evil smile upon her face \"As I was just going off duty anyway, could you two help me take him to my quarters? I'll send him to the Cavern... eventually.\" Both Leonr and Salier grinned at this and grabbed Celan, picking him up and carrying him into the Labyrinth, Jaye following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the entrance now open, Tracia enters the Labyrinth and begins her hunt...</span></div></div>",

Leoner dived down and straddled Tracia's hips while using her legs to trap Tracia's legs \"Well what do we have here?\" Salier cried out \"Another thief who's after our treasures I'll bet! Show her what we do to tickly little thieves Leoner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Elven warrior gladly obliged and lifted Tracia's tunic, showing her flat stomach which looked very inviting to any tickling fingers. Leoner wiggled her fingers to heighten the tension before plunging them into Tracia's belly, making the thief squeal with laughter. Leoner's fingers practically danced over the soft skin, dragging and flicking all around, from her lower ribs to hips. The torture reached its high point when Leoner took a single finger and poked it into Leoner's bellybutton, a central point of ticklish nerves of the thief.

In the room lies both Jaye and Celan on a huge, luxurious bed, both of them naked and Celan's wrists and ankles tied with rope. Jaue, the beautiful Elven woman was lying just beside him, her arm draped over his chest as she lay there sleeping. Apparently after having some fun with the young thief, she decided to leave him hanging while she had a quick nap. Just looking at the young man confirmed what Jaye had done to Celan, his body was red and gleaming with sweat while his manhood was fully erect, apparently Jaye had taken particular pleasure in assaulting that area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia steps through the door, making sure she closes it slightly to avoid any peering eyes before looking over to Celan whose eyes brimmed with hope upon seeing Tracia. Whispering so he doesn't wake up Jaye, he called out to her \"Hey! Release me please! She's been tickling me to death, I can't stand it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting to see if Jaye would wake up at that (And very thankful when she didn't) Tracia smirked at Celan's position before whispering back \"And why should I? Letting you go will probably wake her up. At least give me something I can use to sweeten the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning and writhing in his bonds, Celan eventually gave up and nodded his head over towards a table at the back of the room where a bejewlled glove sat along with a small leather pouch \"Over there, there's a glove that you need to wear in order to get past some of the doors here and a bag of that sleeping powder they use, just blow it into someone's face and it works! Can you please let me go!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the table, Tracia picked up and pocketed both items before turning back to Celan, his expression silently begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you advise Tracia to do?</span></div></div>",

A glare from Tracia silenced him once more before she began work untying his wrists. She scowled in concentration as the knots keeping Celan's wrists tied to the bed were good and tight and she made no progress on freeing him. So caught up in her task was Tracia that she didn't notice the weight on her belt get lighter, nor the movement of Jaye until Celan called out \"Look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her face to look at Jaye, Tracia was too late to avoid the sleep powder thrown into her face.

Their positions were still on the bed but now with their wrists tied together on one end of the bed and their ankles the other, forming a line. Tracia couldn't help that notice Celan was eyeing her up a fair bit, blushing at seeing her naked body tied close to his. A voice pulled Tracia from her thoughts however and turned to see Jaye, still naked, standing at the foot of the bed with the mosr wicked of grins \"Ah good, now that you're awake, we can begin. You two will eventually go to the Cavern for your punishment. But for now, you're both mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words ended, Jaye brought down her hands with the long, sharp fingernails and started tickling the feet of both Tracia and Celan. The nails glided up and down across the bare skin of both pairs of feet, teasing only at first before Jaye's fingers got faster and faster, scratching from the heels to the toes with quick, merciless motions. As both Celan and Tracia started screaming with laughter and thrashing in their bonds, Tracia knew that this was only the beginning, the maddening tickles on their feet was merely a preview of what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have advised Tracia unwisely, go back and try again.</span></div></div>",

Retracing her steps, Tracia moves away from the sleeping quarters of the guards and went for the split in the corridor from earlier.

Tried to break in but was caught by Jaye and the rest.\" The guard on the left said, her voice sounding disappointed as she flicked some of her black hair idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer partner tutted in exasperation \"You're insatiable you know that? You spend all your time in the Caverns tormenting thieves, is your libido all you ever think with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first guard giggled and nodded, her laugh having a harmonic ring to it \"You bet. Maybe if you let yourself go once in a while, you'd see why.

She slowly began to zone out, her mind turning to wonder what sort of treasures the Labyrinth held and hoping that they'd be worth it. So caught up in her imaginings was she that Tracia didn't hear the footsteps behind her until it was too late. With little warning, Tracia felt fingers dig right into her sides with viscous squeezes, causing her to leap up and squeal with laughter from the sudden attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise instantly gained the guard's attention and the two looked back to see Tracia dancing about and laughing madly while another guard was tickling her sides fiendishly, not letting go despite her victim's struggles. Tracia could do little more than cackle at the tickling, her face contorted into a big smile as the guard's fingers dug in deep at her flanks, not leaving her alone for an instant as she tickled long and hard on the flanks. The tickling only stopped when Tracia lost her balance and fell to the ground, contact breaking as she hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to recover, Tracia breathed hard before trying to get back up, only to be stopped by three pairs of hands that pushed her back down to the ground, preventing her from moving completely \"Well, well, well.\" Came a voice that Tracia recognised as being the guard with blonde hair \"An intruder all the way in here? You've done well to get this far at least but no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Came another voice \"It's off to the Caverns with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\" Said the first guard, her voice choked with disappointment \"Can't we have her stick around for just a little while? I'm sure she'll be lots of fun...\" Tracia felt a hand trace up the back of her thigh, tickling the inside of it with slow, gentle scratches that nevertheless caused the thief to squirm in her captor's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hand suddenly poked into Tracia's ribs, causing her to outright laugh from the sudden attack and teasing on her thigh. The second guard spoke again, her voice laden with temptation \"Well... I suppose we can keep her for a little while at least...\" A hand snuck up Tracia's tunic, brushing against her bare back while starting to rip away her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden tug ripped off Tracia's tunic as a whoop came from the blonde guard, overjoyed at getting a new toy. Barely able to defend herself, Tracia was stripped of all her clothes completely, the torn rags being flung into the dark corner of the corridor along with her boots. Flipped onto her back, Tracia was held down at her arms and legs while the blonde guard straddled her hips, throwing her helmet aside to look right at Tracia, showing off her long flowing hair and own features that matched Tracia's for beauty. Giggling with joy, the guard grinned down at Tracia like a cat that just caught a mouse \"Ooh, this is going to be so much fun! Especially for us.\" She said evilly as her fingers began to tickle along Tracia's lower belly, just above her hips. The fingers scraped just from below the thief's navel down to her mound, emitting both shrieks and some moans from Tracia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tickling was only the beginning however as the other two guards joined in with the assault, one pair of hands tickling her breasts with vigour, the nails flicking along the nipples, tickling constantly and without mercy, only speeding up as Tracia's nipples hardened, making her feel every flick and scratch across the area even more. The final pair of hands started tickling her inner thighs, digging in with pinches and squeezes, tormenting them from the knees right up to her womanhood, tickling with litle shocks that went straight to Tracia's head and nether regions. The three way tickle assault was maddening but also having another effect entirely, warmth building up around Tracia's pussy that she started to enjoy. If the tickling would have this effect on her, maybe being a captive of the Labyrinth wouldn't be too bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have advised Tracia wrongly (Although she might not object to much in this instance).

A quick stroke and Tracia pulled her hand back as the guard squealed and turned, only to see her partner as the only one there. Grinning, she reached over and tickled her buttocks, earning a burst of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm insatiable huh?\" She asked, slipping an arm around the stomach of her partner and holding tight, trapping her arms at her sides too \"After that, I reckon you're hiding something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaahahhatareyuohohootalkiinggaabahahahtt!!!??\" Came the response as the guard's butocks were tickled with light pinches and scratches, forcing her into laughter she couldn't escape from while being held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to deny it? Good, it'll just make it all the more fun to get you to admit it. Let's take you someplace where we can really get you talking...\" With that, the raven haired guard dragged her partner away down the right corridor, continuing to tickle her to weaken the resistance.

As she kept descending, she noticed the source of the light: a single lamp embedded into the rock face next to the ladder. Looking below, she saw only darkness. Sighing, she kept going, hoping to find another light source further ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tracia kept climbing down, the light became dim, starting to become too dark for her to see. \"Where does this ladder go?\" she thought \"that I'm plunged into darkness, traveling hundreds of feet down without a single room?

Either way, there shouldn't be any elves down in this dark.\" With that realization, Tracia relaxed a bit, concentrating on climbing quickly down to where she was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she realized that the ladder was tilting! It clung to the wall as it reclined at an angle. Slowly at first, but it kept curling until the ladder became hand holds, her legs dangling below her.

She could climb hand over hand, dangling from the ladder. It would be the safest move for now, but she knew she could only go so long before her hands got tired. Even if she did eventually reach a room, her arms would be tired and she might not be able to put up a fight if there were guards. There was no way of knowing how much farther she would have to climb through the dark passageway, or if anything was lurking in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, she could let go of the ladder and drop down into the darkness below. She had no idea how deep the drop was, or if there was anything soft at the bottom. Strangely enough, she could smell some moss and vegetation in the musty air around her. There might be plant life at the bottom to soften her fall. It was also a risky move, but who would put such a perilous ladder here? Would they really put it over a lethal fall?

She was lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers hit something, and after some digging brought up a curious stone that emitted a dull glow. No rock should've been able to do that, but sure enough Tracia could now see around a bit. Dismissing it as an Elven enchantment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inspection of Tracia's surroundings revealed a wall of rock a few meters to her left. It ran straight along a path parallel to the ladder above, meaning that it would likely end up where the ladder did, only lower. In the stone was a carved panel, with something that looked like a handprint alongside an inscription. Both hinted that the rocky panel was actually a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia stepped closer. The panel was roughly the shape of a door, if a bit larger. To the right, the handprint sat there invitingly and below that the inscription. Staring at it, Tracia read 'Store Room 1 - Teltus'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately two choices popped into Tracia's head. Either open the door and take look around or follow the wall to where the ladder would go. On one hand, the store room might provide Tracia with some valuable equipment. On the other, it might be a trap. In the end, Tracia decides to...</span></div></div>",

After all, she <i>is</i> the Queen of Theives, she's going to have to start doing some of that eventually. Entering the room, Tracia finds it well lit, but empty. Carefully scanning the room, Tracia quickly looks in corners and for places some tricky Elf may be hiding. Thankfully there seem to be none lying in wait in this storeroom. The room seems filled with rows of elven armor.  Perhaps \"Teltus\" was just an elvish word for \"armor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia approached the racks of breastplates, noting the characteristically small amount of coverage elven armor had. While made of a stronger fabric that Tracia's own vest, the hard armor stopped well short of her waist, and would leave her midriff completely exposed. While some could say Elves value movement over defense, the practice didn't make any sense to Tracia. None of this equipment could be fenced for more worth than a novelty, and she certainly didn't intend to lug sack after sack of breastplates out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the end of the row was a breastplate kept to itself in an open casing. As Tracia got closer, she noticed it seemed to shine almost with a light of its own. Yet strangely she hadn't noticed it until now. Tracia had practically walked past it before noticing it was there. Perhaps this one had special properties of its own? Maybe it made the wearer harder to detect? Tracia looked up and noticed above the breastplate the word \"Teltus\" again inscribed. Apparently this was the special Teltus this storeroom was for. This garment may indeed be worth stealing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to carry it, Tracia would have to replace her own garment with the Teltus breastplate. It may give her better abilities, yet it would still leave her more vulnerable than before. The Teltus was also made in the skimpy elven style. And there was no telling how much it was worth. Then again, there was still the possibility of elven trickery. Looking around again to make sure she hadn't been found, Tracia decides to...</span></div></div>",

The feathers were instead heading to her breasts. When Tracia realised this, she screamed in horror and struggled even harder but it was for nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tips of the feathers soon centred on Tracia's nipples and she screamed in ticklish agony as they rubbed from side to side over her breasts.

She turned to her left and saw the face of a smiling guard before she collapsed into a deep sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *******************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracia awoke gradually, still drowsy from whatever had been in that powder that she had encountered. She opened her eyes and saw that she was in a bedroom and a nicely decorated one at that. Tracia also noticed that she was completly naked and her hands and feet were tied to the corners of the bed she was lying on, leaving her in an X shape. At the foot of the bed, stood the Elven guard who had thrown the powder at Tracia. She too was naked, her body very nicely curved and with a beautiful face framed by long blond hair \"Glad to see you're awake.\" The Elven woman said \"Now I can have a little fun with you before sending you to the Cavern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tracia could reply, the Elven woman bent down and started to tickle Tracia's feet with her fingers. Tracia arched her back and began screaming with laughter at the ticklish sensations. The Elven woman dragged her nails up and down Tracia's soles, not stopping for an instant as she cruelly raked Tracia's soles with her long fingernails. She then switched to tickling each of Tracia's toes, pinching them and scraping her fingernails along the top of them. Tracia yelped with each pinch and bounced on the bed as she tried to escape the tickling. The torment increased as the Elven woman started to flick her fingernails across Tracia's toes, tickling each one with a careful flick of a fingernail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of pure torture, the Elven woman stopped the tickling, allowing Tracia to gain her breath. Panting heavily, Tracia eventually looked up and saw the the Elven woman was at the foot of the bed and now wielding two feathers \"Don't look too surprised,\" She said \"I plan to have a lot more fun with you before I'm done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou advised Tracia unwisely and she is now on the wrong end of a tickling.

Before she can even react, the trap is sprung and Tracia's leg falls through the trick stone before the hole closes up round her leg, trapping her good. Tracia struggled and pulled her leg to try to escape, only to stop when a voice behind said \"Oh good, I like being woken up for presents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elven guard had evidently been awoken by the noise from the trap and was now walking round Tracia, smiling in a most evil manner, taking off her helmet and letting her brunette hair fall down to her lower back as she sat down at the same height as Tracia. The Elven Guard reached over and suddenly ripped at the thief's upper tunic, exposing her body to the cool air. Tracia tried to cover herself up as best she could but the awkward position she was in with one leg dangling below the ground and another reaching up to her chin got in the way of her efforts. She barely even heard the guard speak \"I get so bored with guard duty at times, I do enjoy it when a thief tries to break in, really breaks up the monotony of the job. Especially is they're cute like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing ever so slightly at the compliment, Tracia suddenly felt a lightning shock go up her flanks, causing her to burst out laughing from the sudden tickling on her sides. Throwing her head back and laughing madly, Tracia tried to bat away the hands but without success, the Elven woman kept up the assault with patient glee. She also started to tear further at Tracia's tunic, soon leaving her upperbody completely exposed and naked. Tracia eventually felt the tickling stop and she gratefully started to breath heavily. Looking up, she saw the Elven guard taking off her armour, leaving her as topless as Tracia \"You know, there won't be a change in the shift here for another few hours. I'll have to send you to the Caverns eventually, but how about we take the time we have to get to know each other hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she's saying this, the Elven woman has brought up her hands and started to lightly tickle Tracia's breasts, spider tickling the globes lightly but with fast flicks of the fingers, causing Tracia to laugh but also give little moans as the tickling collided with a build up of pleasure, added to by tweaks from the guards nails across Tracia's nipples. The thief knew that this was only the beginning as far as the tickling went but maybe she could get used to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have advised Tracia unwisely (Depending on your opinion it would seem).

The guard is woken up with alarm in her eyes but being pressed against the wall and with her belt gone along with her weaponry, she was off balance and unable to mount a defence. Tracia looked deep in the guard's eyes and found herself blushing ever so slightly as she gazed into those deep, green eyes. She quickly broke this off however as she glared at the guard and demanded \"Alright, here's how it'll be. You're going to guide me through the Labyrinth and to its treasure if you know what's good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, the guard didn't know what was good for her as defiance blazed in her eyes and she started to struggle mightily to escape. Needing to get the advantage somehow, Tracia plunged her hand upwards, raking her nails across the guard's exposed belly as she started to tickle her. he guard's eyes opened wide before screwing up and she burst into laughter, muffled by the hand at her mouth. Tracia's hand was merciless in its tickling, scratching all round the stomach as she tried to find a single weak point of on her torso to exploit. After some furious moments, Tracia's finger found the guard's navel and she went to work in prodding her finger right into it, wriggling it about furiously as her long nail scratched about with no stopping as she tickled the dip of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elven woman positively howled through Tracia's hand, thrashing about madly in a bit to escape but got nowhere, being forced to the wall tight and getting weaker from the tickling. The nail in her navel was driving the guard insane as tears sprang to her eyes with each little wriggle Tracia's hand made. In less than a minute, the guard was nodding furiously, trying to break through the silence to show she had submitted. The tickling stopped and Tracia let her hand drop from the mouth, noticing the guard was smiling widely \"Ahhhaahh...\" The guard sighed, giggling still slightly \"Y-You win... I'll guide you. J-Just don't tickle my bellybutton again please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed that her fun had ended so soon, Tracia nevertheless let the guard go away from the wall, smirking as she looked down at her \"So much for Elven toughness. Now then, what's your name oh ticklish one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elven woman glared before submitting comletely \"Merion.\" She whispered \"My name is Merion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then Merion, lead the way to the treasures of the Labyrinth. But betray me and I won't be so merciful. Your cute little bellybutton will be mine.\" Tracia threatened, her fingers twitching towards Merion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face etched in horror, Merion nodded once more in hasty agreement, her wish to avoid being tickled overriding all \"Follow me then. And take care to step where I step.\" She said as she started walking down the corridor, taking care to avoid certain areas of the floor.

Merion moved them deeper into the mountain, the tunnel sloping downward and narrowing, until it was only wide enough for walking single file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerion glanced back sheepishly at Tracia. \"You are a very skilled tickler. To have such knowledge of the flesh, you must be quite ticklish as well, aren't you?\" Merion asked, seemingly trying to make conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk quietly if you are to talk.\" Tracia whispered to the elf. \"And my body is none of your concern.
