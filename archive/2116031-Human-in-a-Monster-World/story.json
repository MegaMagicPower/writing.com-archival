Thanks to the careful shielding of his parents, he has never really been exposed to monsters. Unfortunately human private schools cost and arm and a leg, so now he has to attend the first grade at the local public school. What awaits him at school? Will he make lots of new friends, or will he be digesting in the tummy of a fellow classmate before recess? One thing's for sure. Being a pudgy little butterball probably won't do him any favors! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle<br>\r\nAge: 9<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs an energetic 4th grader with short, messy brown hair. He loves sports, soccer and kickball especially. Kyle has quite a few friends, monsters and humans, but he also has quite a big mouth. Highly competitive, Kyle likes to tease and mock the people he beats. His biggest rival is Earl, a dragon at least a foot and a half taller, from the 5th grade. Earl has become increasingly angry about losing to Kyle. The two students like to bet, and the stakes keep going up. Pretty soon Kyle could end up taking a bet or a dare he might not want to pay up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle has an interesting home life. His mother was eaten by an ogre shortly after he was born, leaving him with only a father and an older sister. His father is constantly traveling for work so he's often left in the care of his sister Michelle. Michelle is a witch in training and currently experimenting with size altering magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey<br>\r\nAge: 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey is a timid blond haired boy in the fifth grade. Being shy, thin, and what many adults would deem 'cute' he'd make an excellent meal for most monsters. Well, perhaps not a meal, but a decent enough mid-afternoon snack at least. Fortunately he has protection. Not sharp teeth or claws, like some of his classmates, but something just as effective. Mikey has Courtney, a monster girl who just so happens to be his next door neighbor and best friend. </span></div></div>",

Sure, there are several human boys and girls, like yourself, but there are also monster children, the likes of which you would never have fathomed. Standing their in the doorway, mouth agape, the teacher turns to you and smiles, licking her lips in an almost hungry fashion. Not only is your teacher not quite human, in fact, she looks like some sort of humanoid ant. The first clue is her eyes, which are large and multisegmented, then their are the pair of antennae poking out of her hair, then their is her butt, which looks like the abdomen of a red ant, and finally, rather than clothes, her body is covered in an exoskeletal armor, covering her privates and her large bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks up to you, you freeze up in terror. Is this it, is this scary monster going to eat you? With a smile on her face, your teacher bends down, her multisegmented eyes inches from yours. \"Well, hello little one. Don't be afraid, I'm not going to hurt you.\" she says in a surprisingly kind voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, you look into her eyes, trying not to stare. \"R-really? You mean you aren't going to eat me?\" you ask softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big grin lights up your teacher's face, and she gently rubs your cheek with her palm. \"I wasn't planning on it. Why? Would you like to take a little nap in my belly?\" she asks in a gentle way, running her hand gently over her armored belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you have never had any inclination towards wanting to be eaten before, and you are too young to really appreciate girls, but the soft voice of your teacher almost makes you inclined to say yes. You fail to notice the light twitching of her antennae, or the gentle pulsing of her abdomen, signalling that she is using her mind altering pheremones to try to lull you into a state of peace. Besides being an effective measure to coax prey willingly into her belly, it's also a good way to keep her class calm and easily manageable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you say? Are you going to trust your seemingly nice teacher and take her up on her offer, or will you pass on it and take your seat?</span></div></div>",

Your parents told you to always obey the teacher and taking a nap sounds like a wonderful idea to you. A small part of your mind worries about digestion, but that thought is ignored. You nod your head shyly at the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer antennae twitch as she chuckles and pats you on the head, \u201cGood boy, now take your clothes off. I don\u2019t like the taste of fabric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head dumbly, your mind completely under the power of her pheromones.

With a wierd slurping sound, she pushes farther in, forcing your head into her throat.

Clearing her throat, she grabs her teaching stick, pointing at a diagram on the chalkboard.<br>\r\n\"Ok class, can anyone tell me what happens to food when it reaches here?\" She asked, pointing at the stomach on the diagram, looking at the class as a few hands went up. \"Sally?\" She asked, looking at the wolf girl in the front row of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food digests!\" She said, and the teacher smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Sally! Now, because of Nick here...\" She trailed off, resting a hand on her human filled stomach, it remaining still as the boy inside had no doubt gone to sleep, her belch earlier having drained some needed air. \"We actually have a live demonstration! Though it would usually take a while, there are ways we can speed it up. Would anyone like to rub my belly to help speed things up?\" She asked, and several hands went up, including the wolf girl's. \"Let's start with Sally, then everyone can have a turn.\" She said, the wolf girl coming to the front of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The class continued on, the teacher explaining everything that was happening as her stomach gurgled and groaned, slowly getting softer as the students took turns rubbing and pressing into her stomach, the shapes of the boy inside softening up, the teacher's lesson interspersed with belches as her stomach worked. Eventually, the bell rang, and class was dismissed, heading home for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------Scat Warning--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrading papers after school, she felt a pressure beginning to build in her colon. Getting out of her seat, her stomach much slimmer then before, she walked towards the  faculty lounge. Walking past other teachers sitting inside, she headed into the bathroom, pulling down her pants with a bit of difficulty due to her new added weight, before sitting on the toilet with a sigh of content. She loved this part almost as much as she loved eating her prey. With a twitch of her abdomen,  she sighed in relief as the first log was pushed out, quickly cooling as it coiled into the toilet, plopping into the water before the next log began. She moaned as she felt the bones interspersed in each lump and log that fell from her. She groaned as a sudden large pressure built, the coils of previous human coming to a temporary halt. Taking a deep breath, with a harder twitch of her abdomen, she pushed as hard as she could,  her tongue hanging out as something larger then the rest was pushed out of her, falling into the toilet with a splash, the rest of her waste coiling out as well. Panting for a few seconds, she grabbed some toilet paper, reaching back and wiping. Standing up, her knees shaky, she looked back at the toilet, smirking as she saw the skull, half buried in her shit. Giving her stomach a pat, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nick, hope you enjoyed your nap! Unfortunately,  I don't think my class would be good for you, though I'm positive you'll do a lot better where you're going next!\" She said with a chuckle, before reaching forward and pulling the knob, watching all that remained of her previous new student swirl around, before going down the drain, soon to be forgotten in the sewers.</span></div></div>",

He doesn't really have friends and does as much as he possibly can to not draw attention to himself. Somewhat of a bookworm, he likes to spend his afternoons in the school library reading and writing poetry. Dave knows he isn't the only outcast. A small harpy girl also likes to spend her after school time there. Dave wants to strike up a conversation but he's afraid to talk to monsters. She might be a kindred spirit, but she might also be more interested in dinner than someone to talk to. The only monster he talks to on a regular basis is the librarian, Ms. Carmela Rivera, a rakasha with a thick Spanish accent. He loves to talk to her about literature and is constantly showing her his poetry. She tells him constantly that he's 'cute enough to eat' but he likes to think she's joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex<br>\r\nAge: 12<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex is a nonconformist kind of kid who dyes his hair and wears black. He doesn't really get into fights at school, and he's pretty peaceable and easy to get along with, he just has a different style than most. Unfortunately thats caused problems at home. His mother recently entered into one of the exceptionally rare human/monster relationships. Her fiancee is a rather large drider with silvery hair. He sees Alex as a problem child and the two have talked about different methods of 'reforming' him. Not is at little worried, and he has every reason to be. Parents have the right to treat their children as property. It's not unknown for humans to self their offspring to different venues. Schools (for faculty meals), restaurants, and grocery stores all bought up children. Just last month Alex's best friend had been sold to a catering service by his legal guardians and turned into a birthday cake for a giant boy. Alex hopes to avoid a similar fate. Does his mother love him? And, if so, does that love have a dollar amount attached to it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven<br>\r\nAge: 13<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eighth grader who's generally well liked by all, Steven is safe in most circles. Steven hangs out with a rather interesting group of demi-human friends. There was Shelly, a large, spindly troll. There was AJ, a chubby Rakasha who took in more human calories than he could burn. And there was Emily, a giantess who, due to her species, had to take classes outside. She'd sit under the window of whatever class she was supposed to attend. Being so outgoing, and having such a diverse group of friends, Steven often puts himself unnecessarily in harms way. Sleepovers at AJ's, a Birthday party at Shelly's, going to a movie with Emily, Steven never shies away from a chance to hang out with his monster buddies. One day it might land him in one of their stomachs, or in one of their family members. Each of his friends has brothers, sisters, and parents who know Steven by name.</span></div></div>",

It's partially because of those traits that he has managed to survive for so long. Unfortunately love is blind, and stupid. This year he got his new Biology teach, Ms. Samantha Coils. Ms. Coils is a naga with aqua tinted scales and stunning red hair. She also has a decent sized rack. Brett usually can't help but stare dreamily at his professor as she slithers gracefully up and down the aisles, checking on students lab experiments. Recently she's noticed his gaze and offered him the chance to stay after school for some........ extra credit. Brett wants to but he's highly skeptical. Will he wind up as the teacher's pet, or the teacher's meal? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA senior with only one more year left, Arnold will be glad to be gone. School was never that important to him and he spent the majority of his time just goofing off and putting others down. Extremely muscular and intimidating aesthetically (skull tattoos, leather jacket, etc) he's always been a force to be reckoned with despite being human. Unfortunately his confrontational nature is finally starting to have negative consequences. A group of neko (cat people) freshman he bullied mercilessly years prior have finally grown up and become somewhat accomplished preds, maybe even capable of stomaching a meal as big as Arnold himself. The lunch lady, a hulking ogress, has tired of his pranks, and has threatened to let her innards have their way with him if he causes a ruckus in the lunchroom again. There are also a number of accomplished male monsters somewhat put off by his reputation who'd like to put the human in his place, a stomach. Worst of all the Principal Victoria Summers wants to have a word with him after school. Mrs. Summers is an honest to god giant roughly fifty feet tall. She's so large a second building had to be built, unattached to the school, to serve as her office. Arnold hopes he can continue to rely on his own physical strength and bad boy image to survive, but with so many monsters with their eye on him, his days might be numbered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin is a somewhat easy going freshman with messy brown hair. His best friend in the whole world is Tonya, a werewolf. Despite popular belief, werewolves can actually morph at their own digression, no full moon needed. The intimidating lupines are actually fully in control of their minds and, despite becoming a bit more aggressive and feral, they don't lose themselves after transforming. The two have an extremely playful relationship and Tonya likes to lick him and wrestle with him occasionally. They've known each other practically their entire lives and, though they're extremely close, Kevin is too afraid of rejection to ask her out. Tonya is admittedly bisexual and has had a small number of girlfriends, all of which of disappeared into her steamy gut. Tonya, who isn't particularly affectionate towards the people she's dated in the past, tends to poop them out with little or no regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Kevin loves hanging out with Tonya and his other friends, he has become increasingly wary of school. His homeroom teacher, Mrs. Gulpins, is a toad woman with a beehive hairdo and thick glasses. More than once hes witnessed his teacher unleash her long sticky tongue and swallow a hapless student whole for being tardy. She's recently taken to staring at him strangely and has done her best to try to catch him doing something wrong or breaking classroom protocol. Not sure what to do himself he's considering going to see Principle Summers. Despite humans having little rights, faculty aren't allowed to chow down on students without just cause. Perhaps his giantess principle could give him a room change?</span></div></div>",

His friends just watch as they always do. This time it was the neko curled up on the floor who picked the fight, but Arnold sure as hell finished it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as these losers have grown, they are still no match for Arnold. Now more than ever he had to remind them of that fact. If ever the nekos think to team up it would be the end of him. But that won't happen. They're cowards and by making an example of each individially, Arnold would keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his grades are below average, Arnold is no idiot. He knows what he's got to do to survive, and he knows that intimidation might not carry him safely all the way through his final year. Though it has worked well for the past three years, some of the monsters are starting to realise their own strenghth. What Arnold needs is people on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he formed a gang then it wouldn't matter if the nekos teamed up. Although a lot of the guys hating him, the power and safety of a gang in this kind of environment will surely appeal to those who don't feel all that secure in their place on the food chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn easier option would be to take a girlfriend. Arnold's superior strength is very appealing to girls, both human and monster. He's taken advantage of this fact many times, but maybe it's time to have someone permanent. She'd have to be a monster of course. A lot of the human girls Arnold has been with mysteriously disappear when word gets around, and he needs a monsters strength to help him scare off potential preditors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang and girlfried ideas are both good, but neither will help with the trouble he's starting to get with the school staff. There was a time when even the teachers were afraid of him. Low grades would usually earn you an intimate lesson in the digestive process but Arnold had always been the exception. He isn't the kind of guy who'll go down without a fight so he always got higher grades than someone who does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how times have changed. Teachers these days don't mind giving him bad grades, though so far they have yet to try and punish him for it. They probably expect Principal Summers to do it for them. The giantess probably won't try it this afternoon when Arnold is scheduled to meet with him, but if his grades don't improve, Principal Summers just might follow through with her threats. The only way to avoid that is to knuckle down and improve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere a three clear options. Arnold needs to choose what he's going focus on to make it through his final year. Should he form a gang, go steady with a monster or work on his grades.</span></div></div>",

Of all the girls his been with in the past, there are two that immediately come to mind: a gryphon and a werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it's physical strength that you're looking for then Gale Talons, the gryphon girl, is your best option. Like most gryphon's she's very territorial and gets jelous easily. In fact, when one of Arnold's human lovers disappeared, Gale would usually be noticably fatter the next day. This is something that Arnold could take advantage of. What better deterent could there be than a jelous girlfriend as strong as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a down side though. Arnold would have to have sex with her again. He's done it once but he doesn't really want to do it again. Not that it didn't feel good. Gale really knows what she's doing. It's just kind of scary. As stong as Arnold is, like a mouse to a cat, he is completely at the mercy of the gryphon when she gets her paws on him. And her size, she's taller than him when she's on all fours. It's a worry to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Megan the werewolf is a better option. Sex with her seems a lot more natural, and her strenght, even as a wolf, is not much greater than Arnold's. The only problem with her is her friends. The Pack, all werewolves in this school join it eventually. They don't like to bring humans into the fold but it's not unheard of when it comes to couples. Megan is Arnold's way into the Pack. They respect physical strength, and Arnold has plenty of that, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem getting in. Then he'd have the best protection possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which will he choose, Gale the gryphon with her superior strength or Megan the werewolf with her superior friends.</span></div></div>",

He keeps yelling, his voice getting hoarse after awhile. He soon starts to feel his eyes getting heavy, and as much as he tries to fight it, sleep overwhelms him. He passes out, never to wake up again. Ms. Gulpins wakes up in the morning, and notices that the bulge in her stomach is mostly gone. Her stomach grumbles, and she rubs her belly, joking \"I guess you're ready to come out, huh?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hops off the couch and makes her way to the bathroom, where she hops in and sits down on the toilet, and begins pushing.

Opening the door to his homeroom Ms. Gulpins notices who it is and looks at the time excitedly. Kevin eyes the clock at the back of the room. Oh no, he only has thirty seconds! Ms. Gulpins doesn't consider you 'here, and on time' unless your butt is firmly planted in a seat. Luckily his seat is near the front of the room next to Tonya (she ate the girl who originally sat there just so that she'd be seated next to Kevin). Rushing to his desk he sits down right as the bell rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya gives him toothy grin, \"Close one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\" Kevin sighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Gulpins ribbits in disappointment. Adjusting her glasses, she takes attendance while the class fraternizes. When the second bell rings the class gets up and starts to file out. When Kevin passes by Ms. Gulpins desk she reaches out and pinches his rear. Kevin jumps in the air a little. This is the second time shes touched his ass. He knows she's not trying to flirt with him. She's just checking to see how plump her future meal is. Kevin shivers slightly, it's kind of scary knowing that when his teachers bulging eyes are focused on him she's appraising him, as if he were a piece of meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to fatten up a little there Kevin.\" Ms. Gulpins suggests, \"It's not healthy for a boy your age to be so lean. You should really consider a strict diet of chocolate cake and chipped ham. It'll help you...... fill out.\" A thin strand of drool dribbles down her wide jaw as she looks him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er..... Thanks for the advice Ms. Gulpins, I'll deeply consider it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin exits out into the hall. A powerful fuzzy arm snakes around his back and gently grips his shoulder.

I'm telling you, go see Principle Summers after school today. You might be a human but you've got rights.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that teachers weren't supposed to digest students unless it was disciplinary action, but Kevin wasn't too keen on reporting Ms. Gulpins for harassment. Principle Summers was a towering giantess whose office was its own building, separate from the High School. It was rumored she'd fertilized Eatu Highs entire campus with bullies, but Kevin kind of doubted it. Certainly she'd eaten enough bullies to accomplish such a feat, but she just seemed too professional to do something so crude. Principle Summers was tough, but supposedly fair, and willing to go out of her way to help rule abiding students of all species. She might get Ms. Gulpins to stop groping him, but then again you never know. She was a maneater too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll..... think about it.\" Kevin shrugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya frowns slightly, worried about her best friend, but then she catches a whiff of something and perks up, \"Do you smell that scent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Kevin laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPivoting on her heel, Tonya turns around (rotating Kevin in the process). There's Beth, a sophomore girl dressed in camo, and an open lesbian, \"Check out those thighs!\" Tonya lets her tongue loll out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin just shakes his head, how could Tonya still be hungry? She still had half a dragon waiting to be sucked into her intestines!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to ask her out soon.\" Tonya says, half to Kevin and half to herself. The human boy just sighs and rests his head against her fuzzy arm. Tonya likes to fool around with the females. There's a nasty rumor going around that, once she's finished, she gobbles up her girlfriends. Being her best friend, Kevin knows all the rumors are.... absolutely true. With the number of disappearances racking up, everyone else should realize the truth too. He's just amazed at the number of girls still willing to risk dating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin looks up at his preoccupied friend. Truth be told hes had a crush on Tonya for a long while now. He wants to tell her but he's a bit scared of rejection (not so much the eating part, he knows she wouldn't do that sort of thing to him). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum.\" Tonya smacks her lips as Beth makes her way around a corner. Kevin isn't sure if the 'yum' is because she's feeling frisky, or because she's anticipating devouring the sophmore's thick thighs, \"Come on, lets head to class.\" Tonya says.</span></div></div>",

Once the doors closed, Ms. Trojan whines loudly.<br>\r\n\"I was so close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the elevator, Kevin enters the office, somewhat sadden that it was just a normal office, though on a bigger scale. Walking around on Ms. Summers's desk, Kevin notices that she wasn't there. A flushing was heard from a door and after the sink is heard, the woman in question opens it, surprising Kevin. Wearing a business suit with a short pencil skirt, revealing her massive (even by normal standards) cleavage and a bit of her wide, big, round ass, the brunette principal strolls in, rubbing her chubby stomach in satisfaction. Her hourglass figure entice Kevin, making fall in love her, until she stops before her desk and lifts her leg. <br>\r\nPPPPHHHHUUURRRT!<br>\r\nA large fart exited her anus and into the world, a deep sigh of relief from its creator. Soon the smell hits and Ms. Summers waves her hand to dissipate the smell from her face and rear. Being closer to the source and smaller in size, Kevin gags on the smell, catching her attention.<br>\r\n\"Oh my... Are you alright?\" She asks in a motherly tone, coming closer to the smaller human, clearly embarrassed.<br>\r\nCoughing, he signals he's okay and the both of them wait until the smell becomes bearable. Once it does so, the giant sits down in her chair and folds her hands together.<br>\r\n\"What brings you in today,...\"<br>\r\n\"Kevin.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Kevin,\" she asks, now in a business like tone.<br>\r\n\"It's about Ms. Gulpins. You see...\"<br>\r\nThe 'ground' shakes as Ms. Summers's farted again, her face red once more.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, that was my post-dump lunch gas. So, I'm kind of gassy,\" she explains, her face becoming more red and much cuter to Kevin's perspective.<br>\r\n\"Ahem, Ms. Gulpins has been pinching my butt, to see if I'm fat enough to eat and will eat me for the smallest action against the school, like being tardy.\"<br>\r\nA moment of silence, as the giantess leans back to digest the information given to her.<br>\r\n\"I see, thank for telling me this. I'll go have a talk about this with her. Anything else?\" <br>\r\n\"No, madam. Thank you, Ms. Summers,\" Kevin said, heading back to the elevator and possibly, leaving his newest crush behind.<br>\r\n\"No problem! If anything else comes up, talk to me. I'm here for you,\" she said, waving good bye to him as he leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Kevin is siting in his seat, just before the bell.<br>\r\n\"How it go?\" Tonya asks, coming beside him.<br>\r\n\"I'm about to see when the bell goes. But honestly, I don't know! Ms. Summers said she'll talk about it to Ms. Gulpins,\" he replied, uncertain of his future.<br>\r\nAs the final minute before the bell begins, the door opens, revealing...</span></div></div>",

He was an old changeling, a monster who could become any monster or human at will. This allowed him to offer his services to any monster or human. You had always seen him as a dragon, at your parents request. Unknown to you, the humans he could not cure, or could not pay, he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What seems to be the problem, Regina?\" he asked you kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problem!?\" you asked, surprised. \"Are you kidding!?\" you lifted your shirt. \"My scales are growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anyone looked at your belly in complete shock, half of your lower torso was fully covered in green scales with more growing, causing you to wince with pain. \"do they hurt growing in?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little.\" you said, tears forming. \"But its worth it, soon I'll be a dragon, just like mom and dad said I would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anyone turned to Duriana, concerned then turned back to you, smiling. \"I'll have to take a few tests to check on the speed of your transformation.\" he told you. \"I will leave the room for a moment while you slip into the examination gown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Dr. Anyone escorted Duriana out of the room, into the hall. \"I did not want to say this in front of your adopted daughter.\" he said. \"I have seen transformations like this before, they are extremely painful. Only one out of a hundred cases survive the changes.\" he paused, placing a clawed hand onto her shoulder. \"If you want her to survive, we have to make the transformation a very slow one and prey her class mates and teachers accept her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuriana teared up slightly. \"I love her as if she were truly my own daughter.\" she said. \"Please do what you must to make the transformation a slow one. I will call her school and inform them that she is going through 'the change'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Anyone paused, tilting his head slightly. \"The rare occurrence of which a human mutates into a monster?\" he asked. \"That's a long shot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regina's grandmother was a dragon, her grandfather was a powerful human.\" replied Duriana. \"It is possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will run some tests.\" promised Dr. Anyone. \"If I find that it is possible, that is what I will write in my report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, doctor.\" said Duriana with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you discovered that your entire chest, back, arms, and hands were covered in green scales. You opened your curtains and gasped happily at how your scales shined in the morning light. You were in considerable pain as each scale that grew into place felt like a bee sting but you were smiling in spite of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My finger nails are starting to change into claws.\" you whispered, shedding happy tears. \"I have to show everyone at school that I'm changing, just as I said I would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begged mom to allow you to go to school and she eventually agreed but only to half a day so your classmates and teachers could see you were telling the truth. You were ecstatic as you got ready for school but, like the other monsters, you wanted to show off your scales and refused to wear a shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, I want them to see how far I have changed in so little time!\" you protested. \"It's just for half a day... please!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Very well, dear.\" she said. \"Just remember what the doctor told you, take it easy, don't get too worked up, this is a very delicate transition you are going through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be careful, mommy.\" you promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school, the reactions from the students and teachers varied from amusement to shock to utter terror. Your homeroom teacher, a she-demon, with short pointed horns protruding from her forehead, smiled.

You are going to be going through a few things that... err... other dragons normally only experience during their infancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infancy?\" you asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" replied Demona. \"Well, for starters, your lips are not armored to protect them from your flame.

You immediately began to panic as you saw droplets of your own blood dripping onto your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your first flame!\" breathed Demona, as if she were watching a baby. \"That's incredible, you are progressing so fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H....

He let out a blood curdling scream and began to jump around, trying to put the fire out as humans and monsters alike laughed at him before someone came with a jacket to help but the fire out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry!\" you said, tearfully. \"It was an accident!\" then you caught the scent of his burned flesh and subconsciously began to drool. \"On the bright side, you smell yummy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy turned to you, horrified as you, again subconsciously, licked your lips and smiled slightly. The boy screamed and scrambled to get away, that was a mistake as it only enticed you to give chase. You were very fast and strong for your age, thanks to your mom and dad, and quickly caught the boy, your developing claws digging into his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" the boy demanded, struggling in vain. \"Oh, God, don't eat me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never eaten a live human before, only dead ones your mom had brought you when teaching you how to vore and you wondered what it would be like to have a live human moving around in your stomach.

You had swallowed dead humans and one live human whole, though not for long, but you have never witnessed a live human being osterized into a drink before. \"Does it really hurt them?\" you asked, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Swallow shrugged. \"Does it matter?\" she asked. \"They are dead in a few seconds so, if it does, its not for very long and they are very tasty.\" she looked at you, her curiosity rising. \"I'm going to have one, you decide weather or not you want some of it, to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked over to a massive refrigerator and pulled out a small girl naked girl, crying and shivering. Both her wrists were tied behind her back, her ankles were tied together with a fine string, and she had been gagged. \"This is Amanda Jenkins.\" said Ms Swallow. \"This poor girl was accidentally stung by a snake demon named Naga, they were best friends and Naga offered to die with her as punishment but Amanda forgave her and accepted her slow death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very touching .\" you said. \"You put her in there so not to feel any pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Swallow nodded. \"Also to slow the poison's progress.\" she said. \"Only a scale from a baby dragon can save her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, intently. What do you say?</span></div></div>",

It's what landed him in his current profession which is, perhaps, the deadliest job available for a human. Rob is, in fact, a dentist. Every day he's exposed to the maws of countless monsters. Some monsters, such as giants and the larger variety of dragons, are so huge that he actually needs to walk into their mouth to give their teeth a proper inspection. It's only a matter of time before he slides down the throat of a hungry client. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung, with wiry muscles and light brown hair, and a 23yr. old fiance named Laura. Stan is an excellent human specimen. So much so that he realized he could make money selling his body to science. Though test subjects can be taken forcibly, it's usually easier and requires less paperwork when they're willing. For the most part all he's had to do is swallow several tablets and drink several concoctions, which resulted in no documentable side effects. Today though he's taking part in an experiment that's far more deadly. He's going to be testing a new lotion meant to stave off digestion. After stripping down naked and applying the stuff liberally to his skin, he's off to meet the monster who'll be devouring him. If successful, he'll be paid a handsome fee. If not, well, he'll probably be flushed and forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis: <br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one for college, and a big fan of aquatic life, Louise decided to do freelance work as a deep sea diver. It's more lucrative than you'd think. The seas can be fairly deadly, for more than one reason, and there are dozens of shipwrecks each year. Louis is often hired to help track down and confirm the locations of said sunken vessels. He sometimes even helps with retrieving precious cargo. Unfortunately, due to the nature of his work, this sometimes means he has to come in contact with what caused the wrecks. Sometimes the culprit is nothing more than jagged rocks or a sandbar. Sometimes though it's something much worse.</span></div></div>",

After turning off the engine, he gets out of his car and looks at the building. The words VoreTech Labs are written on the side of the building next to a logo that looks like a stomach with a human inside. He approaches the front entrance and pulls an ID card out of his wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slides the card through a card reader that beeps and as the automatic doors slide open a computerized female voice greets him, \u201cWelcome, test subject Stan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan enters the lobby and sees a panther woman sitting behind the front desk. Her name is Ms. Filona and she\u2019s the clerk. The pantheress is about 9 feet tall with a glossy coat of fur. She\u2019s wearing a shirt over her three pairs of eye catching D cup breasts. Ms. Filona is known to always be grumpy and is a strong minded feminist. The last guy she caught looking at her chest was given a one way ticket to the inside of her hot gut, so Stan resists the urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Filona.\u201d Stan greets her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grouchy pantheress\u2019 whiskers twitch as she frowns at him, \u201cBah! I hate mornings!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho wants to test something on me today?\u201d Stan asks as he chuckles at Filona\u2019s behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Zorno and Dr. Kate need a guinea pig.\u201d She waves her clawed hand dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan nods before he walks off through a long white hallway and gets on an elevator. He gets off the elevator at the third floor where he arrives at Dr. Zorno and Dr. Kate\u2019s lab. He opens the door and enters the lab and spots the two scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zorno is a 12 foot tall silver dragon with his wings folded up against his back. He doesn\u2019t wear clothes, which leaves his rather enormous shaft in clear view. He\u2019s a little on the pudgy side and has a long tail that drags on the ground behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kate is\u2026 well, Stan has never been able to figure out what Dr. Kate is. He just refers to her as a mouth monster. She looks human above the waist with long blond hair and gorgeous breasts, but below the waist her body looks like a huge round ball of pink flesh 5 feet tall and 5 feet wide. The bottom of the round part of her body connects directly to two large feet, which causes her waddle whenever she walks around. The strangest part about her is that across the front of her ball-like lower body is a huge pair of lips. The huge lower mouth is completely functional with a huge tongue. Stan heard that those lips open directly into Dr. Kate\u2019s stomach. On the other side of Dr. Kate\u2019s ball-like body, are two massive ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two scientists smile at Stan when they see him enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Stan! You\u2019re just in time.\u201d Dr. Zorno exclaims, \u201cDr. Kate and I need someone to test our latest creation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Stan asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new type of lotion.\u201d Dr. Kate explains, \u201cIt\u2019s meant to protect a human from digestion. We call it Digestion Block, because it\u2019s like sun block except it protects against stomach acid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that could change the world!\u201d Stan exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly! Many monsters eat humans because they love the feeling of a big live meal squirming in their belly. The only problem is that digestion quickly makes the live meal into a dead one and the monster\u2019s enjoyment is cut short.\u201d Dr. Zorno says, \u201cBut with this lotion, a human will stay alive through the whole thing and provide a monster with hours of enjoyment!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 right.\u201d Stan replies. That wasn\u2019t exactly what he meant when he said it could change the world, \u201cBut how am I suppose to help you test it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zorno and Dr. Kate grin at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-oh!\u201d Stan exclaims.</span></div></div>",

This time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... To be honest, we've had some less than satisfactory results up to this point.\" Dr. Kate admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you elaborate?\" Stan asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Dr. Zorno starts, \"our first two test subjects didn't exactly come out alive and kicking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were completely reduced to shit.\" Dr. Kate laments, \"the lotion does leave a tangy sweet aftertaste on the tongue though. So I suppose, in a sense, it wasn't a complete failure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the flavoring is very good. Unfortunately we're scientists, not chefs.\" Dr. Zorno sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should switch professions?\" D. Kate suggests. The two scientists share a hearty laugh as Stan roles his eyes, \"So what makes you think it'll work this time, if so far all you've been able to do is produce a palatable lotion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't end there.\" Dr. Zorno explains, \"we made some real progress before we applied the lotion to our third guinea p- volunteer.\" He corrects himself, \"The lotion completely protected her skin. She came out looking perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! That's amazing!\" Stan gapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Unfortunately.\" Dr. Kate butts in, \"It didn't protect her insides. Digestive juices and bile managed to get into her through the mouth and vulva. The results weren't pretty, and neither was the smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, when she came out my backside I was very pleased with her consistency.\" Dr. Zorno elaborates, \"She didn't squirt out, or emerge as separate droppings, but slid out as one dry, solid entity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was real progress, groundbreaking even.\" Dr. Kate adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We realized something was wrong when we tried to congratulated her, however. Dr. Kate gave her a pat on the back and stool started flowing out of her eye-sockets. As it turns out, the lotion protected her epidermis, but it couldn't protect her insides. All her vital organs had been reduced to feces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what we were hoping for. Very unfortunate. On the bright side though, I heard the medical school we sent her to accumulated a lot of useful data after examining her. Not too surprising, she was a very unusual specimen after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there's always that.\" Dr. Zorno agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's going to stop the same thing from happening to me?\" Stan asks, still nervous as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, we've remodeled the lotion. It will seep in, and have more of a protective effect.\" Dr. Kate claims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zorno nods, \"Yes, it should protect the interior as well as the exterior... That's the theory anyway. Just try not to swallow any bile, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan sighs and closes his eyes. He rubs his temple furiously. What should he do? The paycheck for this job had to be huge, and both of the doctors were incredibly intelligent. If they said the lotion worked, it probably would, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two doctors smile, \"You made the right decision.\" Dr. Zorno pats him on the back, \"Now lets get you out of those clothes and apply the lotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next half hour the lotion is liberally applied to his body by the two doctors. The giant dragon kneads it into his shoulders while the 'mouth' monster, Dr. Kate, massages it into his hindquarters. Squirting a large glob of the lotion into her right hand, she grabs ahold of his member. It comes alive instantly. She begins to jerk him off at a furious pace while, somehow, never losing her straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D- Dr. Kate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of your more sensitive areas, is it not? It should probably have more lotion rubbed into it than other areas.\" She responds in a cool, professional voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- ... I couldn't agree with you more.\" Stan sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kate moves her face to the right as a small spurt of semen erupts from Stan's boner. She then moves her spry fingers to his ball-sack. She cups it in her hands and begins kneading it. The two monsters continue applying the lotion until Stan is giving off a shiny gleam from the balls of his feet to the tip of his hair. Stan gives his glazed arm a lick. Hey, they're right! It does taste tangy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain what's going to happen as you travel through your eater's gastrointestinal tract.\" The large dragon says to Stan, \"You're going to ingested, swallowed whole and alive. You'll travel down to the stomach where you'll be basted in a number of nasty fluids intent on breaking you around. The stomach will get pretty hot, and you'll be churned and tossed around for several hours. Eventually you'll be sucked into the small intestines. Things will get pretty damn tight but you'll manage. The intestines will also try to break down your proteins but, if you made it through the stomach unscathed, you should be fine. After snaking your way through the small intestines you'll be thrust into the colon. Things will get a bit roomier. Just sit tight and you'll wind up in your eater's rectum. You'll eventually be shat out perfectly fine, though you'll probably need a shower... or two... or three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, that was probably more information than I needed to know. So, which of you will be eating me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, neither of us.\" Dr. Kate replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Stan asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two doctors gently grip Stan's shoulders and march him off towards a test room within their lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just observing this time.\" She explains, opening up the door to the white test room. It's a large room, all white, except for a long panel of glass, most likely a one way window. In the center of the room is a large platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat and we'll send the other volunteer in to meet you.\" Dr. Zorno explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan shrugs, \"All right.\" The two doctors leave as Stan sits his basted ass down in the center of the platter. He feels a bit exposed sitting their naked, buttered up like a christmas ham, but he's also a bit excited. He might be the first human to ever survive a journey through a monster! In just a few minutes someone someone is going to show up and devour him, alive. He feels the stirring of an erection as the door opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems he's going to be eaten by</span></div></div>",

He stands there for at least 15 minutes, trying to decide. Dr. Zorno interrupts Stan's thoughts, asking \"So, are you going to agree to the experiment?\".

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Terry is a somewhat short, thin human, averaging at around 4' 7\" and 100lbs, with long black hair, a soul patch on his chin, and heterochromia(One eye is brown, the other is green). The heterochromia is a side effect of being born to a monster-human couple, with his mom being a 7 foot tall bear, and his dad being a regular human working the local mega supermarket, MonsterMart, as a minimum wage cashier. Terry's mom used to work at MonsterMart as a customer service representative, but she once got abit too annoyed by a human demanding a refund and to talk to their manager, that she simply ate him, ending in a feminine burp, and a talk from her supervisor. She got fired for \"breaking the MonsterMart oath\"(I shall never eat a customer, no matter how annoying they are or how delicious they look). She has since decided to be a stay at home mom, and has been trying to become vegan, as she doesn't like eating humans(mainly because that's what got her fired). She does slip up every now and then, however, like most monsters trying to put off humans for good. Part of the reason that Terry even took this job is to help his parents pay the bills. He enters the room, and is greeted by Dr. Zorno. \"Ah! Terry, is it? Welcome to your first day of work! Now, since our last test subject ducked out on the experiment, you get to be the test subject today.\" Terry quizzically asks \"Okay, what's the experiment? Take some pills?\" Dr. Zorno exclaims \"Oh no, no, no! You won't be taking any pills today. You see, we have developed a special lotion that is meant to stave of digestion, making getting eaten not a death sentence for humans. The ting is...we need to test it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry raises an eyebrow, intrigued by the idea of the lotion. \"Test it? How so? You mean...\" Dr. Zorno grins wide. \"Oh no. You...You can't be serious. You need me to...but what if...I don't know if I can...\" Dr. Zorno moves to Terry and tries to comfort him to get him to stop stuttering. \"Kid, you've got nothing to worry about. We've tested this lotion with human skin samples and stomach acid. it didn't damage the skin at all. trust me. you'll be fine.\" Terry finds it hard to fully pay attention to the dragon scientist, as he is abit disgusted by his hanging member. He manages to respond \"Okay, I'll...I'll do it. Just keep that...dick away from me. I don't know why some monsters refuse to wear clothes. It disgusting.\" Dr. Zorno responds \"It may be indecent to you humans, but we monster like to live naturally. Now, let's get this experiment under way. Tammy, i'm gonna need to to strip down completely.\" Terry, annoyed that the dragon had just gotten his name wrong, seemingly out of spite of his disgust in the dragon's shaft being freely visible, proceeds to take off all of his clothes, and gets mocked by Dr. Zorno. \"Hah! Look at that thing! You have a right to be embarrassed to be naked. I can barely see it.\" Terry, annoyed and blushing from the berating from the dragon, demands the lotion. He shouts \"Stop insulting my dick and give the lotion already! I wanna get this shit over with!\" Not a good idea to snap like that, especially around two monsters, one of which he already offended. Dr. Zorno angrily frowns and throws the lotion at Terry. It hits him in the chest, knocking him to the ground, as the dragon had tossed it hard enough to nearly break a rib. Terry gets to his feet and applies the lotion to his whole body. Making sure to put two or three coats on to be sure. He walks up to the two, ready to commence with the experiment. After some debate, the two scientists decide that...</span></div></div>",

Dragon stomach acid is abit stronger, so if Terry manages to survive a trip through him, than the lotion definitely works. Of course, because of the little spat with Terry, Dr. Zorno isn't going to be gentle. He aggressively grabs Terry by the arms, and proceeds to stuff his head into his mouth, and begins swallowing. After a few gulps, only Terry's feet are hanging out of Dr. Zorno's mouth, which he quickly slurps in, and with one final gulp, Terry is sent into the hot, steamy, cramped confines of the dragon's stomach. He hears Dr. Zorno say something from outside. \"Now, don't you start struggling and moving about. It gives me heartburn.\" Terry can hear the sounds of the dragon's massive heart pounding, as well as his guts making their usual noises.<br>\r\nThis ends up being so relaxing that Terry dozes off. He wakes up a few hours later to discover...</span></div></div>",

He realizes what this means: The lotion didn't work! He's gonna be digested alive! He begins pounding on Dr. Zorno's stomach walls, demanding to be let out. He's met with a portion of the stomach walls crashing his face at a high speed. Dr. Zorno has just punched his gut. \"I told you not to struggle!\" Terry hears the dragon yell from outside. He begins pleading that the lotion isn't working and he needs to be let out. he hears the dragon laugh from outside. \"You thought that was the anti-digestion lotion? Hell no. I just gave you a bottle of regular lotion.\" Terry's heart drops at this revelation, and replies \"What?! You set me up?! Was there even a lotion to prevent digestion anyway?\" He hears the dragon chuckle. \"Yes, there is, but I gave you the normal lotion because you pissed me off.\" Terry begins feeling a mix of anger and fear. \"You mean to tell me that you sent me to my death because I didn't like seeing your dick hanging out?! That is fucked up, dude! I'm just a kid!\" Dr. Zorno happily chimes in, \"Ah, and that's when humans are the tastiest! And that lotion only made it better. Tasted like vanilla.\" Terry yells that this isn't fair and bounds on the stomach walls some more, only to be met with a even harder strike from Dr. Zorno. This one knocks Terry unconscious. He never awakens. A few hours later, Dr. Zorno can feel Terry knocking at his back door, and rushing to the nearest restroom to relive himself. He barges into the bathroom and grabs the first open stall, and plops down on the toilet, and begins grunting. He starts slowly pushing the 18yr. old's remains out of his anus, and they land in the toilet as wet, brown logs with bits of bone lodged in. After about 25 minutes of clearing his system of the young boy, he finally finishes and wipes, then flushes and goes back to the lab. He sends an apology letter to Terry's parents, informing them that \"due to a malfunction in the lab, Terry was sadly digested during an experiment.\" Terry's parents are devastated.</span></div></div>",

Stan trips over the tail and falls heavily to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zorno picks him up off the ground and chuckles, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Stan, we've worked all the kinks out of the lotion, it's sure to work this time. Besides, even if it doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019ll have given your life in the name of science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t want to take the risk!\u201d Stan shouts as he struggles in the dragon\u2019s strong grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zorno and Dr. Kate ignore his protests.

He renews his desperate struggling but her deceptively strong arms keep him firmly pinned to her spherical midsection and against the huge second mouth across it's middle. Stan starts to panic as he watches the huge rosy lips of the mouth open. The lips open wider than he ever believed possible, the lips are soon far enough apart that Stan could literally step inside. Stan whimper in fear as the huge open mouth reveals a dark and fleshy interior. It's filled with puddles of disgusting ooze and a very strong smell of stomach juices. Dr. Kate's second mouth really does open directly into her stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Stan's surprise, Dr. Kate's powerful arms suddenly release him. Before he can get away from the wide open mouth however, Dr. Zorno laughs and gives him a shove. Stan screams as he loses his balance and stumbles backwards until he trips over the huge bottom lip of Dr. Kate's lower mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan collapses onto the slimy floor of Dr. Kate's stomach just as the huge lips slam closed behind him like a bear trap. Taking a quick look around, he sees that Dr. Kate's stomach isn't very cramped, it's about three feet wide, three feet long and four feet high. Dr. Kate's entire spherical midsection only has a diameter of about 5 feet, so that means that her huge stomach takes up the vast majority of the room inside her midsection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan puts it from his mind as he gets up and desperately tries to pry the strange stomach lips back open. But the inside of the stomach is too slick with slime and ooze for him to get a grip on the inside of the lips. The lips are ridiculously strong as well and firmly resist his efforts to force them open. He hears Dr. Kate moan with pleasure as she enjoys feeling him struggling inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan eventually exhausts himself and he sits down on the wet and disgusting floor of the stomach. He resolves himself to the fact that escape is impossible. His only hope now is that the Digestion Block lotion actually works.</span></div></div>",

Maybe the Digestion Block lotion on his skin converts stomach gasses into breathable oxygen for him somehow or does it give him the ability to breathe stomach gas like it is oxygen? Well, however it works, at least Stan doesn\u2019t have to worry about suffocating in Dr. Kate\u2019s belly\u2026 it would be embarrassing if his body survives digestion but he still dies from lack of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of surviving digestion, Stan realizes that Dr. Kate\u2019s stomach walls have just started secreting their acidic juices. Dr. Kate\u2019s stomach was already slick with slime and ooze so the stomach acid seeping in makes things even slimier. The acid keeps coming in until Stan is up to his calves in the bubbling liquid. Stan swallows nervously as he hopes the lotion works. After a minute or so, Stan\u2019s skin is still unharmed and he sighs with relief. Now he just has to hope that the lotion keeps working through the whole digestion process and doesn\u2019t wear off halfway through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kate's stomach must be nearly sound proof to anything going on outside her body. The only noise he can hear coming from outside Dr. Kate is the occasional conversation that\u2019s so badly muffled that he can\u2019t understand what is being said. However, Dr. Kate\u2019s stomach is not sound proof to things going on in the rest of her body. Above the noise of the gurgling stomach, Stan can hear Dr. Kate\u2019s rhythmic heartbeat. He finds it slightly relaxing and after 30 or so minutes, Stan closes his eyes and drifts off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan\u2019s eyes suddenly snap open as he wakes up.

Cold hands!\u201d Kate gasps in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan chuckles and keeps his hands inside her until her body heat warms them up. Then he pulls his hands out and slides his cock inside, making Kate moan pleasantly. The position is a little awkward due to Kate\u2019s large spherical midsection, but he manages to stay on by spreading his arms and legs wide and gently gripping her flesh. It\u2019s like trying to hug a giant ball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate\u2019s body rocks a little and shivers with pleasure as Stan starts to rhythmically slide his cock in and out. Her pussy is quite warm and wet, making him groan happily. He keeps humping for several minutes before he shoots his load just as Kate orgasms.</span></div></div>",

Ms. Filona is a strong minded feminist so he knows that he\u2019ll have to handle this delicately. Even though he\u2019s wearing the Digestion Block lotion, he knows that\u2019s no guarantee that he\u2019ll survive if she gets pissed. For example, the lotion won\u2019t be able to save him if she decides to \u201cchew her food\u201d into very small pieces before swallowing it. Sure, the lotion would prevent those small pieces from being digested but Stan would still be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you look quite beautiful Filona.\u201d Stan tells her in his most gentlemanly manner with a smile on his face as he looks at her face and resists looking at her six breasted chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as long as Stan has known the pantheress, she\u2019s always had an expression of irritation on her face.

Her feline mouth opens and closes as she struggles to think of something to say and her cat whiskers twitch rapidly. Stan swears that he can see her blushing beneath her black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBwah?\u201d Filona replies dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, well, the grouchy kitty isn\u2019t use to hearing people compliment her. She\u2019s completely lost her composure. Stan thinks to himself, despite her always acting mean and grouchy, she\u2019s a real sucker for a compliment. He may actually have a chance of getting her to agree to a date!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan decides to turn on the charm and keep acting like a gentleman, \u201cYour light green eyes are very lovely and your fur is stunning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilona fidgets in her chair and her blush deepens to an even darker shade of red. Despite her black fur it\u2019s now easy to tell that she\u2019s blushing even from several feet away. To Stan surprise, she\u2019s also unsuccessfully trying to fight back a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBwah?\u201d The pantheress repeats, still unable to form a coherent sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you do me the honor of going on a date with me this evening?\u201d Stan asks hopefully with a charming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilona smiles at him dumbly and nods before she once again says, \u201cBwah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan resists chuckling. Filona doubtlessly won\u2019t realize what she agreed to until she returns to her senses, \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll pick you up at your house and we\u2019ll go to a restaurant. What\u2019s your address?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pantheress keeps smiling dumbly as she writes it down for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at 7 o\u2019clock.\u201d Stan tells her before he leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the door closes behind him, he hears Filona swear loudly as she returns to her senses and her grouchy personality reemerges. Stan chuckles a little. It sounds like she finally realized that she agreed to go on a date with him.</span></div></div>",

She gives herself a quick examination in the mirror. Betty is one of the larger types of ogres and stands at around 30 feet tall. Her green skinned body is plump and she has chestnut colored hair. She has two small tusks curving upwards from her lower jaw which protrudes outward. Each of her huge breasts is larger than a full grown human and each of her titanic ass cheeks are twice that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking that her teeth are a healthy yellow and that her breath reeks enough. She sits down on the toilet and expels last night\u2019s dinner. When she\u2019s done she stand up and looks down to see human skeletons floating in the brown colored water. Betty smiles at the sight as she thinks, \u201cThat\u2019s one bus load of tourists that won\u2019t make their return flight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty then brings her green hand down on the lever to flush\u2026 and the toilet clogs, \u201cDamn it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe works away at the toilet with a plunger designed for such huge toilets but no avail. Betty leaves the toilet problem for now as she goes to get dressed. She squeezes into her three sizes too small female business suit as much as she can. Even so she is unable to get one her breasts in leaving it exposed. Her bulk stretches the fabric to the limit everywhere. The suit is tougher than it looks though as the clothes are somewhat magical. Betty has had it for years after she took it from a giantess (a pile of ogre crap doesn\u2019t need clothes anymore after all) and it has always been three sizes too small no matter how much fatter she gets. She wears it because she discovered that people find her more intimidating (and slightly arousing because of the exposed breast) if she looks like she\u2019s always on the verge of bursting out of her clothes. After she has shoehorned herself into the outfit she slips her feet into her high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Betty wonders if she should go into work or stay home and call in a plumber to fix the toilet. She not worried about the possibility of losing her job. She works at a marketing agency run by humans and regular sized monsters that are all terrified of her huge size. She once didn\u2019t go to work for an entire month and didn\u2019t get fired. It\u2019s not a completely free ride though. She still has to go if she wants a paycheck, but for today she could stay home if she wants to. Although one of her tiny coworkers has been looking at her with surprising interest lately.</span></div></div>",

It's the least I can do.\" She reaches down, wrapping her thick green fingers around his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... No that's okay; I'll wash off at home.\" David replies nervously as he squirms in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I insist.\" Betty states firmly as she goes to her kitchen sink and turns on the hot water. Despite the fat little man\u2019s struggles she easily removes all his clothes then holds him under the faucet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty please, I can wash myself!\" David squirms in the uncomfortably hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be faster.\" Caking her hands in soap she goes about sanitizing him. Using one of her plump index fingers as if it were a washcloth, she diligently scrubs every inch of him. She even plays with his cock a bit, until he explodes on her fingertips,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss!\" David protests feebly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't respond to his protests, she just keeps lathering him up in soap suds and washing them off. Soon she's done washing the fat human and wipes him off vigorously. Betty smiles at her handiwork. \"Now that you're all clean I'll stuff you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... What's that?\" The plumber asks in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, nice ass!\" She compliments, eyeing his big fat butt before she parts the cheeks with two of her fingers, \"Don't worry, this'll only take a minute... Hey, do you want to use the bathroom first? If you're intestines are full I probably won't be able to get very much in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- get what in?!\" He yells with a slight edge of panic as he keeps squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuffing! You know, bread, scallions, some diced up bacon bits.\" Betty explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no, just pay me and let me go home bitch!\" David shouts in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze suddenly hardens, \"Well I never! Is that how you talk to all your customers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the ones that try to eat me!\" He yells struggling in her grasp with all his pathetic might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop squirming! I said quit it!\" Betty demands as she squeezes him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the stubborn little morsel keeps struggling to the best of his ability, \"I refuse to be anally penetrated by stuffing!\"</span></div></div>",

She holds him over the sink again and starts to squeeze his fat tummy between two of her green fingers. David screams and his face turns red. The building pressure in his gut causes his bowels to explosively spill their contents into the kitchen sink.

The one thing you love about being a gremlin is how they maintain their size and shape as they shallow their prey. The human in his panic fall down and give you perfect shot at taking in his head with the rest of his arms as you make way to his shoulders. Next you reach his stomach as you take it into your maw and start to make your way to his legs. With a interesting display of strength that is common for a gremlin you lift his swinging legs above your head as you reach the crotch area. Finally after a minute of swallowing you reach his feet before take those into to your jaw sealing the fate of the foolish human. Even though you just swallowed a whole human your size hasn't changing at all (something about a gremlin's stomach being large to hold a macro and still maintain size you muse).

They can be, at any time without reason, snatched up and devoured by a hungry monster.
