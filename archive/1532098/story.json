What am I gonna do now?!?\"<br>\r\nWhile the Keyblade hero was trying to think, he heard two noises: a female singing voice and very loud footsteps accompanied by the sound of crushing plants. A huge woman was coming!<br>\r\nWhen the enormous footsteps became very close, Sora saw the woman: she was Briar-Rose! Sora knew about her thanks to Yen Sid, but she looked much more beautiful than shown in the wizard's book.<br>\r\nThe beautiful blond girl was carrying a basket and she was wearing her farmer clothes.<br>\r\nThe giantess lifted a bare foot right above Sora. The sole was a little dirty, some blades of grass and a squished bug were attacked on it. The foot went down, making a gigantic thud and almost flattening Sora, who managed to jump to his left. \"Ironical\" he thought \"She sings and shows her love for the nature, but meanwhile a whole little world is destroyed under her feet!\" </span></div></div>",

After some minutes of walking in that strange forest, Sora saw a group of mushroom edges and cartel with the writing: \"Welcome to Mushroom City\". <br>\r\nSora walked into the town. The houses were built in the mushrooms and the inhabitants looked like normal human beings, but they were much smaller. One of them approached the shrunk teenager and said: \"Welcome, stranger! Our town is pretty nice, but sometimes a huge giantess comes here and we gotta be very careful. And when she's gone, a lot of our houses are destroyed by her feet. I hate it when it happens! It's so annoying and so scary! I was almost squished once!\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sweet singing voice and the gigantic footsteps could be heard again... \"OH, NO!\" the tiny man yelled. A huge shadow covered Mushroom City. Everyone started running around in panic, while Sora just stood where he was: he was so unsettled, he didn't know what to do!<br>\r\nAurora stepped on a mushroom-house, destroying it. Then she giggled and said: \"I love mushrooms!\" Sora almost started to hate her...</span></div></div>",

The keyblade hero repeatedly tries to hit the barefoot giantess, but he's too small and he only can annoy her a little without hurting her minimally.<br>\r\nAurora's gigantic hand suddenly descends on Sora, this time the escape is harder because the giantess is faster and more concentrated. She grabs Sora and holds him between her index finger and her thumb. The hold is so strong that Sora cannot use his weapon.<br>\r\nAurora exclaims: \"What?!? A little man? Why were you bothering me?\" Sora answers: \"Didn't you notice that you were stomping a city full of innocents?\" The blonde giantess looks down and sees a half-destroyed city and some tiny corpses. \"Oh, my God! I'm so sorry for them! It's because I like stepping on mushrooms, they're so smooth and so soft... it's not my fault after all, they're so tiny and I'm so huge...\" Sora is disgusted: she's much more evil than she seems!<br>\r\n\"Anyway\" the beautiful giantess continues \"I don't forgive who hits me!\" \"Oh, no...\" Sora murmurs...</span></div></div>",

When she hits the ground she feels something moist and wet. She turns and sees that both her feet have been sliced off and that she's losing a lot of blood. Aurora beginning to slip into unconciousness says \"But why?\" before closing her eyes and passing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora climbs on top of a rock and says \"Because you hurt a lot of innocent people by crushing their homes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurray for our hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora looks behind him and sees a small group of reamining survivors. Sora says to them \"You all gotta leave here, if a another giant comes around it could lead to the problem like before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right!\" says one man from the crowd. Another says \"We'll re-build elsewhere.\" The crowd begins to move out into the distance making Sora say \"If they could move at any time why did they waste my time?\" Sora sighs and starts walking off into the distance to continue his own journey and hopefully get his normal size back.</span></div></div>",
