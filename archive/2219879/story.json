However, Papi had ended up coming with them. Darling just couldn't say no to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hung on him in their usual hijinx. Miia looked at them, anger in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was supposed to be my day with darling. Why did you have to come along. I knew him first he's mine.\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia couldn't get the thought out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That annoying little harpy is always getting in my way, I wish she would just disappear\" Miia thought to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia, Papi, and Kimihito walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had left the TV on and there was a documentary playing. It was a national geographic show about constrictor snakes in the wild. They showed as an anaconda wrapped around a chicken and crushed it before swallowing it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia had an idea. She was a Lamia, a snake, the natural predator of annoying birds like Papi, if Papi disappeared then they would assume she just flew away in the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would do it tonight. Darling was going to be away, he was going to see family tonight. </span></div></div>",

He was going to see family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had cooked dinner. Miia hadn't eaten anything, she would eat later tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to bed\" Miia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This early?\" Centoria said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya I'm tired\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good night then\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia slithered off into her bedroom and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours passed. As the moon rose Miia was sure she was the only one awake. She slithered out of her room and through the hall. She opened Papi's door and slithered up to her bed. Papi was layer out without any blankets covering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia slowely wrapped coils of her snake body around Papi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapi wouke up and saw Miia wrapped around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miia what are yo-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapi was interrupted as Miia constricted her coils. The coils slid against each other applying pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papi did you know Anacondas can crush with 90 psi of force. That's enough to crush the heart of their victims, and snap bones. They also love to eat birds. However I'm not an anaconda. I can  crush metal pipes using my tail, meaning I have a closer to 10,000 psi maximum force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia whispered constricting tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapi tried to escape but it was useless, Miia's snake body was solid muscle and the scales proteced her from and claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even squeezing that hard yet, you ready?\" Miia taunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapi tried to speak but there was no sir in her lungs to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia's coils started moving again. Squeezing tighter and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>crack</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>crack</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>crack</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia felt Papi's bones snap in her coils. She constricted even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> CRACK </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure was to much for Papi's fragile avian bones and her ribcage collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh already, you're weaker then I thought\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapi lost consciousness as Miia squeezed the life out of her. Papi fell limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well time for dinner, itadakimasu \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia unhinged her jaw, another serpentine ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with Papi's feet, as they slid down her throat Miia giggled thinking of how easy that was. Papi slid down Miia's throat, and as Miia's lips went around her ass she kept pulling Papi in deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia felt Papi's flat chest go past her lips and the head. Finally Papi's wings bent at unnatural angles. She bones inside shattered by Miia's powerful grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia felt Papi slide down her throat into her serpentine stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia felt Papi move into her long snake stomach. Miia picked up the feathers that had fallen and threw them out the window, leaving it open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia went back to bed, a large lump in her lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miia woke up in the morning the lump wasn't firm anymore. It had elongated and become soft. The enzimes her stomach produced were breaking down Papi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia went down to breakfast. She didn't eat anything, she was quite full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not eating anything, Miia\" Centoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already ate before you all woke up\"  Miia respond<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone seen Papi? She's missing and her widow was open\" Mero said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, do you know something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she probably just went out to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess. But I'm still worried. She might be in danger, she's a bird and could get hurt easily\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have no idea\" Miia thought to herself, as she felt a contraction push Papi a little farther down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMero stared at the bulge in Miia's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miia, ...... no nevermind\" Mero said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia couldn't think of who to eat next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They looked up and locked eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mero has to go next.\" Miia thought to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother contraction pushed Papi into Miia's intestine to be stripped of nutrients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast everyone went their separate ways. Miia stealthy followed Mero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMero got out of her chair and into her tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia snuck up to Mero's room. She slithered in. Mero saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miia, why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to spell it out for you. I saw you eyeing my tail earlier\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is true, thats Papi isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, she didn't last long\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY, ... why would you kill her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was an obstacle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia darted at Mero. Who was just barely able to Dodge. Miia struck again, Mero was too slow. Miia wrapped her coils of death around the helpless mermaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could crush you, but this'll be more fun. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia pulled Mero out of the water and started swallowing her starting with Mero's Tail. Miia wrapped a coil around Mero's throat to stop her from screaming and pushed Mero into her throat. Miia unhinged her law and started pulling Mero in. Mero struggled but couldn't put up a fight against Miia's iron grip. Miia pushed past Mero's ass. Then Mero's chest, she squeezed Mero's chest into her throat and with one last gulp swlllowed Mero alive<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia looked down at the squirming lump in her tail. Mero screamed for help, but it was muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe the door swung open standing there looking at Miia was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Near where Rachnes body went from human to spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls tightned around Mero as Miia squeezed Rachne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't hurt me, my exoskeleton is like armor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still have a soft upper body and you're underestimating my strength. Snakes are some of the strongest animals.\" Miia squeezed further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRACK</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachne's exoskeleton collapsed under tons of pressure. Throwing her insides over the room. Her upper body went limp and Miia easily swallowed it down. Miia went to get Suu who cleaned up the remains of Rachne that Miia didn't eat, not knowing she was eating a friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentorea would be here on Friday. So Miia had a few days to digest her meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curled up in the warm humid room to sleep and digest. She could still feel Mero struggling Papi had no form left and was nearing the end of her journey through Miia. Rachne's upper body was a lumo at the top, and in the middle there was a humanoid struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia could contract her stomach muscles and easily end Mero. But her struggling felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed, Mero slowed down and stopped. Killed by Miia's powerful stomach acid. Keep grew softer and Papi was ready to exit, completely digested, and stripped of nutrients by Miia's predatory digestive tract.</span></div></div>",

Merus Royal title didn't seem to protect her flesh from Miia's stomach acid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe added nutrients allowed Miia to grow longer by around 50%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> knock knock knock </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentorea was finally back. Miia opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is everyone\" Centorea asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they're waiting for you. Want to join them\" Miia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then close your eyes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oookkk, just don't try anything funny\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentorea closed her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia wrapped around her in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIIA WHAT ARE YO-\" <br>\r\nCentorea was interrupted by Miia contracting and forcing the air out of her lungs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentorea started to struggle. Miia kept an iron grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get to see them now. They're part of me now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia constricted harder. She felt Centorea's legs snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia used more and more pressure. Centorea struggled against it but couldn't keep up. Miia's serpentine predatory biology was built for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia felt Centorea's bones shatter I'm her coild but Centorea didn't stop struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Miia went for a killing blow. Miia contracted extremely hard and felt Centorea's bones shatter into dust. Unable to cope with literal tons of pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentorea went limp, the pressure had collapsed her ribcage, lungs, heart and more. With major arteries popping she suffered extreme internal bleeding and lost consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia kept squeezing, pushed by her animal instincts for upwards of 20 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia unhinged her jaw preparing for her biggest meal yet. Luckily for Miia, Centorea's bones were shattered, meaning she was considerably less rigid. Still Miia slowely swallowed Centorea. Moving from her ass up. Swallowing her horse body's and her breasts. With one final gulp Centorea disappeared, Miia slurped down her hair like a pasta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentorea was easily the largest meal so far. Rachne had been mostly splattered and Suu had cleaning her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next week Centorea slowly lost definition and grew soft. Moving through Miia's digestive tract and eventually joining the others in the sewer. Miia grew even more, now double her original length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia decided she couldn't really get Suu. She couldn't coil around a geletin and Suu wasn't really a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Miia reported them missing. It was investigated as a kidnapping. No one ever discovered what had actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kimihito got home he was crushed by loosing his friends, but grew closer to Miia. When he asked about her increased length she claimed it was a growth spurt. He accepted it, the thought Miia was behind the disappearances never even crossed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when eventually Miia and Kimihito married she never told him about the fate of the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
