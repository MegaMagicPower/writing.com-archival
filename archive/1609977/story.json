Actually it wasn't really John Goodman, just some demon that kind of looked like the actor in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotund, porcine demon fell backwards. In desperation it tried to summon a green energy shield. Buffy lunged at the creature, clenching the charm in her hand. Her fist went through the magic forcefield and struck the demon with enough force that it crumbled into dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy laughed. \"Score!\" she congratulated herself, \"Chalk up another victory for yours truly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen as if to spoil her victory, a green ghostly entity flew in, shrieking like a banshee. \"John! John!\" the thing cried out. the green ghost glared at Buffy with glowing eyes. \"You little bitch! you've killed my boyfriend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy shrugged, \"Uh, your boyfriend was eating people. I know that cultural relativity is a thing but that's not something I can let slide. Hope your next boyfriend is hot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John was--why you!\" the ghost thing was livid. \"Oh I'll show you hot, you little bitch! I curse you to not fit in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green apparition cackled maniacally before something happened. Buffy felt a sharp pain in her chest as her modest boobs started to grow. She moaned with pleasure and pain as the twin orbs pushed open her shirt and snapped her bra in two. her body felt on fire and her nipples stuck up like rubber erasers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy glanced down at her chest with . . . glee. \"Oh this is the best curse I've ever had,\" she said as she kneaded her soft boob flesh enthusiastically. Experimentally she pinched her nipples and winced as the soft tissue was twice as sensitive as before. \"Thanks, ghosty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green ghost laughed, \"Don't thank me yet, wait until the rest of your grows.\" And it was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Buffy realized something horrible. \"Am I going to get fat?\"</span></div></div>",

Moreover, they were off the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing off the sheets, she saw that she had ripped through her nightgown. In fact, it looked like she had <i>exploded</i> out of it. \"What the Hellmouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling herself to her feet, she saw that she had definitely grown in her sleep. Grown quite a bit, too: judging by the distance between her head and the ceiling, she was now 7 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on her bedroom door, and Dawn poked her head inside. \"Buffy, can I borrow... Holy crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the Scoobies,\" Buffy told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrial and a great deal of error taught Buffy that the only article of clothing that still fit her enlarged body was her bathrobe, and even that came higher up her legs than she was comfortable with. It was all she had, though, so that was what she wore for the impromptu meeting with the Scooby Gang. Rather than tell the same story half a dozen times, she waited for Dawn to tell her when everyone was there, then made her entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and I woke up this morning Andrea the Giant,\" Buffy said, recounting previous events. \"Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you recall the exact words this spectre used to curse you?\" Giles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Buffy said, \"she said, 'I curse you to not fit in!' So, I don't fit in any of my clothes, so curse complete, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles and Willow exchanged a significant look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy,\" Willow said, \"try to stay calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll work on that right after you tell me why you two threw each other the Buffy-is-screwed look, how about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Willow said, \"with magick, loose phrasing can mean a lot. 'You won't fit in ' may mean you're a socially awkward misfit, like Xander,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander opened his mouth to defend himself, but reconsidered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... or it may mean you're too big for your clothes, or... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or it may mean,\" Giles said, \"that you will have to be outside, because you literally won't fit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Buffy said. \"So there's a chance I might get even bigger. Any idea how much bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy had learned to hate a number of words since moving to Sunnydale: Hellmouth, Master, Initiative. But her least favorite words, she soon decided, were the three that came out of Willow's mouth in response to her question: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's now a few days after Xander saved Willow from destroying everything at the end of Season 6:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Buffy and Dawn were fighting in the graves, Buffy finally realized that Dawn has already grown to be a couple of inches taller than her. As the older sister Buffy felt that SHE should be the taller one. Up till now, Dawn had always looked UP to Buffy. After their mother died this situation had meant a great deal more to Buffy. Not that she would ever admit it to anyone. Being a slayer and knowing that they NEVER have any children Buffy felt that this was the closest that she would ever be to becoming a mother. From time to time, Buffy still wished that there was someway that she could live a 'normal' life. Anyways, after Dawn had gone off to school Buffy casually mentions to Willow about Dawn now being taler than her. Willow then said, \"Gee Buffy, Dawn's been taller than you for over 6 months now. Tara {she sniffles} noticed it first and told me about it. We even bet how long it would take you to notice. I guess she won {Willow's now near tears}. She even worked out a spell to learn how tall Dawn will eventually grow. That sure caused Buffy's eyes to bug out. I'm still surprised that you never noticed the past few months how much Tara has been talking about how beautiful Dawn's becoming as she blossoms into a woman. Buffy then said, \"Well ya, it's just that I didn't really pay much attention to that. I did have other things on my mind, like the 3 Nerds.\" Buffy suddenly needs to know just how tall Dawn will eventually grow, so she asks Willow. \"Willow dear, just how tall did Tara figure Dawn would end up growing?\" Willow replied, \"She said in a couple more years Dawn would be 5' 9\", 5' 10\" tops. Why Buffy?\" She then says, \"Well it's just that I would feel more comfortable around Dawn if I were the BIG sister. But at my age, it's not like I'm ever going to grow any taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy then feels Willow embrace her real tightly as she says, \"Oh ye of little faith [no not her]. Buffy when you have a world-class uber-witch as your best friend in the whole Universe, a request like that is easy to fulfill. How tall do you want to become?\" Buffy's eyes then light up as bright as a super-nova. After a couple moments of thought she says, \"Willow I think 6 foot even would be tall enough. I'd end up being a couple inches taller than Dawn and most of my clothes should still more or less fit me.\" \"Hmmm\" Willow said. They say that clothes make the woman. And you ARE a woman, Buffy. Buffy then said, \"Well it's nice you noticed I'm a woman, Willow.\" (Then thinking about what she might of implied) Buffy said, \"My bed's already warm enough now Willow. I don't need your help getting it any warmer.\" Willow gets a real big laugh out of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly 3 hours later, Willow re-enters the living room carrying a very old and dusty book. \"Took me a lot longer than I expected to find this sucker.\" Buffy now as giddy as a 6-year old on Christmas morning asks, \"Are you sure this will work?\" \"Of course it will\" Willow replied. \"Now Buffy I can't guarantee that you'll end up exactly 6 feet tall. They didn't measure things in feet and inches back when this book was written. It'll take me a few minutes to translate 6 feet into their measuring system. So you might end up growing a  _little_  taller than you expect.\" Now getting worried, in a very stern tone Buffy asks, \"Alright Willow, out with it. Just how much taller could I grow?\" Giggling a little Willow said, \"Oh I wouldn't worry about that. You shouldn't end up more than an inch or two over 6 foot tall.\" Hearing that Buffy says, \"Hmmm, 6 foot 2, eyes of blue. I could live with that, but absolutely NO taller. You hear me Will !\" \"Ya, Ya, Ya\" Willow replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow then tells Buffy, \"Oh incidentally, while I'm gathering up what I need to do this spell you should go get your favorite clothes. This spell allows the person's clothes to grow with them. This way, you'll save on having to buy replacements.\" Buffy does as she's told and in less than 2 minutes, nearly her entire closet and ALL of her lingerie is in the center of the living room. Buffy's now standing in the center of it all. Since it's now well past 12 noon, Willow suggests they get something to eat and Buffy agrees with the idea. So they go out for some food. A short while later Dawn comes home (this day was a short day schedule). Seeing the pile of Buffy's clothes in the living room, at first Dawn starts picking them up but then she decided to leave them all where they lie.(Except, of course, for Buffy's really cute pink-and white silk bra Dawn's wanted to borrow ever since Buffy bought it a couple of months ago.) After all, next time Buffy complains about Dawn's bedroom being messy she can remind Buffy about this mess. Dawn then sees the spell book Willow left open. Looking at the translation Willow had made Dawn notices an error. [It's in one of the ancient languages Dawn can both speak and read fluently.] Putting her school books away, Dawn's coming back down the stairs when Buffy and Willow return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey enter through the kitchen door and so don't notice that Dawn is home. Getting right to the spell, Dawn walks in on them just as Willow goes into her windup. Dawn interrupts them by asking what's going on. Willow only says, \"Buffy asked me try out a new spell.\" Dawn then asks, \"You mean the one I saw on the kitchen table?\" \"Yes Dawn\" Willow replies a bit annoyed. Dawn then says,\"Well THAT'S a weird one to choose. I don't see how it's going to be much use to either of you.\" Now also getting annoyed with her little sister Buffy says, \"Oh Dawn, let us women get on with our work. You're still too young to understand these things.\"  \"Fine\" Dawn then yells going back to her bedroom. Willow then finishes casting the spell on Buffy. After waiting for more minutes then she thinks necessary and nothing has happened Buffy asks Willow, \"why haven't I grown any taller?\" Willow tells her that this spell takes a while to work. \"Believe me Buffy, you'll feel it when it starts working.\"  \"Oh....   Ohhhhh, you're so very right I feel it starting to work now. Boy do I ever feel, feel  you know Willow.\" Buffy faints right there from the intense feelings now flowing through her body as it starts to glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Dawn has calmed down and returned to the living room. Picking up the spell Willow had cast on Buffy, Dawn then asks Willow, \"Why on Earth does Buffy want to make anything so big?\" With her focus on Buffy Willow only says, \"What Dawn?\" Before she repeats herself Dawn notices that her sister is now glowing and passed out. Raising her voice to be heard over Buffy's moaning \"I said, why does Buffy want to make something so big? And how come she's glowing like a gigantic firefly?\" Not wanting to say anymore than she has to to Dawn Willow just asks, \"Dawn you don't know what you're talking about. That spell doesn't make things gigantic.\" \"Oh no\" Dawn says back. \"Then why does your translation read SIXTY? Willow tell me what's supposed to be sixty.\" Willow then says back, \"Dawnie, Dawnie, Dawnie it says six not sixty.\" Dawn then told Willow, \"You better look at that again. I know my numbers and there's no question but you have written 60 down not 6.\" With Buffy's moans now grown so loud they have to shout at each other, Willow says, \"let's go outside and I'll show you you're wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside a couple of minutes later, Willow has just re-translated the section about size and still insists that it's 6 and not 60. Dawn then reminds Willow that the Babylonians used a sexagesimal (60 base) system and not the decimal system we use today. Willow ponders on that for a few seconds and then a light bulb goes off in her head. She has just realized that Dawn is right! Willow then says, \"Oh Oh. When she wakes up Buffy's is really going to be mad at me. Dawn help me drag her out of your house, while you still have one. Don't ask questions, just do it and then throw all of her clothes out in the back yard, too.\" So the two of them succeed in dragging a suddenly much heavier Buffy and all her clothes are outside before the spell really kicks in. Several hours later, after the sun has set Buffy's body starts rapidly expanding. As it does it begins squeaking like a balloon ready to burst. But fortunately for her, Buffy doesn't explode while she's growing to become a little over 60 feet tall. It's now late enough that no one will notice Buffy's new height until the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Due to Buffy's rapidly increasing weight it took Dawn and Willow nearly half an hour to drag Buffy's sleeping body into the back yard. By then, Willow was physically exhausted. {Being a witch she never bothered to do any REAL exercising} So not bothering to tell Dawn anything about what will soon happen to Buffy, WiIlow tells Dawn that SHE must carry all of the clothes piled in the living room into the back yard placing them next to Buffy. Looking at the pile, Dawn decided to first start dinner. Since she would be doing the cooking, Dawn chose her favorite food PIZZA. She took out 2 extra-extra large pizzas from the freezer and put them in the oven. She figured that by the time they're done warming up, Willow will be in a better mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow walking to the clothes pile Dawn unconsciously starts separating Buffy's lingerie from everything else. After a couple of minutes doing that she comes across her favorite nightgown. It has some kind of Demon fluid stains all over it and now she's furious with Buffy for taking it without asking her. {Of course when Dawn 'borrowed' Buffy's silk bra earlier that afternoon it was a whole different situation}. The reason it was Dawn's favorite, was because it was the last thing her Mother had bought for Dawn before she died. Dawn now digs furiously through the pile looking for more of her things. [In her haste to grab clothes, Buffy had emptied ALL of the clothes hampers in the house except for one in Willow's bedroom.] She ends up with a fairly large collection of her clothing, many of the pieces now have demon stains on them. Putting her nightgown in with her lingerie, Dawn starts washing the load with the special soap Buffy uses for her clothes. {It's the only solution that can get out all of the different stains Buffy gets from fighting Demons out of her clothes}.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn gets out the spell Willow had written trying to figure out why Buffy wanted to make something over 60 feet long or tall. Dawn knows that because she's a slayer, Buffy does have super-natural strength, but even SHE would have great difficulty lifting or carrying something THAT big. Then saying to herself, since Buffy wanted to make something really, really big I wonder why she choose 60 feet, Dawn substitutes a somewhat larger number. While holding the spell book Dawn says the spell out loud half a dozen times. Soon enough, she'll be an even bigger problem for Willow to have to deal with.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe oven bell rings and Dawn takes out the pizzas. Yelling at Willow to, \"come and get it\" she doesn't hear any movement from upstairs. Willow's is so zonked out, it would take a major earthquake just to wake her up a little. So now only half finished sorting the clothes, Dawn continues tossing Buffy's clothes on top of her now sleeping body. Putting her now washed clothes in the dryer, Dawn starts eating the first pizza. She just can't believe how yummy it tastes and before she knows it, the entire thing is in her stomach. Before starting on the second one, Dawn gets another two pizzas out and starts cooking them. She's thinking that there's never a problem with left-over pizza for lunch. It IS Friday evening so she doesn't have to go to school the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore those pizzas have even warmed up very much, Dawn has inhaled the second pizza. She DOES get real hungry when its her time-of-the month but not only is this ridiculous, she's over a week early! So while waiting for the pizzas to finish cooking, Dawn takes out her freshly washed nightgown. She intends to put it on over Buffy's bra. She had noticed earlier in the afternoon when she put Buffy's bra on, even though it was fairly large on her it felt wonderful next to her skin. Putting her nightgown on, or at least trying to, Dawn realizes that Buffy's bra is now much tighter than before. Dawn is now worried that something she won't like is happening to her. Her nightgown is now too small to wear, whereas before it used to be very large on her. Just then the oven bell rings and before she realizes what's happening, she has inhaled BOTH of those pizzas and put the final two in the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn knows something seriously is wrong with her so she waddles upstairs as fast as she can move. By now, her belly looks to be at least 12 months pregnant and she has great difficulty climbing the stairs to get to Willow. Not at all winded when she gets to Willow's room, grabbing both sides of the door frame Dawn yanks herself in as hard as she can and falls right on top of Willow in her bed. Which does wake her up screaming, because she's now being squeezed into her mattress. By the time Dawn finishes telling Willow everything, the oven bell rings. Dawn then yells out, \"Oh goody, more pizza\". Willow almost gets squashed again foolishly trying to come between Dawn and her pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they get downstairs Buffy's body can be heard squeaking loudly. She has begun rapidly growing bigger. After a few minutes, Buffy height has now become 60' 2\". Fortunately for Willow, Buffy is still out cold. Dawn, however, is another matter. Before Willow can say anything to her, Dawn has started on those 2 freshly cooked pizzas. Willow starts backing up as she notices Dawn now inching taller and thinner with each enormous bite of pizza she consumes. By the time she finishes eating, Dawn is now 6 feet 7 inches tall. It takes absolutely every last ounce of Willow's will-power to resist jumping Dawn's bones, right then and there. Willow does look at Dawn as a daughter or niece and so while her now much larger body is very appealing to Willow, having any kind of sex with Dawn would be so WRONG on so many different levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Dawn's still a virgin and a key the spell affects her differently. Her sudden appetite boost had occurred because the spell required Dawn to become larger naturally before it could start working on her. That was the reason for her sudden hunger and the sixth pizza did the trick. NOW Dawn has also begun squeaking like Buffy had around half an hour earlier. Willow hastily pushes Dawn towards the back door successfully getting her outside before anything else starts happening. Dawn is now totally embarrassed standing in her backyard. She's only wearing Buffy's bra and an uncomfortably tight pair of Xander's pants that she had ALSO found in Buffy's clothes pile. Xander's pants now look like a pair of capri's on Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow finally told Dawn everything about the spell which cheered her up more than Willow thought possible. Dawn is now way taller than what Buffy had been trying for, so she gets a lot more satisfaction from that knowledge than she really should. So much so she's trying to think up of some way to convince [MAKE] Willow to let her stay this tall and thin permanently. Although Dawn's squeaking is far louder than Buffy's, Willow has magically put a silencer on Dawn. That way the neighborhood won't be wakened when Dawn pops like Buffy had. Unfortunately for Dawn because she's a key she pops a whole lot more spectacularly than Buffy did, waking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mind you 6 feet 7 inches tall isn't all that bad, but Dawn's now a shrimp compared to her \"BIG\" sister. A big sister that's now fully awake and lording it over her. Buffy then unwisely said to her little sister, \"See Dawn it takes a professional to do things right. Right Will.\" Almost immediately realizing the advantages of her new size, Buffy wasn't mad at Willow one bit over her 'tiny' mistake. Buffy figures that she must now be at least as big as Godzilla or maybe she thinks Goddesszilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy's happiness is interrupted by Dawn starting to squeak again. Dawn has a worried look on her face. She wasn't expecting this to happen again and now her entire body feels like it wants to explode at any second. Not expecting this to be happening, Willow has a very perplexed look on her face. She didn't know that Dawn had repeated her modified spell 6 times in succession.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ironically because Willow had so roughly pushed Dawn out onto the back porch she had yet to see JUST how big Buffy had become. While Dawn had finished throwing all of Buffy's clothes on top of her body she had only been a little over 8 feet tall. So Dawn had quite logically but wrongly assumed that she would end up growing to be taller than that, like say maybe between 8 1/2 and 9 feet. In a few minutes, she would start seeing the world from a whole new perspective. So hearing Dawn's squeaking Willow had done what she could to save Buffy's house from imminent destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo even-though no one outside of Buffy's yard can hear Dawn's squeaking, Willow and Buffy heard it's deafening sound. Now awake, at first Buffy doesn't realize what has happened to her. She's still very groggy and her vision is quite blurred. Using her now extremely amplified voice Buffy asks, \"Say Willow what's going on here? Inside I feel like a balloon ready to pop and I don't like it one bit.\" Because Dawn's now squeaking so loud, Buffy doesn't hear one word of what Willow yelled at her. Now seeing her sister's body vibrating so violently, Buffy starts worrying about Dawn's safety. She moves toward her sister to comfort her and Buffy finally realizes that she has unwittingly become a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat realization causes her focus to return to Willow, who somehow seems to have disappeared from sight and sound. Willow sneaked around the side of the house outside of Buffy's new field of vision. She knows that she's in for it now and plans to make a hasty retreat when Dawn blows up. Willow figures that Buffy will then be temporarily focused on Dawn and not her. Dawn's body now blurs from the intensity of the vibration and Buffy's beside herself with worry. She tells the now terrified Dawn, \"No matter what happens to you Dawn, I'm going to stay right beside you until Willow fixes things.\" Dawn passes out when her body finally does POP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping with the sound of an atomic bomb, Buffy's instantly becomes furious with what she presumes Willow has just done to Dawn. Dawn is even more out of it than Buffy had been when SHE had popped. Due to the intensity of the feelings she experienced when Dawn popped, she won't wake up for several days. By itself that wouldn't be too bad, if it wasn't for the fact that she's now over 80 feet tall and REALLY stacked. While she's lying down sleeping, Dawn's body now covers nearly the entire back yard. Which doesn't really leave any room for Buffy to maneuver in back there. Looking at Dawn's now enhanced figure, Buffy looks at her OWN substantially enlarged bust. A fringe benefit from this mess that Buffy finds quite appealing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Willow ran away she wisely put a force field up around Buffy's house. No one looking at Buffy's house from the street or sidewalk will now see an angry gigantic Buffy glaring at them from her front yard. For the time being, Buffy can't go after Willow. She knows that she must be there when Dawn finally wakes up. There's just no TELLING how bad Dawn will freak out once she realizes how big she has become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By all rites of magic, Mistress Dawn Inga Summers doesn't even exist. In their great desperation to prevent Glory from retrieving the KEY to her dimension the Monks had very hastily sent IT forward to the 3rd Millennium. Because they had gathered together all of the 'Mystical' energy that they could detect, a time-vortex was created. They did not notice that due to her physical closeness to her KEY, Glory was also sucked into the vortex and deposited in the same city as her key. Fortunately for Dawn &amp; Buffy the trip stripped Glory of her ability to detect exactly where the key was. So in desperation Glory started systematically working her way through Sunnydale. So, in fact, Dawn was actually created out of the mist, which meant she could assume any age or body type or SIZE she desired. That is, once she learned how to manipulate the molecules of her body with her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the original Vampire Slayer was infused with demonic energy, the genetic structure of her along with all future Vampire Slayers was irretrievably altered. So while every slayer was fully functional as far as sex went, it was now impossible for her to become pregnant by a regular human boy. As usual for her, Buffy found a way around that problem without even realizing it existed. The first time Xander laid eyes on Buffy he was totally smitten with her spirit and her body. Fortunately for both their sakes it was a 'pure' lust that was without ANY violent intent. So a few weeks later when Xander was possessed by the animal demon at the zoo he acted out on his natural urges. Buffy's normal resistance to having sex was totally overwhelmed by the demon-infused pheromones that Xander was exuding. He got all the way to home plate and afterwards Buffy didn't even remember losing her virginity. When he was totally freed from the spirit's effect, Xander just thought that it was all a wonderful dream. He was so embarrassed about his 'dream' Xander didn't tell Buffy about it until after Sunnydale was destroyed. {At the end of Season 7}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of months later, with no inkling that she was NOW pregnant, Buffy had her final showdown with the Master. When she died just as the prophecy had foretold Buffy's daughter died with her. Since she was just a beginner witch Willow, had nowheres near the magic inside her needed to revive Buffy. She would've completely failed performing the task if Xander hadn't been involved with raising Buffy from the dead. Having already demonically mated with Buffy, Xander now had the ability to retrieve Buffy's spirit from any kind of death she experienced. The soul of Buffy's unborn daughter hitched a ride back from death with Buffy before she woke up back in her body. There her demonically infused essence stayed unformed until the Monks sent Glory's key to Buffy. So rather than being Buffy's younger sister, Dawn is actually Buffy and Xander's DAUGHTER!! A situation they would've discovered fairly soon had Willow paid serious attention to Dawn after everyone learned that she was in fact a \"living\" key. When Buffy's body was again revived after Glory's destruction, Willow had substantially more than enough magical power within her to rudely yank Buffy back from her well-deserved rest in Heaven. Due to the timing of Buffy's return, over the next couple of years, several actions occurred that wouldn't have otherwise happened. Also some others that should have occurred didn't. [Some of which WILL be mentioned later on in the story.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleeing Sunnydale with an ever growing army of enthusiastic Vampire Slayers made Dawn feel even more left out of Buffy's life than before. Dawn had become so depressed about her situation she tried using a spell to make her grow UP faster. She figured that once she turned 18, Buffy wouldn't be able to legally stop her from growing where-ever she wanted to in the world. Having absolutely no clue as to her true nature or ABILITIES, the spell Dawn chose succeeded in transforming her into a 50-feet tall and still growing teenager. Seeing the sadness in Dawn's eyes Buffy ordered Willow to do something about it. At first Willow thinks Dawn would appreciate having some clothes that fit her properly. When Dawn had grown into a giantess only the clothes she was wearing or touching grew with her. Now that it's a couple months later and since she's several feet taller, the few clothes that did fit her then are rapidly becoming little more than tatters. So Willow asks Buffy to gather together ALL of Dawn's clothing including her lingerie so when it's done Dawn can wear whatever she wants. It takes Buffy 3 trips to carry into the barn, where Dawn had been exiled to sleep, all of Dawn's remaining clothing. Willow then recited the spell. Her intent was all of Dawn's clothing would become big enough to properly fit her. Then it would continue growing larger while she grew bigger until Dawn had finished puberty. Wrongly assuming something that she shouldn't have, seconds after Willow finishes performing the incantation, all of Dawn's clothing start rapidly growing bigger along with EVERYTHING that Willow and Buffy were WEARING. To say the least, Buffy was not amused while Dawn's joy lasts less than a minute. She started crying when all of her newly enlarged clean clothing along with everything Buffy, Willow and her were wearing disintegrates into dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow getting quite annoyed with her, Buffy gives Willow ONE more chance to fix her mess. After pondering things for several minutes Willow snapped her fingers in victory. Saying to Buffy, \"I don't know why I didn't think of doing this before Buffy. I'll just do an equalization spell.\" \"A what?\" the now confused Buffy asks. Willow explained, \"You know Buffy, it's a spell where 2 or more things (or people in this case) are made the same size.\" Buffy then said, \"Well, if you're absolutely sure this WILL work right go ahead and make Dawn my size.\" [Buffy was thinking about the 3 inches that Dawn had already grown taller than her.] Not wanting to upset Buffy anymore than she has already Willow said \"Alright, but you know Buffy when I finish the spell Dawn will now be able to \"borrow\" all of your clothing. Because this spell will take a lot out of me, I'm going to have to eat as big a meal just as fast as Dawn does Buffy.\" Hearing that REALLY perked up Buffy's ears. So for the better part of 2 hours Buffy cheerfully {and a little too much so for Willow's taste} shovels food and drinks into Willow while Dawn eats a very hearty dinner. By the time Dawn finally finishes her meal, the 5 foot 6 inch Willow has now grown a 6 foot 5 inch waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow essentially immobile, Willow tells Buffy to stand next to Dawn inside the barn. The funny thing is everything would've worked out just fine if Kennedy hadn't tapped Willow on the shoulder. It was at the very end of the incantation where Willow was supposed to say the names of what (or who) to equalize, Kennedy was informing Willow that the Amazonically-built and statuesque Astrid Asgard, a 7 foot 6 inch new slayer from Minnesota had arrived. {Willow had anxiously awaited her arrival. She had told Kennedy to tell Willow the instant she arrived.} So without really realizing what she had just done, Willow then included both of them in the spells magic. Making matters even worse Dawn and Buffy's names in the spell were REVERSED. The magic spell then envelopes everyone standing inside the barn, INCLUDING Willow! The magically charged and greatly enhanced orgasm building up inside Willow puts her into a coma-like state. When it's finally released into the 4 other girls everyone passes out. Because she was the only virgin standing there in the barn Dawn doesn't understand what THOSE feelings were when they flooded through her body. It was shortly after midnight when Faith finally SHOOK Willow awake. Just barely conscious now [with a much smaller waist and a couple of feet shorter] Willow asked Faith,\" Faith dear, is Buffy very happy that Dawn is now just as big as her?\" with a very confused look on her face Faith replied, \"I really don't think so Willow. Why don't you ask her yourself.\" Over her shoulder as she starts running off Faith shouted, \"Don't worry yourself about it Willow, I'll make sure that you have a real NICE coffin at your funeral.\" Hearing that now greatly worries Willow. Slowly turning around Willow {still clueless about her new reduced circumstances} beholds her newest handiwork, a gigantic and now very steamed Buffy whose even TALLER than Dawn was when Willow said the equalization spell. Nervously smiling while she looks way, way, WAY up at Buffy, the only sound coming out of Willow was, \"whoops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Dawn had suddenly become a 50-foot Giantess in relation to her new, IMPROVED size her appetite had doubled. During the nearly 3 months since then, she had continued to grow bigger all around. Before Willow had spoken the fateful words, Dawn's body had also continued to mature. Puberty was being very, very kind to Dawn. No one there had realized JUST how much bigger Dawn has grown. SHE knew that her 30A-B bust had blossomed into a much more perky 32C. However even she hadn't fully realized how much her hips had widened. Her hips already growing from 31 to 36 inches {relatively speaking, of course} was the main cause for her clothing becoming very tattered. Dawn's rear was now over TWICE as big as before her giantization. It wonderfully accented her larger bust and still fairly small waist. With the sputtering she did near the end of the incantation, rather than shrinking Dawn down to Buffy's exact size, Willow made them the same size by accidentally COMBINING their two bodies shapes together! Thereby making them BOTH a little over 60-feet tall with hair flowing down well below each girls ass. Overall they both were now very voluptuous. Then again, Willow hasn't seen yet what has happened to the others she had included in the spell, or [more importantly to fixing this mess] that the incantation has substantially shrunken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill reeling from what she has done to Buffy, Willow starts backing away from Buffy. Just as she gets to the barn door, a shadow falls over her from behind and before she can even react, Willow has been lifted 40 feet into the air. Dawn then says, {to Willow's great regret} \"Buffy can I keep her? She's now the right size for my doll collection.\" Buffy grins broadly at that thought but then shakes her head no. Then from somewhere near the ground, Willow hears Kennedy say, \"Dawn, as far as I'm concerned you can keep her, Willow is way to small for me to play with like I like to now.\" Being the only one standing there who is still a virgin, Kennedy's statement goes way, WAY over Dawn's now 60-foot sweet head. It does however REALLY upset Willow. As loud as she can Willow {now in tears} yelled down to Kennedy, \"You don't really mean that Kennedy.\" A few seconds later she replied, \"Oh yes I do, shrimp!\" Dawn then started jumping up and down squealing, \"Oh goody goody, come on Willow. Let's go outside so we can play House.\" Willow's at a loss over Dawn's seemingly mental reversion to that of a six-year old. Willow also rapidly becomes dizzy from seeing Dawn's bouncing 36D bust. Now that it's the exact same size as Buffy, Dawn's going to enjoy borrowing Buffy's clothes. That is, once Willow figures out how to magically grow them some new clothing without it disintegrating into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Willow, Dawn spends well over an hour 'playing' with her. When she finally tires of it, Dawn looks for a box and locks Willow inside. Although still quite steamed about Willow's new goof, seeing how happy Dawn was playing with her new 'doll' Buffy decides to let Willow off the hook. At least for the night. Saying good night to Dawn when Buffy starts walking back to the castle, Dawn turns to say good night to Buffy. Within seconds, Dawn's giggling uncontrollably. Seeing Buffy's back side swaying in the air she had just remembered Buffy's legal name. When Buffy returns to Dawn half a minute later, she was not amused when Dawn [between giggles] eventually points at Buffy's gorgeously rounded rear saying, \"At least your real name now FITS your body.\" Before she can get another word out Buffy has flipped Dawn over her knee and threatens to spank Dawn (all night if necessary) if she says Buffy's real name. Dawn quickly promises to keep quiet. They then hug and right after Buffy gives Dawn a sisterly peck on her right cheek, Buffy whispers into Dawn's right ear, \"Remember Dawn, now that we're the same size now, so are you.\" That statement instantly took the smile off of Dawn's face. It also stopped the hic-coughs that had started from all of Dawn's giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was a nickname she had given herself back in the 7th grade. She had done that to stay in school. Her parents were High-school sweet-hearts and had even married before graduating High School. The area was fairly Conservative where they grew up so when a couple had gone steady for awhile and wanted to seriously fool around they were expected to marry. After all, if after 6 months or a year things didn't work out between them the couple could always get a quickie divorce in Nevada. Consequently, many of the teen-agers growing up there were on their second or even third marriage by their 21st birthday. The Summers-Smith's however were one of the many couples who did stay together long after High School ended. Her father went into the Navy for a career. Before retiring he ultimately became an Officer in Intelligence. {Buffy's father was the one who helped her get the submarine she used in Season 8.} Being in the Navy, Buffy's family had moved 9 times by the time she got to the 7th grade. In fact, they arrived about a month after the school year had started. Unfortunately for Buffy, several years earlier the Public School District's Board had voted to require all the students to wear uniforms with their names monogrammed on even in Junior and Senior High. Buffy's parents had been married over 10 years when she was finally born. Both the Navy and civilian Doctors they had seen had told them they couldn't have children. So they were overjoyed when Joyce became pregnant with Buffy. Knowing this would probably be their only child they spent the long months waiting working on what to call the baby. With about a month to go, they decided to flip a coin and whoever won would name the baby its first name. They also agreed that the loser would come up with the second name. Coming up with a more European sounding name Joyce chose George or Athena. Buffy's father chose Bobbie or Ilyiana, she was his favorite Great-Aunt who had emigrated from Russia. Since he won the coin toss he filled out the birth certificate as follows: Barbara Ilyiana Georgia Athena Summers-Smith. Since it was in his very flowing script neither one of them realized what they had just named their daughter. As bad as that was, it could have been a whole lot worst. It was only the day before her birth that they decided NOT to name her Barbara Ann Danielle Alexandra Summers-Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLearning about the school requirement, Joyce Summers went to the prescribed store to buy Barbara's uniforms and get them monogrammed. With such a long name to sew, the automated sewing machine decided to only sew on Barbara's initials on her clothing. During the week in school Barbara spent before getting her school uniforms, and having a very trim 17-inch waist nearly the entire school (along with most of the teachers) were already calling Barbara, Barbie. Which she really resented. Everyone saying it quickly realized that too, but they didn't care about that. Barbara was also under orders from her father to not get into any fights in this new school. He didn't want to have to deal anymore with parents complaining about their kids injuries. Although she still only a potential vampire slayer at this point, Barbara was extremely strong, flexible and agile for her age and size. In her entire life, Barbara had never started a fight but she was ALWAYS the last one standing when it ended. Having developed a very bad habit of getting up late in the morning, Barbara didn't even look at her monogrammed blouse when she hastily put it on that first morning. The previous afternoon Joyce had dropped the box on Barbara's bed without even opening it. She just assumed that Barbara's clothing read Summers-Smith not B I G A S S. The machine monogramming Barbara's blouses and sweaters had ignored the hyphen in her last name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 4 Ninth grade girls great misfortune to be the first ones to see Barbara when she entered the school grounds. Their leader wasn't about to let this weird new girl go to her classes wearing a blouse with that clearly \"phony\" name. In less than 30 seconds after ORDERING Barbie to go home, there were 3 broken arms, one broken leg and 2 sprained shoulders. Then the REAL melee began. By the time the Police arrived, over a dozen students and even a couple of teachers were injured!! Needless to say Barbara's father was ready to shoot her when he returned home from an assignment 3 days later. Suspending her for a month {which incidentally was the maximum punishment for a first offense} for fighting just made things worse. Barbara now essentially hated everyone in that school. At least when she returned to school everyone (teachers included) now gave her a VERY wide berth. During her enforced vacation, Barbara had decided from that day forward she would be, just plain Buffy Summers. It was never legally done, but then again really who is going to argue with a girl with Buffy's reputation over calling her B S!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of weeks before Willow's BIG disaster with the \"equalization\" incantation, Kennedy had hurt Willow. It happened one night when Kennedy was trying out a new position from Willow's very special copy of the Kama Sutra. Without realizing just how strong she has become Kennedy accidentally sprained Willow's left wrist. It reduced her activity for several days. So upset about what had happened to Willow, Kennedy couldn't even bring herself to tell Buffy what happened when she asked Kennedy why she was so distracted the following afternoon. Months earlier, when Kennedy had arrived in Sunnydale she was only 4 inches taller and fuller in the bust and also a couple of cup sizes larger than Willow. Being nearly identical in size physically to Tara made Kennedy suddenly so very attractive to Willow. So while she wasn't in the market for a new bed-mate at the time, Willow's body was subconsciously drawn to Kennedy's. Willow was lucky that Kennedy was immediately receptive to her overtures. Because they hit it off so easily, Willow didn't even consider that things could quickly change between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely 18 when Kennedy arrived, Willow was seemingly very ancient at 22 1/2. So while puberty had long since past Willow by, it hadn't started working its magic on Kennedy until shortly past her 15th birthday. While it wasn't working full-time on her anymore, that Spring when Kennedy had transformed into a full-blooded Vampire Slayer, puberty had suddenly returned with a vengeance kicking into over-drive on her. Since then she had been gained at least another inch each month in height and across her ballooning bust. When Willow had made her goof with the \"equalization\" spell, Kennedy had already become a quite stunning 6' 3\" tall. She would have proudly worn a 41E bra, if anyone made one that size. Also without realizing it yet, Kennedy had become far stronger than any other Slayer in Buffy's Army. That explained why she had so easily injured Willow. Kennedy was now at a cross-roads in her young life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach night she became increasingly worried if this would be the night she again injured Willow. Kennedy reasoned, quite logically, that as she was still getting bigger and stronger every single day, it was only a matter of time before Willow was again hurt during their nightly bedroom gymnastics. AND the next injury might be much more serious OR something permanent. Kennedy couldn't live herself if that happened and yet she also couldn't bring herself to leave Willow. So when Kennedy heard that Astrid was coming and just how big she was, Kennedy began praying that Astrid would be willingly help her with her sleeping arrangements. Having learned shortly after Sunnydale was destroyed that Vampire Slayers can't become pregnant, Kennedy will be shocked to learn WHY it's taken Astrid so long to come to Scotland. She has no inkling that Astrid has been extremely happy being a Mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason it has taken so long for Astrid to arrive was she refused to leave without her family OR best friend. During Christmas break while in 9th grade, a new family moved into her triple cul-de-sac neighborhood. It was kind of an unusual family. The two oldest kids were both in the 9th grade but step-siblings. Everyone of the 10 kids (no multiples) had at least one full sibling except for the boy. Consequently in a house full of kids he felt alone. Skinny as a rail and not yet that tall he looked to be out of place in High School. If he hadn't been placed in 2 of her classes for the rest of the school year, Astrid probably wouldn't have noticed him at all in school. So when he asked her to the High School's Halloween Party, she turned him down. Astrid figured he had been talked into playing some kind of prank on her by some of the kids she had seen him talking to just before he asked her. Already a little over 6 feet tall, at that time she was nearly a foot taller than him. A few days later, her older half-sister Julia told their father about the boy's Halloween invitation and he insisted that she go back to him and accept it. He even gave her permission to fight back HARD if the boy tried any funny business with her. So she was quite surprised over how gallantly he treated her at the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later, Astrid heard he had been sent home after being in a fight. She never did find out about it but a couple of much bigger boys than him had asked him how \"good\" she was in bed. To cheer him up, she went over to his house after school. When Astrid asked to see him his step-mother said he wanted to see no one so she left right away. Suspended a week for fighting (throwing the first punch in front of a teacher didn't help) he was in no mood to talk to ANY one from the High school. It took her several days but his step-sister Nerissa finally convinced Astrid to visit after Thanksgiving Dinner. The match-maker's efforts worked out far better than she expected. By Christmas break they were dating and it was only 14 months later on February 29th during their Junior year when they married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat year they had an early Christmas present, because on the Winter Solstice their twin daughters were born at her home, healthy and full term. When they had married it seemed more sensible to everyone that he move in with her family. This way they DID have a lot more opportunity for privacy. Which explains why the girls came along so soon after their marriage. While she didn't have any chance to be Homecoming Queen, Astrid was the surprising choice for Belle of the Junior/Senior prom. So a couple of years later when she was suddenly transformed into a Vampire Slayer, Astrid was by far the most resistant one to join Buffy's Army. Like several other potentials who happened to be pregnant when they unexpectedly became Slayers she had gone into premature labor. If Astrid hadn't been living such an healthy life-style her daughter would've surely died. As it was, her daughter spent nearly 2 months in the Hospital before being released weighing just over 6 pounds. That summer her husband needed to take 2 final classes to earn his Associates Degree which they really badly needed for their future. So 4 days after his last final, Astrid's family along with her best friend were packed for Scotland. Arriving on that fateful day, Astrid had absolutely no clue about what would soon happen to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid had been lucky her husband Harold Tallman (ironic name) at grown to be 2.25 meters tall, ending up less than 1 1/2 inches shorter than her. He also filled out quite handsomely and they both now weighed 22 stone. {308 pounds or 140 kg} Interestingly, once they were living together his body really started growing up. It almost seemed as tho Mother Nature WANTED their bodies to be fairly close to the same size. Seeing Faith on their arrival, Kennedy was notified about their newest recruits arrival. While the rest of her group were being shown to their new quarters, Kennedy took Astrid to her fateful rendezvous with Willow. When the incantation unexpectedly engulfed them along with Buffy, Dawn and Willow, Astrid instantly thought, \"Maybe, I should have turned these women down, after all.\" So when things cleared up and Astrid didn't seem changed, she relaxed a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that really wasn't the case, at all. While the spell had been a disaster as far as Buffy AND Dawn were concerned, the silly thing had worked perfectly on Kennedy and Astrid. Kennedy was now 7 1/2 feet tall with a body identical in size and every other way to Astrid's. Realizing that she's just grown another 15 inches taller Kennedy nearly faints from joy. With Willow now unconscious and not knowing how long before she'll wake up from the effects of the spell, Kennedy hastily asked Astrid for her help. She figured that Willow couldn't object if Kennedy offered to share her room [ahem, bed] with Astrid while she settled in. Incorrectly assuming that ALL Slayers were lesbian, Kennedy couldn't fathom why Astrid slapped her to ground with a very forceful \"NO WAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow crying worse than she had since she was 3, Astrid instinctively hugged Kennedy. Which only confused her more about Astrid. Kennedy then broke down and spent over an hour spilling her guts to Astrid telling her EVERYTHING, about her really \"close\" friendship with Willow. Now seeing the pain Kennedy is suffering Astrid offers to help her with at least some with her problem. Kennedy instantly cheers up again wrongly assuming Astrid will share her bed. Especially when Astrid asks Kennedy to take her to her room. After hitting her head on a couple of doorways [Astrid's home had 9 foot or higher ceilings, both upstairs and down], she remembers to start ducking. So now she tells Kennedy to stay there and DON\"T undress while she goes for a walk to think things through. About half an hour before Willow is finally wakened by Faith, Astrid has come up with a solution (of sorts) for Kennedy's problem. Within minutes she willingly but reluctantly accepts Astrid's offer. This is why Kennedy told Willow she was leaving her so abruptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
