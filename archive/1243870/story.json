It had been a long day of shooting in a cramped basement and production was wrapping on yet another fine giant woman movie.  Eager to oblige, Kerri assumed a sprawled out position on the street of the model city, overturned model cars and toy soldiers strewn about from the filming of previous scenes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd..Action!\u201d  Kerri gingerly lifted the toy tree up from the sidewalk that fronted one of many model office buildings erected around her 5\u20194\u201d frame. The toy city gave the illusion Kerri was some 500 feet tall.  Kerri closely examined the tree, playing up the part of a giant woman terrorizing yet another city as she smiled in satisfaction down to one matchbox car.  YOU CAN\u2019T STOP ME, Kerri purred down to the toy people, hamming it for the camera as she tossed the object over her shoulder.  \u201cAnd..cut,\u201d the director snapped.  \u201cThat was awesome, Kerri. Thanks for another great job!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, that was pretty cool. Awesome, actually (Kerri smiling). Gosh, when will editing be completed?\u201d Kerri asked as she wrapped her bikini-clad body in a bath robe. \u201cMega Kerri 2.0 will probably be edited and posted for sale in two weeks,\u201d the director assured her. \u201cThe effects, video, audio will blow everyone away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri was satisfied with her work and the pay, but anxiously awaiting a well-deserved vacation of sand and sun in the California resort town of Pleasanton, a popular destination for sun worshippers near the border with Mexico and within a short driving distance of Kelston, a large California city with a population of 5 million known for its vibrant downtown and active nightlife along the Kelston River.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri had arranged for a car service to pick her up directly from the shoot. She had packed her belongings the night before since her flight left that night at 8PM.  \u201cThis is gonna be so relaxing and I can\u2019t wait to fit into my new bikini,\u201d Kerri thought to herself as the car approached the airport.  As the driver unloaded her luggage from the trunk and placed them on the curb for check-in, Kerri couldn\u2019t help but notice two men staring in her direction, obviously chatting about her. \u201cShit, betcha they\u2019ve seen too many giantess movies.  Hope they don\u2019t bother me,\u201d Kerri mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving checked in and completed screening without being recognized or bothered, Kerri settled in at her gate, nestled in her seat as she absorbed herself in a chic lit novel she picked up at the gift shop.  Then it happened.  Half way through page ten of the Friendship Test, the two eerie men casually walked up to Kerri, smiling from ear to ear as Kerri tried like hell to not notice them.  Kerri was mortified.  \u201cGod, I\u2019m almost on the beach, why must I be bothered?\u201d Kerri thought to herself as the men stood before her.  \u201cMs. Taylor, we loved you in Mega Kerri, when are you gonna be makin\u2019 the sequel?\u201d the one man asked as he sat down next to an uncomfortable Kerri. \u201cUh, that\u2019s nice you like it.  The sequel should be coming out soon, but not before I go on vacation.  In fact, I\u2019m feeling a little under the weather and I really shouldn\u2019t be socializing,\u201d Kerri spoke softly, face blushing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops!\u201d the other man still standing cried out as he accidentally spilled a gooey substance on Kerri.  \u201cWhat the hell is that stuff?\u201d Kerri belted out in disgust as she wiped the goop off her arm.  \u201cGross, how did you get past security with that shit?\u201d  \u201cPlease, just leave me alone,\u201d Kerri pleaded as her face turned angry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men left in an awkward hurry, surely embarrassed at leaving a poor first impression on a person they admired.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The warm water and 85 degree temperature made her forget that it was Monday morning, that millions in the nearby city dredged off to work, and other burdening responsibilities..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri had already applied a generous helping of buttermilk sun lotion to protect her silky skin from the radiant sun\u2019s intense glow.  Dark hair pulled back in a cute ponytail, her lips glowed from the cocoanut gloss needed to prevent them from chapping from the heat.  But mostly, Kerri relished showing off her new Victoria\u2019s Secret bikini, a halter top and lo-rise bottom in a beachy, fashionable floral pattern.  It was a no-brainer purchase.  A pink flower she purchased at the hotel, was neatly tucked in her hair.  Kicking back, Kerri adjusted the volume on her iPhone as Gwen Stefani sang into her ear.  The gentle breeze brewed up hypnotic waves that rocked Kerri\u2019s baby blue inflatable raft and put the content bathing beauty into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly 10:30 A.M., Kerri had been asleep now for an hour as the warm currents of Kelston Bay gradually carried her out further from the beach.  The further out she floated, the deeper in sleep she fell.  The deep rest seemed to trigger a reaction, one that made the woman\u2019s arms, legs and other body parts stretch and lengthen.  The area of her arm that had been splattered the night before pulsated as even her raft and iPhone enlarged in proportion to Kerri\u2019s growth.  An observer from the air might not be the wiser as to just how big she had just grown, the open water providing little means of comparison or proportion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in an isolated section of the bay as she glided slowly toward the mouth of the Kelston River, Kerri was a sight of contentment.  The only sounds within in her immediate vicinity were the tussle of waves and a light snore escaping from her mouth and nose.  The sounds of traffic and bustle of the big city, still distant, were about to greet a most relaxed woman.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I repeat, May Day! we are issuing a distress call!\u201d  It was all in vein.  The Coast Guard rescue ship was blindsided by the mysterious object, wrestling it and its crew beneath the water\u2019s surface with cruel efficiency, leaving nothing more than bubbles on the water\u2019s surface in its wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, you wouldn\u2019t believe what my boyfriend did to me in bed last night,\u201d Jessica, wide-eyed and excited exclaimed to Shauna sitting across from her as they started their lunch at the restaurant Pri Jardin, sun glistening outside their window.  \u201cOh, betcha not better than the night I had,\u201d Shauna teased.  \u201cWell, he started to ..ya know\u2026what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jessica inquired of Shauna, head turned and eyes glued toward the direction of the window.  \u201cHoly shit, what in the fuck is that?\u201d  Jessica and Shauna joined several other patrons as they approached the restaurant\u2019s large window that looked over the Kelston River.  The sound of clanking utensils was replaced by gasps and awes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, I am begging you and the rest of these people to avoid the city streets and park your car.  These roads are closed.  If you refuse to obey, you will be arrested,\u2019 the officer scolded a driver of an SUV.  \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I have a very important meeting in 15 minutes,\u201d the angry motorist whined to his passenger. \u201cShit, I guess I\u2019ll just have to walk.\u201d  \u201cSir, sir, what seems to be the trouble?  Why are all the roads backed up?  I need to get across town for to meet my parents at the hospital,\u201d a young female college student pleaded.  \u201cWe are merely talking precautions regarding an oil tanker that has run aground along the Kelston.  Please be patient,\u201d the officer bravely lied to the driver.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, Ok keep going. I\u2019m amazed how fast all this traffic is moving across this bridge this morning.  God, I\u2019ve never seen so many cars and trucks move so quickly at this hour,\u201d Joe boasted to his wife, Emma, as the couple made their way downtown for an afternoon ballgame.  BOOM. \u201cWatch out!\u201d Emma shouted as the bridge shook with heart-stopping jolt as several cars traveling in front of them steered out of control, colliding into each other.  One such vehicle veered into the guardrail at high speed landing with front wheels suspended over the Kelston River.  \u201cThat felt like an earthquake.  Holy shit!\u201d Aftershocks continued to vibrate across the four lane concrete bridge, the sensation like waves to passengers on a ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe and Emma sat stunned for about thirty seconds, observing the wrecked cars in front of them, when Joe peered into his rearview mirror to see hoards of people exiting their cars and trucks, some running, other milling about in a state of curiosity.  \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Joe asked as his heart raced.  \u201cI\u2019m not waiting around to see what happens,\u201d Joe heard one woman mutter ass she passed his vehicle in a panic. \u201cGee, do you smell that?\u201d Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMMM, UH, OOOH! MMMPH.  The sounds of a semi-conscious Kerri softly blanketed the immediate vicinity on the vast suspended roadway.  Subdued conversations and rustling cell phone cameras on the bridge\u2019s surface replaced the rumble of cars as people gathered cautiously at the bridge\u2019s sidewalk that separated them from the water\u2019s surface twenty feet below.  \u201cWhat do you think happened to her?\u201d a girl asked of her boyfriend. \u201cShe\u2019s ginormous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOOOH, Huh, Kerri puffed as she began to wake from a deeper-than-normal sleep.  Her raft, which was so big all the vehicles on the roadway seemed like model cars in comparison, had nestled against the bridge in a parallel fashion.  Its 200 feet of baby blue rubber spanned a fifth of the bridge\u2019s length as Kerri\u2019s arm relaxed on the float\u2019s arm rests, seemingly inches from gawking motorists and their cars.  Cell phone cameras continued to shutter as some people began to back away.  Kerri\u2019s fingers began to claw and curl  as her eyelids flickered.  People were spooked when Kerri\u2019s impossibly long legs shifted and rubbed against the raft, creating a loud krrplurp sound.  The scene was quiet enough to make out the sexy sounds of Gwen Stefani on Kerri\u2019s iPhone, which remarkably continued to pipe music into the giant\u2019s ears.  The air was saturated with aroma of buttermilk sun lotion.  Some people were blinded by the intense reflection of the sun off of Kerri\u2019s silky skin. Others could make out their reflection on Kerri\u2019s rock hard stomach as they watched rivers formed by the combination of sweat and lotion meander and flow around her belly button and drop onto the moist raft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWITH A FLICK OF THE WRIST<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri\u2019s bold lashes fluttered in a seeming flash as her big brown eyes made direct contact with all the people on the bridge as she woke from slumber.  Startled by the presence of so many people in an unfamiliar place, this wasn\u2019t any beach she immediately reasoned, Kerri\u2019s left wrist flailed, as her lengthy fingers, accented with perfectly painted fingernails, chafed the roadway, sending a pickup truck and a sports car into the air, landing on several other vehicles, injuring ten people.  Kerri, now rubbing her eyes, watched in awe as people ran and screamed in the opposite direction.  Kerri\u2019s eyes bulged in simple disbelief as she took in the small world around her.  It was reminiscent of the many giantess videos she shot for Giantesszone, but these were real people, real buildings, and real cars.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHERE THE HELL AM I? Kerri insisted outwardly.  Kerri studied the flames that ensued from the wreck she had just caused as she again rubbed her eyes and adjusted her bikini.  No stranger to playing a giant, an incredulous smile came over the bathing behemoth.  Police choppers buzzed over head as police on foot descended upon the bridge as Kerri eyed their moves.  Relatively unshaken, Kerri calmly asked, WHAT DID YOU PEOPLE DO TO ME?  \u201cMa\u2019am, please remain still as we try to figure a way to help you,\u201d one brave police officer on the bridge assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBravery would be needed.  Kerri was now somewhere between 125 and 150 feet tall.  SURE THING.  YOU PEOPLE FIGURE IT OUT, Kerri smiled.  Kerri resumed a reclining position on her raft as Gwen continued grinding out tunes for her pleasure, all the while watching as police and EMT\u2019s attended to the wounded, the moans of the injured people occasionally overpowering the pop beats pumping in her soft ears.  The gentle bump and shake of the river put Kerri in a pampered state as she sighed with an AAAaah.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEXT TIME ON MS. TAYLOR\u2019S WORLD\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri leaned forward lazily as she remembered the shiny gold Victoria\u2019s Secret beach tote bag between her legs. GOSH, EVERYTHING GREW, Kerri marveled aloud as police and others still on the bridge jumped at her booming voice.   Kerri rifled through the tote and pulled out a banana, which itself had grown to roughly 20 feet.  GOD, THIS SUCKER IS HUGE, Kerri laughed as she peeled back the fruit, releasing a pungent banana aroma.  Caressing her stomach in satisfaction, Kerri\u2026..TO BE CONTINUED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surveyors have been flying over head taking measurements\u2026stay tuned to KHYT for more on this incredible story.  \u201cSee if you can find out more. I can\u2019t believe a giant woman has invaded the city,\u201d Pam gushed to her roommate Tanya as she tuned the car radio dial to another station.  \u201cIt\u2019s 12 Noon.  KRES 1019 AM Radio has just received more information on Ms Kerri Taylor, the sunbathing- tourist-turned-giant.  What authorities know so far is limited, but somewhere out in the Kelston Bay, the brunette 26-year old Ms. Taylor, clad in a nothing more than a bikini, and in a deep slumber on her pool raft transformed from a 5\u20194\u2019\u2019 woman into a monstrous 140 foot giant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyewitnesses say that Ms. Taylor drifted in the bay, where it encountered a Coast Guard boat, crashing into it with such force, the vessel sank.  The crewmembers were later rescued [\u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe our eyes, we, ya know, just called out an emergency, this enormous blue float with a giant lady on it came at us so quick\u2026she was just out cold or sleeping or something,\u201d one of the crew stated on record for KRES Radio]. More troubling for authorities now is that the 200\u2019 raft carrying the young sunbather has drifted into the mouth of the Kelston River and has snagged itself along one of the largest bridges on the winding waterway.  Police and EMT are rescuing several motorists injured when Ms. Taylor made contact with the bridge. Police have urged people to remain calm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times I've been around that track<br>\r\nSo it's not just gonna happen like that<br>\r\nBecause I ain't no hollaback girl<br>\r\nI ain't no hollaback girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's right dude, meet me at the bleachers<br>\r\nNo principals,no student-teachers<br>\r\nBoth of us want to be the winner, but there can only be one<br>\r\nSo I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all<br>\r\nGonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you<br>\r\nThat's right I'm the last one standing, another one bites the dust<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri, lightly tapping her feet to the beats and mouthing the lyrics under her breath, leaned forward lazily as she remembered the shiny gold Victoria\u2019s Secret beach tote bag between her legs. GOSH, EVERYTHING GREW, Kerri marveled aloud as police and others still on the bridge jumped at her booming voice. Kerri rifled through the tote and pulled out her $200 pair of Oakley sunglasses and a banana, which itself had grown to roughly 20 feet. GOD, THIS SUCKER IS HUGE, Kerri laughed as she applied her sunglasses over her eyes and peeled back the fruit, releasing a pungent banana aroma. Caught up in the moment, Kerri sang along out loud\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times I've been around that track<br>\r\nSo it's not just gonna happen like that<br>\r\nBecause I ain't no hollaback girl<br>\r\nI ain't no hollaback girl <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoooh ooh, this my shit, this my shit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me hear you say this shit is bananas<br>\r\nB-A-N-A-N-A-S<br>\r\n(This shit is bananas)<br>\r\n(B-A-N-A-N-A-S)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain<br>\r\nThis shit is bananas<br>\r\nB-A-N-A-N-A-S<br>\r\n(This shit is bananas)<br>\r\n(B-A-N-A-N-A-S)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times I've been around that track<br>\r\nSo it's not just gonna happen like that<br>\r\nBecause I ain't no hollaback girl<br>\r\nI ain't no hollaback girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo caught up in the moment she was, munching on a giant banana, rocking out and gazing at the people and traffic just 2,000 feet from her on the Downtown Expressway, the giant hadn\u2019t yet seen through her Oakley sunglasses to her left, several police officers waving their hand up to her.  Finally, one police officer sounded a loud screeching siren, its high pitch squeal piercing through the funky beats blasting in Kerri\u2019s ear.  With mouth stuffed with banana, Kerri picked the earbuds from her lobes as her oversized Oakley\u2019s gaped at the roadway. WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE MATTER? AM IN THE WAY?  I\u2019VE BEEN WATCHING, AND NOTICED MOST PEOPLE ARE BEING HELPED.  (Pointing to two overturned cars) IF YOU WANT I CAN REACH OVER THERE AND TURN THOSE CARS OVER FOR YOU.  \u201cMa\u2019am, we don\u2019t mean to disturb your enjoyment, but we need to ask you not to shift and gyrate in your raft, since the movement is creating waves that are hitting up against the bridge\u2019s supports and rocking the roadway.  The tow trucks are having a hard time moving cars. And people are losing their balance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri sat in her raft stunned as she processed what the policeman said, only the peaceful sound of the river water smacking against her raft answered back.  Giant Kerri was amazed that such ordinary movements could produce such awesome effects.  As she scanned the bridge\u2019s surface, taking in several ambulances, police cars and rescue vehicles tending to wrecked and overturned cars, it finally occurred to her that this was no \u201cMega Kerri 2.0\u201d video shoot or other fun video on KerriGiantess.com, these were real accidents, real people going to the hospital.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a large chunk of banana tucked in her cute cheeks, Kerri struggled to find the right words at such a crossroads moment; officers in uniform, helpless motorists in tiny cars juxtaposed the jumbo sunbather in a bikini, pampering herself, pretending that the world has not changed.  UM, OK, IF YOU NEED\u2026the stringy portions of the banana had caught in Kerri\u2019s throat, as the 140 foot female coughed and hawed to find the next sentence. Kerri fisted her chest to clear her airways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam and Tanya followed closely behind a large tractor trailer as they rolled down the Downtown Expressway at roughly 40 mph.  \u201cGod, Pam, could imagine being that tall.  Shit, things I could get done and, think, I could have any man I wanted,\u201d Tanya sighed.  \u201cYeah, that would be totally hot,\u201d Pam pondered.  \u201cWatch out!,\u201d Tanya cried as Pam slammed on the brakes.  The large truck in front of them had slowed down precipitously as its trailer began to jackknife.  The loud yawn of 18 wheels grinding to a stop on the pavement was followed by the crashing sound of several cars colliding with the now overturned trailer.  The culprit was seemingly innocuous, yet foreboding;  Kerri, sunbathing goddess had successfully coughed up the banana strings, but the ensuing force catapulted the banana chunk she was indulging onto the roadway, directly in the path of the 18-wheeler.  The truck tried to swerve and miss the four foot high, four foot wide stump that once was under a ripe banana peel, but the vehicle hit it head-on, catching pound after pound of fruit in its axles, tires and brakes as the driver struggled in vein to correct the situation.  Banana, its moistness accented with the saliva of the giant, spread like margarine all over the roadway.  Cars, one after the other skid and scattered at high speeds as the air filled with the punctuated sounds of metal on metal, pandemonium as palpable as the pungent bouquet of banana and saliva in the midst of chaos.   Up to a quarter-mile of once orderly moving traffic looked like a jumble of matchsticks as people and cars were tangled and strewn.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small curl of a smile emanated from the corner of her glossy lips. Kerri sat in back in her raft as she watched the whole disaster play out through her sexy Oakley\u2019s, only her bare feet in the foreground blocked her view partially.  Moving her right foot over, she made out the overturned trailer that separated from it cab. \u201cThis is no giantess video, these special affects are a lot better!\u201d Kerri thought to herself.  Feeling ever pampered, she bit off another large chunk of banana, turned to the tiny people on the bridge, whet her lips as she lightly pointed to the ensuing commotion a few football fields away and suggested,  I COULD TOTALLY HELP THOSE PEOPLE IF YOU\u2019D LIKE.  Giggling with creativity, THEY SEEM TO BE GOING\u2026.BANANAS?  UH, I\u2019M TOO MUCH, Kerri gasped as she rolled her eyes with a cute smile.  BUT IF YOU INSIST I SIT HER AND WATCH ALL YOU LITTLE PEOPLE COME THEIR RESCUE, THEN SUIT YOUR PUNY SELVES.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri leaned back, sighed as she lazily crossed her legs and pushed her sunglasses higher on the bridge of her nose.  As though she forgot to turn off a hot iron, the 140 foot beauty plugged the music player\u2019s earbuds back in her ear with utmost urgency, lip-syncing and luxuriating in\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times I've been around that track<br>\r\nSo it's not just gonna happen like that<br>\r\nBecause I ain't no hollaback girl<br>\r\nI ain't no hollaback girl <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoooh ooh, this my shit, this my shit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me hear you say this shit is bananas<br>\r\nB-A-N-A-N-A-S<br>\r\n(This shit is bananas)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I WAS A LITTLE PISSED, BEACAUSE, I HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GIVEN MY BOYFRIEND THIS NUMBER YET AND TO BE HONEST I\u2019M IN NO MOOD FOR CALLS\u2026I\u2019M SUNBATHING AFTERALL. \u201cThought and old friend could use some go old girly girl gossip,\u201d the voice on the other line bubbled.  SO I\u2019M JUST RAFTING IN THE WATER AND\u2026Kerri chatted on about small matters, sex with the boyfriend, beauty tips as the world around her seemed to fall apart.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nADVICE FROM THE EXPERT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSO, KELLY, WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO NOW? Kelly Cole was probably the last person on earth Kerri should have been asking for advice; like Rodan asking Godzilla for help in saving Tokyo.  Kelly Cole is the star in the website, Giantesszone\u2019s most popular video, \u201cDay of the Goddess,\u201d the Gone with the Wind of giant woman videos.  Kelly had been watching the breaking television news as she sat in a hot bath in her home back in the east coast.  Kelly was excited to try the new flat panel television that she had affixed to the bath\u2019s walls.  Loving the part of the giant woman herself, but feeling sorry for all the people hurt on the highway, Kelly felt compelled to offer some advice to the young giant; her mantra, \u201cscare the crap out of people, but limit the casualties,\u201d Kelly offered.  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do very much to enjoy yourself, just go about your business, save the people on the highway, sunbath, talk giant shit to them and\u2026 and may be go shopping as they fret over what to do about your 140 foot ass,\u201d laughing at the silliness of the conversation and the predicament.    \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go Godzilla to have fun. Now, if I were you and wanted to win over some pretty pissed off people, I would mossy on over to that highway where that large pile-up is and start rescuing a few people or 100.  The news reports say that you created a 50-car pile-up \u201d Kelly said soothingly as she caressed her shoulders with the bath sponge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police on the bridge beside the collasal Kerri listened intently to her end of the call as helicopters above used ultra-sensitive microphones to hone in on the other half of the conversation from Kelly.  Kerri was bothered by the chopper; \u201cfirst of all, I need to get those helicopters to stop listening to us girls\u201d, Kerri whispered softly, sarcastically with a smile. \u201cFrom what I can see there are two of them and they are really annoying.\u201d  With Kelly still on the phone, Kerri rolled her lips, open palm to her mouth and cocked her head back to a pinpoint view of one of the police helicopters no more than 50 feet overhead.  One chopper attempted to back off as the pilot could see what was coming.  Too late as Kerri\u2019s air-filled lungs and glossy luscious lips conspired like criminals and whipped up a warm feminine whisk of wind that whirled its way to the chopper with precarious purpose.  The sunglass be-speckled giant kept up her puckered posture for no more than a minute\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay Day!, May Day!, Help,\u201d the pilot and co-pilot cried out from the sky.  The chopper lost control, heading straight for the water no farther than 25 feet from Kerri\u2019s pretty pedicure.  However, the chopper recovered just feet from the water, rising again quickly.  NOW, THAT WAS JUST A WARNING. PLEASE KEEP OUT OF MY SPACE. Kerri waved to them in a friendly, conciliatory fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whirlwinds remained, congregating a where the chopper was now perched, creating a vacuum in the air space.  Kerri watched as the chopper righted itself, then, as she noshed on yet another helping of banana, gazed in girlish wonder as the chopper\u2019s blades lost lift and came splashing down into the water like a rock.  OMIGOD! Turning to the police on the bridge as she cringend, I JUST WANTED THEM TO GO AWAY.  Coast Guard boats dashed to help.  The police were less than convinced of Kerri\u2019s concern for the choppers and were getting pissed off, a fact not lost on the giant herself, but nonetheless continued chomping on banana without a care in the world.  Assured the pilots were being helped, Kerri lay back in her raft, continuing her giant plans with Kelly.  OOPSY, GIANT ME ALMOST DROWNED SOME PEOPLE, Kerri blushed to Kelly. YOU WERE SAYING..?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There car had come to an ugly stop on the highway and was facing the opposite direction of traffic.  \u201cYeah, I think I\u2019m OK.  God, look at all the wreckage.  I wonder what caused that ruck to wipe out? \u201d Tanya inquired as she rubbed her sore neck and arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what?\u201d Tanya asked Pam in annoyed tenor as she observed Pam in an awe and disbelief.  \u201cAre you OK, Pam?\u201d  Tanya looked out the back driver side window and without hesitation, screamed \u201cLet\u2019s Get Out of Here!  Run!\u201d  Tanya and Pam reached for their respective door handles, but it was too late; they felt the helpless rushing sensation in their stomach as their car levitated from the ground, their front window darkened from the force lifting them.  The two young ladies held each other\u2019s hand in horror for what seemed a lifetime, but was actually ten or so seconds when they felt the ground underneath their car again and light beaming into their windows.  When they peered out the window, several other cars appeared before them, neatly lined up in rows.  People were milling about, not sure what to make of what had just occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOW, I\u2019LL JUST MOVE THAT CAR\u2026RIGHT\u2026OVER\u2026HERE\u2026THAT\u2019S IT, Kerri said as she placed her fingers among the many wrecked and disabled cars that been involved in the large pile-up.  Kerri had paddled her raft to the edge of the Kelston River, just where it meets the Downtown Expressway, maneauvering a quarter of her raft onto land so as to anchor it as the rest floated softly in the water.  Kerri had turned onto her stomach and with her chin resting on her right hand on the raft\u2019s head rest, her moist soft lips, cute nose and big brown eyes were no more than 15 or 20 feet above the mutltitude of cars and bevy of people along the Downtown Expressway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the water to her left, sat a large commuter ferry, that extended the length of her toes to her bikini top.  It was close enough that subtle gestures by the giga-gorgeous giant caused the river-faring boat to sway and swoon.  \u201cMa\u2019am, we appreciate your assistance in helping the police with rescuing all these people, but\u2026,\u201d the police awkwardly clammared from the PA system of a police car on the scene.  SURE. I DON\u2019T MIND, Kerri smiled as she fingered a car still on its side, setting back on its wheels with a loud crunch.  Between her fingers, Kerri spotted several people scampering for cover, as the beautiful behemoth smiled cutely.  OH, NO ONE HAS TO RUN.  I\u2019M NOT GOING TO DESTROY THE CITY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri picked up another car with two people trapped inside as the doors were jammed shut from an impact with another vehicle.  Lifting it some thirty feet above the ground, she brought over to the ferry, placing it behind fifteen other cars she had already lined up in neat rows on its deck.  Many of the cars\u2019 passengers had exited their vehicles and were wandering about the deck of the vessel.  \u201cThere\u2019s no one here to operate the ferry,\u201d one man yelled out to the giant.  \u201cWe can\u2019t get off the boat.  The gates are locked. We\u2019re trapped,\u201d another man begged up to Kerri.  With every additional car and ever more people Kerri placed on the boat, the waves her oversized raft kicked up, created more worry on the ferry.  \u201cPlease, lady, stop putting more cars on this boat,\u201d a young woman pleaded.  DON\u2019T WORRY, FROM MY VIEWPOINT, THE BOAT LOOKS FINE. IT WON\u2019T SINK Kerri assured as she smiled to them.  I\u2019LL FIND SOMEONE TO OPERATE IT AND YOU\u2019LL GET TO SAFE GROUND ACROSS THE RIVER.  The people were right. The ferry was designed to hold 15 cars and Kerri had already plucked 17 cars from the highway and was adding one more.  THERE. DONE. NOW I\u2019LL ASK THE POLICE TO GET AN OPERATOR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the roadway\u2019s surface for an available police officer, one not aiding victims, Kerri couldn\u2019t help but notice a large chunk of banana in the right lane before her, the smell pulling at her nostrils.  With her index finger, Kerri scooped up the pile, placing it her mouth as she savored the flavor.  Then, without warning\u2026BURP!.. EXCUSE ME\u2026BURP!.. a wicked gush of air escaped from Kerri\u2019s enormous mouth, sending a warm, yet unpleasant gust of wind among all the people milling about. SORRY. EW. THAT WAS KINDA GROSS.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst was yet to come.  With an ominous wrinkle in her nose, Kerri frantically and uselessly placed one of her lanky fingers under her nostrils.  Some people looked up in horror, when\u2026.ACHEW!...CHEW!...Kerri sneezed like a hurricane, sending nasal mist down on the expressway like rainy season in the tropics.  Some people were quite literally blown off their feet.  A scream rang out as a man was trapped under a car that had previously been on its side, now sneezed back on its wheels, now pinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri looked to see the horror on the ferry..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No actors, no contrivances or phony crap; The best special effects with an unlimited budget.  Your people on the ground really did a number on that Kerri.  Great work!\u201d Kelly said as she praised her friend, Dr. Jennifer Ulstof of HomTech Industries. \u201cYeah, just soaking in the bath.  I\u2019m watching the whole thing go down on this really cool flat screen TV I had put in my tub above the faucet.  Just wait until I tell Kerri about the whole thing, Jenny.  She\u2019ll never\u2026oops, better watch that ferry, Kerri [Kelly spoke to the TV, sponging herself, interrupting her cell phone  conversation with her friend], those people are gonna be toast if you add another car.\u201d   \u201cHey, Jenny, I\u2019m too wrapped up in this.  Let me call you back.  Hold on. Before I go, just confirming\u2026private jet ready to take me to Kelston tonight? Your people are ready for me?\u201d  Kelly adjusted her bath pillow as Jenny assured her all plans were still on.  The bathing beauty took a sip of wine as she hung up the phone.  \u201cI think she\u2019s about to sneeze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA NEW WORLD ORDER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful and sensual female aroma hovered in the warm air, as though mother nature herself was sexed up.  It was enough to drive even the most panicky people to distraction, to forget that a 140' woman was casually destroying people's property and endangering lives.  That was part of the double-edged sword of a beautiful woman as a giant. Super-sized sexiness, but superhuman height, oversized body parts that simply get in the way of average people in a big city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, now pull up just so slightly.  And you, Ma\u2019am, steer your car a little to the right,\u201d a helpful man gestured as people gathered around him to help.\u201cSir, can you move your Escalade up a couple more feet, just so it touches this woman\u2019s car?\u201d he continued.  The fellow ferry passenger was all to eager to comply.  Chatter among the passengers of the idle water vessel picked up as the menacing sight of a giant female crane-like arm re-appeared high above their heads  The giant hand clenched yet another vehicle, a Ford F-150 Pickup, carrying a substantial load of fertilizer.  EXCUSE ME PEOPLE, Kerri boomed from her giant raft. JUST NEED TO MAKE SOME EXTRA ROOM.  Still holding the heavy pickup, Kerri used the back of her hand and knuckles to push several cars forward, the sound of tires rubbing against the ferry\u2019s surface fraying already jumpy nerves.  Kerri's greasy hand reaked of sun lotion and banana.  The shift in weight caused the boat to groan.  \u201cThe boat\u2019s gonna tip,\u201d a man yelled over to Kerri, who dismissed his protest with a smile and wrinkle of her nose.  LET ME PUT THIS TRUCK DOWN AND I\u2019LL GET SOMEONE TO GET YOU TO SAFETY.  NO MORE CARS, I PROMISE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just inches to spare, Kerri placed the big red truck behind a black Porsche.  The driver promptly exited the sun lotion soaked vehicle. There were now 18 cars and trucks on the vessel along with some 30 people milling about.  \u201cNow, Ma\u2019am, back you car up and you over there and there, get to the other side of the ship!,\u201d a young woman directed in response to a sudden tilt of the boat.  The ferry was anchored several yards from shore and its 15\u2019 high-wire gates, temporarily erected to keep tresspassers away, had trapped all on board.  Three people could be seen climbing over in desperation, but a bend in the top of the fence, stopped them cold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople could do nothng but hope Kerri didn\u2019t add anymore cars to the boat.  The passengers watched as Kerri scanned the highway for police to aid them.  Human-sized fingers picking and prancing about the cars and people on the highway just below her raft as she could be seen tapping on the hood of a police car with her gorgeous fingernail, adequately gaining the attention of the overwhelmed officers inside.  HEY, CAN YOU HELP THOSE PEOPLE ON THE FERRY?  THAT BOAT'S ABOUT TO SINK AND NO ONE, ESPECIALLY ME, WANTS TO SEE THE POOR PEOPLE DROWN.  Kerri then cupped her mouth suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEew, gross, did she just eat someone?\u201d a twentysomething woman asked.  \u201cNo, I think she\u2019s eating a piece of banana from the roadway. It stinks like banana.\u201d Her boyfriend assured her as he monitored the car\u2019s balancing on the boat. BURP!  \u201cEew, she just burped.  I can smell all the way over here,\u201d several people complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nACHEW!  A giant gust of wind accompanied by a rain of sweet feminine saliva enveloped the ferry passengers.  \u201cHoly shit! Get off the boat!\u201d Tanya yelled to her friend Pam and everyone else.  A large wave kicked up by the massive girl sneezing was headed directly for them.  People scrambled over the parked cars as they attempted to scale the impassable fence, but the weight of people on the side of the boat only hastened the imbalance of vehicles as one car crushed up against the another.  The impending waves kicked up against the boat, knocking people off the fence like rag dolls as they landed violently on top of cars and on the ferry\u2019s surface.  The sound of the overturning vessel was blood curdling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri\u2019s designer sunglasses scanned the scene, the bikini-clad giant overtaken, paralyzed with awe at what she wrought; the sight of these puny people scampering like mice, so helpless in the presence of her impossible size, power and beauty.  Kerri just lay on her raft, one cheek resting on her arm as she watched the doomed ferry toss people and cars into the river, the catastrophic event kicking up a wave of warm water that snaked onto Kerri\u2019s raft, caressing her underside.  Kerri sighed in comfort as her stomach, belly button and breast pampered in the warm water that subsequently pooled on the ginormous raft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting her swimsuit gently as a light breeze swept across her tanned, silky back, Kerri took advantage of the distraction of the chaotic crunch of cars cascading off the boat and tiny people screaming to let out a faint fart that had been beckoning since she had been feasting on that humungous banana. No one noticed..The  giant girl's sense of real-world giant woman experience caused her to purr under her breath in satisfaction, big deep sunglasses hiding the fun in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRING, RING..\u201dHey Kell, Omigod, I just totally sneezed and that ferry tipped. How freaky!\u201d  Kerri quipped.  \u201cSeeing those people on the ferry, jumping the fence and... those cars, reminded me of the scene in \u2018War of the Worlds\u2019, Kelly added.  \"Hey, Kerri, I'll see you in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
