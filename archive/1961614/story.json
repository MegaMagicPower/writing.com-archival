The sun had gone down hours ago and feeling tired he had stopped at a gas station to fill the tank and get a coffee. If the caffeine  wouldn't keep him up, it's horrible burned flavor would.  His destination was still several hours away. Providing  his rebuilt head gasket held up he would be arriving early that morning. He sighed, he needed some music.  He received nothing but static from the radio, the high mountains blocked out the radio transmissions.  Fumbling blindly in his arm rest compartment he pulled out a tape, a moment later an 80's rock tune began to play. At least now the ride would be tolerable.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light from his left caught his attention. Lightning? This time of the year?  Last time he'd checked it hadn't even called for rain. There was another flash. Maybe it was ball lightning.  A third Flash. Was it just him or did it look like it was getting close---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FLASH!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\"  Scott cried out as a bright flash engulfed the car and temporarily blinding him. Swerving he felt the road become rougher. Thinking he was going off to the side of the road he slammed on his breaks  and came to a complete stop.  It took a few minutes for his vision to clear and as it did Scott noticed something was amiss. It was daytime now, that was Impossible. So was the sight before him. He stared out through his windshield for several moments, then looked at his coffee wondering if it had been spiked with something.  Putting his car in park he shut the engine down and got out to get a better look at his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs impossible and incredible as it seemed he was </span></div></div>",

It was a little hard to make out details but he could tell there was a young man and woman in almost all of them, confirming his young couple theory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott suddenly heard a loud boom followed by what sounded like footsteps.

One particularly hard, close footfall caused Scott to tumble to the ground, and as the giant kept moving around - god knows what he was doing, maybe putting something away - it became impossible for him to get up. Scott was thrown this way and that, stumbling to his feet only to be tipped over and lose his balance again. Despite his best efforts, he rolled out from under the bed just as the giant closed one of his draws and turned around. The footfalls, for a moment, stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" boomed the giant, the voice terrifyingly loud and all-encompassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's heart dropped out of his chest as he jumped to his feet, trying to run back under the bed, back to his car. But those damn feet again changed everything, causing chaos. Scott fell again almost instantly as the giant approached and before he knew it all light was gone. He turned around to see a hand, an absolutely gargantuan hand, filling his vision. Two fingers pinched Scott's body delicately, lifting him from the ground. Scott tried not to pass out from the fear and the sudden change in altitude as he was lifted higher and higher and higher, all the way to the face of this hoodie-wearing god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they were face to face. \"Now what do we have here...?\" said the giant. \"You almost look like...whoa...\" the brown eyes squinted as the face got closer and closer, the breath like a vaguely minty hurricane. \"Are you a person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to breathe, such was your terror, you nodded vigorously. You wondered if he could even see. \"Whoa!\" came the answer to that. \"This is great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because of that, making contact with this giant seemed a silly move for now. He was pretty handsome, he thought, as was the woman in the pictures. They seemed a happy couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant stopped moving and the earthquakes caused by his footsteps mercifully stopped. Deciding the car would at least give you some shelter, Scott sprinted back to it and dived in, buckling up for good measure and waiting. He could see the huge sneakers through his front windscreen; the feet shifted slightly. Scott didn't know what was going on but he knew that every movement that monster made was dangerous to him. He contemplated driving deeper into the nightstand but he didn't know if the giant would hear the sound of the engine. So he just waited. Surely if this giant was going to stick around, he'd take off the sneakers? Maybe he was just folding some clothes or something. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scott's heart was beating so loud he was sure the giant would somehow hear it. He was petrified. He didn't even know if the giant spoke English, let alone if he'd be nice enough to not squash him into a pulp. He didn't even know where he was. He knew that his chances of surviving this situation were remote at best. He just wished it hadn't been so sudden. Not 20 minutes ago he'd been driving back from his trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott breathed deep and tried to calm himself - panicking wasn't going to help anyone. And eventually he got what he wanted; more earthquakes. The giant was walking away and the door opened as he left. Scott breathed deep and started looking around the car. There was nothing - no sign whatsoever of the force that had taken him here, wherever \"here\" was. He shook his head, patting himself down. Maybe something in his pocket, or under his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope. Nothing. What the hell? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears sprang to Scott's eyes. How could this have happened to him? Was he stuck here forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few minutes to wallow in his misery, Scott realised that if he wanted to go home he would need some help. He needed to find out what had happened and figure out a way to make it happen again, or reverse it, or something. If this were, say, a parallel universe or another world, he figured that maybe a physicist would be the best way to go. But it could take forever to find one, one he knew he could trust, and one with the knowledge to help him. Would they have internet in this world? Or a yellow pages or something he could use to find a scientist? Or maybe he could take his chances with the inhabitants of this house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing deep, he started his car and began to drive slowly across the wooden floor of the bedroom. From his low vantage point he could see that the wooden floor ran uninterrupted into the hall, which was good. And he figured he'd be small enough to fit under it, too - even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was his intention?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>First thing Scott did was take out his own phone, which still had some juice, and use it. It was still in working order, and there were available wi-fi connections, but they all needed passwords. Damn. But that was a promising sign that the cyber world on this planet would be easier to navigate than the real one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott drove out of the cover of the nightstand and into the room. He stared around, but unless there was something like an iPad on the bed, there was no device in here he could use. He did notice English books and similar plug sockets, so for all intents and purposes this just looked like Earth. Maybe he'd been shrunk and teleported elsewhere on Earth, rather than teleported to a gigantic universe. Hm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept moving and looked around. The room on the left...had a PC in it. And a sofa. And the sofa...had an open laptop on top of it as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, two chances. They were likely both password-protected, but it would have to be the place to start. If not that, Scott wasn't sure what to do next - maybe take the giants' smart phone, but that seemed a very bold move. Don't have to think about that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott drove into the second room, and parked under the small sofa, before getting out of the car again. He listened carefully, but couldn't hear the giant. OK, he wasn't here anyway. The best place to go was surely the laptop - the desktop would be way too difficult to use. Emerging from under the sofa, he looked up. Scott was reasonably fit, not exceptionally so, but enough to climb this sofa given the easy handholds. He took a deep breath and got started. He realised that if the giant came, he'd have almost nowhere to hide. But this room might not see that much use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb went well, even though at only about 2cm tall, it was roughly a 50-foot climb for Scott. It was exhausting, but the hard wooden floor below kept him motivated, and it wasn't exactly difficult to find handholds in the soft fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the top, Scott made for the open laptop and quickly moved the tracker pad. The screen jumped to life. No password needed. Score!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scott realised he would have very little chance of getting help alone, and the guy in the house might be the only chance he had. It was a heavy risk, but it could be days before he even knew who to talk to, and actually reaching the person could take months or years. Or he'd get killed on the way. So he'd need to rely on somebody at some point, and who better than this guy? This seemed a relatively \"normal\" home (apart from the one, obvious difference) and he seemed a relatively \"normal\" guy (apart from the one, obvious difference), so why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Scott drove on. As he drove he looked out the window and noticed some books, the spines of which were written in English. Score. Looks like they spoke English here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sped on under the door and into the hall. It wasn't a big house; the stairs were right next to Scott on the right, and there were only two more doors. One, ahead of him, was shut. Looking under the door, it looked like the floor became tile. Bathroom, Scott guessed. The other door was immediately to the left of Scott as he drove out into the hall. He stopped the car for a moment and peered inside - it was a much smaller room than the master bedroom, with the same wooden floor. There was a large TV on the wall, a desktop PC and a small sofa. Empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott drove into the far corner, next to the bathroom door, and reversed into the corner very carefully. He wasn't exactly hidden, but the white car matched the baseboard, so it was less likely to be spotted. He still had three quarters of a tank left, so there was no issue there. He took several deep breaths and got out of the car, then, leaning on it, listened carefully. The giant was surely still in the house, but where? </span></div></div>",

Was Rod Serling suddenly going to show up and start talking about him and the Twilight Zone? It really looked to Scott that this was exactly what had happened. When he had made it under the desk he shut the car off and got out. From there he had a better view of the Bedroom. The closet door was opened and he could see a dress hanging among other articles of clothing. So this room belonged to a Teenage Girl. A messy one from what he could see, which wasn't what he'd expected, Every Teen Girl he'd ever know always had a clean room, almost to the point where it was an obsession for some of them. Suddenly he felt a tremor through the floor. Weak at first, but growing steadily stronger. He knew what that was, he'd seen enough Godzilla movies over the years to know that it was the footfalls of something enormous coming his way. Without wasting any time he jumped back into his car, turned the ignition and-- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engine refused to turn over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No. You gotta be freak'n kidding me!!\" said Scott in disbelief. His disbelief would only grow as the door  slowly swung open and a Giant stepped into the room. The first thing he saw was a pair of  really nice feet. More than nice, in his eyes they were perfect. He followed the feet up the legs of her PJs, up her chest to her face. He didn't recognize her, and he didn't expect to. Her blue eyes matched the straight shoulder length blond hair, she had a round face and a cute turned up nose. She closed the door and walked toward the computer desk.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne huge foot slammed down in front of the car as she settled into the computer chair. It had been so close that Scott was lifted out of his seat. He heard her sigh high above him. It  was slightly echoy. Probably from the acoustics of the room itself. He watched the toes wiggle in front of him with fascination. It was true that he had a thing for feet, but that wasn't the only reason to stare. There was so much detail, he could see the Demerol ridges on every toe,  every wrinkle of that wide sole. It was really quite beautiful, he wondered what a foot that big would feel like. As if to answer his question the huge foot slid forward, the toes lifted slightly off the ground and the big toe that was twice as big as the silver Malibu settled down on top of it. He heard a Bang as the front shocks broke under the tremendous weight. The windshield glass cracked down the middle as the pad above pressed down. The metal roof groaned but for the moment held. Then, the pad began to move as the Teen Girl began to unconsciously rub her toe over the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the  fact the car was in park, it rolled  forward and back with the foot. Something on the Transmission broke and the front tired popped under the weight of the flesh above. Scott doubted very much if this young giantess could've heard it from under her foot, not with the sound from the Computer fans, or the conversion she was having with someone on Skyp. Suddenly the glass of the side windows exploded out ward as the roof began to collapse under the enormous weight. Instinctively Scott crouched down onto the floor of the car as the windshield spider webbed  and popped out  of its frame. Scott cried out as the huge toe pressed down all around him for a moment more until....</span></div></div>",

Death by giant child foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and could still see the foot in vivid detail. The flat sole, the cute toes, everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't a drinking man, but he sure wished he had one right about then. He breathed deeply, trying to calm himself down. it might've been minutes, maybe hours, but he finally stopped shivering. His hands still shook but he could live with that for the moment. He had bigger things to deal with, like what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here he was. Tiny as a bug in a car that was the size of a Hot Wheels, in the bedroom of a  \"Little\" girl that happened to be hundreds of feet tall. And all he had  for survival with was what he had in the car. He considered trying to get the girl's attention, but would a child so young understand him or would he be viewed as a weird bug or plaything? Then he thought if there was a child, there had to be a parent. Or an older sibling.  Maybe he could try to get help that way. But the reaction might be the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought occurred to him. whatever he decided to do, he would have to do it without his car. While traveling by vehicle was faster it wasn't built for all surfaces. It barely drove over carpet. The thought of venturing out in this giant world terrified him. But what choice did he have? Taking a deep breath to calm his nerves, Scott stepped out of his car and opened the back trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wished he had more resources, but in actuality he had almost nothing. A flashlight, a first aid kit, and assorted tools. He stuffed the first aid kit in his back pocket and put the flashlight into his inside coat pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took twenty minutes to travel from under the child's bed to the opened door of the bedroom. Scott peered out into the hallway. He would have to stick close to the wall if he had any chance. To his left the hallway ended with a flight of stairs, from what he could see. To his right were a series of doors.  </span></div></div>",

Far better to deal with an adult than a child of such a young age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, he picked a spot where the fabric of the PJs were the most wrinkled and began climbing. It wasn't as easy as it was portrayed on Saturday morning cartoons. Without climbing gear and dealing with cloth that looked to be made from rope it was making slow progress. As he climbed up the not do little girl's stomach he could here her digestive system already at work breaking down her meal. It made him feel uncomfortable and so he continued on. It was when he had passed the stomach area that it really became hard. It was almost vertical by the time he reached her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Scott's climb went unnoticed by Beth who was paying more attention to her breakfast than who was climbing up her chest.

Um! No! Wait!! Hey! I uh!\" Scott couldn't managed to find the words as he watched the boy's massive open palm begin to encompass him; the kids excited smile clearly visible between his the giant fingers as they closed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point running. Even if the man had a head-start, the boy could easily just walk over and snatch him up, regardless of how much distance he created between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott felt the heat radiating off the boy's palm as he was pressed into it from behind. The giant's tough leathery fingers pressed against his back as his face was smothered into the soft warm surface of the boy's flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to breath for a few moments, Scott began to panic, wriggling frantically before the pressure around him finally let off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting and on his knees, Scott's stomach dropped as he realized he was now being held high off the ground in front of the young boy's enlivened face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember having a toy like you before!!!\" The boy's eyes glimmered as he stared the tiny man in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's heart nearly skipped a beat the moment he heard the boy label him with the word 'toy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! W-wait no! I'm not a toy! I'm an actual person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy looked confused for a moment as he heard the man's odd response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaaa!.. No waaay! you're way too small\" The boy giggled as if having heard an amusing joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott nearly fell over as the boy's hand shook slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true!  I used to be normal sized, just like you! Even bigger!\" Scott frantically tried to convince the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause as the boy simply stared back with a blank expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...... Really?....\" The boy's words trailed off as his eyes widened with disbelief; he could tell the tiny man wasn't joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was just driving on a road somewhere and I somehow ended up in your room like this!\" Scott decided that honesty would probably be the best approach now that the boy seemed to finally understand his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooow, how did you get so small?\" The curious six year old brought the man up to his face to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know I just suddenly woke up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's your name?\u201d The boy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name's Scott\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Mark!\u201d The six year old yelled back excitedly, now knowing the name of his new little friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha...., nice to meet you Mark...\u201d Scott replied timidly in reaction to the giant boy's terrifying abundance of energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!...Um...Do my parents know about you??\u201d The boy asked with a sudden whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?.... No...... At least I don't think so. Could you bring me to them? They should be able to help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was an odd pause as the boy seemed to become lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh.. Mark?\u201d Scott felt an uneasiness as the six year old seemed to contemplate the request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm.. okay..\u201d Mark muttered distantly with a noticeable tone of disappointment.  The boy tried to hide it, but he was clearly a bit conflicted; here he thought they were about to have so much fun too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded his head as he began to stand up. The boy felt compelled to do what Scott asked of him; regardless of the man's size he was still an adult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay, I'll go find my mom\u201d Mark responded as he carefully closed his hand round the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the room, the boy headed across the hall and down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark walked into the kitchen, he was met with the sound of dishes being washed. The boy's mother stood in front of the sink cleaning various dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mommy?\u201d The boy muttered in a subdued voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it honey\u201d The woman asked as she continued washing at the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh, I found ..uh.....something in my room\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you find honey?\u201d The woman replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...\u201d The boy opened his hand and stared down at the tiny man in his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready listening to the conversation from within, Scott was happy to watch the fingers around him uncoil, allowing him to get some much needed air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stared up at the boy, who seemed hesitant to answer his mother as he stared downward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uhhh. I found uh...\u201d Mark's heart began to race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman began to pull off her gloves, signaling that she was finished with the dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he saw his mom beginning to turn, Mark suddenly snapped his fingers closed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you find honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh........................... a quarter!\u201d The boy lied innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...that's great honey! You should save it for when we go shopping haha\u201d The woman smiled as she left the boy alone in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he had actually gotten away with the sudden lie, Mark's heart began to settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began quickly walking back towards his room, Mark could feel tickling sensation of the tiny man struggling inside his closed fist; Despite feeling a pinch of guilt, the boy couldn't help but reveal a naughty smile . <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he were dreaming, this was the most vivid dream he'd ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the colossal scale of everything there was no question he was in a Boy's room. It was a bit untidy, but then he recalled his own room but being very clean at that age either. Making sure the car was out of sight , he ventured across  the messy floor of the room.  He could've drove the car, it would've been faster, but he was in an exploration mood. The room had a few pieces of furniture, other than a Bed that wasn't made, there was also a desk, and a dresser. On top of which was an older TV hooked up to a game console Scott didn't recognize. Near the bed was a remote control and a pair of black, white, and red high-top sneakers. In the corner of the room was a skate board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Kyle was pouring milk into a bowl of Lucky Charms. It was Saturday morning and he was still  dressed in his blue pajamas and white T-Shirt. He was the youngest in the family, up until his older brother Brandon disappeared six months ago without a trace. He'd been taking care of Kyle while their parents were out and had been working on an invention, but he hadn't been seen since. While Kyle missed Brandon, his absence also resulted with Kyle staying home alone. It didn't bother him that much and his parents always checked on him to see if he was okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his Bowl of cereal and Spoon, he headed to the living room to watch cartoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Scott could feel hear someone or something moving about. Judging from the size of everything who or what it was must've be hundreds of feet tall, at least.  He walked over to the TV remote.  Damn, it was one remote even He couldn't loose. Each button had to be 6f by 6f.  He climbed up onto it and mused whether or not he could push a button and turn the TV on. Then he noticed something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's odd' He thought, 'The brand name on the remote doesn't match the brand name on the TV'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Kyle was sitting on the sofa and was just about to turn the TV on when he remembered he had taken it with him upstairs last night.  As he got off the couch and headed up to his room, he hoped his lucky charms wouldn't be too soggy by the time he got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott paused, the sounds of footsteps seemed to be getting louder. A vibration through the floor was Scott's first warning that someone was coming. As the vibrations grew stronger they were accompanied by a loud <b>BOOOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>BOOOOM</b></font></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>BOOOOM</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too far away to make it back to his car, and the floor was shaking almost too hard to stand, much less run.

He hadn't noticed the tiny human on the remote, nor did he feel him tumble into his hand as he lifted and turned the remote around. He though he had heard a faint voice but dismissed it. His Lucky Charms and his cartoons were waiting downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told the only thing that had really saved Scott from falling to his death was the position of the huge fingers that closed around the remote. With every sway of the hand he was knocked between flesh and rubber/plastic. The view of the outside word between those huge fingers was a blur of motion. How the hell could someone so big move so damn fast?Everything he watched on Discovery was a lie! A big fat lie! One he'd have to think about later. At the moment Scott was trying his best not to slip between the kids fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle bound down the stairs and sat on the couch in front of the TV.

This green grass is as tall as he is, maybe even taller. He could not believe this; some asshole must have spiked his drink earlier with LSD, or something else he thought. Scott looks around and touches the edge of the green glass, this must be the most life like hallucination that he has ever encountered, the cute eighteen year old boy thought to himself. Truth be told, this would have been Scotts first hallucination sense he has never done any illegal drugs in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Scott looks around the area puzzled with his baby blue eyes, while scratching his clean shaven face, and occasionally running his fingers through his neatly trimmed, short lit-brown, almost dark blond colored hair. As the young man stands there, the sun is gently engulfing his lean, athletic, well defined body. Annoyed, Scott walks back to his car, gets inside, turns on the car, and attempts to drive away from this nightmare in hopes of finding a road of some kind. However, as he attempts to maneuver his car through this weird looking, grass like forest at unsafe speeds, the frustrated teenager strikes something hard. He steps out of his car, and looks around to see a large lake nearby. He realizes that his car is stuck on a large rock near the edge of the water. Scott gets back in his car, and attempts to break free of the rock. As his car rocks back and forth, he yells in frustration, while switching gears. An angry Scott realizes that his situation is hopeless, so he turns off his car, gets out, and kicks the rock. Scott then attempts to use his cell phone to call for help. However, as luck would have it he cannot get any signal. The irritated teen decides to leave his car in hopes of finding some help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Scott is walking along the edge of the large pretty blue lake, and after twenty minutes, he starts to become uncomfortably hot. So Scott walks over to the lakes edge, and he takes off his t-shirt, revealing to the world his smooth, well defined, hairless chest. Scott begins to splash the comfortable water over his smooth, lightly tanned skin, and then he mischievously looks around to see if anyone else is nearby. Seeing nobody, he smiles, and he takes off his shoes, his socks, his blue jeans, and his underwear leaving him naked as the day he was born. As he stands there completely naked, near the water\u2019s edge, anyone who comes by can see that the athletic teenager has a really nice ass, and he is well hung too. Scott runs into the nice water in order to cool off, and as the naked teenage boy swims around in the water, he is unaware that a huge guest of wind has just blown away all of his clothes leaving him permanently nude. Scott is also unaware that something is nearby, but whatever it is has not seen the small doll size teenager yet. As he swims in the water, Scott hears something nearby, so he looks around to see what it is, and he is shocked to see what?</span></div></div>",

Those pillars were covered at the top by a vast pair of shorts that served as the only piece of clothing on a Goliath male body. The giant looked young, likely in his early 20s at a guess with a near perfect physique. The bulky muscles of his clean-shaven torso partially obscured a chiseled face with soft blue eyes and messy blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air started to turn into a tempest once more as the titan lowered his perfectly shaped ass to the floor and his feet slid out of red flip flops, each the size of a football field.

Scott was terrified at the site of two monolithic and meaty soles taking over his sky. The stench was a tad unbearable too as the air filled with the Adonis' foot sweat. All this air turbulence was turning this quiet swim into a hellish struggle against the waves. Something had to be done and quick!</span></div></div>",

HOLY SHIT! IT'S MY LUCKY DAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's voice was deep and thunderous, terrifying poor tiny Scott. The sky darkened again as the titan leaned down and a massive hand carefully plucked the tiny out of the water.

The massive lips opened up, revealing a horrible stinky canyon lined with pearly white teeth. The hand tipped the young teen in as he screamed and cried out for mercy. That mercy never came. Scott fought the vast tongue to the best of his ability but the vast and slimy pink muscle just slammed him into the roof of the mouth. Every movement the giant made Scott weaker until he just gave up. He started to fade out of consciousness as he slipped into the dark abyss that was the muscle god's digestion system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant became hard as he felt the little man struggle for survival inside his mouth. He decided to play with his food, just a little bit. The feeling of little hands trying to overcome something as meager as his tongue brought a sense of power that he had never felt before.

The fun was over quickly but the thought of an earthie being totally and utterly destroyed by his digestive system was something that was going to keep him feeling mighty and powerful for a long time coming. He and his people were gods among the universe and that little fucker was serving his true purpose in life: becoming protein for his superior.

It was where the heel goes and likely the most dangerous place on the thing to be. Scott started to panic, realizing the urgency of his situation but the fall had made him weak.

The giant rose up again to his full towering height as his sole started to slide over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping on his flip-flops, the giant started to walk back to his car.

Along with that Scott saw that the giant sized anthro had a towel on one of his shoulders along with a bottle of some sort of suntan lotion in his right hand. The human then saw a bit more back away from the wall so that he could see the wolf sit down in a lawn chair. Once he had done this the anthro opened the bottle and turned it upside so that it was facing his free hand. When he had done this he pushed against it causing the lotion to come out of the bottle. Once he had doen this Scott found himself kind of blushing a little when he saw the white wolf set the bottle down onto a nearby talbe before he started to rub his hands together. After he had done this for a few seconds he began to spread it across his very large arms, before he moved rubbing his huge chest, followed by his impressive eight pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny human continued to stare as the wolf rubbed the lotion onto his legs before he turned and tried to rub it into his back. However, the wolf's back ws just far too wide for the white furred wolf to completely reach as he said in a very deep voice, \"You know I love having huge muscles. But it's always such a pain to get my back without someone's help.\" Hearing this prompted Scott to gasp out in slight surprise which caused him to move his arms and legs in the water making small splashing sounds. And once again the human's eyes widen, but this time it was a bit more out of fear when he saw one of the wolf's ears twitch while he turned to face him. This revealed that the white furred wolf had emerald colored eyes as he looked the huamn's direction and......</span></div></div>",

A blanket? And what's it doing here?\" Scott asked himself as he leave the giant field of blue fibbers Looking at the foot he wondered how he could see this giant creature Thinking hard he soon gets an idea \"Maybe I could run to the left to see more features about this giant\" he said as he begin dashing to the left Looking right he see yet another similar giant feet as he run pass it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about 30 second Scott finally stopped running and then look at the giant creature now that he have a good look at it Starting at the feets he sees that the feets were cream-colored and if he look real closely at them He could see that the feets have long nails Slowly moving his sight toward the legs he sees that they have the same color as the feets but not only that he could see some light-brown stripes across the legs But as he got to the torso he found a very interesting discovery The giant was wearing nothing but a purple bikini and saw that the giant has large breats \"So this giant creature is female\" Scott said as now finally got to her face And when he saw it His mouth immediately drop opened The giantess has two pointed ears at each side of her head and beneath the ears was a long black-colored hair He couldn't see her eyes since they were closed but he could see a small buttoned nose on her face and finally he saw two pairs of three wiskers on each of her cheeks He also sees a blue beach towel beneath her Scott couldn't believe his eyes standing right in front of him was a giant anthropomorphic female cat \"Woah so this world I'm in right now is inhabited by giant anthropomorphic animals This is one strange place indeed\" said Scott Looking at the giant cat woman fantasized by both her size and species She seems to be asleep probably getting a tan from the sunlight He wondered if he could get an even more closer look at her and....probably have a little fun on her gigantic body</span></div></div>",

While most bats, especially the ones Scott knew about through movies and television series, carried a somewhat intimidating appearance to them, this anthropomorphic creature oddly carried a sense of innocence as hinted by her large eyes and small smile residing upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, I get the pool all to myself!\" She says in a victorious matter as her eyes scan about the surrounding area as if to make sure her assumption was correct. As she gazes about, it seemed she took no notice whatsoever on Scott as she slowly began to make her way into the cool refreshing liquids. Just as the waters rose halfway to her knees did she let out a small shudder. \"d-didn't expect it to be so cold...\" she mutters to herself as her eyes were wide from the sudden surprise. Despite the temperature, she slowly continues her way down into the water before letting out a somewhat content sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering inside the pool, Scott begins to feel the water about him slowly shift with each movement she made. Fortunately for him, the movements weren't too extreme that it causes him to go under with each change in current. It wasn't too long before Scott was floating about with eyes glued upon this magnificent creature swimming ever so gracefully about the edges of the pool. Just as he was getting to admire the sight, reality soon manages to slip its way back into the recesses of his mind as he immediately recognizes the situation he was thrust in. Here he was, shrunk and nude, in a pool with a giant bat girl swimming about. Just how was this huge anthro going to react to a small human floating about right besides her? Let alone if she even knew what a human being was in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith admiration quickly shifting into terror, Scott quickly attempts to make his way to the nearest edge of the pool in hopes of escaping. With panic taking over his entire body, filling it with a surge of adrenaline, he quickly begins to swim his way to safety. Terror seemed to be doing it's job perfectly considering the great speed Scott was going while battling against the great currents of water, though luck didn't seem to be joining in at all. As Scott turned to gaze upon the bat girls location, to his shocking discovery, he spots her on a coarse straight towards his location. It was clear she was paying no mind of her direction just by her closed eyes alone, making the situation that much more of a danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when safety was mere yards away, Scott soon finds his miniscule form getting washed up by the waves caused by the bat girls careless swimming. Now within the body of liquid, Scott tries with all his might to get his body back into a swimming position. This however was proven nearly futile as the batgirls great arm movements end up tumbling him within the water. Before he could even mange to get a good bearing of his whereabouts, Scott suddenly finds his body bumping straight within an odd surface encasing him in utter darkness. Dazed, and weak from his struggles, he quickly gazes about trying to find out the strange area he was stuck in. to his ever-growing shock, he quickly discovers that he was...</span></div></div>",

Filled with a sense of pride, the gorgeous young girl decides to go on a road trip before heading off to college in a few months. As she drives down a nearly lonely stretch of highway, she is pleased with her accomplishments in High school, and hopes to do even better in college. At her high school, she was the former captain of her schools cheerleading squad, and a star athlete on the gymnastics team. She has received a full college scholarship for both sports. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While Christy drives down the lonely stretch of road in her old Dodge Charger, she has her window down, which allows a comfortable wind to blow back her long, strawberry blonde hair, and to cool her smooth lightly tanned skin. As she scans the road ahead of her, with her sexy greenish colored eyes, she suddenly sees lightening nearby, \u201cbut that is impossible\u201d she thought, there are no storms anywhere near here. A few seconds later, a bolt of energy engulfs her car, temporally blinding her, causing her to drive erratically. While the scared teenager desperately attempts to regain control of her car, her natural, perky, watermelon size breasts bounce around in her t-shirt like Jell-O. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She suddenly stops by crashing her car into what she thinks is a tree. As her vision returns, she gets out of her car to survey the damage, and discovers that the front of her car has been smashed. She can see that her car has apparently struck a stone bolder. Annoyed, she scans the area around her, with her now fully restored eyes. She is in shock when she looks around, and notices that she seems to be surrounded by green grass, which is as tall as she is, maybe even taller. The girl quickly examines herself for any injuries, and finds none. She then looks at her driver\u2019s side window for any cuts, and sees nothing. The unharmed girl is now standing next to her damaged car, as she decides what to do next. Christy realizes that her car is now totaled, so she tries her cell phone to get some help. However, she cannot get any connections at all. So she reluctantly decides to go into the weird looking forest to find some help. As the girl walks through the strange looking forest, she hears splashing nearby. Christy carefully goes over to investigate, and comes across a lake. To her delight, she sees a handsome naked white boy around her own age swimming around in the nude, and she likes what she sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Scott swims around in the water, the completely nude 18-year-old boy turns around to see a gorgeous teenage girl who is around his own age, and height, maybe slightly shorter, grinning at him, while hiding behind some tall looking grass. Still floating around in the water, Scott admires her beauty from afar, which causes him to have an erection. He can see that the girl has a well-defined, athletic, yet curvy body. The girl also appears to have a fine ass, from what little he could see of it. He smiles back at her, and playfully waves at her. Scott watches as Christy does what next?</span></div></div>",

She knew him as Scott and they used to go to the same high school together. They were even a couple at one time, dating for two years, until her father broke them apart last year over religious concerns. Christy\u2019s father is an extremely religious, conservative man, and he strongly disapproved of Scott\u2019s family joining a more liberal church nearby. After the couple was forced to breakup publicly, they still managed to date behind her dad\u2019s back. Christy who still has strong romantic feelings towards Scott smiles at him, and begins to undress herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Scott smiles back at the distant girl, when he finally recognizes who she is, and his romantic feelings for her begin to overpower him, as he watches her undress. Both Scott and Christy are thankful they are both eighteen now, because there is nothing Christy\u2019s father can do about it. Christy removes all of her clothing, and places them on a large rock for safekeeping. Scott smiles as his former girlfriend jumps into the water, and swims towards him in the nude. The tiny nude couple finally came together in the lake, and they begin to play in the water. Meanwhile, some more wind blows over her clothes, pick them all up, and blows them away, just like Scott's clothes. The naked young couple is unaware that their clothes are all gone, as they swim around playfully in the lake together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they innocently swim in the water, the tiny couple sees something huge moving through the sky, and it lands near the edge of the lake, out of the water. When it crash lands they swim over to investigate it, and Scott is shocked to see that this object is his own car, that abruptly explodes. As they watch all of Scott\u2019s belongings going up in flames, they see another object meeting a similar fate, falling through the sky, and landing just a few feet away from the blazing remains of Scott\u2019s car. Christy is now in a state of shock, when she realizes that the second object is her car, which quickly catches fire. As all of the couple\u2019s belongings, and their two cars burn to a crisp, the scared couple swims back to shore. At the same time as they both emerge nude from the water, the scared couple quickly looks around for their clothes, but finds nothing. The tiny naked couple is naturally alarmed by this situation, when they hear some loud noises moving around nearby. The still wet, tiny naked couple hides behind a large rock, peeks around it, and to their horror, they see a giant what nearby?</span></div></div>",

The Children he wasn't sure about, the footwear gave no indication of their genders other than there were definite differences in age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott began to think, how he got there was a mystery and not important. What was important was what he'd do next? Clearly his car wouldn't be adequate protection. It could pass for a matchbox car but it didn't have the sturdiness of one. It could be crushed as easily as an egg wrapped in foil. He located the door of the closet and cautiously moved toward it. There was a gap just big enough for to drive the car under if he decided to do so. Looking out into the world beyond he saw walls, ceiling, furniture, all towering high above him. No sign of the Giant occupants. He listened carefully, not a sound. Not even a radio or TV. He was alone in the house.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be no better time to move to a different location.

Yes, it may make sense to go find a secure hiding place somewhere in the house, you're at least in a closet. You aren't in the middle of a hallway. And if you time it wrong, you could find yourself driving down a hallway as the family got home. Your car definitely wouldn't take someone stepping on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead you figure you'll try to glean as much information from the shoes as you can.

He coughed a bit from the stench wafting from them; he wasn't sure whether they belonged to a boy or a girl, but they were certainly worn regularly. Based on the size of the shoes, this kid was probably somewhere around 13 -- not quite a grown-up, but getting close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second pair of shoes was a pair of sneakers, and while they were the size of a small warehouse, they were much smaller than the cleats. Maybe a seven or eight year old? He wasn't sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this rate, it was going to take forever to surveil the closet, but Scott had an idea; maybe if he climbed up on one of the pairs of shoes, he could get a good look at the whole area. He'd just passed under the cleats, and one of their laces was laying on the ground; it would be an easy, if smelly climb. Or he could climb the smaller sneakers, but they had velcro closures; climbing them would be tough. </span></div></div>",

Even the kids will be thousands of feet tall compared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, he comes to the top of the shoe. He walks out onto the tongue, amazed that it doesn't even move with his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he can get a better view. Okay, not much better, but still, he's able to see a few more pairs of shoes, and the first pair tells him something almost immediately. A pair of pink ballet flats sits beyond the smaller sneakers; though his small perspective makes it difficult, they certainly seem to be about the same size as the cleats. Okay, so a girl in her tweens or teens, cool, that's good to know -- though goodness, she needs to wash her feet once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott still can't get a read on the gender of the other child -- the smaller shoes he sees are all reasonably unisex.

Okay, at least he has a little bit of an idea of what this family looks like; he's not sure what he'll do with the information, but it's good to know.

Scott tries and fails to hang on, and before he knows it, he's in freefall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lands on a cushioned surface, and immediately coughs at the stench; he's fallen into the girl's cleat!

As quickly as it was lifted upward it was back on the floor again, and as it grew dark Scott knew it was coming. A foot, wearing a worn sock began to make it's way into the cleat.

Whoever she was, she was uninterested in loosing the laces enough to allow her foot to slide in perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's mind raced. What could he do? There was nowhere to run and in a few seconds the giant foot would be on top of him. He had two choices, climb up onto the socked toes or find some way to make her take the cleat  off.

So he reached up and found a small hole in the weave, probably too small for him to notice, and pulled himself up and up and up, until he broke through the fabric.The shoes groaned and trembled as the girl shifted her weight, but fortunately, she hadn't started walking yet -- she was probably putting the other cleat on. That gave him enough time to break through into the chamber of her sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked his lighter on, not to set anything on fire, but simply to try to get a view of his surroundings. He had come out between her fourth and fifth toes; he was shocked to see that even her pinky toe dwarfed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly pulled himself in tight between the toes, pulling himself into the disgusting toe jam that collected here. It was like the smell of her cleats times a thousand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the worst thing yet happened. The girl began to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world suddenly dropped out from under him, and then he was falling back down, and with a WHAM, her foot landed on the floor. A few moments passed, and the the world dropped, and he fell, and WHAM. Drop, fall, WHAM. Drop, fall, WHAM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the world suddenly lifted up and there was a surprise WHAM, and then there was shuffling, and then finally, mercifully, the movement stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it didn't stop, exactly. The foot still shifted back and forth, tipping left and right as the girl moved her food unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...be...forgot....late....\" he heard a muffled, feminine voice call from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ree...kay...game doesn't start for...its,\" came a louder voice from above him. Then, without warning, the toes of the girl scrunched tight, subjecting him to massive pressure from all sides. It wasn't enough to kill him, but it sure as hell scared him for a moment. This was going to be a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*  *  *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley pulled her cleats on as quickly as she could; she knew she was in trouble. She'd forgotten to pack her cleats when she went to stay over at Emily's house the night before, and she hadn't realized it until her mom was picking her up. That meant they had to run back home and she had to slide them on quickly, before rushing back out and getting in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you forgot your cleats Haley. We might be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, mom. It's okay, the game doesn't start for twenty minutes. I'll be a bit late for warm-ups, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley sighed. Just a few years and she could drive. She just needed to keep telling herself that. Idly, as she thought this, she played with her toes; it almost felt like a little pebble had gotten into her sock. Oh well. Nothing she could do about it until they got to the field. If they got there early enough, she would take her sock off and check. And if not...well, it wasn't that big a deal.</span></div></div>",

He hoped he still had the upper body strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began climbing. So far so good. As he climbed he began to contemplate what to do next, the first order of business he concluded was survival. Step one of that was to get out of this cleat. But once he got out then what? He swung his leg up over the side and sat to catch his breath. Not bad, he felt a little winded but he did better than he thought. He was glad to be off that that fowl smelling  insole.

He was putting too much though into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Scott slid down the outside of the cleat to the floor. He was halfway back to his car when he felt a tremor. And another, stronger then the last, followed by another even stronger. Footsteps! Well he couldn't be certain they were footsteps but he'd seen enough giant monster movies to come to that conclusion. By the time he reached his car the floor was shaking so much he could barely stand. Then the footsteps stopped. Through the crack under the door Scott Looked and saw a pair of socked, but nicely shaped feet. He heard the doorknob turn and the door swung open, a powerful wind from the displacement of air threatened to take him off his feet. There was a blinding light, he covered his eyes for a moment until he could adjust to the light. His eyes adjusted, blinking he looked up at the mountain of a teenage girl. Based on her athletic build and what she wore, it was no doubt the teenage girl that stood towering above him was the owner of the Cleat he'd just escaped from. She reached down and grabbed the cleats, Scott was thankful he'd escaped in time. He was in darkness once again as the door of the closet was closed once more.  He heard her drop the cleats on the floor and slip them on her feet. As she walked away and the footsteps faded he heard two muffled voices. Feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...be...forgot....late....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ree...kay...game doesn't start for...its,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was close, and exhilarating. He needed to move on, staying in a closet wasn't fun at all and there was nothing in there he could survive on. He didn't know about the dangers that lay beyond that door. He checked his watch, if the time was correct it was just after twelve in the afternoon. He could risk leaving the safety of the closet now or wait until nightfall and travel in the cover of darkness.</span></div></div>",

Not just the fact he hadn't seen anyone yet, but also that he hadn't busted a shock or spring driving over the bumpy vinyl flooring. The Malibu wasn't meant for off roading. it took him about ten minutes to drive down the hallway to where he figured was the living room. When he arrived there he came to a complete stop. It was a living room all right. Couch, flat screen TV, DVD case. Instead of vinyl floor however there was thick carpet. The fibers were a good seven feet tall. He wasn't going to drive through that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParking the car close to the fall where he hoped it wouldn't be noticed, Scott ventured toward the sofa. The Idea was that he could hide underneath and observe the occupants of the house safely. Try to find out more about them and decide whether to try to get someone's attention or simply stay out of their way.  The couch looked like an imposing structure, even from the distance he was at the moment. He wondered how he'd react to seeing the giants who sat on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard something from above. A door closing, this house had an upstairs? He heard thundering footsteps and before long he could hear someone walking down a set of stairs, toward the living room! Scott's heard raced, he still had a long way to go to the safety of the couch and he knew he'd never make it in time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to face the First Giant or Giantess he would ever see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

Then, she saw it, a tiny something inside the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott screamed as he was brought into the air, his ears popping. He heard the metal groaning as the fingers pressed into it. Once sufficiently high up, he could make out the face of his titanic captor. The girl had a round head, with freckled cheeks. Her grinning mouth revealed dimples and pearly white teeth. Green eyes gazed onto his car through the enormous, round glasses and curly blonde hair rolled down the back of her head like a waterfall.

He paused and looked down as his siblings continued on without notice. He picked it up. It was a toy car, where did that come from? It didn't look like one of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Austin! The bus is almost here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought he slipped the car into the pocket of his coat and ran to catch up with his brother and sister. For Scott, getting picked up by a giant kid car and all and dropped into a dark pocket was a pretty scary experience. That's putting it lightly, he was lucky he didn't shit his pants. Looking out the back window through the opening of the pocket, the outside world rushed by. Everything came to a stop, he heard a loud rumble, then more movement. Finally the kid had stopped moving, yet the sensation of moving and the loud rumble remained. He couldn't  tell but, based on the background noise of kids chatting about various subjects, he assumed the kid was on a bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what was he going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt safe in his car, but he knew that was a false feeling because he knew the kid could crush his Malibu like foil. If the sound of buckling metal when the car was picked up was any indication. He wasn't much safer outside the car either, with him being trapped in a giant's pocket and all. It would be safer if he could somehow get this kid's attention. He's sitting down, so climbing up to his ear would be \"Easier\" than when he's walking. That could backfire if it turned out this Kid was a real A-hole.  The longer he thought of it, the more he concluded that no matter what he did things didn't look good. </span></div></div>",

He didn't know how long the bus drive to the school would be and he didn't want to be halfway up to the kid's shoulder when he decided to stand up and move. It was better to remain where he was until he had more time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, it was the best course of action. The drive to the school was fifteen minutes at the most, and as soon as the bus stopped the kid was on the move. Scott could hear the chatter of students as the kid made his way to the school while his unexpected passenger was rocked back and forth with every swing of a leg. For Austin, the walk to his home room was uneventful. He sat down in his desk and took out his math book. He put his hand into the pocket of his jacket and for a moment it looked to Scott that he was going to take the car out of his pocket to look at it some more. Instead, he ran his fingers over the contours of the vehicle leaving smeared fingerprint oil over the glass in the process. Then the door opened and the teacher walked in. Austin quickly withdrew his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a moment, Scott felt sure it was safe and decided to venture out into the pocket. He had almost climbed up to the edge of the pocket as the teacher walked by. For Scott he caught a brief look at a pair of athletic shins in nylon. This was enough to make him rush to the edge of the pocket and peer out into the class room. The teacher was making her way back up to the desk, this time Scott got a better look at her. She was ebony in completion, kinda reminded him of Phylicia Rash\u0101d when she played Clair Huxtable on The Cosby Show. She wore a blue skirt and matching blouse. Her hair was shoulder length and most of all wore no wedding ring. She thundered past, her stilettos making an echoy clicking as he walked. It took a moment for Scott to realize his jaw was hanging open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began her class, Scott formulated a plan. If he wanted to get help from someone a rational adult would be a better choice than a kid . He'd use the car, but really everything he needed he could take with him in his backpack. He'd just have to climb down to the floor and make his way under the teacher's desk. There was another reason of course. A desire that made him feel guilty. He didn't consider himself a pervert, but faced with such a woman it was hard to resist. He only had an hour, whatever he was going to do he had better make up his mind to do it. It was now or never.</span></div></div>",

He rummaged through his trunk and found a box cutter, and an unexpected find.  Ice picks ,and slip on Ice cleats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018So THAT\u2019S where they went\u2019 Scott.  He\u2019d been looking for those since last year.  They be very useful when the time came to climb. He slipped the cleats on and closed the trunk. It sucked that he\u2019d have to leave the car behind, but if he wanted to be with the teacher he had no choice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s a piece of junk anyway.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his backpack secured he climbed up over the edge of the pocket and looked out.  He was hundreds of feet in the air and a fall from this height would be fatal. Scott carefully inched his way down the jacket to the jean pants leg. Already he was thankful for those cleats. Scott ran the length of the Kid\u2019s thigh and breathed a sigh of relief that he had not been noticed. Now came the hard part. Scott inched his way off the kid\u2019s knee and made his decent down the pants leg.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again he was thankful to have those cleats. He doubted he\u2019d be able to make the decent without them. It took longer than he would\u2019ve liked to climb down to the sneakered foot, but it wasn\u2019t like he was a pro mountain climber. Thankfully the cuff of the jeans covered most of the sneaker or he\u2019d have to climb up out of the sneaker as well. As it was though all he had to do was traverse the shoe laces and climb down to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott took a moment to catch his breath. One step closer to... what was her name anyway? The students never called her anything other than \"Ms\". Well, until he could learn her name, Scott decided to call her \"Clair\" and planned what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two students sitting in front of the kid he just climbed down from, in order to reach the Teacher\u2019s desk he\u2019d have to make his way past them without being noticed.   He didn\u2019t think it would be too hard, he just had to be on the lookout. The hardest part would be the distance between the teacher\u2019s desk and the Student.  He\u2019d be out in the open.  He could get spotted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott removed the cleats and bolted under the desk in front of him. So far, so good. He crept around the feet of the Student and ran to the next desk. </span></div></div>",

As the foot lifted off it kicked the ruined Malibu , the car spun out of control until coming to a stop, about that time the airbag went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne he realized he was still alive, Scott looked out the back window, what was left of it, and saw the three potential executioners board the school bus over the grass of the front lawn. The kid didn't even notice. He'd been hurled hundreds of feet into the front lawn and the whole thing had gone unnoticed by the three giants. He considered himself lucky to be alive, if he'd been standing there with no car he'd be a stain by now. Hurting all over, he crawled out of the wreckage of his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I had just made my last payment.\" Scott said to no one as he looked at what was left of his car. He wondered if he ever got back how he was going to explain to his insurance company how his car got partially crushed by a teenage boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked at the house. It was walking distance, but he had no idea of he could get inside. His odds for survival were marginally better inside than it was outside. But it would take a while to get there. And once he was there, how would he get in? It wasn't like he could climb the steps and ring the doorbell. He opened the trunk of the car and pulled out his camping equipment. A knapsack, a  tent, and a few flares. He had meant to take these out weeks ago. Good thing he hadn't. Otherwise he'd be in more trouble than he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his gear on his back, Scott left his car and started his walk through the alien forest that was the front lawn of the house. Maybe ten minutes later there was a flapping of wings. He looked behind him, then up towards the sky as a crow flew off with his wrecked Malibu in it's claws. It must've been attracted to the silver paint.  Good thing he didn't decide to make camp there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravel was slow. The terrain was uneven and muddy. And he had to avoid the predatory insects and arachnids that called the lawn home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Scott had stopped all walking, he was busy observing the titanic kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked somewhat similar in age to the Anderson girl, long red hair tied up in neat braids. He hadn't seen her face yet, which wasn't surprising. The clothing the girl had on was predominantly brown, a large jacket and shorts that extended down to just above her knees. A bag was in her hand, though Scott couldn't see inside the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young titaness knocked the door, peering up as the door opened to reveal an older woman, much taller than she was (if Scott even thought that possible).<br>\r\n\"Hello Miranda,\" The older giant's voice was loud enough to wash over the whole lawn, and he could tell her tone was warm and friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Miss Anderson!\" The girl, Miranda, chirped in response. Her voice was also loud enough for Scott to hear, \"Do you want to buy some cookies?\"<br>\r\nHe stopped paying attention to the conversation as he continued on his way, slowly but surely meandering his way through the clumpy, wet dirt as the superior lifeforms conversed overhead. It seemed she was just a simple girl scout, not much to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up as he heard the closing of the door, eyes following Miranda as she began to move again.

Such a number was impossible to visualize in his head, but here it was standing right before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis small mental tangent was immediately shattered by the booming noise and tremors created by her immense pale knee slamming into the ground. He was sent flying back along with some small flecks of dirt, landing on his back with a grunt. Gazing up, his eyes met her face, now visible as she peered down at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreckles dotted it all over, a small absent smile on her lips as her innocent looking blue eyes scanned over the soil and grass. Said eyes suddenly thinned mischievously as they reached for something, causing Scott to begin uncomfortably shuffling back. She kind of freaked him out, and it wasn't just her size doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked around to check if anyone was watching before she delicately plucked up the small unfortunate ant she'd discovered. Quickly, she shifted the insect over to her bag, sliding a packet of cookies to the side to reveal a jar. After hastily unscrewing the lid she dropped the bug inside. It didn't take long for her to find more ants, scooping them up and putting them into her containment for the little beings. Sure, a few popped against her fingers when she squeezed too hard, but her supply was ample, What was one or two squished bugs when there were hundreds available in this garden alone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 13 year old giantess took another look around, not wanting her interests to be revealed to anyone in the neighborhood. Miranda liked playing with insects, she'd pick them up and take them home and have her way with them in her bedroom. Most of all, however, she'd found herself really enjoying their taste for some reason. It had stemmed from a game of truth or dare with the other girls in the scouts, but after a few more secret 'taste tests' she'd decided that she liked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, her eyes landed on a speck in the dirt.

Where there any more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda decided she had collected enough bugs for today. She stood up, hearing an an almost inaudible yelp from the man she held. Very slowly, so she wouldn't startle him further, she closed her hand into a fist. then she lowered her hand to her side and headed for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Scott, he was scared as naturally anyone would in an impossible situation like this. Of course his goal was to make contact and yes he had wanted help. He also wanted the time to get used to approaching these giants and judging their personalities so he wouldn't be in more trouble than he was. All of that had gone out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis young Giantess didn't seem to have hostile intentions for him, she could've easily crushed him. She still could. But that look she had on her face when she held up that ant...Scott wasn't very good at reading faces, but  there was something about it that made him feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark in the closed hand with the exception of some cracks of light from between the fingers. He knew she was on the move, but he had no idea where. A part of his brain was telling him to bite the pale flesh that surrounded him so the young giantess would open her hand and he'd be able to get way. He concluded  that part of his brain was an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite her? And risk falling to his death? Or being crushed into pulp by a giant  angry adolescent? Not happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly felt her come to a stop. The hand move upward and it leveled in a horizontal position. This was it. Where ever this young Giantess had taken him, it looked as though they had arrived. The fingers unclenched, Scott breathed in fresh air. He was blinded at first, but after blinking a few times his eyes adjusted to the light. He looked about.  </span></div></div>",

Sure it was an odd one, but it was still a bug. With a sigh she pinched it up between her fingers and began to move the 'bug' over to her jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked up at her with wide eyes, freezing up in the moment of the enormous being staring down at him. Had she seen him? Had she not? His question seemed to be answered as the enormous hand drew near. He went cold as the large fingers pushed against either side. Any more pressure and he felt like he'd explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rapidly pulled away from him, the large fingers quickly lifting him up. He looked around frantically, eyes passing over Miranda's face a few times (her expression was largely uncaring) before he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig mistake. Below him was her large bag, filled almost entirely with packets of what he assumed were cookies. Much more alarming was the jar directly below him, crawling with bugs that rivaled him in size. He fruitlessly tried to squirm in her firm grip, eyes wide as she lowered him into the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda lowered the speck to the rim of the jar, before dropping him in. She just managed to screw on the lid (complete with air holes), before a voice pulled her out of her task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda? What are you doing?\" It was the mother of the house, the one she'd just sold cookies to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Miss Anderson,\" She stood, pushing a packet over her jar. A smile crossed her face, \"I tripped and dropped all my cookies, I'm such a klutz,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at her, the girl scout was happy to see her nod and return to her home, she'd gotten off free with her little toys. The young girl skipped away from the house without a care in the world.</span></div></div>",

Answer= by any means necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course was the situation Scott found himself in. The constant bouncing about from the young giantess skipping from door to door was keeping the Predatory insects at bay. The others, the none predatory, were more concerned in their own survival and ignored him except for the odd time he found himself upon one like a bucking bronco. That were at least Two things that played in his favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the moments were things were still. When the young Giantess would be at the front door of a house selling cookies. That's when things got violent and it was every man/bug for himself. That's when he found himself crawling away from a bug or being crawled over by a bug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething tugged on his backpack. An ant had managed to get a hold of it with it's mandibles. As he was lifted, Scott wiggled free of the backpack along with his survival gear. That was of no concern for him, let the ant take it if it wanted it so badly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for who knew how long. Moments of being bumped about followed by moments of fighting for his life. One thing was becoming increasingly clear. The bugs had a longer stamina than he did. In all honesty he didn't know how much longer he would be able to keep it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she trying to do, win the trip to Washington?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the hand reached in and closed around the Jar did Scott know the young giantess had made her way back home. She held it up and looked at it's squirming contents. Between getting run over and trying to avoid a pred, Scott looked up at the face peering though the glass. She was chewing on her lower lip as though she was trying to make a choice. A choice about what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she unscrewed the top of the Jar and reached in.</span></div></div>",

If he hadn't had to worry about predators he might have made better progress. At least the ants ignored him. By two in the afternoon he'd decided it was better to set up camp and move on the next day. He wouldn't be just setting up the tent, that wouldn't do at all. He needed protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott chose a spot to pitch the tent. A flat stone which wouldn't be comfortable, but at least he wouldn't have to worry about anything crawling up from underneath. He Hoped not anyway. Once that was done, he fortified by collecting whatever he could find and building up around it. Stones, bits of leaves, insect parts, whatever he could find. He heard the Bus, looking past the grass he could see the three children he encountered earlier walking back up the walkway to the house. Even from where he stood, Scott could feel the foot falls vibrating through the ground. He mused that if they were aware of him they might help him. Then again the expectation might clash with reality. The reality was, as they thundered past him to the front door of the house,that he would not be finding out any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't see them for the rest of that day. By the time the sun was starting to set Scott was secure inside his make shift shelter. He had placed debris in front of the entrance and zipped up his tent. Even with the bedding he had placed in the tent and the sleeping bag on top of that, he doubted he would get much sleep. He just hoped his camp would be look unappealing to a night time predator.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it grew dark Scott could hear voices from within the house. The voices of the kids and the mother, but no father it seemed. Either he was away, or she was divorced or widowed. They were probably having a hot meal while he lay in his sleeping bag eating a protein bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had predicted, Scott didn't sleep very well. The night time noises were almost as loud as the daytime. Once he though he heard something crawling up along the side of his shelter. His imagination immediately brought up the vision of a huge centipede. A scary thing to think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\neventually though Scott did managed to sleep. He was awaken the next morning to  the ground shaking and the sound of footsteps. At first he thought maybe it was just someone walking up the walkway, but then he heard the crunching of grass underfoot. Scott sprung out of the tent not caring about predators. Predators could be crushed underfoot just as easily as he could. He looked about and then his eyes focused on</span></div></div>",

It was a warm Saturday morning and she had decided to take her child out for a stroll and , as a bonus, get some exercise in. It hadn't been easy for her since the baby had been born.  The child's dead beat father had skipped down the day he found out she was pregnant and working while trying to be a good mother to her child was a balancing act. Fortunately she had help from her mother and younger siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her experience with her child's father. Jazmine longed for companionship, and sometimes wished for a man in her life. She was just thinking this when she noticed a flash of silver in the sidewalk ahead of her. She frowned. It was moving. She could here a buzzing noise from it as if it were motorized. She picked up the pace, easily overtaking it. As she got closer she was surprised to see that it was a car about the size of a hotwheels. Acting quickly she reached down and picked it  up off the sidewalk. The front wheels spun for a brief moment before coming to a stop. Between her thumb and fingers it felt fragile and not like a toy at all. There was a wisp of smoke coming from the tail section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jazmine gazed into the interior of the car she almost dropped the car in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked into the dark eyes of the ebony face of the woman who had picked up his car and was holding it between her fingers. There was no callous in her expression, only shock. She brought the car closer so that all he could see was a single eye. The eye focused on him. It blinked twice. With no other option available he waved at her. The eye widened. He heard the woman whisper one two words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he was descending towards the woman's pants. A moment later he was in the tight confines of her front pocket. He shut the engine off. He could tell the woman had turned direction and was heading back the way she had come. He couldn't tell though if her pace had been faster or not. Scott unbuckled his seat belt and waited. He hoped she wasn't hostile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazmine tried not to be hurried as she made her way back to the house she had been renting. To anyone who happened to see or meet up with her she would just say she had to go really bad.  Taking her baby out of the carriage she stepped into the house and when directly to her bedroom. With her heart pounding into her chest she carefully removed the car from her pocket. She held it in her palm while her baby cooed and made noises.  </span></div></div>",

Both were clad in workout clothes. One, a brunette woman, her hair bound into a ponytail, wore a grey tank top and tight fitting leggings. The other one, slightly smaller, had opted for an outfit that was more appropriate for the summer like temperature, a blue crop top with matching shorts. Both of them wore spotless white sneakers.<br>\r\nBut more importantly: the were running directly towards Scott!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic filled him, and Scott jumped back into his car, sparking the ignition. With a low whine, the engine came to life. Scott didn't hesitate to press the gas pedal all the way down.<br>\r\nThe wheels squealed as spun in place and Scott was driving away from the colossal joggers. The speedometer ticked upwards. 40 miles per hour. 50 miles per hour. 60. 100. 120...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit the maximum speed his car was capable of. But, as he looked into the rear view mirror, a shiver ran down Scott's spine.<br>\r\nThe joggers were only coming closer. Even at top speed, his car couldn't hope to escape the two titans. Their feet thundered down relentlessly, each stomp closer to him than before.<br>\r\nScott was paralyzed. He had to try something, anything... or else, he would be crushed underneath those sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the wheel with both hands, he took a deep breath. Then, Scott pressed down on the gas, pushing the pedal all the way through as he swerved right in a desperate attempt to escape.</span></div></div>",

It was an older house, but that didn't mean it would be easy to get in. That wasn't his number one priority anyway. It wasn't until he had pulled off and parked under the heavy leaves of a rose bush did he feel he was safe. Well, relatively safe anyway. At least he was out of site of giants, and the Malibu should protect him from predatory insects. Yeah, like a shark cage protects the diver from a great white shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever mind the fact that everything was gigantic, never mind the fact that this was all a slap in the face of everything that was taught to him about that being laughably impossible. If only there was a way to find out more about this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold on, maybe there was. He opened up his backpack and took out his laptop. As soon as it was up and running he began to search for wi fi signals. Much to his surprise he found them, the majority were strong but required a password. All but one. There's always someone who doesn't keep his or her wireless password protected. What did he find out? Not much at first , his own web browser was almost incompatible to what passed for an internet browser. When he did finally manage to gain access to the information highway, the majority of popular sites he knew simply didn't exist.  He wasn't sure if that was good or bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the setbacks, he did manage to learn what he needed. He learned where he was, the year, the weather and what was happening in this world. As far as politics and worldly affairs go, it was a calmer place than the one he'd left. He was glad for that. Maybe these giants had more sense than to screw up the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, he closed his laptop and put it away. He looked out at the vast jungle that was the front yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and I resolved that as man had dominated the world of the sun, so I would dominate my world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were preparations to make. The forecast he learned bothered him. It called for a lot of rain, maybe thunder showers. Sure, he was probably protected under the leaves of the rose bush but he wasn't sure if he had the high ground. The last thing he wanted was to drown in his car.  He looked about. He could drive the car further up the incline, but the leaves were not as thick there. He wasn't sure if his car would take the pounding of giant raindrops. Certainly not the glass. Maybe he could cover the whole car with a leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis other option was more frighting. He could find a way into the house. If insects and spiders can find their way into a house, why not him? Than again, who knows who or what he'll find inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a moment, then made his decision.</span></div></div>",

With his tiny, almost-flea size body, it's unlikely if any of them will notice him (unless if there's any possibility of doing so).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked at the ground and thought: \"Maybe I could dig my way into the house from underground.\" The big question is how to get there. Even if he had a shovel with him, it'll probably take him forever to dig due to the size of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked high up to see a large window just above his exact location. \"I could enter inside the house from that window.\" he said.

The fleshy open palm shrouded the car in darkness as it descended.  Scott came to the full realization of just how small he was as the boy's massive fingers pressed up against both side of the car. There was a sudden jolt as the car began to ascend into the air. As the boy brought the matchbox car up to his face, he flipped it upside down to see if there were any manufacturer details on the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... that's weird.. there's nothing written under here...\u201d Brian hummed with confusion as he inspected the very detailed looking underside of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott felt his stomach drop as the car suddenly flipped upside down. The man was now quite happy that he put his seatbelt on only a few moments before, as it was the only reason he hadn't just been thrown into the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot finding anything, Brian released his pinch on the car and let it roll on it's side down the length of his fingers and into his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Scott was sent into a nauseous spin as the car suddenly rolled on it's side twice before finally settling on it's wheels with a heavy thump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cuuughhh...\u201d Scott dizzily looked out the window, realizing that the car was now literally in his son's hand.  He watched the world beyond the giant hand slowly turn left and right as the boy inspected the car from every angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there recovering from his recent roller coaster , Scott realized this would probably be his best opportunity to safely get the boy's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath and collecting courage, Scott reached for the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026...<br>\r\n\u2026??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping onto the handle, the anxious man was startled to find that the door wouldn't budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d Scott swore as he realized the door might have been slightly dented in when the Brian's fingers pressed on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Scott was about to try the other side, he realized that Brian's enormous god-like face was now directly in front of the windshield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing the car closer to his face, the boy attempted to stare into the windows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBRIAN!!

He could feel the crumby tin-strength metal compress between his fingers as he squeezed the car into an ball. It was almost kind of amusing to the boy how easy it was to crush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it one final squeeze, Brian tightened his fist to the point that compressing it any further seemed impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon opening his hand, the only thing left was an ugly unrecognizable ball of scrap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaaah, I knew it.

After about the seventh honk, the horn seemed to stop working all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Sigh- I guess it's just broken... maybe I should throw it out...\" Brian muttered as he looked down at the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap...\" Though he was still dizzy, the last thing Scott wanted was for his car to be thrown into the trash, especially with him still inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Scott turned the keys and hit the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian suddenly gasped as the car between his fingers lunged forward without his assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooah, cool\" The amazed ten year old watched as the car started making right and left turns all on it's own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scott drove around the massive floor of his son's bedroom, he began to think of ways he could communicate with him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, he still has no idea it's me...If only I could just spell it out for h-..... Oh wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott suddenly realized he could literally spell out a message with his driving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a complete stop, Scott suddenly began driving in very straight, precise directions. repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird.... what's it doing....\" Brian squatted down in front of the tiny car as it continued driving in the same pattern over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaaaait a sec.....*GASP*\" The boy's eyes went wide as he realized it was spelling out his name \"BRIAN\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOSH!! THAT'S SOOO COOOL!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the boy's reaction, Scott knew he had succeeded. All he had to do now was keep the boy's attention long enough to write out a sentence like \"I'm inside the car\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could attempt it, the excited ten year old jumped to his feet and ran over to the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANDREW!! HURRY!! LOOK AT WHAT MY NEW TOY CAN DO!!!\" The boy screamed down the hallway towards his older brother's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott felt a wave of relief knowing that Brian was getting his older son involved, making it much more likely he'd get some actual help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan could be heard down the hall from the bedroom adjacent to the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uugh, what do you want Brian?\" An annoyed adolescent voice poured from the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew was 16 years old currently going through his rebellious stage. Regardless of the teasing and tormenting the teen usually put the younger boy through, Brian was always making an effort to impress his sibling idol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeaase! It's really cool I promise!\" Brian whined until the older brother eventually appeared in his doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe highschool freshman was wearing a yellow illustrated tee shirt, pair of black jeans, and a pair of his frayed year-old sneakers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seriously better be good..\" The aggravated teen stood in the doorway as the younger male sat down on the floor by the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! This car can spell out my name all by itself!!\" Brian beamed, excited to impress his older sibling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stared out the window at the giant teen who towered even higher than Brian by a foot and a half. The boy's boxers were partially showing and he seemed to be in a grumpier mood than when he last saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen rolled his eyes . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you called me in here for? Some lame toy?\" The teen snapped at the boy. It started to seem very likely to Scott that the older boy's bad mood was due to some sort of teenage drama at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Just look! I'm telling you it's cool!\" Brian begged as he nudged the car, waiting for it to zoom off like it did before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Andrew probably wouldn't wait much longer, Scott put the car into gear and began to drive.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n..<br>\r\nAfter a moment of acceleration, the car suddenly puttered to a complete stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n???<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No......GOD DAMMIT!\" Scott's heart sank as he realized the gas tank had just ran out of juice. The frustrated father slammed his fists on the steering wheel. \u201cI was so close!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo~.. why isn't it doing it?!\" Brian whined as he began to pull and tug at the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I should have known you'd just waste my time like usual...All your toys are total junk huh?\u201d Unfortunately for Brian, the older teen was clearly just looking for any excuse to bully the boy at this point, as doing so had recently become the teen's primary form of venting . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you it worked before!!!\" The boy gave the car a rough push, causing it to roll across the room in front of the taunting teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So now you're wasted my time with stupid make-believe lies...You really are just a lame little kid\" The teen glanced down at the tiny car between his sneakers and instinctive knew his next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess since it's broken, you won't be needing it anymore...\u201d The cruel sixteen year old smirked as he began lifting his foot over the tiny matchbox car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott felt a wave of fear wash over him as he watched one of his son's massive worn sneakers lift off the ground and cast a vast shadow over his car. The dirty sole of the teen's sneaker was patterned with worn repeating treads that practically had no grip to them anymore. The dizzying patterns blurred by before the foot came to a dead stop directly over the vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!! ANDREW PLEASE!!! NOOOO!!\" Brian started to plead frantically as he realized what his brother intended to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say goodbye to your stupid little toy~\" The teen grinned began to slowly lower his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen's word's sent Scott into a panicked frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO NO!!! ANDREW STOP!!! PLEASE!! ANDREW I'M IN HERE!! IT'S DAD!!!! NOOOO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of creaking turned to crunching and shattering as the vast, heavy sole of the sneaker made contact with the top of the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen seemed to be taking a lot of enjoyment out of both the boy's reaction and the crunching sound under his foot as he pressed down harder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sneaker and the floor came closer together, the light between the two dimmed. Scott had dove down onto the floor of the car with some futile hope that the teenager would only partially crush the car and leave. The horrified father could only imagine the enormous bare foot of his older son just beyond the sneaker pressing down mercilessly from above with no sign of stopping. This was one of the same feet the loving father used to playfully tickle back when Andrew was just a happy little kid; now it was the harbinger of his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly for the unfortunate father, Andrew's enjoyment came first, and he clearly wasn't going to settle until he had crushed the stupid toy completely flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crackling and popping noise of the car's compression eventually came to an abrupt end as the bottom of the teen's sneaker made total contact with the floor.  The car had essentially disappeared between the two. The satisfied teen licked his lips as he slowly twisted his heel back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as he was about to turn and leave, the teen decided to taunt the sobbing boy one last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, just wait till I tell dad you were lying..!~\" The sixteen year old smirked as he walked out, finally lifting his size seven foot off the flattened clump of foil<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He had a few bottles of water and some granola bars. Not much but it would do for now. He looked up, deciding that the best way to get up to the top would be to climb the teddy bear as it was the only thing that was really sticking out of the box.

What's worst, if she was that big how big was the child whose teddy he was climbing? He really didn't want to meet up with him or her. Children usually become very scared when it comes to tiny living things and they tend to stomp first and ask questions later.  His best bet was to find the woman again, she wouldn't be hard to find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vibration shook him out of his train of thought. Followed by another, stronger than the last. And another, and another, each growing stronger than the last. He heard someone enter the room and head for the toy box, he'd hoped to see the woman again.

The bear had been hers since she was a toddler and though normally she didn't sleep with a stuffed animal, she'd seen a flash of lightning. She feared lightning and felt the need to have something with her for comfort. Turning out the lights she climbed into bed, laid down on her back and pulled the covers over herself up to her neck. And she waited for the coming storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Scott, the experience of being under the covers was a disorienting experience. His world had become dark, hot and filled with the sound of the beating of a hard and the bellowing of lungs. This must be what a Bed Bug feels like. Fumbling in the dark he found his Flashlight and looked about. Above him was a ceiling of fabric. Under him was flesh and blood covered in pink material that rose and fell with every breath the child took. He'd only been under the covers a few moment so he knew she was still awake. There was a rumble in the distance. He knew that sound too, the sound of thunder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now what do I do?' he thought, surveying the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs scared as he was, he had to admit the thought the idea of being on a Giant not so little girl was fascinating. How many could say they've done that in their lives? If this had been the mother he'd  do some exploring but he had to remind himself that this was a Kid. Course, he didn't see the harm in taking a walk, so long as he stayed clear of the areas that were clearly out of bounds. He heard another thunderclap. He would have to be careful, this kid wasn't going to be asleep any time soon. He could take his time and be very careful. He'd have to keep close attention to the breathing, if it slowed he'd have to leave right away before she rolled over on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which way to go.</span></div></div>",

However, the storm seemed to have stopped for the time being. Karen got up and grabbed the glass she kept on the nightstand for this exact reason and headed off to the bathroom to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was completely unprepared for Karen's movements. In the space of a second the landscape of skin began to rise and slope downward at what seemed to Scott an incredible speed. Scott proceeded to go flying like a rocket from the momentum, hitting the bit of bed sheet just behind him. Fortunately the sheet prevented the impact from being fatal, but unfortunately he was then slingshot back toward the giant girl. Scott was moving far too fast to see where he was going or react, but he grabbed blindly and managed to grasp a couple strands of Karen's long golden hair, which now filled his view. As he held the strains of hair in a death grip the simple act of a young girl getting up from her bed made the world's fastest rollercoaster seem to be moving at a snail's pace in comparison and far more disorienting for Scott. Booms far louder than any thunder he had heard where he had come from sounded with each step as the humongous girl walked to the bathroom, despite the carpet under her feet. Scott could do nothing but hang on to the hair desperately as it swung back and forth like a pendulum with Karen's movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren of course was completely ignorant of this life and death struggle taking place. Karen reached the bathroom sink and filled the glass when she heard her mother's voice yell and whipped her head towards the sound. \"Karen sweetie! You doing alright?\" she said. \"Just getting some water Mommy!\" Karen replied. With that, Karen took a quick drink and headed back to her room where she took one more drink as she sat on the bed before putting the glass on the nightstand again and laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's arms began to ache quickly from the swinging and he knew he couldn't hold on much longer. As Karen filled her glass Scott's felt they were nearly about to give out. Scott heard a woman's voice briefly, but with Karen's head whipping around he found he had no reason to care as he finally lost his grip and went flying. Suddenly Scott found himself immersed underwater and tumbling, he wasn't able to hear another word the two said. Scott stopped moving for a split second before the water began to move, throwing him back one way and then forth another as the girl took a short drink of her glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's lungs began to burn, and he kicked himself upward towards the surface. Karen's face filled Scott's view as he looked up, and looking around at the clear walls around him in a lake the size of a football field it didn't take a genius to realize where he was. <i>I'm in her water glass!</i> Scott thought in horror as the realization dawned on him. The lake made what seemed to him to be massive waves as the girl walked back to her bedroom, Scott was violently thrown around the glass. While it would have been only a couple centimeters at normal size to the tip of the glass it might as well have been Mount Everest for all the difference it made to Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to escape, Scott felt another massive wave as Karen sat down. Scott's already considerable terror rose yet higher as he saw the girl raise the glass to her mouth. Scott swam away from the child's face towards the other side of the glass, but this made little difference as she tilted the glass edge to her mouth and drank. Scott swam in panic fueled desperation away as he rapidly approached the young girl's cavernous maw, Scott hearing Karen swallow a couple times. Just before he would go in, the glass tilted away and Scott found himself treading water once again. Looking up at the girl, he heard a GULP that sounded to Scott as loud as an explosion and saw her neck move as she swallowed. Apparently she had her thirst quenched for now, and with a violent lurch and another few waves Karen placed the glass on the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was safe for the moment but he knew it was only a delay of execution. Scott had no way out, the walls of the glass far too smooth for him to attempt to climb out, and there was only so long he could swim. Scott knew his situation was hopeless, either he would be drank by a preteen girl at some point over the course of the night or she would fall asleep and he would eventually lose his strength and drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Karen felt a bit thirsty again and picked up the glass. This time she took a long, slow drink and put it back on the nightstand. Scott saw a massive hand reach over and grab the glass. \"PLEASE MISS! PLEASE DON'T! DON'T DRINK ME!!!\" Scott screamed as loud as he could as Karen raised the glass edge to her face even though he knew she would never hear him. Once again Scott swam to the opposite side of the glass, once again he swam with everything he had against the current, once again he just barely avoided passing the mouth as Karen stopped drinking, and once again Karen would pick up the glass a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott grew more and more afraid as the process continued. It was clear by the fourth time it happened that Karen was going to finish the glass. There was less than a third of the glass filled now, and Karen groggily grabbed the glass once more. Deciding to finally finish it off, Karen tilted the glass and took a final long drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was exhausted, and at this point he didn't know why he was even trying to survive anymore. When a giant hand wrapped around and picked up the glass one more time Scott knew the end had come. Despite this, some part of Scott kept pushing to live and swam against the current once more. Scott could barely muster the strength to speak at this point much less shout, but reflex demanded he say something. \"God... please... Miss. Please let me live...\" Scott gasped as his final words as he finally lost the strength to continue swimming. Naturally Scott's words fell on deaf ears as Karen had no way of knowing what was happening, for her all she was doing was drinking a glass of water. Time seemed to slow down as Scott could barely move as the last bit of water with him in it approached the girl's mouth. As Karen tilted the glass even more the current became faster, Scott watching in weary resignation as he rushed towards Karen's mouth. Finally the inevitable happened and Scott passed Karen's lips. <i>No. NO!</i> Scott thought as the water pooled in her mouth. Karen's tongue began moving, pushing the water back, and she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GULP.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thing Scott heard or felt as the swallow sent the water crashing against the back of and down Karen's throat, the force throwing Scott against the throat wall as though he were a shipwreck victim being thrown by a wave against jagged rocks. Scott was killed instantly, but perhaps that was a mercy as his lifeless body would feel nothing as Karen's digestive juices began breaking him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...\" Karen sighed in content as she drank the last of the water. Lying back down for the last time that night, Karen absentmindedly licked her lips with a \"mmm...\" as she turned her head to her side and fell into a deep sleep...</span></div></div>",

The flesh looked soft  with no callous. He traced every wrinkle as he pointed the flashlight upward to the toes. They wiggled nervously. Yeah, they would look really amazing.

If it hadn't been from the blankets touching the floor  the task would've been impossible for Scott. It almost was.

In this case, Scott was hoping for single.  As he made his way to the large door on the far wall next to the bed he looked for other signs such as his and her slippers or photographs. He saw one pair of fuzzy slippers but that didn't mean anything as the husband or boyfriend might not wear slippers. As for photos, the room was too poorly lit to see stuff like that despite the flashes of lightning which were diminishing in intensity and timing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon climbing under the door he shown his flashlight beam around illuminating the dark interior. As he had hoped, he'd seen several pairs of shoes but not a single pair of shoes owned by a man. Even the clothing that hung high above him suggested that the occupant of the bedroom was a single mom. Either a widow or divorce. All the better, he didn't want to deal with the complications of a guy--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething caught his attention. Shining his light to the left he saw the biggest pair of leather sandals he'd ever seen in his life. A thought came to his mind and he ran toward them. The sole was a good six or seven feet tall and it was a real struggle on his part to climb up onto it. Once he was on top, Scott began to climb up one of the straps. Just high enough so he could get a good look at the sole of the sandal. The flashlight beam shown down upon the imprints made by huge toes that had to be twice as big as those belonging to the pre teen in the other room, the shapes of the toes were similar but more refined as whatever made those indentations clearly adult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to wait long as he felt the vibrations coming up through the floor.

Fast asleep and holding her old teddy. A habit of hers when it came to thunderstorms since she was very young. Tucking her in she closed the door behind her and headed for her own room. She ran her hair through her wet hair. She needed a warm Bath after all that. As she stepped into her bedroom, she paused for a moment. She had the odd feeling as though someone was there. She turned the lights on and they promptly went back out. Power Outage. So much for that bath.  She took a flashlight out and proceeded to check the room. The closet. Under the bed. Nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Storm must be messing with me.' Erin thought as she pulled her stockings off.

Her hair, which was dripping wet from the rain, hung shoulder length. If he were to guess, and that's all he really could do, she was around 5' 5\". She wore a dress, Scott assumed she had just come back from a date. A bad date judging from the expression. He could see where the pre teen got her looks from. Moments after the lights had gone out he watched her inspect the room with a flashlight as though she might've....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight've thought someone was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no way she could've known he was there. Still, to be on the save side, he remained still and his own flashlight was off. After a few minutes of searching she shook her head and began to undress by flashlight. He turned away. It wasn't his place to watch like some perv. He only turned when she walked passed the sandals. A single footfall was enough to knock him flat on his ass. By this time, she was dressed in a nightgown and robe. She put her fuzzy slippers on and paused in front of the sandals to look at the storm. To Scott, it was as though she was inviting him to hop aboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his decision quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For Scott every impact with the floor, a single footstep, threatened to shake him free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot feeling like going to bed right away, and not wanting to take a bath by flashlight, Erin walked downstairs into the kitchen and thought for a moment. Normally she'd get her self a bowl of lucky charms or some other comfort food, but after that date she needed something a bit stronger. She got herself a glass, the opened the fridge and took out the wine. The bottle of wine had been in her fridge for a year, maybe longer,  and this would be her third drink from it. So she wasn't exactly what you'd call a heavy drinker. As a matter of fact, the single glass was enough to make her feel giddy and a little tipsy. She needed that after tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her Glass in her hand Erin walked into the living room and sat on the couch, placing her feet on the coffee table.She took her first sip, felt the slightly burning sensation of the alcohol and the warm feeling it gave her. She smiled and listened to the storm raging outside. She knew her daughter was upstairs doing the same. She'd check in on her later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's grip had finally failed when the woman propped her feet up onto the coffee table. He was laying face first on her bare ankle, his heart racing a mile a minute. He though for sure she had felt him. He though any moment he'd be swatted like a bug. He slowly raised his head. Looking past the curve of the shin and the thigh and up the length of her body to her face he saw that he hadn't been noticed at all. The woman stared straight a head slowly sipping the contents of a glass she held. Scott sniffed. Wine. Slowly he rose to his feet. He still hadn't been noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott thought about his options, maybe  he could climb onto the coffee table, but what good would that do? He'd just be stuck on the coffee table. So his only other option would be to make his way the length of his woman's bare shin to her robe. Get close enough to her ear, maybe get her attention. He began to slowly walk the length of the shin.</span></div></div>",

Scott watched in silence as more MMMs! and that constant <b>CRUNCH</b> continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the flakes Scott was stuck in were thrown on top of the massive teeth. <b>CRUNCH!!!</b> the teeth barely missed Scott as he watched them, too terrified to so much as cry out. Karen's greedy tongue moved Scott to what to her was millimeters, but it was enough. Scott looked up at the teeth as <b>MUNCH!!!</b> the flakes and Scott with it were mercilessly crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unaware killer smiled at the funny people on TV. Swallowing her bite, \"Mmmm...\" Karen licked and smacked her lips as she scooped up another spoonful of cereal. \"Yum!\"</span></div></div>",

There was a flash of red and then he was aware of nothing as he lost conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sat down on the couch and watched her cartoons while she enjoyed her bowl of cereal. Her mother may not have approved, but since her mother wasn't around she placed her feet up onto the coffee table. She almost brought her right heel down onto Scott's unconscious body. Karen watched her cartoon's and enjoyed her breakfast. Some time later she had drank the last of the milk from her bowl and was about to get up and drop the dishes off at the kitchen, when something caught her eye. Taking her feet off the coffee table she peered closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren wasn't what you'd call the average kid who thought everything tiny was a bug and be freaked out about it. In fact it was very rare that she'd be freaked out by any insect. So when she peered closer and got a good look, she knew immediately that this was no bug. It was obvious to her that this was  a tiny person. A tiny person that wasn't moving. She thought about picking it up between her fingers, but was afraid she might crush it. So she carefully nudged the unmoving form over the edge of the coffee table and into her cupped hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carried it up to her bedroom where she had a magnifying glass. Upon further examination she was relieved to find It, He, was still breathing. Where did he come from? Where there anymore?  What was she to do with the one she had? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott Ached all over. Clearly the fall hadn't killed him even though it should have. The warmth radiating from underneath him felt good on his aches and---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he laying on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes and found himself staring eye to eye with the child he'd fallen from. He was in her hand, and she was looking at him with a look of relief and concern. Relief that he was okay, but concern as she wasn't sure what to do next. To be honest Scott didn't really know either. </span></div></div>",

If she had landed with a bit more force he would've ended up in her bowl of cereal for sure. Speaking of which, he watched as a spoonful entered the preteen's mouth. She chewed slowly watching the antics of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Ironically it was the Jack and the Beanstalk skit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed help, and this kid was his only option. He looked up further as she ate another mouthful of cereal. She had shoulder length hair. If he could make it to her shoulder, and then climb up her hair, he could make it to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began climbing. Listening to the sounds of chewing, cartoons, the occasional giggle, and laugh. Reaching her shoulder was tough, but Scott found out that climbing rope like strands of hair wasn't as easy as he though it would be. There was an oiliness to the follicles that made climbing difficult. It slowed him down but eventually he found himself closer to his goal. It was an nicely shaped ear, as far as ears go, with a gold stud in the lobe. He swung back and fourth on the follicle he clung to until he was close enough to jump. He landed in the cup of the Ear, not far from the enternce   to the inner ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe preteen didn't seem to have noticed as she tipped the bowl and drank down the last of the milk. Scott inched his way closer to the inner ear and wondered what he should do next. After all, he'd never done anything like this in his life. Should he yell into the inner ear now, or wait until the cartoons were over so there would be no distractions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though normally she didn't sleep with a stuffed animals anymore today the old bear would serve a different purpose. She was on her way to her first sleepover at her friends house. Including Karen there would be three other girls. Cassie, her cousin Jill, and Lori. All of them agreed to bring a doll or bear that they slept with when they were younger. A sort of show and tell.  Placing the bear next to her PJs and change of clothing she zipped up her duffle bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was rocked like crazy as the child picked up the duffle bag and Hop, skipped, and jumped all the way from the bedroom to the waiting car. Thankful not to be jostled about for  the moment he had no idea where this preteen was taking him but based on what he could see he had a pretty good idea. He didn't have a good feeling about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumble of the car stopped, the was the sound of a door opening and a woman's voice saying <b>\"Have fun Dear.\"</b> before Scott's prison was picked up and moving again. There was a brief pause as a door bell was wrung and then there came new voices. Young excited voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe REALLY didn't have a good feeling about it. More movement. More rocking about. From what he could hear they were making plans for tonight. Ordered Pizza and some popcorn with a movie, followed by games.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott clearly knew he needed help, but he'd rather get it from a grown adult than a bunch of kids. But did he have a choice? Not really. Then the Duffle bag came to a stop. There was a sound of the zipper opening and light filled his prison. Still on the Bear, Scott wished he'd gotten off a while back. He looked up into four giant faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was the girl from before, but the other three who stood behind her were new to him. As for their ages, Scott could only guess that they were all about the same age.  One was blond with dark blue eyes, as she smiled dimples formed on her cheeks. The other two were brunette and Scott was fairly certain they were related somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"See? I brought him.\"<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren reached in with two hands and pulled out the bear which she promptly tossed onto the bed next to the other plush dolls. What she and her friends failed to notice was Scott, who at the same time found himself air born in a failed attempt to get off the bear.  He followed behind the Bear in an arc that would  take him over the heads of the three girls. Then he noticed as he tumbled that his accent upward was tapering off, he might not be sailing over their heads after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Coming back home from a long road trip with stories of your travels to tell your friends and Family, but your travels are not over. While driving home a Mysterious Portal opens up, sending you to a world that is your own-- but gigantic in proportions. What will happen to you in this new world is completely up to you, but there are a few ground rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No one sentence chapters. Unless  its a choice. And even then don't have six chapters in a row that's just \"How About?\" I've seen that enough and if there's too many I'll have to remove them or add to them. Try to put in at least one paragraph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Though the interactive has an 18+ rating, Chapters don't necessarily need to be. Write within your comfort level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Nothing  involving the main Character getting Peed on, or crapped on or involving a toilet, or farting. But everything else (Feet, vore, unaware, etc) is fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) He can encounter anyone--but if it's a Kid NO sexual interaction. But everything else (Feet, vore, unaware, mistaken for a bug or toy,etc) is fine. You can save the sexual stuff for any adult characters or characters over 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) This is my first Non- Furry interactive but if you want to put in a furry character go right ahead. Animals are okay too if there happens to be a family pet or neighborhood dog on the loose or whatever you can come up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess that's about it then. <br>\r\n</td>",
