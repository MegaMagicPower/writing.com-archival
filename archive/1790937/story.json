Because of his shy nature it was hard for him to approach people, especially when entering high school where everyone already has their group of long term friends. The only person he'd really had a chance to talk to was the kid next door to him, Ronny. He was an energetic guy who loved joking around and doing sports, Hunter suspected that he had some sort of hyper active syndrome or something. His body was very lean and showed growing muscles under his tanned skin. Where as Hunter, despite his naturally Italian olive skin tone, was a bit paler and more scrawny thanks to all the time he spent inside.<br>\r\nAt school, Hunter was lucky to be ignored most of the time. his scrawny physique and general loner status made him an easy target for bullying. If he wasn't being ignored by his fellow students at the all boys school, then he was being shoved in a locker or pushed face first into a toilet or some more direct form of humiliation. It didn't help that the coach for most of the sports teams and all the PE classes had insisted on making you his little helper in cleaning up the locker room and collecting all the dirty jocks and uniforms; he thought it would help build character and show you what real men where like.<br>\r\nSo, to sum up, the first month of high school SUCKED. And it was about to get sooooo much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhere do you shrink?</span></div></div>",
