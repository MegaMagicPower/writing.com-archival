It is an honor and a challenge and I know you will do a great job... and don't pay any attention to the stories about a team captain curse.\"<br>\r\nNow Eric remembered.  There were these stories about how being the team captain of the football team had big consequences.  There were all these stories about bad things happening, not always right away.  It might be two years from now or ten years from now.  Jim Swenson, the team captain ten years ago had been killed in a plane crash.  Josh Quinn from last year broke his collarbone in the last game.  Somehow these random events got turned into some kind of voo doo.  It was all silly,<br>\r\n\"I'm not worrying.\"  Eric told the coach.  \"Bad things happen to everybody from time to time.  Being the team captain won't matter at all.  Besides, weren't you team captain right here at Center twenty years ago?  Looks like you survived the curse all right.\"<br>\r\nCoach laughed.  \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I did all right if you ignore not getting admitted to Notre Dame, busting my knee joints in college and growing a fat beer belly. I've been blessed.\"<br>\r\n\"You had some bad breaks, but not way you can blame life on a curse.\"  Eric wasn't going to think about a curse.  \"Besides, it all brought you back here to Center High and the great victories while you've been coach.  You can't knock that.\"<br>\r\n\"It's been good,\"  Coach admitted.  \"Still, I can't help thinking about how things might have been different.  If I hadn't been picked as team captain.\"<br>\r\n\"You couldn't have done anything different.  It's just fate.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just it.\"  Coach told him solemnly. There was something. I got so focused on the team during my senior year that I kind of slacked off taking care of myself.  I wasn't working out on top of the team workouts and I wasn't eating enough to keep my weight up.  I got kind of light and got knocked around on the field. I think if I'd been 205 or so instead of 178, I'd have gotten that scholarship to Notre Dame.  I can't help thinking that it would have changed my life. \"<br>\r\nCoach got serious and looked Eric up and down.<br>\r\n\"You keeping yourself in good shape?  Eating enough?  You look a little light.  Don't want you to suffer my curse.\"<br>\r\nEric laughed.  \"Don't worry about me, Coach.</span></div></div>",

His boss liked Eric because having a hot jock  brought in all the high school girls.  Eric's Mom was kind of a health nut and so Eric didn't see deserts much at home.  At first Eric left the ice cream alone but his boss encouraged him to at least give it a try.  Now Eric couldn't get enough.  He had started by eating through the menu and all 30 flavors so he could make recommendations, then he found his favorites and finally he started making up his own creations.<br>\r\nHis boss, Mr. Campbell was impressed.  Eric was a good employee and great behind the counter.  Still he liked to razz Eric from time to time about how much ice cream h put away.<br>\r\n\"You certainly are lucky to be young with a fast metabolism and a jock to boot.  If I ate like you, I'd need a wheelbarrow to haul my belly around.\"<br>\r\nEric had heard those kind of comments all his life.  He had a pretty healthy appetite but couldn't seem to gain weight even when he wanted.  Fortunately he was happy with 180.  It was just right with enough muscle and size for strength while being light enough to stay quick and agile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric leads the team to the League Chamionship game.  Now that the season is over with no long practices, Eric has more time to enjoy himself and relax.  By graduation he has gained 20 pounds and starts working full time at the ice cream parlor. He gets to take it easy before reporting to college and foot ball training. He reports to practice weighing a pudgy<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's been a rough two weeks for Eric as he tried to lose weight and get in shape,  Try as he might, he can't get his sprint speed back and is clumsy rather than agile.  Eating healthy and spare hasn't been easy either.  Eric really misses those massive ice cream sundaes and frequent snacks.<br>\r\n\"OK, Matthews step on the scale and lets talk.\"<br>\r\nEric is sure that all his work will pay off.  He steps on the scale.<br>\r\nWhat's it say?\"<br>\r\n\"220\"  Eric reads and steps down proudly.  \"It's working, Coach.\"<br>\r\n\"Son, we need to talk reality here.  You can work like a bear and get yourself back in playing shape but by the time I can use you, Joe and Tim will have you on experience and you';; be playing third string.  But there is another possibility.  I can see you on the line with another 25 pounds or so and it won't matter how fast and agile you are.  You'd have to eat big and lift weights but you would start.  what do you think?\"<br>\r\nEric was torn.  He wanted to be a starter but he was already ashamed of being fat.  Should he get his old body back and be a nobody or get even bigger and be a player?  Should he weigh 200 or 250?</span></div></div>",

He intended to get his weight down and his speed and agility back to be the star football player in college he was destined to be.  He knew the coach was disappointed and that he would have to work like crazy after reporting to practice over weight and out of shape.  Somehow it hadn't been quite so easy as he thought.  Eric's plan was to eat healthy and work hard to get his weight down under 200.  Tim and Joe, his competition were lean and in shape from the start and Eric couldn't match them no matter how hard he worked.  Coach had allowed him in the game a few times and each time, Eric had been clumsy and slow.  No matter how hard he worked he just couldn't drop below 215 with a pronounced ring of flabby softness around his middle and a big ass.  <br>\r\nEric sighed as he watched Tim swivel and dodge down the field for another touchdown.  Joe was almost as good and the two were always riding him about his gut.  Eric was starving himself and those two could eat anything and keep their weight.  It wasn't fair.<br>\r\nIt had been a disappointing season for Eric.  Now all he could do was focus on next year.  He would show them.<br>\r\nJogging back to the locker room he tried sucking in his gut.  <br>\r\n\"Give it up, Tank. You just can't make that puppy go away.\"  Joe wasn't really mean but then he had never known the old Eric who would have whupped his butt.  <br>\r\n\"You'll be sorry, twink, when some widebody tackle grinds your skinny ass into the ground.\"<br>\r\nEric tried to look confident.<br>\r\n\"My skinny ass is never going to get caught by some lumbering widebody.  It's chunky old you that should be worried.  Oh, I forgot, you spend all your time on the bench. Coach likes you there because your wide old ass keeps that bench really warm.\"<br>\r\nEric slowed to let Joe run on.  He couldn't take any more and besides this jogging was really getting him winded.<br>\r\n\"The nerve of Joe making fun of him like that.  Eric was twice the athlete that Joe would ever be- as soon as he got back in shape. \"<br>\r\nEric kept to himself fr the rest of the season just putting in the time.  He stopped starving himself but tried to eat healthy and by the end of the semester he was back at 225.  He was in way better shape than the beginning of the season but still heavy.  Well he wasn't going to worry about it  now.  There was plenty of time before next season.  Eric enjoyed the holidays especially<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eric poured out his soul about the disappointing season and how he was afraid that he would forever play second fiddle to Tim and even Joe.  Somehow he just couldn't get his weight down no matter how he starved himself and how those extra pounds made him slow and clumsy.  All he frustration he'd been holding back just spewed out.  <br>\r\n\"I don't know what to say.\"  Coach was concerned.  \"You've always been a natural athlete and nobody has more drive and commitment. I think maybe your body is telling you something.  I think that you aren't destined to be a running back and no amount of will power and starvation is going to get you back to high school.  You have to stop looking backward and move forward.  Let me  do some research and then we can get back together before you head back to school. Let me see if there aren't some options you like.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean like sumo wrestling?\"  Eric was feeling even more discouraged.  He didn't like the Coach's drift.  Eric just wanted to get back to his old self.<br>\r\n\"Nothing like that.\"  Coach gave Eric a big hug.  \"You're just meant to be a bigger guy and with all your natural talent and drive, you'll be a star.  Now I just need to think about which direction you should go.  At least you can stop torturing yourself and stop starving.\"</span></div></div>",

Eric wasn't one to dwell though and pushed it all into the back of his mind.  It was great seeing all his old friends again, hanging out, having a few beers, watching sports.  There wasn't any point in starving himself.  He'd gotten some remarks about his size at first but after a week, nobody said a thing about how much bigger he was since high school.  They were used to Eric's healthy appetite as well.  They stopped commenting and even egged him on.  It didn't help that he was working on a construction site.  He was always hungry it seemed and he was skinny compared to the other guys. At least that's how he saw it.<br>\r\nHis mom would fix a healthy breakfast for her jock son and pack him a good sized lunch which Eric finished at morning break.  Then lunch time meant hefty sandwiches from the roach coach and whatever they might have for desert.  then hit the coach again at break.  He usually got something after work and then had a big dinner at home.  Eric was enjoying life, eating what he wanted and getting bigger.<br>\r\nEric didn't notice that his clothes were getting tight or that he was developing a serious belly and lovehandles.

In fourth grade both boys had been average all around.  Both were in little league and played pickup at the park in the summer.  Gradually Eric turned more to sports as his natural talent improved with effort.  Glen on the other hand didn't have much talent to begin with and by the time they were too old for Little League, Glen didn't continue with sports.  Eric's natural athletic abilities made him a big man on campus.  Glen was more nerd than jock, a tall, skinny boy who kept to himself.  Still the boys were good friends still.  Glen just accepted Eric, never giving much thought to his well-built physique.  He was just Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he heard Eric bragging about breaking up with his girl friend and then stuffing himself just to get back at her, he looked at Eric with new eyes.  Sure Glenn knew that Eric was good looking and buff while Glenn was scrawny but Eric was just Eric.  Now he began to imaging a different Eric.  What would a few more pounds do for Eric's looks.  Sure they were friends and Glen didn't want bad for Eric but wouldn't it be great if he wasn't the hot jock so that they would  have more in common.  If Eric's girlfriend was going to treat him badly when Eric was such a catch, then maybe he'd be better off if he wasn't so hot.  Glen began to imagine an Eric with some pounds around the middle.  They'd make a great team agina just like when they were kids.  Scrawny Glen and tubby Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he do to help the plan along?<br>\r\n \"Well, you showed her.\"  he told Eric. \"She thinks she's perfect.  She just a chick.\"<br>\r\nGlen was wanting to take this a bit further. Maybe Eric just needs more encouragement.  Maybe he's tired of high maintenance girls.  Football season is over and he won't have all tha pressure and attention.  Maybe we can just hang out and maybe I can help Eric relax and eat big.  <br>\r\nEric nodded.  \"I've had with picky chicks.  You know I was looking forward to getting some free snacks from the pie shop.\"<br>\r\n\"Well you know that you can always find food at my house.  My mom loves to bake and she says I eat like a bird and Dad's trying to lose weight so we've always got plenty.

We can watch the game?\"<br>\r\nHe was hoping that Eric would agree and then he would have time to get a little something to stimulate his appetite.

His lean waist was now more of a mound and Glen liked watching Eric play with it when he wasn't stuffing his face. Glen didn't really care whether Eric was fat or lean.  He just liked hanging out with him and now that Eric was turning into such a chowhound, he was spending more time with Glen than ever.<br>\r\nEric scraped the last of the dip and stood up letting Glen see a nice beginner belly.<br>\r\n\"Gotta go get ready for work.

Ever since Glen had asked him, he couldn't stop thinking about it.  Even with a scoop or two of ice cream, Eric thought he could do it and these days he seemed always to be hungry.  He locked the door and turned down the lights. Then he cleaned the counters, swept the floors and the utensils.  He was ready.  He decided not to go for the Happy Hog, the biggest of the sundaes, after all he was a jock.  The Big Piggy would be a fine start with 12 scoops of ice cream, three gooey brownies, caramel and hot fudge sauce, covered with whipped cream and nuts. He dug in, each bite tasted better than the last.  Eric ate faster and faster because there was a lot of ice cream and he didn't want it to melt.  Man he was stuffed. There were still three scoops left.  Eric took a deep breath.  His belly was bulging and packed solid.  He gave it a thump and then a good shake.<br>\r\n\"BBRRRRRGGGGG\"  Erick let a big belch and grinned.  Now he felt he could go all the way.<br>\r\nEric cleaned up his bowl and headed home, feeling proud of himself and enjoying the weight of his loaded belly.

His hand was caressing a bulging gut without thinking as he told Glen about his conquest.  <br>\r\n\"Oh thanks.\" he told Glen's Mom who had just handed him a big wedge of pie, his second this afternoon.  \"I just can't get enough of your pies.  They are so good.\"<br>\r\n\"My pleasure, young man.\" she answered.  \"I love to cook and watch people enjoy my cooking. Eat up. There's plenty more.\"<br>\r\n\"So, anyway.\"  Eric continued.  \"I really didn't believe I could do it but you know what they say about ice cream- that you can always find room for it.  Well each time I thought I was full, I just pushed on and I did it.\"<br>\r\nEric paused and shoveled pie into his mouth.  <br>\r\n\"Well,\"  Glen said. \"That's what you say but did anyone see you?\"<br>\r\n\"You don't believe me?\"  Eric looked annoyed.  \"Why would I lie about that.\"<br>\r\nGlen backed down a bit.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not saying you lied or anything but was the sundae really that big.  It's one thing to tell about something you did but when you have proof.  When somebody actually sees you do it then there is no doubt. \"<br>\r\nEric put his clean plate down and looked hopefully around for Glen's Mom.  Glen handed him his plate.  Somehow Glen liked watching Eric eat more than eating himself.  Eric took is without comment.<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to show me.  Then I'll be completely sure.<br>\r\nEric leaned back after putting his plate on the table.  The jock had eaten nearly 3/4 of a pie.  He patted his belly contentedly.<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just have to prove it to you.\"<br>\r\nGlen watched in amazement as his friend struggled to let his belt our and then unbuttoned his jeans to give his belly room.<br>\r\n\"This new training program for football is amazing.\"  Eric told Glen. \"I'm  really bulking up.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you are looking bigger.\"  Glen said cautiously.  \"So when are you gonna show me how you handle that sundae?\"<br>\r\n\"Well,\"  Glen told him,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had been thinking that he needed just a bit more bulk but was afraid to go for it.  Running it past Bob was a way to get the subject out and Bob hadn't shot the idea down. Eric was thinking that he'd work out a little harder, run more times a week and try to eat more.  It had been a hard pull getting from 150 two years ago to the buff 180 he was today.  To get the pounds to stick he would have to eat quite a bit more.<br>\r\nNow he felt that he could do it.<br>\r\nEric's schedule was busy with his job at the ice cream shop, his girlfriend Rachel and football - not to mention school work but Eric had developed discipline and focus along the way.

Even the usually sour, claggy smell of the overboiled vegetables and grease from the cafeteria set his mouth watering and stomach rumbling as he strode down the corridor, one arm around Mindy's slender waist.  So preoccupied was he with the thought of feeding himself that he hadn't even made the connection between his near-painfully intense hunger and the Dragonfire powder he had consumed the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stood in line, his stomach gave an audible growl, so sharp that it sent a twinge through his abdomen, and Mindy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's hungry!  Had practice this morning, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he grunted without even glancing at her as he loaded his plate.  A mound of mashed potatoes near the size of his head, five sausages, a heaped bowl of stir-fry noodles from the international table and two bread rolls stuffed into his pockets; tucking the bowl into the crook of his arm, he grabbed his water flask in his free hand and hurried for a table, Mindy trailing behind with her own more modest lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant he sat down, he was diving into the potatoes, scooping up huge forkfuls and shovelling it into his mouth with barely time to breathe.  He picked up two sausages in his other hand and shoved them into his mouth, chewing hard and swallowing them both in moments, washed down with a good half of his water flask before setting into the noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timmy!\"  Mindy sounded shocked.  Timmy glanced up, cheeks bulging, a stray noodle trailing from his lips, and mumbled something unintelligible.  \"Ugh...\" she muttered with a roll of her eyes, and returned to her own meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bread rolls were dry, but Timmy helped them down with the rest of his water, and then leaned back in his seat, looking with some disappointment at his empty dishes.  There was a tight pressure in his upper abdomen, restricting his breathing, but he hardly noticed, eyes drifting across to Mindy's spare bread roll and unfinished bowl of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you can finish this,\" Mindy sighed, pushing them towards him.  \"I've lost my appetite.  I take it you want dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm!\"  Timmy's mouth was already filled with chips, and he nodded enthusiastically.  With a sigh, Mindy pushed back her chair and headed for the cafeteria counter, returning just as Timmy finished cramming the bread roll into his mouth.  She set down a large bowl of ice-cream and fudge brownie before him, along with another glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm off to do my makeup,\" she informed him, although she couldn't be sure he was listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Timmy finished, the fullness was beginning to set in, and he felt warm and lethargic.  He leaned back again, his hand moving to his abdomen, where there was a taut bulge below his ribcage.  All of a sudden, he felt tight and heavy; beneath his hand, he could almost have sworn the bulge was growing, as the bread rolls absorbed the water and expanded.  Shooting pains were running through him, and he rubbed his stomach with the flat of his hand to ease it.  Slowly, despite the noise of the busy cafeteria, his eyes slid shut and he slipped into a food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timmy!\"  Mindy's voice brought him slowly back to reality, and he stretched his legs out and opened his eyes.  He had slipped down in the seat and was now slouching with one hand resting on his stomach - his stomach which, given time for his meal to settle and fill out the rest of his gut, now swelled forward over the waist of his sweat-pants.  An inch or so of bare skin, tight as a drum, was visible beneath his shirt, and his fingertips slid down to scratch it lazily, his brain still kicking into gear as he looked up at his girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

He was tall, built like Adonis and a legendary smile.  He had one other remarkable characteristic as well.  They boy could eat.  Nobody had ever seen Chad refuse an offer of food and nobody even Rick, the 300 pound lineman could out eat him.  All the girls tried to get in his good graces by offering tasty treats.  None of them could compete with his favorite Ruby who was a great gook and a good appetite as well.  No matter how much Chad could pack away, nothing seemed to affect his lean, muscular physique.  Still Sarah had dreams that Chad would eventually forget about Ruby and fall in love with her.  Chad was such a sweetie and Ruby was a demanding bitch.  Someday, Chad would recognize that Ruby was no good for him and see how much Sarah loved him.  Still, as the say, love is blind and the way to Chad's heart was definitely his love of eating.  Ruby made sure that Chad was always well fed and satisfied even as she was a demanding bitch for everything else.  <br>\r\nSarah had a plan.

She would win Chad's heart but first she needed to make friends with Ruby and learn her cooking secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was getting really sick of this bullshit.  She had been sucking up to Ruby for three months now and if she had to do any more time with that bitch she would go stark raving mad.  It was easy enough so long as you were willing to do all her shit work and never argue or disagree.  Ruby just wanted friends to do all her dirty work and tell her how great she is.  By this time, Sarah had learned a lot about Ruby.  She wasn't actually very good at anything except bullying.  She got her followers to make the food that everyone believed she cooked.  She even bullied Chad who seemed only to care for her because she made sure he always had something to eat.  By now Sarah knew all the dishes that Chad couldn't resist.  Actually Chad didn't seem to resist any food but she knew the ones he really liked.  She had been doing to cooking for Ruby long enough.  It was now time to take her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody wanted to deal with Ruby's anger but Sarah wanted Ruby to end their friendship to avoid Ruby taking revenge later.  She deliberately started messing up the food she was preparing.  She burnt the cookies, added too much salt, left our key ingredients and when Ruby confronted her she claimed that school was stressing her out.  Before she knew it she was out of Ruby's inner circle and Ruby was forced to find a new slave. And in the meantime, Chad began to notice that both the quantity and quality of Ruby's provisions declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pounced.  Seeing Chad growing unhappy with Ruby's abrasive personality and the now less than satisfactory food he was used to, she offered her services and with an appetite like Chad's it was easy to get him to think of Sarah after Ruby stopped satisfying him.  He soon discovered that Sarah was much more fun to be with during the brief interludes when he wasn't stuffing his face.  The two become a couple and Ruby gets mad.</span></div></div>",

Ruby had tended to use spices and seasonings to flavor her recipes, but Sarah used heavy sauces and creams to make her food taste better.  As a result, Chad was suddenly consuming about 3,000 more calories per day with his new girlfriend preparing his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, Chad had been able to put up with Ruby's unpleasantness because he had taken out his frustration in the weight room - every time she was mean to him, he just ended up working out harder and harder and pumping his muscles bigger and bigger.

Somebody had to tell him.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lardboy. \"you in training for the sumo team?\"<br>\r\nChad was in deep denial.<br>\r\n\"You wish, wimp.\"  Chad answered sucking in his gut.  \"That's all muscle.\"<br>\r\nJeff shrugged and went back to studying.

He loved Sarah's cheesecake. <br>\r\nChad had just weighed himself at the gym and was a bit concerned at seeing 245 pounds.  He was lifting heavier than ever and his chest and arms were bigger  but the gut he had picked up just would go away.<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this bulking up.\"  Chad confessed.  \"I'm really making progress with the weights.  I feel stronger but I don't like the way I look.\"<br>\r\nChad was always a hit with the ladies and he was proud of his v shaped torso tapering from a wide chest to a narrow waist.  These days he wasn't seeing that V any more. <br>\r\n\"I can't seem to get rid of this gut.  Do you think I'm getting fat?\"<br>\r\nChad looked up hopefully loading the last of his cheescake into his mouth and gazing longingly at the rest of the cake on the table.  Man he wanted more of it.<br>\r\nSarah wanted to scream \"Of course you are getting fat and I love it.  I want you growing fatter and more handsome every day.\" but she was afraid that she would frighten Chad who was still in denial about his destiny.  <br>\r\n\"You aren't fat.\"  she told him rubbing his firm round gut.  \"No way you can be a big lifter with a 32 inch waist.  It's just not natural.  Feel how solid this is. I think you are better looking now than when we first met\"<br>\r\nChad warmed to the touch of her hands on his belly.  He really wanted to believe her.  His muscles were bigger.  Maybe his gut just naturally went with getting bigger and stronger.<br>\r\nChad grabbed her hand.<br>\r\n\"You don't think I'm getting fat?\"  Chad looked hopefully at the cheesecake.

Not one of his buds could match his lifts. <br>\r\nThen Jake asked him if the secret to his strength was trading in the six pack for a keg.  He laughed it off but later on alone in the dressing room he looked closer.  That chiseled six pack he'd sported was now a firm round bulge.  No sucking in could make it disappear or reveal those abs.  It was firm.  Chad could feel the muscles but it was no sixpack.  He could cup it in his hands.  He was still wearing the same workout clothes.  Somehow he hadn't noticed that  shorts were now riding low under his gut and his loose tank top wasn't so loose. <br>\r\nLooking from the side, Chad couldn't believe how much his belly stuck out.  Why hadn't he noticed?  Why hadn't Sarah said anything?<br>\r\nThe last time he weight, he was 245, way over last year but he figured it was just part of getting stronger.  And he still had abs.

That's more than before but with all the new muscle, that keg will go and my sixpack will come back.  He stood sideways and looked at his silhouette.  The hard ball of his belly stood out proud and filled his workout shirt to overload with a bit of belly showing under the hem.  Chad tugged it down but there was too much Chad for the shirt to cover. <br>\r\nHis belly growled and Chad smiled thinking about the big supper Sarah would have waiting for him.

It got stronger with each step.  Like Pavlov's dog, Chad was drooling with anticipation as he entered the apartment and saw the spread of food for dinner.  Sarah had told him that she had been cooking all day and that there was no reason to throw it all away.  Tonight would be Chad's last big meal so why not just relax and enjoy it.  She didn't have to persuade Chad.  <br>\r\nSarah watched her big boy eat with reckless abandon.  Chad loved to eat, particularly when Sarah fixed his favorite and tonight she had fixed all of them.  When he faltered, she encouraged him by saying that tomorrow he would be on a diet.  He wouldn't have a chance then.  Chad ate  and ate   and ate some more surpassing Sarah's wildest goals.  She didn't understand why Chad wanted to be skinny.  He had proven that to be strong, he needed to get bigger.  How could he expect to be strong and skinny at the same time.  And she loved every new pound on Chads body, the fleshy overhang that would soon be love handles, the soft flesh under his chin and the bigger booty straining his boxers.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she thought \"maybe it will work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah helped her overfed man up from the table and onto the couch.  His belly was round and shiny and she gave it a gentle massage.  Chad was nearly in a food coma but he seemed pleased with the rub.  Sarah let him sleep for an hour and then she brought out Chad's favorite desert, a three layer chocolate cake filled with mouse and cherries.  Chad's eyes got wide when he saw her coming.  He loved that cake but he was massively stuffed and starting a diet.  Sarah just started feeding him and soon her man was begging for more.  Finally she helped Chad to the bedroom where he soon fell asleep.  <br>\r\nSarah did hope that Chad was too much a food hound to last on a diet.  She wanted him to be her big man and grow bigger and stronger but it would have to be his idea.  <br>\r\nSarah did plan to help Chad with his diet.but should she fix him skimpy, local meals or keep on cooking her usual and let Chad decide how much to eat?

Food is for enjoyment and life is all about enjoyment and pleasure.  You work your heart out at a soccer practice.  You deserve a reward.\"<br>\r\nGill was relieved.  He could understand a reward after hard work.  The burger had tasted good even though he was stuffed and probably wouldn't be hungry for dinner.<br>\r\n\"Sure, Ronnie,\" he said.  \"I get it.

Where only yesterday, donuts never entered his mind and eating was just something he needed to do to fuel his body, today after Carson lecture, Gill was addicted to the wonderful taste of donuts.  Dinner had been fine.  Everybody said Mrs. Cole was a great cook but Gill just saw food.  He ate because that is what he needed to do and since he was full from the fast food after practice and then the donut orgy, Gil had just picked at dinner.  Now after doing his homework he was hungry but raiding the kitchen wouldn't satisfy the craving for donuts.<br>\r\nHe sneaked our of the house.  His parents probably weren't home but Mrs. Cale had instructions that Gil was not to go out after dinner without permission.  He started his car and backed out of the drive with the lights our and only turned them on halfway down the block.  <br>\r\nBack home with a dozen hot donuts, Gill ate slowly, savoring the flavor and texture.  Each one tasted better than the next.  How could he have missed this goodness in his life.  Washing those donuts down with milk, Gill was soon finished.  He had eaten the whole dozen.  He couldn't believe it.  If there were more, he would have eaten them too but he sure felt better.  <br>\r\n\"Donuts are the perfect foot.\"  he told himself.  He wondered what Carson's next lesson might be.</span></div></div>",

He even began looking forward to the snacks and gradually got used to them.  He ate a regular dinner just like before and he just couldn't stop thinking about donuts.  He discovered a shop on the way to school and grabbed a couple of them to munch washed down with a quart of milk before heading to class.<br>\r\nToday Gil was just one of Carson's gang going along with the routine.Carson seemed to have forgotten about teaching Gil any more lessons.  He slurped the last of his milkshake and wiped up the ketchup with the last fry and watched Carson wolf down his third burger.  He watched his big friend with interest.  Carson was already pretty hefty for soccer.  Eating like this was sure to make him even bigger but Carson didn't seem to worry about it.  \"Maybe he'd make a good goalie, he was thinking\" and in his head he imagined a very round Carson filling up the goal net.  What an image.<br>\r\n\"Gil!\"  Gill was startled to hear his name which roused him from his visions.  He looked up.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" he said looking to see who was talking.<br>\r\n\"I think you're ready for another lesson.  What do you say?\"  It was Carson. \"So what have you learned about donuts?\"<br>\r\nGil was embarrassed.  \"Well,\" he said. \"I found out that I like them. I know they're not good for me but I still eat them.\"<br>\r\n\"That's good.\"  said Carson.  \"You're a good student.  So are you still hungry?\"<br>\r\n\"Not really.\"  Gill told him, lying a bit because he still had some room left.<br>\r\n\"Well that's not really a problem because today's lesson is<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They never really understand what really goes on.\"<br>\r\nWith everyone in the car, Carson pulled out of the lot and drove down the street.<br>\r\n\"You see, people think that when they are full, there isn't room for anything else.  It isn't true.  First of all your stomach stretches.  It might be tight.  There might be pain but you just never get completely full.  But that's not the big lesson.  There is always room for something liquid to flow around and fill the empty places.  That's where ice cream comes in.  You may feel full after a few burgers and fries.  You may not be able to get one more burger down but there is plenty of room for a big sundae or two.<br>\r\nGil didn't argue.  He liked being part of Carson's gang and he had found that he could keep up with most of them although not Carson.<br>\r\nAll of them ordered the big pigout sundae with six scoops of ice cream and lots of whipped cream and toppings. Even though he wasn't quite full, Gill had doubts about eating all this iec cream.  <br>\r\nHe manned up.<br>\r\n\"What did I tell you?\"  Carson ate his sundae with ease and had encouraged Gill.  Now Gill swallowed the last bite. He leaned back in his chair and smiled.  Man, now he was stuffed.<br>\r\n\"The moral here, my man.\"  Carson continued. \"Is that you may feel you are full but it is just your imagination.  You've got way more capacity than you think and until you start filling that capacity, you never get the satisfaction that comes from really stuffing your gut.  Of course over time your capacity keeps growing and you have to work harder.'<br>\r\nGill had to admit that it was a great feeling.  He couldn't wait to apply this new lesson.<br>\r\nGill continued to enjoy seconds at dinner.  His mother had adjusted to Gill's increased appetite and wanted to keep her boy happy.  Gill was also adding ice cream up in his room doing homework in ever larger quantities. He was liking his new lifestyle in America but it was beginning to affect his soccer game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gil liked the growth because it made him fit in with Carson and his crowd.  He liked associating with the bigger guys and over time he was getting to be one himself.  The speedy, agile soccer star was gradually getting slower and clumsier.  Because Gil was so much better than the rest of the team, he didn't notice his decline.  He  still dominated the game although at a diminished level. He did notice with some pride that he was bigger.  His 28 inch waist was now up to 32 and his medium shirts were getting tight but that just fit in with his new American lifestyle.<br>\r\nBut then, one day at practice, his coach told him they n eeded to talk.<br>\r\nIn his office after practice, Coach had asked him about .how he liked the  season and then quickly transitioned to discussing Gil's performance.  How he was more sluggish and less agile on the field and how he seemed to get winded in a fast game. Coach had weighed Gil and found that he was 185, up 25 pounds from his weight at the  start of the season.  He prodded the bulge around Gil's middle and asked him how many soccerstars have a gut.  Gil was mortified.  He had  built his image in America as the English soccer standout. All that was in jeopardy  now.  He hadn't paid much  attention when Carson was dropped from the team because Carson wasn't really a soccer guy-  too big and bulky.  Now Carson was assisting the Coach rather than playing.  He didn't want to be dropped from the team.<br>\r\nBottom line, the coach had said, Gil needed to drop some weight and get his endurance back up.<br>\r\n\"It's up to you son.  You can be the outstanding soccer player you were destined to be or let it all go.  It's up to you.\"<br>\r\nGil had believed he could have it all.  Embrace the American lifestyle and be a soccer star but that wasn't possible. <br>\r\nHanging out with Carson after practice, Gil pondered what to do.  He stared at the full tray of food that Carson automatically ordered when after practice.  It had become an automatic response for Gil.  He needed that food.  It was  hard to remember back when he first started handing out with Carson.  Well, that was all over.  It had been fun but he wasn't about to become a fat, has-been soccer star.  He would get back on track and the start was to eat less.<br>\r\n\"I'm not very hungry today.\"  he told Carson pushing the tray  toward Carson.<br>\r\nCarson smiled.  He knew what the Coach had told Gil.  It would be Gil's choice now.<br>\r\n\"Your loss.\"  Carson said and finished all the food himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was great to take the championship and he knew that it was all because of him.  Coach was good but the team just didn't have the drive until Gil arrived. It had been close when Gil had let himself go midseason and packed on 25 pounds but after Coach took him aside for a talk, Gil realized that he wanted to take the team to the top. It hadn't been easy and Carson was no help at all. Gil had to tell him that he just couldn't hand out because when Carson ordered something to eat, Gil wanted to eat too.  He had starved himself down 15 of those 25 pounds and got back most of his speed and agility but only from sheer willpower.  He was hungry all the time and the only time he could get his mind off was on the field.  <br>\r\nNow soccer season was over.  <br>\r\nGil packed up his gear and closed the locker. He felt a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Hows it going Carson?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Gonna get something to eat.  Wanna come?  Season's over.\"<br>\r\nGil looked at his friend.  While Gil had pared off 15 pounds, Carson must have packed on 25 with a gut just beginning to sag over his chinos and a big ass..<br>\r\n\"What the heck,\" he thought.  \"I've earned a reward. Why not?\"<br>\r\nThen Gil remembered how he almost lost his place on the team by hanging with Carson.  Maybe he should stay disciplined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And, in spite of his blubber, he had become a football hero.<br>\r\nGil knew soccer inside and out.  He'd been quick, nimble and smart on the field.  Even after losing his edge and gaining 30 pounds he'd still been better than most of his teammates.  But when he'd packed on the last 15, it was all gone.  His body knew what to do but he was too slow and out of shape to deliver.  He'd been pulled and sidelined. Now he was on the verge of getting back to his sormer glory.<br>\r\n\"You ever think about playing football?\"<br>\r\nGil had been lost in dreaming about his return to soccer glory when Carson's voice pulled him back to the donut shop.  He looked at his friend who had finished the second dozen donuts and somehow had a plate of cream puffs which he was studying seriously.<br>\r\n\"Foorball.\" he said. \"I don't know anything about football.  Soccers my sport.  You know that.\"<br>\r\nCarson began sucking the cream from the first creampuff.  Gil had the thought that Carson had become very much like a cream puff as he had become fatter.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\"  Carson mutterred. \"But it's such a crazy game.  All that running and all you ever get to do is once in a while kick a ball into a net.  Not like foot ball where you really get to test yourself out, muscle down big men and stop the other team by shear force.  It's really satisfying.  Plus, no boey ever gets on you about your weight.\"<br>\r\nCarson finished the last cream puff, leaned back in his chair and patted his very large belly. Then he belched and smiled with satisfaction.  \"Who'd want to play a sport where you run steady for an hour and then can't eat anything for fear of getting fat?\"<br>\r\n\"Not you.\"  he answered with a grin.<br>\r\n\"Darn right! And you ought to think about how you want to live your life.\"<br>\r\nLater that night, Gil couldn't stop thinking about Carson's suggestion.  He was tempted <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was blissfully unaware of the flabby, soft gut and fledgling moobs that he was sporting now.  He turned to see Greg his principle rival on the cross country team last year.  Greg was looking at him but what was he talking about.  Surely he wasn't referring to Anton.<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Greg.  You taste those ribs yet? \"  Anton was trying to figure out who Greg was talking to.  There wasn't anyone behind him.  He finally decided that Greg was just trying mind games to psych him out.<br>\r\nGreg was staring at Anton's pudgy middle.  He poked a finger in the soft bulge.<br>\r\n\"Somebody looks like they ate the whole pig.\"<br>\r\nAnton laughed.  Greg was always such a cut up.  <br>\r\n\"Summer is for enjoying yourself.\"  he told Greg. \"Can't stay focused on track all the time.\"<br>\r\nAnton turned back to the food.  Those ribs had been good and he was still hungry.  Maybe he had slacked off a bit over the summer but he deserved a break. Maybe he was a bit soft and he somehow had a belly but he had had a great summer and by track season he'd be putting Greg in his place.  He piled two burgers on his plate and loaded it with potato salad.  Greg was just envious.  This time as he stuffed his gut with the burgers he was conscious of the belly bulging over his swim suit.  As it got rounder and he felt the pressure building,Anton smiled.  The sun felt good.<br>\r\n\"How about some desert?\"<br>\r\nAnton was roused from his nap by<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
