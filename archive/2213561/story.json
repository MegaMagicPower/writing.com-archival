            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Tasha Lyall, and this is my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh school was rough for me. What with overactive glands that gave me greasy hair and pimples, the world's thickest eyeglasses magnifying my eyes until I looked like an anime character, and being 30 pounds overweight, all I was missing was a neon sign that said MAKE MY LIFE A LIVING HELL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, the most popular girl in school, Janelle Lee, treated me nicely, with the occasional suggestion that a vegetarian diet would do wonders for me being the worst of her behavior. Unfortunately, there's only so much she could do in the face of a student body that had decided that my name was not Tasha, but Lardass. Geez, what if I'd weighed a little more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, besides Janelle and her friends, I had my own friends, Elisabeth Brooks and Sarah Patterson. At home, I had my parents, Henry and Nina; my younger brother, Matt; and my cat, Clawdette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also my crush, Colin Channing, but he was unaware of my feelings for him. Hell, he wasn't even the one who took me to the senior prom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey say the senior prom is always a night to remember. Well, it certainly was for me, but not for the reasons they were thinking of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't stay long at the prom. I knew there was no chance of my being named Prom Queen. Besides, my date made it clear where I fit into the picture when he spent all his time trying to get another girl to dance with him. By the time I decided to leave, she was telling him that she was there with someone else, which ought to have been hint enough (you go, girl!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy walk home took me through the park. I had heard stories about the park being a dangerous place at night, but I didn't have much choice. Besides, as it turned out, the stories had nothing on how dangerous it was in real life. I followed the path around the bend, and that's when I saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I thought it was a woman playing with her dog. Then the \"dog\" lifted its head, and I realized it was eating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fumbled in my purse for my pepper spray, and I realized that this creature had decided that I was something that needed to be dealt with. It stood up, and I don't know what surprised me more: the fact that it was 8 feet tall, that it stood on two legs, or that it had hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a howl, it jumped from the woman to me. As I finally found my pepper spray, the creature bit me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, I managed to spray the thing. It definitely didn't like that, judging by the noise it made. As it howled, I screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne or both of us made enough noise to get people's attention, and they came running. The beast heard them and ran off before they could get too close. Those people stayed with me, asking me all kinds of questions, trying to keep me conscious for as long as possible. I managed to stay awake in the park, on the ambulance, and seeing my parents in the hospital. It wasn't until they started treating the bite that I lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I regained consciousness, even before I opened my eyes, I heard a familiar voice say, \"... it's the waiting that's the hard part. I need to know my baby's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasha!\" she shouted, then squeezed my hand. \"I'm right here, baby. Mommy's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes, and saw a blurry figure leave the room. Mom put my glasses on my face, just in time to see a doctor walk in. \"You gave us quite the scare, young lady,\" he said. \"The EMTs were honestly surprised you made it here. Guess it wasn't your time to go. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can get you something. Don't try to do too much just yet, your stitches are still fresh.\" With that, he left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, an orderly brought me breakfast. As he set it next to me, I asked him, \"Isn't it kind of early to be drinking tequila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked me straight in the eye. \"How'd you know I had some tequila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I could smell it a mile away.\"</span></div></div>",

With just a sniff, I could tell where the cleaning staff had missed some spots. And, while I used to think of smells as either pleasant or awful, now they were <i>interesting,</i> with layers that told me so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were the sounds. I could hear people talking, not just in my room, but also down the hall. For instance, I could hear a certain orderly complaining about a certain teenage patient. \"So judgmental,\" he said. \"I have a splash of tequila in my coffee, and she gets on my case about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was bringing lunch, and it was only a few minutes before he got to my room. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling pretty good, actually,\" I said. \"But don't tell people you had a splash of tequila in your coffee: you didn't even have a splash of coffee in your tequila.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe backed out of the room, not taking his eyes off me for an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the nurse came to check on me, I asked, \"When are the police coming to interview me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" she asked. \"It was a dog attack, not a mugging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was no dog. It was 8 feet tall, on two legs, and it had hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"Witnesses who rescued you said it was a wild dog. You've been through a lot. Nobody would blame you for being confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Confused</i> was an understatement. Nothing was making any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away, I noticed that things were getting blurry. Thinking I was tired, I took my glasses off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I did, the world snapped back into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the doctor came in. \"Let's have a look at those stitches, shall we? Now, don't stress out about how it looks. At this point, it looks worse than it actually is. You'll just have some interesting scars to tell your significant other about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted the bandages. \"Hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked. The wound wasn't even black and blue. It almost looked like it was time for the stitches to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anything like this.\"</span></div></div>",

The terrain changed, but I remained sure-footed, not even breaking my stride. No matter how far I ran, I wasn't getting tired. In fact, it felt like I could run to the ends of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I awoke, it struck me that I had never dreamed of running before. Where did that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, a different orderly brought me breakfast. When I asked about the guy from yesterday, this one just said it was his day off. However, I heard him talking to the nurses outside my room, and I knew that the other orderly had checked into a rehab facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad came back, with Matt in tow. As soon as Matt got to my bedside, we hugged each other. Sure, we had each gotten on the other's nerves several times over the years, but being attacked by whatever it was that had killed and eaten that woman put it all into perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got dressed, and a nurse wheeled me out of the hospital. As we walked to the car, I noticed a man who looked to be in his twenties, staring at me. Was that pity in his eyes? What reason did he have to pity me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding I was reading way too much into the actions of a total stranger, I brushed it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, anyway.</span></div></div>",

If you own a cat, you know that they really are very affectionate, and they will greet you when you come home. When we got back from the hospital, however, Clawdette took one look at me and ran off. Later, she snuggled with the others, but the most I got from her was a hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I did when I got home was shave my legs and underarms, which had gotten pretty hairy while I was in the hospital. You can imagine my surprise, then, when they were hairy again that night, and they were just as hairy in the morning as before I shaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, I dreamed that I was hunting deer, armed with nothing but a kitchen knife. I had a sense of accomplishment following the successful hunt, even though I thought it was too bloody when I woke up. Like the running dream, the hunting dream was crazy vivid: I swear, I could smell and taste the blood, even after I woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I went back to school, things continued to change. Both Elisabeth and Sarah hugged me when I got back, but Sarah kissed me right on the mouth, and even slipped her tongue into my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-<i>kaaay,</i>\" I said, gently pushing her off. \"I didn't know you felt that way, but I'm afraid it's not a two-way street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, covering her mouth. \"I don't know what came over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, she wasn't the only one: everywhere I went, I suddenly had guys, and a few girls, following me. Even Brad Butler, who couldn't explain himself to Janelle Lee any better than Sarah could explain herself to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot enough weirdness for you? How about this: I saw the guy from the hospital again. This time, there was no doubt he was looking at me.</span></div></div>",

I still ate my veggies, but meat made my mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreaky nail growth and carnivorous cravings may sound funny, but my dreams were no laughing matter. Now, instead of running or hunting, I was killing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes it was family. Sometimes it was friends. Sometimes it was total strangers. Always, I would pick up a readily available weapon and kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two worst things about the dreams were how vivid they were, and how casually I would do it. It wasn't out of anger or frustration: I killed in my dreams only because they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was patient with me when I woke up screaming from these nightmares. Elisabeth got tired of me calling her at all hours, telling her about my dreams in full detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week after the attack, I stared at my reflection. I was looking at two things that, honestly, should not have been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, I had absolutely no scars. A week after I almost died, there was no sign that I had been bitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, despite my increased appetite in general, and my craving for meat in particular, I was definitely losing weight. My belly didn't pooch out anymore, and my double chin was down to one and a half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening to me?</span></div></div>",

Yours, and untold others'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back!\" Mom told him. \"My husband has a gun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his eyes to me. \"Have the dreams gotten bad yet?

Now that the word had been said aloud, though, it seemed to resonate with me: there was an actual word for what was happening to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the family, though, needed more convincing. \"Even if we believed you,\" Dad asked, \"how did you know that Tasha was the one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know her name,\" Mr. Woolsey replied. \"But I recognized her face from that night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought werewolves weren't supposed to remember what they did in wolf form,\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a Hollywood myth,\" Woolsey answered. \"They figured it was easier to build sympathy for a character if it wasn't really him who did those awful things. No, Tasha, you won't think the way you normally do, but it's still you in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're like this,\" Mom said, \"you must have some way to restrain yourself. What happened, that you killed that woman and passed this on to my daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two things happened, Mrs. Lyall: greed and complacency. I thought I could put some extra hours in, make extra money. I figured, I've been at this for so long, surely there's no danger.

You can renovate the basement into a safe room, most of the things you'll need are a short drive away, and whatever isn't that close, your can get over the Internet. And your neighbors prefer not to know what you're up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your first moon set, my family can lend you an armored car where you can stay those nights. Pick yourself up about 50 lbs. or so of ground beef each night for food, and a bucket of crushed ice each night for water. Once your safe room is ready, I suggest investing in rabbits. The meat from 12 of those rabbits will satisfy a night's hunger, while the energy you expend hunting them will soothe your emotions. That will be your Plan A.

In addition to losing weight, I had become stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I had the last of the meat put in place, and the crushed ice in the bucket, Mom asked, \"Do you have everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see,\" I replied. \"I've got two locks: one to help keep the doors closed, one for the steamer trunk. I've got $500 in cash, just in case something happens. I've got my smartphone. And Sarah put a playlist on it, to keep my spirits up while I'm waiting. Did I miss anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this,\" Mom said, giving me a hug and a kiss. \"I wish I could be of more help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all doing everything we can, Mom.\" I climbed into the armored car. \"We should do this, before it gets too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom locked the doors from the outside, and I padlocked them from inside. Then I took off my clothes, folded them, put them in the steamer trunk, and locked it. I poured the crushed ice out of the bag, then unwrapped the hamburger meat. Then, I brought up the playlist Sarah gave me, and pressed Play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later, \"Born To Be Wild\" filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome songs put the boogie in my feet. Others were slow, giving me a chance to rest and eat a sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to me that I still had no idea when I would change, or what it would feel like. Looking at myself didn't help: Body hair and long nails were part of my daily reality now, so seeing them told me nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the time \"She Wolf\" by Shakira started up, I screamed in pain. I suddenly felt like I was burning up. If I'd had a single stitch on, I'd have torn it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the heat subsided, the pain took over. My whole body began to swell. My feet metamorphosed into paws. Fur spread over my body. My nails grew into claws, and my teeth into fangs. My ears moved to the top of my head. My face grew into a muzzle. I grew a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my transformation complete, the pain subsided, and my system flooded with endorphins. I closed my eyes, threw back my head, and howled.</span></div></div>",

I felt <i>great!</i> I couldn't wait to go out and hunt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept I had to. Because some <i>idiot</i> locked me in this tiny room. I couldn't even stand up straight. Whose idea was this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yeah, it was my idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI prowled the tiny room, wondering if, perhaps, I had left something to hunt in here. But there was nothing. Not even a mouse! Who lives like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, sure, there was the ground meat. But where was the fun in that? How was I supposed to hunt something that was already dead? <i>When I get out of here,</i> I thought, <i>I'm coming after the people who made that dumb decision, and I'm going to tear them limb from limb!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing to hunt inside, I decided to try forcing my way out. I charged the doors as fast as I could go... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n ...which wasn't too fast, as it was so small. I bounced off the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI searched for windows, picturing myself crawling through whatever opening there was, to wreak vengeance on these meatbags for locking me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really should have noticed that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with no attainable alternatives, I ate the dead meat. After that, I crunched the ice in the bucket. Once that was all gone, I relieved myself, then curled up on the steamer trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I did this, I realized that I didn't <i>really</i> want to tear anyone apart. I was just hungry, and I wanted to satisfy that hunger. <i>Maybe</i> that's <i>why I locked myself in here,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I woke up, feeling like I'd had the best sleep of my life. I was wide awake and full of energy. For a split second, I wondered if I had really changed, or if it was just a dream. Then I saw the massive pile of wolf scat on the floor. Nope, that was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got dressed and called home. \"Hello?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom, it's Tasha. Back in human form. I'll need a shovel and a mop, then a big breakfast. Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, dear. How was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hangry for a good chunk of it. I would have preferred to hunt for my food. So I guess we definitely need to look into those rabbits. I'm glad this will be out of the way before the graduation ceremony.\"</span></div></div>",

And Mom and I both had a laugh over the pre-ordered graduation gown, which I was almost swimming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoolsey had suggested that I go to the gym to see what I was capable of now. \"The last time I went to a gym,\" I said, \"I couldn't go on social media for a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the old Tasha Lyall,\" he said. \"Let them see the new Tasha, then see what the internet has to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I did, the morning of graduation. Sure enough, by the time I got home, #goals was trending. I decided to put up a tweet contrasting the current attitude with what they said about me two years ago, with the hashtag #TheStruggleIsReal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back to graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI accepted my diploma in my big gown, then took it off as I walked away, revealing a tasteful outfit that better showed my figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter caps had been thrown to the sky, Janelle Lee came over to me. \"Looking good, Lyall,\" she said. \"I told you going vegetarian would do wonders for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" I replied, \"I eat meat with every meal. I've learned how to make a mean steak tartare, if you know somebody who's interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed it off. \"So, where are you going now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be going to college locally, so I don't have to live in a dorm. There's a certain time of the month when it's best for everyone if I'm not around people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you. Hey, I'm going to New York City to dance the night away. Wanna come with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so.\" Actually , I would have loved to go dancing, and I probably would have had to be dragged off of the dance floor when she was ready to call it a night. But I figured going from Lardass to Xena was enough of a public change: going from wallflower to party animal might raise some questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" she said, and went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, if I <i>had</i> gone dancing with her, things would have turned out differently for her.</span></div></div>",

Join me for tea, dear, there is much I wish to discuss with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat down on the couch - or <i>settee</i>, as Mrs. Woolsey called it - and Colin brought us tea, serving me first, a fact which Mrs. Woolsey definitely noticed. \"What did you want to discuss?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a young Lycan, Tasha. I don't know your romantic involvements, but I am sure you are in need of The Talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that there are a few differences between what Mom told me and what you're about to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are, indeed. For instance, you won't get sick from any sexually transmitted diseases, but you can still carry them for roughly 24 hours, before your enhanced immune system can eradicate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the big difference is in pregnancy and childbirth. If you become pregnant by another werewolf, you will carry the child for three months, whereas your mother carried you for nine. If you mate with a human, your child will most likely be human, but it may be a viewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a viewolf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnancy with a viewolf lasts the same length of time as a true werewolf pregnancy. If you were human, a viewolf pregnancy would be of great concern for you, as it could kill, and has killed, many human women. A viewolf can shapeshift almost at will, but is treated as the pack Omega. They must prove themselves worthy of advancement, in all things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it's in my child's best interest if Daddy's a werewolf, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"</span></div></div>",

I opened the steel door to the basement, to find that the staircase was now completely enclosed, with a second steel door at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening that, I found the basement was now fortified and soundproofed, so the neighbors wouldn't complain about the noise once I'd transformed. Much like Woolsey Manor, there was a place to keep my clothes, and a shower where I could clean up the morning after. \"Only one thing missing,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a few things,\" Mom said. \"And here they come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad and Matt carried in several cages of rabbits. \"You could have asked,\" I said. \"I'm strong enough, I could have helped you cut the transfer time in half, if not more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to remember that,\" Dad said. \"Anyway, you and Matt will be in charge of taking care of the rabbits, once the hutches are set up in the garage. Need anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An answer to a question: What are we going to do with my scat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will go into the compost. Have a good night.\" With that, the rest of the family left the basement, locking both doors after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was, by now, becoming a routine: I put my clothes away. I changed. I howled. I hunted. I killed. I ate. I drank. I pooped. I peed. I slept.</span></div></div>",

The legend says, he ordered a young servant to be killed, then served the boy's flesh to his guest, purely for his own amusement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Unfortunately for Lycaon, the guest was actually Zeus.

The fact that the Woolseys named their restaurant after him may mean that someone in the family is descended from Lycaon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's one heck of a thing to find out about your new employers, not to mention the people who accidentally got me into this mess.</span></div></div>",

I'm familiar with Lycan appetites, so it won't upset me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"but don't say you weren't warned.\" I was always self-conscious about how much I ate now, even though I knew that, between my metabolism and my metamorphoses, I'd have to be a pretty dedicated glutton to pack on the pounds again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was excellent. My enhanced senses loved everything about Manganiello's. I made a mental note to tell Mom and Dad about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, we went dancing. Now, before prom night, I wouldn't say I had two left feet, but I didn't dare try any fancy dance moves. Now, though, I trusted my feet more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it came time for our date to end, and Colin took me home. \"I had a good time,\" I said, as Colin walked me to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad,\" he replied. \"So, can I call you tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came the moment I fantasized about all through high school: Colin Channing kissed me.

What's she been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staying out of trouble,\" I replied. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same,\" she said, and turned to face me. When she did, I almost dropped the popcorn and sodas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle looked <i>dead.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't mean she was tired-looking. I mean she looked like a corpse. She smelled like one, too. And, when she smiled, I saw fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I put two and two together: Janelle was a vampire. And, from the looks she was giving me, she now knew I was a werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, uh, what are you doing?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cab driver. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waitress. But I hope to be a chef one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went on like that, until Brad came to Janelle with the refreshments, which were all for him.

She and I were both new at this, and I figured it wouldn't be a completely bad idea for us to be in touch, albeit without the knowledge of those higher up in our respective communities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it struck me: Janelle said she was a cab driver. So, in order to find her, I asked Mom and Dad to do a little digging, to find out who the youngest cabbie working nights at each company was. Even without asking her name, it didn't take long for us to find an 18-year-old girl driving for the Knightley Cab Company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, I checked my work schedule, to find a night when I would be working late. With that information, I got a lift to work from Mom, then asked the Knightley dispatcher to send Janelle to pick me up and take me home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on schedule, Janelle drove up just as I was walking out of Lycaon. I gave her my address, and we were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" I said, \"you're a cab driver now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're a waitress,\" she replied. \"How's the food? Tourists are always asking for recommendations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food is wonderful,\" I answered, \"and I'm not just saying that because they pay me the medium-sized bucks. For people of more modest means, give Manganiello's a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time for us to talk about the elephant and the 800-pound gorilla in the cab. \"How long have you been a vampire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember graduation night, when I went off to dance the night away? I snuck into this underground rave, four guys bit me, and I woke up in the morgue. When did you become a werewolf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prom night. The guy who took me wanted to dance with someone else, so I went home early. I was walking through the park, and I saw this beast eating somebody. It attacked me, and I used my pepper spray on it. It ran off, but not before it bit me. As I recovered, I realized I was going through some changes. Then this guy shows up, says he's a werewolf, and he was the one who attacked me, so now <i>I'm</i> a werewolf, too.\" I paused, then asked, \"What do I look like to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth? You're covered with fur, and you smell like an animal. What do I look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like death warmed over, and you smell even worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got quiet for a while after that. Then, Janelle said, \"I envy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You envy me? What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can walk in the sunshine like it's no big deal. You can eat food. You can have children. All that was taken away from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can run around every night of the month. No matter when, you always think like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Twilight</i> made us look stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, <i>nobody</i> looked good in <i>Twilight</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we pulled up to my house, she asked, \"Would you like for me to make sure you get in safely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessary. Thanks for the ride.\" I gave her a $10 tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your car is out of the shop soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My car is fine,\" I told her. \"But you and I got to talk this way.\"</span></div></div>",

The fact that the men stood behind the woman told me she was the leader, and the way she smelled told me she was a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasha Lyall?\" she asked, with a hint of an Irish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Aoife.

Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For our purposes, it's sound as a pound. For centuries, werewolves and vampires have strictly avoided each other, after thousands of years of trying to kill each other. Many of us, in both communities, feel it's time for a change.\" She sat down across from me. \"We want to reach out, test the waters, as it were. That's where you come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I'm a waitress. You want a diplomat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we want is someone with a friend on the other side. That's you, and that's Janelle Lee, and that's devil a one else. You and she will be our secret diplomats. You carry on with her, as you've been doing. Then you tell me, and Janelle tells my sister, what's the craic. We want peace between us, Tasha. Show us the way there.\" With that, she and her cohorts left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first move was to call Janelle. She answered on the second ring. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janelle, you're not going to believe this, but an Irish vampire whose name I can't pronounce wants me to be a diplomat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be my sister, Aoife,\" said a voice that sounded familiar. In fact, she sounded almost exactly like my vampiric dinner guest. <i>She must be the sister,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you might have gathered,\" Janelle said, \"it's a bit easier for me to believe than you thought. So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto. Call me tomorrow afternoon, we'll start figuring this out.\"</span></div></div>",

You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto. How are we supposed to create peace, when we don't even know why there was a war?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. Finola just said she wanted us to try being friends, and that I should tell her what works and what doesn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure are confident in our abilities, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure it's a question of confidence. Vampires and werewolves haven't been getting along for centuries, millennia, even. Maybe we're the first ones who were on a first-name basis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I heard about this one thrall, they wouldn't turn him into a werewolf, because he was going out with a vampire. A culture like that, it's gotta be hard to break through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lee brought me a soda, then left. \"How's being a werewolf treating you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a cat, Clawdette. After I was bitten, she hissed at me and avoided me. She's calmed down now, she just watches me when I'm around. Hopefully, she'll start accepting treats from me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she will. I've read that cats are far more social than people give them credit for. She'll work out that you're still her person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged her. Hers were the first words of hope offered to me on the subject of Clawdette.</span></div></div>",

Taking out my smartphone, I checked my work schedule against the lunar cycle. \"I've got a couple nights off coming before the moon. I'll call you later, and we can set it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the hallway was dark, Janelle was able to walk into it, and she gave me a hug.

For someone who had only recently been introduced to the world of the supernatural, she seemed to appreciate the importance of our meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it went well, Mrs. Lee,\" I said. \"Thanks for having us over. I hope Matt wasn't too difficult for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. They've been sitting quietly this whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked past Mrs. Lee. Matt and Courtney were sitting together on the sofa. Matt had his arm around her, and she didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Janelle, as did her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Janelle said. \"I must have picked it up from Finola.\" She cleared her throat and called out, \"What are your intentions toward my sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Courtney both jumped. \"We... we weren't doing anything,\" Matt stammered. \"We were just... just sitting here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk about this later, Matt,\" I said.

Even if I didn't trust you, my senses told me nothing untoward happened. But we were in the house of an angry vampire, and I had to get you out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think Courtney's sister acted like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was looking to protect her little sister. Courtney was ovulating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if she's on the rag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not <i>menstruating,</i> Matt, <i>ovulating.</i> She's fertile. And Janelle didn't want you sniffing around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt slumped in his seat. \"I guess you think I shouldn't see her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that, and I don't mean that. My goal is to establish a peaceful settlement between vampire and werewolf, and I think a romantic relationship may do just as much good as girlfriends. But you may need to be careful, until Janelle comes around.\"</span></div></div>",

How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've adjusted pretty well,\" I replied. \"I would think of my moon sets as inconveniences, if it weren't for the fact that I'm fully capable of murder those nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which,\" she said, \"would you care to join us at the manor for those nights? Feel free to bring the family, we would love to have you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words sounded like a casual invitation, but the underlying tone spoke of a woman accustomed to getting her way. Getting out of this would require serious diplomacy. \"I wouldn't want to impose on you, ma'am,\" I said, trying to match her jaunty manner. \"And my brother would be an imposition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, dear, he can't be that bad. He was raised by the same woman who raised you, after all.\" Damn. She was determined not to let me out of this easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI conceded that she was higher up in the pack than I was. \"I will pass along your invitation, ma'am, and let you know later.\" If anyone in the family had a prior commitment, I could at least get them out of the invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a miserable time for the only pressing issue to be Dad's drive to work. I accepted the invitation, bracing myself for Matt to embarrass me somehow.</span></div></div>",

After months of isolation from her, I was accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second surprise came when we arrived at Woolsey Manor, and Matt actually behaved himself. I expected him to say and do every embarrassing thing possible, with the possible exception of walking around without pants on, but he behaved, if not like a perfect gentleman, at least like someone who had been allowed out of the house before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Woolsey seemed like she was going to compliment Matt on his comportment, but, before she could, a blur of motion knocked him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to ask when the Woolseys had gotten a dog, when I looked, and saw that Matt had been knocked down by a girl. \"Hi,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,... hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Woolsey pulled the girl to her feet. \"Luna, these are the Lyalls: Henry, Nina, Tasha, and Matt.

The poor thing had gone through her first moon with no prior knowledge. Her parents were killed by a monster hunter, you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Luna ran past us, heading for her own cell. Unlike myself, she didn't wait until she was locked in to take off her clothes. She was down to her bra and panties by the time she reached the dungeon, and was stark naked before she reached the door to her cell. A thrall followed her, picking up her clothes. The expression on her face as she shook her head told me that, in Luna's short time at the manor, she had become known for this behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kissed Colin goodnight, and he locked me in. I took off my clothes and put them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I changed, I howled. My howl was joined by others in the pack, including one who couldn't have been more than a cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI liked hunting rabbits, because no two ever ran the same way. I had to think in order to catch them, and their terror made the meat taste better. Much better than the ground beef I had to eat my first moon set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy belly nearly full, I drank from the trough, then relieved myself, and I curled up in a pile of hay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the cell door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ears picked up as the intruder, who smelled familiar, approached. I wanted to sleep. Why did this human want to bother me? I gave a warning growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human ignored my growl, reaching toward me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled louder. Nevertheless, he persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched my arm, and I had enough. I sank my fangs into his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed enough, as the human backed away. I settled back into the hay pile. It occurred to me that there were some consequences to the bite of a werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before I fell asleep, I recognized the scent of the human who had come into my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Colin.</span></div></div>",

The two men had black hair and the woman was a redhead, but that was all I could see of them. I felt a chill run down my spine as they turned my way. All of them had pale faces and wore sunglasses. Their expressions were cold, almost emotionless, as they then walked on without saying a word. I shuddered at the experience and made a note to mention them when the police questioned me later. Strangely, though, no police officer came to get my statement. I asked a nurse about it, who could only shrug. \"All I can tell you, miss, is that, during a full moon, there is a rise in homicide cases in the area.\" Softly, she said. \"Most of them have been deemed wild dog attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, remembering the towering wolflike creature that had bit me, and remained silent as the nurse changed the subject. \"Your wound is healing remarkably fast. Staying in good shape must help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I thought the nurse was trying to be smart with me, and threw the covers off of me to give her a piece of my mind. Only I froze upon doing so, seeing that I somehow now had a lean and muscular frame. I looked like I was in better shape than Janelle Lee! \"What...?!\" was all I could say in my surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright, dear?\" Turning to me, the nurse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was confused, though somewhat happy. \"I- I think I need to use the bathroom.\" Muttering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse nodded, then aided me to the bathroom, though I felt as if I could now run a marathon without breaking a sweat. As I walked towards the bathroom, I stumbled slightly, as sounds and smells began to flood my mind. It was a bit overwhelming, it frightened me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is happening to me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds and smells and, later on, the sights continued to flood my mind, to the point I was tempted to ask for a sleeping pill. Somehow, I made it through the day, and watched as the sun began to set. Once I saw the moon in the night sky,...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

That you can smell what everyone on this floor is having for their meals. That you can see a small crow on the water tower on the horizon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the picture.\" Tearing up, I said. \"I take it I've been turned into one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoife nodded. \"Yes, though that was not the intent.\" Softly, she replied. \"Your fast thinking with the pepper spray may have spared you from a grim demise, but it has cursed you with a more grueling fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are what you might call a cleaning crew.\" Speaking for the first time, Cain said. \"We clean up the messes left by werewolves, so to maintain the Masquerade that they do not exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Frowning, I demanded. \"Are you going to finish me off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoife sighed. \"I understand your fears, colleen.\" Calmly, she said. \"However, you must control your emotions. You are changing rapidly, from the inside, and it will wreak havoc upon your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be released from the hospital tomorrow morning with a clean bill of health.\" Serious, Slade added. \"However, the life you knew is over, and a new one is about to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was literally trembling at this point. \"Why are you telling me all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, colleen, we know what you are going through.\" Calmly, Aoife replied. \"We have seen it happen again and again over the centuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then smiled, revealing a pair of long, pearl-white fangs.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I dreamed that I was running free through a dark woods, chasing after a man in a suit of armor on a horse. I could sense others running with me, but my focus was on the man. I could smell the sweat on him and his horse, and I could sense their utter terror. It filled me with a strange sense of excitement as I pushed myself to run faster. I heard the man scream as I leaped upon him and drove my teeth into the soft flesh of his exposed neck. Blood gushed into my mouth, increasing my excitement, as I bit again and again, before letting out a haunting howl to the full moon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke with a start, sweat pouring all over my body. I noticed that I was biting onto the metal bar of my bed. I began to shiver from both the chill of my sweat and fear of the nightmare, still very much fresh in my mind. The orderly from before entered my room, looking very much concerned. \"Nightmare?\" Softly, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"It was... so real.\" Trembling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orderly nodded before letting out a low sigh. \"My name is Randall Woolsey.\" Calmly, he said. \"We met that night of the full moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped. \"You're the one who attacked me!\" Hoarsely, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scrambled for the nurse call button, only to be stopped by Randall's hand. He had a grip like a vise. \"Listen and understand.\" Softly, he hissed. \"I have to look after you until your first full moon, to save face in the family. Any lives lost due to you after your first transformation will be on me, unless I get you ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you at least get me some dry clothes?\" Frightened, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall nodded. \"After you are changed, we will need to have a long talk before the doctors release you.\" Serious, he said. \"I was sloppy that night... I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed me a towel and a fresh set of scrubs before turning around so I could change. \"What did that woman do to deserve being eaten alive?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was a reporter.\" Darkly, Randall replied. \"She was hell bent upon exposing the existence of our kind to the world.\" He sighed. \"All efforts were made to discreetly detour her, but she refused to relent. Taking her down was the last option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" Sadly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much... \" Sighing, Randall replied. \"The job had been done by the time you came to investigate, but I was too hyped up from the hunt... As I said, I was sloppy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the tequila?\" Now dry and dressed, I asked. \"I'm decent now, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall turned around, shrugging. \"No better way to drown the blues after getting the riot act from my parents, the pack, and the cleaning crew.\" Softly, he said. \"I'm certain another riot act will come from you and your parents, once the truth of what had happened to you comes out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, uncertain how to react. \"Well... what's done is done, and it can't be undone.\" Albeit reluctantly, I said. \"All I can do is move on, so... what can you tell me of what to expect up to my first full moon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall sighed, a small grin appearing on his face. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The nightmares are not only going to continue, but get worse, until your first full moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered at the thought. \"I dreamed that I was part of a group hunting a man on horseback in medieval armor.\" Softly, I said. \"I bit into his neck again and again, then howled at the full moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not an expert in dreams, Tasha.\" Calmly, Randall said. \"However, I can tell you that the nightmares will end after your first full moon. From there, you will start your new life as a werewolf and a part of the pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall blushed slightly. \"Well,... I sort of like you.\" Softly, he said. \"I was devastated when I realized I had bit you in the heat of the moment,... \" His voice trailed off. \"But... you probably hate me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother surprise. I had no idea that Randall Woolsey liked me, or even knew I existed. I was again uncertain of how to respond. All I could think to say was, \"You never know what the future might bring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall turned to me, surprised, then smiled more, seeing me blush. \"You never know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe exchanged a shy smile, but I changed the subject before things got too awkward. \"Um... Am I a member of the undead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans refer to us as the undead.\" Calmly, Randall replied. \"They fear what they do not understand, and oftentimes hunt it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... what am I?\"  Uncertain, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are what we are.\" Shrugging, Randall replied. \"Our bite does not change anyone, unless under the power of the full moon, or something like that. I'm not a doctor either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that. \"What are you, then?\" Grinning, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall sighed. \"I'm a hunter in training.\" Softly, he said. \"The reporter was my first ordered slay, and perhaps my last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed myself. \"I forgive you, Randall Woolsey.\" Looking him in the eye, I said. \"Do you forgive me for the pepper spray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall chuckled. \"I was blinded for a good ten minutes due to your move, but... it was self defense, so, yeah, I forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else should I expect?\" Calmly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to get leaner and stronger as you get closer to the next full moon.\" Serious, Randall said. \"You are going to need a safe place to lock yourself up during your first transformation, to protect yourself and those around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me with that?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall nodded. \"My family can. They will be meeting with your parents tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to say something, but paused, as I smelled Mom's perfume and heard Dad's heavy footsteps approaching.

Every time I was holding something back, I would gulp as if swallowing the guilt of not sharing something. \"Four strange people came to see me just as the sun went down.\" Softly, I explained. \"One woman and two men, claiming to be the cleaning crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told Mom and Dad everything that the three had told me, then told them about Randall Woolsey, who claimed to have been the werewolf who had bit me.

Mom continue to inspect every part of my body before finally having me put back on the scrubs and sat down next to me. \"Your father and I met in college.\" Softly, she explained. \"We were both taking a minor in parapsychology, the study of the paranormal: ghosts,... vampires,... werewolves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were fascinated by them.\" Finally settling down, Dad said. \"We often joked that one of us would end up becoming one or the other.\" He gulped, tearing up. \"We never dreamed it would happen to our only daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randall Woolsey said that he would bring his parents to the house tomorrow night, to talk to you two.\" Nervous, I said. \"They want me to be prepared for my first full moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad turned to each other, worried.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I now had a narrow face, with sharp green eyes, elf-like pointed ears, and a dark nose, like that on a wolf. I raised my hands to touch my face, and found that I now had long, pointed fingernails. Upon touching my face, I discovered that I had almost clear-colored peach fuzz on my face. In fact, it was all over my body. There was no more denying it.

It was over one hundred acres of dense forest land that, once you were in it, made noon look like twilight. At the edge of the forest was the Woolsey estate. It looked much like a fortress that had been converted into a mansion. Looking upon it all, I had the urge to run out into the forest... to hunt. \"This place is incredible.\" Smiling, I said. \"How do they even afford it all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Werewolves age far more slowly than humans.\" Calmly, Dad explained. \"Truebloods age even more slowly, so they can acquire vast fortunes in their lifetime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe pulled up to the main house. Once we stepped out, a valet took the car to be parked elsewhere, while a tall, attractive woman walked out to greet us. With her were two people I recognized, Brad Butler and Colin Channing. \"Fancy meeting you two here.\" Surprised, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" Nodding, Colin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Woolsey... \" Bowing, Dad said. \"It's an honor to meet you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, taken aback, as Dad, then Mom, kissed her hand. \"The honor is mine.\" Smiling back, the woman said. \"Though, please, call me Susi.\" She turned to me. \"You must be Tasha... my son has said so much about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All good, I hope.\" forcing a smile, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi giggled. \"Do not hide your emotions, child.\" Calmly, she said. \"We werewolves can sense your emotions before you even show them. It is natural to be nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they werewolves too?\" Motioning to Colin and Brad, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are Lycan thralls.\" Patiently, Susi replied. \"They work for our family in exchange for protection or political favor.\" She smiled. \"Why don't we take this conversation inside where we can be more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi led us inside the mansion, where Colin and Brad took our coats before leaving us, while Susi invited us into a grand dining hall. \"The public event is not for several hours, but I find conversations go far more smoothly over a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad and Collin returned and helped us into chairs, while Susi seated herself before taking a moment to collect her thoughts. \"First, I taught the Parapsychology class your parents minored in during their college years.\" Serious, she began. \"They actually tied for best student couple with two others. Before you ask, no, they had no idea I was a werewolf until they contacted me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told that everything of who and what I am would be explained.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi nodded. \"Those who become Lycan thralls are sometimes inducted into the pack, though Bradley is disqualified, for reasons I will not discuss.\" Calmly, she said. \"Those who are bitten, for whatever reason, and survive are automatically inducted into the pack, to preserve the Masquerade. This includes you, which brings us to The Talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. \"I have a feeling it's a bit different from The Talk Mom gave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi smiled. \"First, you can get pregnant, but you will never acquire any STDs, outside of being a carrier for about twenty four hours, the time needed for your new enhanced immune system to eradicate it.\" She turned to Mom, a bemused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom cleared her throat. \"If you become pregnant by another werewolf, you will carry the child for three months, whereas I carried you for nine.\" Blushing, she said. \"If you mate with a human, your child will most likely be human, but it may be a viewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?!\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human/werewolf hybrid.\" Softly, Dad explained. \"Pregnancy with a viewolf has the same three month gestation period. Only, if a human were to mate a werewolf, her pregnancy would be problematic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upon or shortly after birth, the viewolf can and has killed their human mother, due to the fact they can shapeshift at will.\" Serious, Susi said. \"As such, they are treated as the pack Omega. They must prove themselves worthy in all aspects of life within the pack, and only a select few have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess it would be in the best interest of my child to have a werewolf father.\" Disappointed, I said. \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not personal, child.\" Calmly, Susi said. \"It is simply the life of a werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that all of your teachings were the truth and not legend.\" Pale, Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi smiled. \"The truth is often stranger than fiction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Colin served me first, which Susi definitely noticed, as she flashed me a knowing smile, before silently nodding at him as he served her, blushing. Once all of the covered dishes were served, Brad poured everyone what looked like a fine red wine. I nearly jumped when I smelled blood. I turned to Susi, who smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are Bloody Marys, a reinvented cocktail classic, featuring citrine-colored pig's blood consomm\u00e9 and Tito's vodka.\" Calmly, she explained. \"Pig's blood is a touch more fragrant to the nose than the pungent tomato sauce from the original recipe.\" She gave a light giggle. \"However, for you, we have provided a vegetable juice, as you are a bit too young for alcohol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, then turned to the covered dish in front of me. I was a bit relieved when it was revealed to be a fine slice of venison, though rare. \"I have a lot to get used to.\" Softly, I said. \"I was a strict vegetarian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Bemused, Susi inquired. \"Try the vegetable juice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, not knowing what to expect, and took a cautious sip. I immediately regretted it, and turned to find Colin holding up a bucket, into which I spit out the juice before the drink was taken away. \"What... ?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi giggled again. \"Werewolves, like regular wolves, prefer everything from nature, not processed from a store, which is one of the many things you will need to get used to, Tasha.\" Calmly, she said. She paused as Colin then placed a different red drink in front of me. \"This should be more agreeable to your palate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I lifted the glass and sniffed the drink. It smelled fantastic, and I took a sip. It tasted even better, and, before I knew it, I had drunk it all down. \"That was amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juice.\" Bemused, Susi replied. \"Anything processed, you will immediately reject. It is a natural survival instinct.\" She motioned to the meal in front of us. \"Please, enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad began to eat in small bites, taking sips of their Bloody Marys, turning a worried eye to me occasionally as I reluctantly picked up the fork and knife. All the while, Susi watched me with increasing bemusement as I took my first bite. To both my surprise and delight, it was the greatest thing I had ever tasted! Before I could stop myself, I had dropped the fork and knife and was tearing into the venison as if i was tearing it off the carcass of a freshly killed deer. \"Tasha!\" Mortified, Mom gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi raised her hand, silencing Mom. \"It's perfectly normal.\" Kindly, she said. \"Her first transformation is going to require an insane amount of calories, which she seriously lacks, which is why I invited you all to a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had finished the large slice of venison that had been offered to me, and turned to Susi as if to beg for more. \"I- I can't believe I just ate meat.\" Blushing, I said. \"I'm even more surprised that I'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not.\" Bemused, Susi said. \"You are going through a lot of changes at a rapid pace, and need the nutrients to fuel them.\" She snapped her fingers, and Colin brought forth another plate of venison. \"By all means, Tasha, eat your fill.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a window, but it was a good fifteen feet up, and had thick metal bars in it. \"I take it this is where you go when you transform.\" Gulping, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi nodded. \"We have more than enough cells to accommodate every last member and guest of the mansion.\" Serious, she explained. \"This is where you will be staying for your first full moon tomorrow night.\" She motioned to a trunk in one corner. \"That will be where you will lock up your belongings, so you have something to wear come morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, we're staying here for the weekend?\" Curious, Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that frighten you, pup?\" Smiling, Susi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shrugged. \"I dunno... \" Nonchalant, he replied. \"I haven't been attacked by one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi giggled. \"Your innocence is refreshing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe roughed up his hair, causing him to chuckle before she turned to me. \"How is your relationship with your cat, Clawdette?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you... ?\" Surprised, I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi motioned to Mom and Dad, and I sighed, knowing they must have already talked about everything at length. \"She avoids me. I mean she completely avoids me. I have not seen hide nor hair of her since I got back from the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi nodded. \"She will come around in a few days.\" Calmly, she said. \"I have a pet cat as well, we call her Shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we came back up from the cellar, I saw a large black cat approaching us in the hall who walked straight up to Susi and began to rub her body against her leg in a form of greeting, then moved on and the tour continued. \"I'm surprised she didn't hiss at me.\" Wincing, I said. \"Is she just used to werewolves around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi nodded. \"Give Clawdette time.\" Smiling, she said. \"Cats are sociable creatures. She will get to know the new you, and learn to love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur tour ended with our guest bedchambers, where Dad and Matt found tuxedos waiting for them, and Mom and I found elegant dresses waiting for us. \"The social event begins in three hours.\" Serious, Susi said. \"Please be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, we were left to our rooms.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

They were opened for us by Collin and Brian, in old century servant uniforms. Beyond them, inside the spacious ballroom, we all saw a large number of men and women dancing together. Moving among them were all sorts of entertainers including jugglers, acrobatic dancers, violin players, and singers. It was a classic early century theme. Randall approached me, wearing an insanely expensive looking suit, and bowed before me. \"May I have this dance, milady?\" smiling, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be honored.\" Smiling back, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall kissed my hand, like the gentlemen of old, and escorted me to the dance floor. Mom and Dad were not too far behind, leaving Matt alone like a small male wallflower. Only I gave a bemused smile as a girl Matt's age approached him and did a curtsy. \"Would you care to take me to the dance floor, noble gentleman?\" Smiling, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed, looking a bit awkward. \"I'm hardly a gentleman.\" Blushing, he said. \"Besides, I'm not that good at dancing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl giggled then grabbed Matt's hand. \"Shut up and dance with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed even more, but smiled as the girl pulled him out onto the dance floor. I could not help laugh, seeing Matt like putty in a strange girl's hands. Randall chuckled as well, then turned to me. \"Her name is Luna. My mother adopted her last year.\" Softly, he explained. \"She is a Lupine, a naturally born werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to her parents?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall sighed. \"Her parents were killed by an unknown monster hunter.\" Sadly, he replied. \"Luna does not know who it was. She spent weeks in the midnight forest, alone, before Mom found her, just after her first full moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That had to have been terrifying for her.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall nodded. \"She has come a long way since then.\" Smiling, he said. \"I'm actually surprised she went right up to Matt. She's normally so shy.\" He chuckled. \"Do you think your little brother can handle her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned. \"Matt,... He's a wild child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... what?\" confused, Randall asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled. \"Matt was adopted too.\" Whispering, I said. \"We found him in the mountain wilderness two years ago, running with the wolves.\" I sighed, a sad look forming on my face. \"For some strange reason, he only listened to Mom, Dad, and me, so we were given the right to adopt him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a strange coincidence.\" Smiling, Randall said. \"It's a small wonder the two hit it off so smoothly.\" He paused. \"Do you think he might... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Wincing, I replied. \"He does not smell like... I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall winced. \"Those naturally born have the same scent as humans, until their first transformation. It's a protective measure.\" Worried, he said. \"I will inform Mom of this, and see what she thinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the dancing continued, with entertainers moving among us, until the song ended, and everyone applauded the band, who bowed. Everyone fell silent as Susi raised her hand for attention. \"Welcome, all, to the Hunter's Moon Ball.\" Calmly, she said. \"We only have one new member this year... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may, Mother.\" suddenly, Randall announced. \"We may have two new members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi raised a single eyebrow, then gave a bemused smile, as Luna pulled Matt forward to be seen by all. \"Can I keep him?\" Beaming, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guests roared into laughter, with Mom and Dad joining, though nervously. Susi gave a bemused smile and approached Matt before lifting his chin with one hand, and used a finger to push down his lip to look at his teeth. After a moment, she giggled, then winked at the guests. \"Two new members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the guests laughed, then applauded as Susi then said, \"Please welcome to our pack, Tasha and Matt Lyall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a curtsy and Matt bowed, as the guests cheered and applauded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the party, all of the guests moved down to the cellar, where the men and women entered their own cells as the thralls closed and locked the heavy doors. \"Do I have to go in one of those?\" Worried, Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded. \"It's not so bad.\" Cooing, she said. \"I was scared of it too, once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a precaution.\" Calmly, Susi said. \"We will know for certain once morning comes, and everyone is released.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, Matt walked into one of the cells and the heavy door was closed and locked behind him. Sighing, I entered a cell of my own, and prepared myself for my first transformation under the full moon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once I had it off, I folded it neatly and placed it into the trunk that was provided and found, to my relief, there were my old jeans and blouse, waiting for me to wear in the morning. As instructed, I locked all of my clothes into the trunk, and waited as the room slowly got dark with the setting sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I felt nothing. Then, a strange feeling came over me in sharp waves of both pleasure and pain. Every part of my body felt as if it were on fire, but, at the same time, I felt surges of high energy and power. The pain was making me stronger and stronger. I began to scream, then laugh, then scream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's happening to me?!</i> Curious, and frightened, I thought. <i>It's so strange.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my hands, and saw that the skin was literally bubbling, as if all of the muscles and bones were reshaping themselves into a different form. My fingernails hardened, then grew into something more like claws, as pads formed upon my palms. My light peach fuzz body hair darkened and became thicker. Within seconds, I was covered in a dark brown fur, and I was forced to scream again as the pain forced me onto all fours. Again, I laughed as the pleasurable pain moved to my face. I could feel my nose being pulled forward, as my senses began to pick up the scent of everyone in the other cells, and hear their own cries and laughter. Finally, the transformation was complete, and I rose onto my hind legs, giving out a loud joyous howl. It was joined by a chorus of other howls, including one that sounded strangely familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never felt so powerful, or so free, in my entire life! I wanted to jump about, to run through the wilderness,... to hunt. I looked around, and became enraged to find that there were no visible exits. But that mood instantly improved as I heard a door open, and saw a number of rabbits hop into the cell with me. <i>Prey...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCapturing and devouring the first rabbit was all too easy, but the death cry of the first alerted the others that there was a threat among them, and they all scattered, rushing to find hiding places. There were plenty of places to hide among the hay, blankets, trunk, and little holes in the cell walls. This only made the hunt all the more satisfying, and I had caught and devoured them all. After such a satisfying meal, I wiped the blood clean from my face with my arm, and drank my fill from the bucket of cold water, before relieving myself in the hay and lying down in the blankets to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Realizing it was the taste of rabbit, I remembered my actions of the night before and quickly got dressed, wanting to brush my teeth. Once I was dressed, a firm knock came to the cell door and a small panel opened revealing Susi's face. Seeing that I was dressed, she smiled and opened the cell door. \"How was your first experience?\" Calmly, she asked. \"Do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny how you refer to it as an experience.\" Smiling slightly, I replied. \"It was incredible, but also frightening. As for how I feel,... I can't explain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try.\" Smiling, Susi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel stronger, more confident than before.\" After a thought, I said. \"It's like nothing before this matters at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi nodded. \"That is because your life before is over, and you are reborn into a new life as a werewolf.\" Calmly, she said. \"Now, I'm certain you are worried about your little brother, Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he transform?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi nodded. \"He did: only, when we released him, we were in for a cute surprise.\" Bemused, she said. \"The pack has affectionately dubbed him Cub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Curious, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi giggled and pointed to the cell Matt was assigned. Curious, I looked in to find him petting the rabbits that were given to him. \"He didn't eat them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He played with them all night long, just as a wolf cub would.\" Smiling, she said. \"That, of course, will change as he gets older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up at me and smiled. \"Morning, sis.\" Happily, he said. \"When's breakfast? I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of the pack laughed. \"I think we can find you something to satisfy both of your appetites, Cub.\" Grinning, Susi she said. \"Luna will take you to the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled sheepishly as Luna took his hand. \"Come on!\" Smiling, she said. \"I can smell them cooking eggs from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sniffed the air and moaned, his mouth watering. \"I can also smell bacon, buttered toast, and apple pie,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, seeing Matt and Luna rush up the stairs, while Colin and Brian gathered the rabbits from Matt's cell. \"I wonder why he's not as scared as I was.\" Worried, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Albeit briefly, he lived with wolves.\" Softly, Susi said. \"It was just a matter of his mind returning to those times.\" She placed a reassuring hand onto my shoulder. \"He will have an easier transition because of it.\" She sighed. \"Luna was the same way until the last full moon. She now eats the rabbits, but she is a growing girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that. \"We are going to have to convert our basement to accommodate two werewolves now.\" Softly, I said. \"I just hope Mom and Dad can take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have known your mother and father for years, Tasha.\" Smiling, Susi said. \"All I will say is that, although they do not realize it, this pack owes them many favors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the Woolsey estate and returning home, I found two familiar faces waiting for me: my friends from school, Elisabeth Brooks and Sarah Patterson.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With the ice broken, I told my friends all that had happened to me after the wolf attack. By the time I finished, they were wide-eyed, but, surprisingly, not afraid. They seemed more curious than before. \"So... you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, got bit by a werewolf.\" Thoughtful, Susan said. \"Only you survived, and, now, you are a werewolf, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt was always a werewolf, but had just reached the age for his first transformation.\" also thoughtful, Elisabeth said. She sighed. \"So, what do you eat when you,... um,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wolf out?\" Ruefully, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Elisabeth nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I eat rabbits... don't ask, you'll only puke.\" I then smiled. \"Matt just played with them, like a little wolf cub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed at that, while my friends again giggled. \"Well, you look great, other than needing a major wax job and a shower.\" Smiling, Elisabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tried that, it just grows back the next day.\" Softly, I said. \"Also, I did shower\" I turned to Matt, who sighed and walked up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take the child out of the wild, but not the wild out of the child.\" Bemused, Susan said. \"Anyway, what does this mean for you... for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one can know of this, outside of this inner circle.\" Serious, I said. \"There are very powerful forces bent upon keeping up the Masquerade that werewolves do not exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine.\" Wincing, Elisabeth said. \"Do you only eat meat now, or... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can eat fruits and vegetables, but they have to be all natural, or I'll just puke them right back up.\" serious, I said. \"When we change every full moon, Matt and I have to be locked up in a cell, or we will run wild, and no one will be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we still hang out?\" Hopeful, Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. \"Of course!\" Happy, I replied. I then sighed. \"I just don't know how Matt's friends will react to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can hang out with us.\" Serious, Elisabeth said. \"Annoying or not, he's always been fun to have around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys.\" Tearing up, I said. \"Your friendship means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all shared a hug at that point.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after Susan and Elisabeth left in good terms, I closed the door and turned to find myself facing Aoife and her associates, Cain and Slade. I jumped, a short scream escaping my lips. \"How did you do that?!\" Startled, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoife smiled. \"It takes years of practice, colleen.\" Calmly, she said. \"You need to focus your senses, until smelling and hearing someone coming becomes second nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you to my home?\" More calmly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand you are close friends with Janelle Lee from your school.\" Serious, Aoife said. \"She is now a vampire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janelle... a vampire?\" Surprised, i asked. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like you... wrong place at the wrong time.\" Calmly Aoife said. \"It is rare for two to be close friends on the opposite sides of the coin. This is an diplomatic opportunity we dare not pass up, as it may not come along for another century, if ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Wincing, I asked. \"We're close friends, yes but we're hardly diplomats.\" I sighed. \"I thought the two were mortal enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a war centuries ago, one that pulled the humans into the fray.\" Serious, Aoife said. \"You know it as the Dark Ages.\" She sighed. \"Now, we both honor an unsteady cease fire, to maintain the Masquerade and keep the human population out of our hair, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only now you want to find a way towards an actual peace treaty.\" Thoughtful I said. \"I have not seen Janelle since prom night... I would like to meet her again,... but I need to know what started it all, before we even start any kind of talks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoife nodded. \"To begin with, vampires had used werewolves as bodyguards, to protect them while they slept and provided places for them to be locked up during their full moon transformations.\" Calmly, she explained. \"Only over the years, this mutually beneficial arrangement blurred, until vampires saw werewolves as nothing but their mindless servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mistake was made... something that enraged the werewolves.\" Quietly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dracula - yes, he exists - killed a female werewolf in front of her pack.\" Darkly, Finola said. \"This angered the entire pack, and they attacked in force. As it was a full moon, Dracula was forced to fall back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought vampires were immortal.\" Confused, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does not mean we do not feel pain, colleen.\" Serious, Aoife countered. \"That, and a human can kill a vampire with the right tools, we are not invulnerable.\" She sighed. \"Needless to say, Dracula slaughtered the entire pack out of anger. He meant to make them serve as an example not to cross vampires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only it pissed off the werewolves instead.\" Guessing correctly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoife nodded. \"Thus, the war began.\" Sadly, she said. \"The very next full moon, the entire werewolf community slaughtered every last dhampir and thrall in a hundred mile radius of the castle, which was what dragged the human population into the fray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are dhampirs?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dhampir is a human/vampire hybrid.\" Calmly, Aoife explained. \"They can only become a vampire if they give in to bloodlust. Otherwise, they only have a nigh immortality, living up to four hundred years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much like a werewolf.\" thoughtful I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Aoife nodded. \"The war lasted until the beginning of the Italian Renaissance, which was when Dracula and Lycaon, the first werewolf, reluctantly signed a cease fire agreement that began the Masquerade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this Lycaon still alive?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoife shook her head. \"He died shortly after the cease fire was signed, a victim of the Van Helsing family.\" Softly, she said. Her face turned dark. \"That is a very carefully guarded secret I am trusting you with, colleen. It does not take much to enrage the werewolf community.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that and slowly nodded. \"I will not repeat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister and I will arrange the meeting.\" Calmly, Aoife said. \"Until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she and her two associates were gone, as if they had never been there. I could only shake my head. \"I've got to learn that trick.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If something happens to one, the other suffers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that and silently nodded. Only a slight smile touched the corners of my mouth as Mike ran to the car. \"This is so cool!\" Excited, he said. \"How fast does she go?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classified.\" Softly, Mike replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt pouted. \"You're no fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sighed. \"The meeting will be brief, and there are a few rules I need to go over with you before you meet your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I got Matt into the car then got in myself as Mike took the driver's seat. Once we were underway, I asked, \"What are the rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are just three.\" Serious, Mike said. \"No sudden moves, keep your voice level at all times, and whatever you do,... keep your hands out of your pockets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sort of get the first two rules.\" Wincing, Matt said. \"Why the third?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The distrust between werewolves and vampires is outrageous.\" Serious, Mike said. \"That said, both sides are easily triggered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, we arrived just outside of the midnight forest, where Mike stopped the car and ushered us out. \"This is as far as I am allowed to take you.\" Calmly, he said. \"Aoife will escort you out back to here when the meeting is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out at the forest and found Aoife and her associates waiting. \"Come, colleen.\" Calmly, she said. \"It is time to meet your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, then allowed Matt and me to be escorted to a large cabin near the center of the wilderness, where the entire pack was waiting for us. \"I have brought them.\" Flatly, Aoife said. \"They are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it would seem.\" In the same tone, Susi said. \"We agreed to this meeting with a guarded optimism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sniffed the air and winced... another vampire had arrived. As if on cue, a woman who looked strikingly like Aoife walked into the dim light of the moon. \"As have we, they are here.\" Calmly, she said. She turned to me. \"Good evening, colleen. I am Finola, Aoife's twin sister... the detective works for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a car door open, and got the whiff of another vampire before seeing Janelle appear out of the shadows. Casually,  I stepped behind Susi. \"Nervous, cub?\" Softly, she asked. \"Don't be... you have the power of the pack behind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle and a boy I recognized as Brad from school entered the scene. Seeing them, Aoife frowned. \"I had a feeling you would bring her here, buachaill.\" Flatly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pack was curious to know her, Aoife.\" In the same tone, Brad replied. \"That, and they trust me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... is everything okay?\" Wincing, Janelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just setting up boundaries.\" Calmly, Brad said. \"Both cleaning crews are very wary of vampires and werewolves meeting each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is for the best that both sides avoid each other, and do not trespass upon their occupied territories.\" Calmly, Aoife said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Nodding, Brad said. \"However, Janelle was invited, and you were informed of the meeting.\" He smiled. \"Had you disapproved, Finola would have intercepted us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not disapprove.\" Calmly, Finola said. \"We are, as you said, wary of this meeting... anything can go wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding someone had to break the ice, I timidly called out, \"Janelle... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle turned in my direction as I stepped out behind Susi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasha.\" Nodding, Janelle replied. \"You look well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like death warmed over.\" Wincing, I said. \"Sorry, but you smell worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get used to it.\" Wincing back, Janelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha and I slowly approached each other, then, in a surprise move, we fell into an embrace and cried onto each other's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did this happen to you?\" After we parted, Janelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prom.\" Softly, I explained. \"Wrong place at the wrong time sort of thing. I saw a werewolf eating a woman, and got bit trying to get away from it.\" I blushed. \"Turns out he has a crush on me. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After graduation... I went out to dance the night away and well, stumbled upon an underground rave.\" Softly, Janelle said. \"I got feasted on by four vampires, and left for dead... long story short, I'm one, too, now.\" I shrugged. \"I'm taking an apprenticeship to learn to be a private investigator, likely for the cleaning crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll soon be starting as a waitress, and work my way up to being a chef.\" With a slight smile, I said. I sighed as Colin cleared his throat. \"Janelle, this is the pack... when they learned of the meeting, they wanted to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the members of the pack, adults, teenagers and children walked up to Janelle and sniffed her before walking away into the darkness of the wilderness. The last one to sniff her was Matt. Janelle looked at him surprised. \"Matt, you too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled. \"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my side, cub.\" Bemused, Susi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Matt walked to her as Randall walked up to Janelle and introduced himself. \"As you are a friend to Tasha, we wanted to know your scent, so as not to confuse you for a trespasser or threat, should you decide to visit her.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make certain you announce your visit before coming.\" Serious, Aoife warned. \"Werewolves can be rather impulsive when surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As can vampires.\" Calmly, Randall said. \"So be certain you announce your visits to Janelle in advance as well, Tasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle and I both nodded, and Janelle was escorted back to Brian's car, while Matt and I were escorted back to Mike's car. He did not speak until we were well away from the forest. \"It is rare for a vampire and werewolf to have a relationship.\" Softly, he said. \"Do not be surprised or hurt if it does not last long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Worried, i asked. \"They want us to be diplomats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea.\" Serious, Mike replied. \"Still, expect many werewolves to try to talk you out of ever seeing her again.\" He sighed. \"I have no doubt many vampires will have the same in mind with Miss Lee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... why?\" Curious, Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know there was a cease fire.\" Calmly, Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then knew what Mike was trying to say. \"There is no treaty,... not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded. \"You and Miss Lee have a big job ahead of you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the door were his two friends, Greg and Dusty Rune. The twins were Matt's age and height, with brown hair and brown eyes. Both wore blue jeans, T-shirt and sneakers. \"Here you are, nature boy.\" Teasing, Greg said. \"We thought you had run back to the wild, since we haven't seen hide nor hair of you in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, man?\" More concerned, Dusty asked. \"You usually call us every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we've been through a lot lately.\" Rubbing one arm, Matt said. \"That, and this little girl I met... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and Dusty turned to each other, then laughed, causing Matt to blush. \"You have a crush?!\" Amused, Greg asked. \"Matt, you animal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom could not help but grin. \"It's two girls, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and Dusty laughed even harder, as Matt and I shot her an irritated look. Mom merely shrugged as she grinned. \"They're just crushes, boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they?\" Stepping inside, Dusty demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we know them?\" Anxious, Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know the first girl.\" Calmly, I said. \"She's a wild child, like Matt, and her parents are obsessively protective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They call me cub.\" Blushing, Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusty smiled. \"Sounds like someone we know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Touche.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other is my friend's little sister, Courtney Lee.\" Remaining calm, I said. \"I think it's more of a good friendship than anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful there, Matt.\" Becoming serious, Greg warned. \"Girls can be vicious when they think they have competition, even with crushes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a young man came to the door and knocked. \"I work for Uber.\" Politely, he said. \"I am here to pick up Matt Lyall for a meeting with Luna Woolsey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were not informed of this.\" Stepping up, Dad said. \"Let me see the paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man handed Dad some papers, which Dad looked over, then turned to Matt. \"If anything happens, run to the forest.\" Darkly, he said. He then whispered, \"Only a suicidal fool would follow you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded, then turned to the Uber driver, who seemed slightly startled. \"My family is a bit over-the-top protective.\" Wincing, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky me.\" Sweating, the driver muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Matt was driven away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Albeit against my better judgement, I took Matt along with me. We met at the old church ruins just outside of the city, which werewolves and vampires alike considered neutral ground. Any and all fighting between the two powers was strictly forbidden in such locations. The church ruins were a monument to a citywide fire disaster decades ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon meeting Janelle there, I spotted her little sister, Courtney, nervously standing at her side, just as Matt was beside me. \"I see they made you bring your sibling along too.\" Flatly, I said. \"I guess they are part of the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... \" sighing, Janelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we both said, in unison, \"You won't believe what I learned about my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe paused then gave a nervous giggle. \"You first.\" Nodding, Janelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom and dad are berserkers.\" Softly, I said. \"Descendants of legendary Old Norse warriors, with insane speed, strength, and endurance. They have been offered to join the pack on more than one occasion, but will only do so if they lose control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is deep.\" Surprised, Janelle said. \"Berserkers were considered demons of war, incredibly skilled and dangerous warriors, associated with the god Odin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Which makes me a berserker werewolf. I have to work on controlling my temper more than ever.\" I sighed. \"Your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned that my mother is a psychic vampire, as in she feeds off of life energy of people, rather than blood.\" Quietly, Janelle said. \"She is also the granddaughter of Dracula... <i>The Dracula</i>.\" She gulped. \"I'm almost expecting Courtney and me to be offered to cross the threshold any day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes you his great-granddaughter.\" Gulping, I said. \"That beats me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle shook her head. \"I don't know about that.\" Honestly, Janelle said. \"I'm related to the Alpha vampire, your powers are the work of two gods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both paused and turned to Matt and Courtney, who had been silent all this time, to find them awkwardly smiling at each other, giving an occasional shrug or giggle. \"Do either of you two have anything to add to this?\" Curtly, Janelle demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Courtney jumped slightly, and said in unison, \"We weren't doing anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not what she asked.\" Calmly, I said. \"Do you two have anything to add?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's cute,... for a werewolf.\" Blushing, Courtney said. \"I would not mind having him as a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed. \"She is pretty,... for a vampire.\" Scoffing his feet, countered. \"Only, I already have a werewolf girl who likes me, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney responded with  \"I said friend, not boyfriend.\" She scoffed. \"Typical boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle and I giggled. \"I don't think we have to worry about any love triangles here.\" Bemused, I said. \"Courtney seems to just like my brother as a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Smiling, Janelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to us until later, Mom and Mrs. Lee had followed us.

I was relieved to know that Matt did not have an infatuation with Courtney Lee, but an innocent friendship. I was also pleased to know that vampires, as a whole, wanted better relations just as much as werewolves, as a whole. Only we both agreed to take the process slowly, not to leave a single stone left unturned. Grudges on both sides had to be resolved, mysterious deaths had to be solved, including the death of all but one of the Van Helsing family. As I was walking back to my car, provided by the pack, I met up with Aoife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it the meeting went well.\" Courtly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a step in the right direction.\" Calmly, I replied. \"It is not just the two powers that need to face negotiations, it is their thralls and allies as well.\" I sighed. \"The incident involving my brother and her sister was a clear example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any issues?\" Curious, Aoife asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, shaking my head. \"Matt just sees Courtney as a friend, nothing more.\" Calmly, I replied. I giggled. \"I think he has eyes for a certain female werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoife smiled. \"Does Courtney return Matt's friendship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does.\" Nodding, I replied. \"Though she made it clear there is nothing romantic between the two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"News of this will calm many nerves.\" Serious, Aoife said. \"We do not need a love triangle complicating the peace effort.\" She then frowned. \"You should know that your mother and Miss Lee's mother had followed you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I sighed, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We intervened before you could detect them, and had a word with them.\" Calmly, Aoife said. \"I must ask you to show restraint, and understand that your father and her father alike are obsessively protective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they did not follow us.\" sighing again, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoife grinned. \"I think you both would have smelled their collective testosterone from a mile away, if they had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Anything you want to try, okay through Aoife first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we do regarding talks between the two groups of thralls?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boyfriend, Colin, and Janelle's boyfriend, Brad, will be joining you on these peace talks, and will be masked as dates.\" Serious, Mike replied. \"Your parents will be busy working with me, helping maintain the Masquerade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of my friends?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike frowned. \"Don't let them in too deep,... for their own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting lasted about an hour, with Mike and me setting up boundaries for the peace talks, dates and times for the next meet, and rules regarding the involvement of friends, unless I wanted my own thralls.

Sarah, Elisabeth, and I went, taking Matt along. Mom and Dad had agreed to meet with Janelle's parents, in a diplomatic understanding between the two families. As far as I knew, it was being led by detective Mike Sutherland. We walked among the many vendors selling anything from carnival treats to town history souvenirs. Matt bought a stuffed werewolf with his allowance, and gave it to Luna, who was with her mother, Susi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you,\" Blushing, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna giggled, then gave Matt a kiss on the cheek. \"That's for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all giggled at the sight of the two skipping ahead, holding hands. \"They make such a cute couple.\" Smiling, Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puppy love?\" Grinning, Elisabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like a cub crush.\" Bemused, Susi said.

Matt and Luna especially enjoyed themselves, having a seat all to themselves on the Ferris Wheel, and Luna winning the largest stuffed animal in the dart throwing game. The look on the vendor's face was priceless. \"For you,\" Giggling, Luna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed, accepting the large stuffed bear, and gave Luna a kiss on the cheek. \"That's for you.\" Smiling, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned, hearing a giggle, and saw Janelle approaching with her sister, Courtney, and their friends, Mindy and Zooey. \"Fancy meeting you all here.\" Smiling, Janelle said. \"Are you enjoying the carnival?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, though I could not help but giggle. \"We are, but not as much as Matt and Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle smiled, seeing the two holding hands. She then laughed as Luna threw Courtney a look of warning, pulling Matt closer to her. \"Mine!\" Sharply, she barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney laughed, raising both hands. \"He's all yours, kid.\" Bemused, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard you and Matt are werewolves.\" Quietly, Mindy said. \"Does it hurt when you, well,... change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no.\" Wincing, I replied. \"It hurts, but it's also a rush, like... sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting way to put it.\" Bemused, Susi said. \"It's accurate, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have so many questions.\" Wide eyed, Zooey whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do we.\" wincing, Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You four can meet somewhere privately and discuss it later.\" Serious, Susi said. \"Just do not share what you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been warned.\" Gulping, Mindy said. Zooey, Sarah, and Elisabeth nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi nodded, satisfied. \"For now, this is a time to enjoy ourselves.\" Smiling, she said. \"Allow yourselves to be kids for a while: it is not a role you will have forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all nodded, then turned our attention back onto the carnival, until we all heard a familiar howl from the midnight forest. At first, I was surprised, as the full moon was not due for another night. Then, I saw a large timber wolf at the edge of the forest with its pack behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing to be worried about.\" Calmly, Susi said. \"The wolf pack never leaves the safety of the forest. They howl every night before the full moon, to remind our pack it is nearly time to lock ourselves up for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief.\" Smiling, Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Luna ran up, looking worried and frightened. \"Mommy,... Matt ran off!\" Tearfully, she said. \"He went after the wolves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Stunned, Sarah demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will handle this.\" Firmly, Susi said. \"The rest of you stay here and enjoy the carnival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Matt might be in danger, I...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was crying as I stepped into my cell, and howled in sadness as the transformation took hold. Only, to my surprise and delight, a distant howl responded. I howled again, and again the response came. The other werewolves joined my howls in a chorus to lead my little brother home. Luna was especially howling in her own cell, the rabbits being forgotten for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to all until later, Finola was helping to scour the dark forest for Matt when she heard his howl. Janelle was with her. \"Use extreme caution, colleen.\" Whispering, she warned. \"Werewolves lose nearly all of their cognitive thinking in wolf form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle gulped before nodding, then paused as a wolf standing on its hind legs jumped out from behind some bushes with a bark. Finola pushed Janelle behind her, but paused as a small red ball rolled towards her. She looked at the ball, then turned to Matt to find him on all fours, panting with an air of excitement. He gave another bark, ran in a circle, then barked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's acting just like a wolf cub.\" Smiling slightly, Janelle stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Smiling, Finola said. \"Being raised by wolves, his first transformation made him think much like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bemused smile, she picked up the ball and gave it a light toss. Matt gave a happy bark and chased after the ball before returning it. Upon doing so, Finola handed Matt what looked like a doggy treat, which Matt devoured. Shortly after, he was fast asleep in a little ball at Janelle's feet. \"He's actually kind of cute like this.\" Calmly, Janelle said. \"What do you think happened to him last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We determined that he fell into a ravine and hit his head.\" Calmly, Finola replied. She motioned to the goose egg on Matt's head. \"He wandered around, dazed, then found himself here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle looked, then moaned. \"We should have guessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the cabin where she and I had our first meeting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was also annoyed. \"Why did you run off like that?!\" Scolding, I demanded. \"Don't you know you could have been hurt?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Tasha.\" Firmly, Susi said. \"Matt can't help himself. When the wolves beckon, he goes to them. They are his family, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where was he all this time?\" More softly, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He fell into a shallow ravine and hit his head.\" Calmly, Colin explained. \"Stunned, he wandered through the woods, until he found the cabin where you and Janelle had your first meeting.\" He gave a nervous chuckle. \"None of us thought to look inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, then roughed up Matt's hair. \"At least you are back and safe.\" Bemused, I said. \"Just don't give us another scare like that, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed. \"I'll try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon our return home, Mom and Dad nearly smothered Matt with hugs and kisses, before turning to me. I winced, expecting the riot act, only they hugged me as well. \"Matt has a habit of sneaking out in the middle of the night to the call of the wolves.\" Ruefully, Mom said. \"I sometimes swear there is berserker blood in his veins as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our fault for not warning you of this, honey.\" Calmly, Dad said. \"I'll give you a GPS tracker so you can find him faster next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You chipped me?!\" Startled, Matt demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's harmless, honey.\" Cooing, Mom said. \"That, and it's for your own protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know what you are thinking, and we already got the riot act from Aoife for not telling her of the chip.\" Serious, Dad said. \"It is because of the distrust between the powers they were not informed, until the time came for them to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed before nodding. \"I... understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not use that when I start dating!\" Annoyed, Matt demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help laugh, then a thought came to me and I added, \"Same here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad blushed, telling me that I was chipped as well. <i>That was how mom found out where Janelle and I were meeting.</i> With a chill, I thought.

It was one thing to have us chipped, but not to tell us,... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mom and Dad gave us our space while I spent some time with Colin late in the afternoon. He didn't know Matt and I were chipped, either, and he understood my frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be mad, too, if my parents did that to me.\" Comforting me, he said. \"Still, you have to admit, they were there when you needed the help the most.\" He chuckled. \"We also have a better idea why no one ever physically bullied you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help grin at that, now knowing my parents were berserkers. \"Their parents must have told them the story of the biker gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin nodded. \"Susi told me that story too.\" Softly, he said. \"The pack sees them as one of their own.\" He touched my hand. \"As of last night, they see me the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped, knowing what that meant, and Colin nodded before revealing a heavily bandaged arm. At first, a look of guilt fell upon my face. \"I- I didn't even notice you were injured at first.\" softly, I said. \"I was just so mad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin lifted my chin to look me in the eye. \"I have no doubt that, now that I'm a werewolf, too, they will want to chip me, as well.\" Smiling, he said. \"I'll happily do it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wrapped my arms around Colin and kissed him, before we made out in the back seat of his car, until the sun went down. In the afterglow, I laid on top of Colin, smiling. \"Best talk ever.\" Whispering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin grinned. \"Just wait until our first date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it came time for me to return home. I was feeling a lot better, and ready to talk to my parents again, but, upon reaching my house, I was in for a surprise. Matt was outside, being confronted by two boys from school. They seemed angry at him for some reason. Neither were talking, but Matt was trying to talk them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you two are so pissed, but we can talk this out.\" Backing away, Matt said. \"I don't want to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first boy threw a fist, catching Matt in the jaw, which turned out to be a big mistake. Matt's eyes turned red, and he lunged onto the boy with an angry roar, before literally throwing him over the head of the second boy. He bounced off the grass, and ended up in a heap near a tree. The second boy threw a fist of his own, only Matt caught it, and I could hear the knuckles cracking as he began to squeeze it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, Matt!\" Running up, I yelled. \"You made your point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin pulled the boy away, while I pulled Matt away, screaming and kicking in anger. \"He hit me, sis!\" Screaming, he protested. \"He deserves to be pummeled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These guys were hypnotized.\" Serious, Colin said. \"Look at this one's eyes... glazed over, not even focused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who could have done this?\" Worried, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin sighed. \"My guess,... a vampire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mom and Dad came out, shaking their heads. \"I was afraid of this.\" Softly, dad said. \"This is why we had you two chipped... in case you were attacked, or taken,... or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you two when this was happening?!\" Annoyed, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watching the entire time, honey.\" Firmly, Mom replied. \"Matt is a true born werewolf, two normal boys are no match for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, he wasn't talking to us, so we gave you both your space.\" Serious, Dad added. \"We understand your anger, but you also need to understand our reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vampires have always been... problematic with our bloodline.\" Softly, Mom said. \"It was just in recent years that we had reached a non-interference pact; but, still, trust takes time.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Only she gave a short nod, and I turned back to the boy, just as the third boy grabbed my other arm. \"Don't be shy.\" Grinning, he said. \"We love breaking in the fresh meat around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes narrowed. \"Do you, now?\" Coldly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could stop myself, I grabbed the boy by the collar and literally threw him across the room, out the door. The doorman, as if expecting it, opened the door as the boy flew through. \"Have a good evening, sir.\" Grinning, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then turned my attention to the other boy, who finally took notice of my pin and turned pale himself. He immediately released me. \"I apologize.\" Trembling, he squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your meal as if it were your last.\" Growling, I said. \"I certainly hope you are... generous with your tips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys quickly nodded, and left immediately after finishing their meal, leaving me a five hundred dollar tip. Once they were gone, Susi finally laughed out loud. \"Well played, Miss Lyall!\" Applauding me, she said. \"We have been trying to get those four to behave themselves for weeks now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just ban them from the restaurant?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not turn away any werewolf, despite how despicable they may be.\" Calmly, Susi replied. \"The clean up crew deals with them, should they fall too far out of line, but these four kept themselves just barely out of the danger zone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until I became a waitress.\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi nodded, obviously still amused. \"Do not think poorly of me for doing that to you.\" Smiling, she said. \"Your act tonight has earned you the respect of all of your peers, not to mention their admiration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was incredible!\" running up to me, another waitress said. \"I'm Crystal Canine, those four nearly made me quit on my first day.\" She bowed to me. \"If you need anything, do not hesitate to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"I could use a few more friends.\" Softly, I said. \"Are you up to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal looked up at me in surprise, then smiled and eagerly nodded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have cameras catching every moment that happens here, so everyone knows Jack was not a gentle-wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded to that. \"What of nights of a full moon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gentleman Wolf restaurant is closed during the three day period of the full moons.\" Serious, Crystal replied. \"Only we are expected to be in uniform and ready to work the moment it reopens, for our hungry guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are the waitresses responsible for the rooms?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only during times we are short-staffed.\" Shrugging, Crystal replied. \"Even then, very few werewolves stay during the day, as they have lives of their own outside of the midnight forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I report my tips?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you wish to brag about them.\" Grinning, Crystal said. \"We sometimes have a contest as to whoever can gain the most on busy nights just before and after the the full moon transitions.\" She then pointed to the tables. \"Each waitress needs to be very punctual when clearing the tables they are assigned. If another waitress is ordered to clean the table for you, she gets the tip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced at that. \"Sounds like there is some competition for tips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal sighed. \"Some werewolves tip scraps, while others pay their weight in gold.\" Sadly, she said. \"I sometimes barely scrape by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone I should watch out for?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal discretely pointed to a young woman just entering the dinning hall. \"Her name is Loveta Howl... she's a well known bully to other waitresses.\" Softly, she explained. \"Only with you on the staff, she may tread more carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we are going to find out.\" Whispering, I said. \"She's coming our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing just standing around?!\" Rudely, she barked. \"We still have guests to serve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a lot of nerve to talk.\" Coldly, I snapped back. \"All waitresses are to be here and ready to work precisely on time.\" I then grinned. \"You lost a lot of tips tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you are new here.\" Frowning, Loveta hissed. \"I come when I please, and, if you are smart, you will give me the tips <i>I earned</i> from my tables!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Crystal. \"You told me she was a bully. You didn't tell me she was stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoveta turned red, and was about to grab me by the collar, but stopped cold on seeing my family seal pin. I have to admit, it was satisfying to see the color drain from her face, knowing who and what I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to speak when Susi walked up with a slight grin on her face. \"Ah, Loveta,... I see you have met our newest waitress, Tasha Lyall.\" Calmly, she said. \"She is working her way up to chef status.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charmed.\" Frowning, Loveta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" My eyes narrowing, I replied. \"I do hope you will be more punctual in the future, poor Crystal had to work double duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am aware of this, Tasha, thank you.\" Politely, Susi said. She then turned to Loveta. \"This is the last time I see you coming in late, or taking tips you did not earn. Have I made myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoveta's frown deepened. \"Yes, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi returned Loveta's frown, then walked away. Once she was gone, Loveta turned to Crystal and me. \"You couldn't just leave well enough alone, could you?!\" Angry, she hissed. \"Mark my words, I'll make you both pay for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stormed off before putting on a fake smile for the customers. I knew I had made an enemy, but, from the grateful smiles of the other waitresses, I had a feeling that I was the only one brave enough to stand up to her.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

That turned out to be a mistake, as something snapped... not in me, but in Crystal. Her eyes turned an eerie red color before she gave out a familiar roar.

He turned to Matt. \"Do you want the usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded. \"Yes, please.\" He produced a number of bills, then added, \"One for my sister, too, there's a lot of shenanigans afoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Raising an eyebrow, another cabbie asked. \"May we ask what sort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Her</i> rival and <i>her</i> rival are plotting something.\" Pointing to Janelle and me, Matt said. \"Aoife has already been told, and she's <i>not</i> happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a given that Abby Vamp is just using Loveta.\" Frowning, Janelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Frowning, I replied. \"Only I have a feeling Loveta believes it's the other way around.\" She sighed. \"I wish I knew what they were up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you.\" Irritated, Matt said. \"They want to know why you and Janelle are always hanging around each other and the two cleaning crews.\" He huffed. \"It's like they're jealous or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just may have it there, kid.\" Softly, the barista said. \"The cleaning crew is among the highest ranking officials on either side. They may be thinking Miss Lyall and Janelle are trying to rise quickly in ranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With both hungry for power, they would see it as a threat to their goals.\" Thoughtful, the powerful man said. He turned to Matt. \"Good detective work, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed, then beamed as a steaming cup of what looked like coffee was put in front of him. He sniffed it first, then took a sip before grinning. \"It's good, sis. Try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful man whispered something to Janelle before she turned to me as I took a sip, prepared to spit it right back out. Only, to my surprise, it was blood with a hint of coffee for flavor. What surprised me more was that I actually found it very tasty. As I swallowed it down, I found the texture very smooth. <i>It's... delicious.</i> Wide eyed, I thought. then I said, \"I've never had... blood coffee before... It's got a unique flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" Bemused, the barista asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, I shrugged. \"It's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabbies smiled as one remarked, \"You like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabbies then turned to normal conversations about life in general as cab drivers, careful not to reveal their names just yet. Before long, Matt and I left on good terms. \"They're really a great bunch of guys.\" Assuring me, Matt said. \"They are just slow to to warm up to outsiders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, then thought, <i>There just might be hope for peace yet.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Janelle and I had managed to bring small numbers of thralls on both sides to stop by Nouri's for casual conversations. No secrets were shared, but it was clearly established that both sides had the same fears of rekindling the old war. No one wanted that to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Luna had become quite the pair, running about like two wolves at play whenever they met. Fortunately, neither were ready to take their relationship any further just yet, but they did make a cute couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin and I had been dating while talking to the werewolf thralls, which made intimate moments more difficult, but it also kept Dad at bay, who was more than capable of putting the fear of God into any would-be suitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up from my diary as Susi approached me. \"It is time to ride out the full moon.\" Calmly, she said. \"You should know that Loveta Howl has been on edge all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Meaning she is up to something.\" Frowning, I said. \"I hope she doesn't do anything stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" nodding, Susi replied. \"Loveta is a strong werewolf, but a denier of old world warnings, such as other monsters, monster hunters,... <i>berserkers</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cracked a grin at that. Though I had never seen Mom or Dad in action, I knew Dad could hold his own against a vampire in drunken roughhousing. \"With luck, she won't learn the hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my diary into my backpack, then walked into my cell, with the door being closed and locked behind me. Only, as Susi walked away to lock herself away, I saw the large pile of hay shift, before Loveta emerged from underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane?!\" Angered and concerned, I demanded. \"You know we'll end up fighting when we transform!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm counting on it.\" Scowling, Loveta countered. \"I will show this pack who the true Alpha is, by sending you running with your tail between your legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only shake my head, a sense of sadness coming over me. \"You fool.\" Softly, I said. \"You allowed Abby Vamp to talk you into an act of madness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformations began for both of us shortly after, and we howled in unison before facing each other with just enough rabbits for one to feed upon. Loveta made the first move, swiping at me with her claws. She dug deep into my flesh, causing me to howl in pain before I swiped back in anger. Again and again, we lunged at each other, with Loveta making ground in her offensive. For a moment, as I lay on the floor, I thought she might win, only something snapped within me and I remembered Aoife's warning: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">Now men and women fueled by Gods rose from the ground, screaming like bloodthirsty animals.<br>\r\nThus is the gift of absolute mortal power...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose from the stone floor with a roar of rage that shook the entire cell, to the point of loosening the mortar. Loveta gave a surprised yelp and barely dodged a blow that cracked the heavy stone wall of the cell we were sharing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not notice the shielded window in the door opening, or the panicked voices of the thralls who had heard the sounds of combat. All I remembered was a steel plate falling over the barred window before a pungent gas filled the cell, just as I threw Loveta into the cell door, literally breaking the lock and throwing it off its hinges.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I was lying on a loveseat in the sitting room of Susi's estate. Mom and Dad stood before me, with a mixture of concern and pride on their faces. Matt was in the background with Luna at his side, looking a bit frightened, yet impressed. I also spotted Colin close by, who carried a similar expression. \"You gave us all quite the scare, not to mention one hell of a show last night.\" Lightly scolding, Susi said. \"Loveta Howl will likely never challenge you again, once she recovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will she be okay?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Werewolves have remarkable healing capabilities.\" Calmly, Susi replied. \"Loveta will live, but I suspect she will be limping for quite some time.\" She sighed. \"You literally broke her against the heavy reinforced steel door, throwing it completely out of its frame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl.\" Grinning, Dad said. \"You are now officially a berserker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you experienced last night was the trial of fire.\" More serious, Mom said. \"It is much like a dhampir becoming a full fledged vampire through the burning of the blood.

I stood by the door with both her parents and mine standing behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not to blame.\" softly, I said. \"Abby Vamp has a way of manipulating people.

Within a few generations, there could be an entire pack of berserker werewolves running amok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, though I tried to hide it, as I saw where Mike was going with his questioning.

Although their only common goal at the moment was to be rid of the nosy media, it was definitely a much-needed step in the right direction. As the festival began, there were local bands playing folk music, with performers dancing to it and, of course, food and beverage stands. There were also carnival games and a few rides for the younger crowd. It reminded me much of the Oktoberfests Mom and Dad were so fond of. Matt and Luna were enjoying the snacks from the many vendors while meeting his friends, Greg and Dusty Rune, who were all too happy to meet her. Luna remained polite, playing the shy girl, which warded off most questions for the time being. My friends, Susan and Elisabeth, remained on high alert with Janelle's friends, Mindy and Zooey. Their job was to be on the lookout for signs of Vie Harris, or either Jon or Victor Van Helsing crashing the party. All of them were instructed not to engage either of them if they wished to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are ready, Tasha.\" Serious, Dad said. \"This is your first command of the pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me.\" Softly, I said. \"I need to remain focused, as anything could go wrong at any point of our plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a back up plan in case that happens.\" Softly, Mom said. \"Susi is aware of it and has approved.\" She nodded to Dad, who nodded back. \"We and Janelle's parents will take the immortal down, if necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Taken aback, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a vampire grabs you, unless you are a berserker, you are not breaking that hold until he releases you.\" Darkly, Dad said. \"After that,.... \" He sighed. \"Well, it is for the best that you don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to drag him into the midnight forest, aren't you?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"Don't ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus on your plan.\" Serious, Mom said. \"One way or another, Vie Harris will go down for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they walked off, vanishing into the crowd of festivalgoers. I was about to follow after them, but Mike stepped into my path. \"It is for the best you do not know their plan, Tasha.\" Serious, he said. \"What they have in mind will make them a part of the werewolf pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped hearing that. \"They are going to go full berserk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if your plan fails.\" Calmly, Mike said. \"We have confidence in you and Miss Lee.\" He then gave me a strange smile. \"Either way, it will be a festival to remember.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why this particular town? Well, that is a legend all its own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The local Indian tribes called this place <i>Spirit Lands</i> where all legends emerge.\" Jumping in, Janelle said. \"Ask the locals, they can tell you stories that date back to before this city was first built in the early 1800s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be demonstrations of many of our more popular legends throughout the festival.\" smiling, I said. \"Please enjoy the shows, and don't forget to buy a souvenir or two to take home, from one of our many vendors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting theme for this year's festival.\" Approaching Janell and I, Vie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it.\" Smiling, I said. \"Janelle and I will be giving a demonstration soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooner than you might think.\" Grinning, Janelle added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVie frowned. \"You are the heads of the peace effort.\" Softly, he hissed. \"Here, I thought it was your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He saw our fathers' bonding fight.</i> Surprised, I thought. <i>So trying to bait Janelle and I into a fight had to have been his plan for revenge against both of them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt darkly all made sense, as Vie Harris had crossed paths with my parents, and with Dracula himself, being an immortal. By rekindling the war, he would wreak havoc with my family and Janelle's. Still, I found it rather amusing and began to chuckle.

Llewellyn and Blackwell took hold of Vie Harris from either side. He turned to the two vampires, before throwing me a sneer. \"What do you intend to do, tear me apart?\" Scoffing, he asked. \"I am immortal, I cannot die by any means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had planned something along those lines.\" Coldly, I replied. \"However, as <i>your</i> plan was to take revenge against our parents, through us,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have decided to give you the opportunity to have your revenge, by fighting them on your own.\" Ice in her voice, Janelle added. She turned to Llewellyn and Blackwell. \"Take him to the Midnight Forest. He is not worthy of the name Dracula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor is he worthy of the name Lycaon.\" Firmly, I added. \"I daresay, even the Van Helsings would not want him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLlewellyn and Blackwell nodded and dragged Vie Harris away, with Finola soon following from the crown, with Aoife and her associates, Cain and Slade, right behind. Aoife turned to Janelle and I briefly. \"Come, you will want to witness this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkly curious, Janelle and I followed the sisters away from the festival to the Midnight Forest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the darkness of the Midnight Forest, I looked about, hearing the growls of the timber wolf pack. Then, I saw them running ahead of us, with Matt running with them. Behind us, I saw members of the pack following in strange robes while carrying torches. I looked ahead to see more members of the pack in the same strange robes, also carrying torches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" whispering carefully, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The calling of the moon.\" Darkly, Aoife whispered back. \"An ancient ceremony among werewolves, when they induct new members into their pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, knowing that Mom and Dad were going to be the ones inducted. That only meant one thing: they were going to go full berserk upon the immortal. Only to do that, they would have to first change the host. <i>This is going to be messy.</i> Worried, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reached a clearing where the timber wolf pack had gathered around the edge, growling and snapping, with Matt leading them, as if he were the alpha wolf. Blackwell and Llewellyn half carried, half dragged Vie into the center of the clearing and dropped him before quickly leaving, standing on either side of Finola behind the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a werewolf affair now.\" Calmly, she said to Janelle. \"Whatever happens, stay at my side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remain next to me, colleen.\" Firmly, Aoife said. \"You are about to witness your family's berserker legacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Cain and Slade shadowing me, I watched intently as Susi entered the clearing, confronting the immortal. \"You are naive if you think I am going to let you just bite me, werewolf.\" Snarling, Vie said. \"I have lived for thousands of years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi shook her head. \"I am not the one who will bite you.\" Darkly, she said. \"Only a true descendant of King Lycaon can change an immortal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVie raised a single eyebrow, then howled in agony, as Matt leaped from nowhere and sank his fangs into his shoulder. Vie cursed, stumbling about, trying to throw the wild boy off of him. Eventually, Matt jumped off and ran back to the timber wolf pack, as Mom and Dad stepped out into the clearing. I cringed, seeing that their eyes were glazed over, as if in a trance. The members of the pack began to hum a strange and haunting tune, moving their torches in an almost hypnotic manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyes forward, colleen.\" Strictly, Aoife ordered. \"Unless you wish to be lost in the berserker trance too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to keep my eyes forward, on the action in the clearing, but the humming and movement of the torches was hard to ignore. It seemed to call to something within me, but I managed to keep myself grounded, as Vie began to transform into his wolf state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not lose to a pack of wild dogs!\" Grunting, Vie yelled. \"I will not be changed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pack does not want you.\" Coldly, Susi replied. \"You are nothing but fodder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the humming stopped and the forest fell completely silent. All the color drained from my face as I saw my parents' transformation... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both grew from six foot humans to twelve foot giants with their muscles growing and bulging to Olympian status in a mere moment. They opened their mouths, revealing rows of sharp carnivorous teeth, before they roared. Their combined war cry literally shook the trees before they charged Vie with a speed I was barely able to follow. I wanted to cry out, but Aoife firmly gripped my shoulder in warning, and I remained silent. Within seconds, it was over. Vie Harris was dead, and Mom and Dad were unconscious on the forest floor, their anger fully spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As promised on the first full moon after the birth of Tasha, Henry and Nina Lyall shall join the pack and become the new Alpha couple.\" Solemnly, Susi said. She then motioned Matt and I forward with her finger. \"As their children and members of the pack, you shall induct them, with a simple bite to the arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis came as a shock to both Matt and me. We turned to each other, gulping, then turned to our parents.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I felt myself falling into a trance, and, before I could stop myself, I opened my mouth wide and bit deep into Mom's arm. Her eyes opened wide and she turned to me with a momentary look of fear. Only that fear was fleeting, and it was quickly replaced with a loving smile. \"That's my girl...\" Whispering, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt bit deep into Dad's arm, and his eyes opened, only he did not show fear. He chuckled before roughing up Matt's hair. \"You'll have to bite deeper than that, sport.\" Bemused, he said. \"Don't hold back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt teared up, obviously not wanting to hurt Dad, then bit harder with a whimper, to which Dad pulled him into a warm hug. \"It's alright, son.\" Softly, he said. \"It's all a part of the life of a werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was crying at this point, with Dad comforting him. I was near tears myself, as Mom then hugged me. \"It had to be done, Tasha.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"We are all now one with the pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bow to the new Alpha couple.\" Politely, Susi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not while the peace talks are in progress.\" Politely, Dad countered. \"We will remain neutral, until a treaty is signed.\" He then smiled. \"That, and we need time to adjust to our werewolf status.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very wise decision, Mr. Lyall.\" Calmly, Finola said. \"Also, well said. You will make a fine leader of the pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your compliment is appreciated, Finola.\" Kindly, Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say this calls for a celebration.\" Smiling, Susi said. \"The festival is still going strong, let us all enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers and howls from the pack made the decision unanimous, and, once Mom and Dad were treated for their bite wounds, Matt and I followed them to the festival.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Rabies because of the wild animal bite, you name it, they ran a test for it. Fortunately, everything came back clear. My bite wound was healing nicely, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part of staying there was talking to the authorities, however. At first, it was animal control. Since it was an animal attack, it made sense. I told them what it was. Some kind of huge dog or wolf. Bigger than anything I had ever seen before. It was obvious the animal control guy didn\u2019t believe me. He kept saying animals that big don\u2019t match any canine species on record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I also had to speak to the cops. Because of the other woman who was... well... eaten that night. The hardest thing I had to do was look at a picture of her body and identify if it was her. There was not much left, from the looks of things. The beast had torn her to bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom came and picked me up the next morning to be taken home. I still had to wear my bandage, but, overall, I was fine. Cleared and everything. All I wanted was to fall asleep in my own bed and try to forget this ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you going out alone after dark anymore, okay, sweetie?\" Mom said to me. \"The police and animal control are gonna do more night patrols until whatever did this is caught and killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was only half paying attention, to be honest. My mind just kept drifting off to that... beast... the last thing I really remembered about it was those eyes... the piercing, almost glowing, yellow eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got home some time later, as I locked myself in my room and just wanted to be left alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at myself in the mirror and sighed. I knew I was never much to look at, as prom memories seemed almost worse than almost getting eaten alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was only about 5\u20192, and about 30lbs heavier than I wanted to be. My stomach and thighs shouldered way too much of that burden. The one place I wanted some more fat was boobs. However, Mother Nature had no such plans for me. It seemed I was destined to stay a 32 B cup forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had black hair I kept about shoulder length, but it was a mess. I never put the time I needed into it. What with my greasy skin and large glasses, I kinda figured, what was the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking off my shoes, I felt something kind of off as I lay down on my bed. My socks felt ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling my eyes, I pulled my feet up as I saw my socks weren't just ripped... they were punctured. I pulled off my socks and saw my toenails had actually pierced through them quite easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI normally kept my nails, both finger and toe, cut as short as I could. I had nobody to impress, so easy was best for me, normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as I stared down at my toes, I had to blink and check myself several times. My toenails had all grown longer. Not just longer, but they all had little points on them. Like they grew to sharp edges. They weren\u2019t that long or anything, but they sure felt sharp. I checked and felt them several times to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea what could have caused this, but I was in no hurry to find out or ask questions. I quickly grabbed some nail clippers and chopped those little toe claws back to size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI prayed I had just neglected them way worse than usual, and that I was just exaggerating things. I was still exhausted from everything and decided to take a nap, as I lay down and closed my eyes.</span></div></div>",

The pack is led by an alpha, whose chief assistant is a beta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWerewolves change on three nights per lunar cycle: the night of the full moon, the night before, and the night after.

They age more slowly than ordinary humans, aging one year for every five years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire, silver weapons, and dismemberment are the only ways to kill a werewolf. It takes a pretty big fire to kill a werewolf, but burns take longer to heal than other injuries. A silver weapon can kill a werewolf, but, if it is not placed to kill instantly, the weapon must be left in the werewolf's body until death. Removing the weapon early will allow the werewolf to heal, and you will now be faced with an angry werewolf. Dismemberment is best left to other werewolves and vampires.</span></div></div>",
