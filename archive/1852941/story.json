I\u2019ll expect your uniform by the end of the day.  Don\u2019t bother coming back tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natalie finished taking one last bite of her cinnamon bun, she felt the blush fill up her scarlet, round cheeks.  She really had blown it again.  It wasn\u2019t like she had anyone to blame other than herself--her and her stupid belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, could anyone really blame her for taking a couple of the sweets off the display counter?  She was working at a freaking pastery shop!  The store was practically shoving free food in her face.  Yes, she may have taken a little bit more than necessary, but, really, at the end of the day could anyone blame her for snagging a few donuts at the end of the day for herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she lasted the month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a little humiliated more than anything--no, more than a little humiliated.  She had been reprimanded in front of the entire store at the busiest hour of the day, and--even worse--she would\u2019ve gotten away with sneaking had her uniform\u2019s button not sprung off.  This would\u2019ve just been embarrassing, had said button not rocketed across the room, homing into the back of her boss\u2019s head, whacking him upside his bald head. No, that statement wasn\u2019t accurate enough.  It had actually hit the brim of his fedora, knocking the hat off of his bald head, before the button bounced into the air, spinning like a flipped quarter, before landing heads right on the crown of the guy\u2019s skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie had wanted to just crawl into a ball under the desk at then, but the first stupid customer to come to her kept calling for her, attracting the boss to her plight.  And then--well, the rest was history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie waited through the rest of her shift, well aware that, even now, she was leaving the only job that would hire her.  She went to the locker room in the back, withdrawing her stuff, as she hastily tore off her uniform.  She struggled a little bit as she pulled it off over her breasts, which caught hold of the elastic bands.  Why would an elastic uniform need buttons anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught a glimpse of her naked body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like she had accumulated a little fringe benefit from the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted once more as she ran a hand over her slightly pudgy belly--no, it was a little more than that now--as she pulled her jeans over her thighs, which had grown a little more bountiful with every truffle and little pastery consumed.  As she hopped up and down, struggling to fit into her size eights, she compared herself to an ice cream cone overflowing with vanilla ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, more like strawberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly hung slightly over the lips of her pants, a sensation she was unfamiliar with.  The pinching and uncomfortable awkwardness was uncanny, abnormal.  In high school, she had long, sleek legs, the type you\u2019d associate with a dancer or something.  In actuality, she had done soccer with some running on the side, but the technicalities weren\u2019t important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint is, when she pressed a finger to the flesh, she felt her muscle buried beneath her meat.  Maybe if she had some sort of excavation to the center of Natalie, she\u2019d find some muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil then\u2026</span></div></div>",

Even her cardigan was tight on her soft shoulders.  As she tried readjusting herself, she began to appreciate her position right now.  She was stuck in the worst of situations, since she was stuck without a job with college bills to pay, now officially boyfriend-less, and, on top of all else, she had been paid in pounds rather than dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least the chub lent itself well to interesting puns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she had to work out!  She had to find some other job to take.  Laying a finger aside her chin, she went down the list of possible professions open to her.  Cashier at a store?  No, those customers were complete jack-asses.  It was always easier to feed someone at a bakery.  They always were in high spirits there, always willing to smile and thank a customer.  Not at those stores where people had a bug up their butt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about as a bank teller?  Yeah, just the right job for her.  Less contact with people, unless said people were armed robbers, holding her at gun point.  She imagined herself curled up into a ball under the desk--no, it was even worse now, since with her extra pounds she was just a juicier target!  She couldn\u2019t fight back, since even walking down this one block was enough to put her out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sign caught her eye almost instantly.  She turned around, heart racing, as she stared at the sign.  She was staring at another bakery, this one a cute one that had been designed intentionally to resemble a gingerbread house, like in that old fairy  tale.  Natalie wondered if it was such a wise idea to design a bakery after a cannibal witch\u2019s house, but she didn\u2019t make the damn place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, maybe she could work there.</span></div></div>",

At the front desk was a woman slightly older than her--this was an assumption, as the woman couldn\u2019t have been older than thirty.  She was, however, a little pudgier than her.  No, a lot.  She held a gingerbread cookie in her pudgy fingers, biting into it, her round face almost glowing in revelry, her eyes alight with joy.  Her ginger, wavy locks stuck out in all directions as she swallowed, her bountiful breasts bouncing as she leaned forward, pushing herself up slightly against the counter.  With a wide smile, chicks dimpling, she asked, \u201cHi!  Can I get you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe a job application?\u201d Natalie asked, noticing how the name tag clipped on her bust was labeled \u201cJessica.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica\u2019s eyes lit up.  She hastily drew backward, accidentally clanging her head against a dangling display, before withdrawing a paper underneath the desk.  As she rubbed her cranium, tears in her eyes, she said, in a strained voice, \u201cHere ya go.  Sorry, just--yeah, clumsy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Natalie asked, glancing at the form.  She quickly looked it over.  However, before she finished it, Jessica took the form away, glancing at her with a look of confusion.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, do you want the job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, kinda.  I just got fired from my last job, and--\u201d  Wait, she shouldn\u2019t have said that.Blush filling up her round face, Natalie stammered back, \u201cLook, it wasn\u2019t a big deal why I was fired.  I just--it was a total accident, understand? Unintentional!  I didn\u2019t mean to--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you steal money?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill a bookie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, as opposed to kill someone else--?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr was it just a clothing malfunction?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie sighed.  \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a big deal then.  I mean, so long as it wasn\u2019t illegal--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I kinda took free food,\u201d Natalie confessed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The food thing?  They fired you over that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, surprisingly, I was eating into the profits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s inexcusable of them.  I mean, criminal even!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to get passionate about it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica took Natalie by the hand. For whatever reason, her belly fluttered, her skin tingling on her skin as Jessica pulled her close, close enough to kiss her.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry.  You\u2019re in safe hands.\u201d Those lips were pretty soft, pursed ever so slightly. She had to restrain herself though.  Had to hold herself back.  Sure, this girl was a total cutie, but--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yeah, Natalie was bi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been awkward in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica took Natalie behind the counter, surprisingly strong for a woman of her size.  Her belly had been hidden by the counter before, but, now that she saw it, she was surprised by how bouncy it was.  It was like a soft ball, or perhaps some teddy bear she wanted to cuddle with desperately. She longed to touch it, which--was odd. She tended to prefer thinner girls, but not this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad getting a little pudgy affected how she saw other people?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He seemed rather disinterested in everything, safe for the steaming tray of muffins he held out in front of him, steam rising up from the rounded, fluffy surfaces those muffin tops.  Of course, George had a little muffin top of his own there, nothing huge, but just a little--fluffier.  Natalie kinda wanted to rest her hands on it, to give it a good ol\u2019 squeeze and cuddle up next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with your face?\u201d George asked, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?  My face?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s all red. It\u2019s really weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I--uh--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d George mumbled, extending the tray to the other two, \u201cMuffin?  I guess you\u2019re working here, so you better take a taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re offering me free food?\u201d Natalie accepted the sweet, only to fumble it in her fingers.  Too hot.  It stunned her.  The poor desert landed face-down on the floor, crumbling apart upon impact.  George stared at it in disbelief, and, after sighing, offered a replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Natalie tasted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nearly squealed in delight as the sweet flavor filled her throat.  Her body was in knots as she bounced up and down on her toes, eager for a second bite--third--tenth--until it was all gone.  When it was, she reached for another, only for George to draw the tray away.  It was probably too much to ask for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you think?  Too sugary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it was so sweet and delicious!  It\u2019s perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge\u2019s eyebrows lowered in skepticism.  \u201cDon\u2019t bullshit me. It was a bad batch, I know.  You don\u2019t need to tease me about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it honestly was amazing,\u201d Natalie mumbled, slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge offered a different muffin.  \u201cThis one is much better. I guarantee it.  Maybe you\u2019ll give me better criticism after tasting it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even sweeter than the last one. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We don\u2019t have all--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not.  I kinda packed on a few pounds lately, and--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled as she rested her hands on Natalie\u2019s shoulders, making her feel warm once more.  She was close to her breasts--no, their breasts were touching--as Jessia said, smiling, \u201cI know how that feels.  I used to be a skinny girl until I met George.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gestured over to her cell phone, where she showed Natalie a picture of her and George, only George didn\u2019t have a belly, and Jessica--she was absolutely a stick. Natalie had really cute muscular legs when she was in high school, but Jessica had been really thin, the type of girl who could afford to eat a sandwich or seventeen and not worry about her weight. How did that babe turn into this chubby girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, George made me open up this store, since he really wanted everyone to feel happy while eating. And, well, he did. He always had me test everything he made. It always made him feel special--loved, even. So I ate everything he offered.  When I got a little--well, isn\u2019t it obvious?--he didn\u2019t even mind. He felt it was a tribute to our love.  Still, I didn\u2019t really forgive him for fattening me up, so I gave him a piece of his own medicine. I gotta say, I like him more that those hard abs aren\u2019t in the way. More to cuddle with, I think. Fat guys are more snuggly, am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose--but don\u2019t you miss being skinny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, being in shape, or--?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are in a shape, just a different one,\u201d Jessica said, caressing her own hip before cupping her breasts in each hand, \u201cI mean, I have huge boobs!  Look at these!  These things are massive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so--\u201d  Natalie glanced at her own thighs. Sure, they were thicker than when she had been an athlete, but they still retained a shape. It wasn\u2019t blubbery or messy, and it did vaguely resemble her soccer legs. They were smooth, yet still powerful looking. Her belly she had mixed feelings about, but Jessica\u2019s was so cuddly. Maybe she looked kinda cuddly too, like a panda bear or something.  As for her boobs--yeah, they were humungous.  Even her chubby cheeks looked cute. After all, chubby kids were adorable, so what was so different about chubby adults?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica unwound the tape again.  \u201cSo don\u2019t feel awkward, okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie didn\u2019t.</span></div></div>",

She figured she'd have to stop by the mall on her way home to pick up some new clothes. She walked back into the store's main area and saw Jessica standing there, waiting with her new uniform. \"That was fast!\" Natalie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turns out we had your size right here in the shop.\" Jessica said excitedly, \"You can start tomorrow if you'd like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to get some form of employment, Natalie said, \"I'll be here first thing tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Jessica said, \"Now I have to show you how to do your job. It's pretty simple, just get customers what they ask for, give it to them, take their money, and put in the register! And of course, take something for yourself every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I thought it'd be harder.\" Natalie said, \"When should I come in the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 6:00,\" Jessica said, \"See you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" Natalie said as she walked out the door with a doughnut in her hand that she had purchased with her employee discount, as food was only free when she was working. It was the best tasting doughnut she had ever had, glazed to perfection. She went to the mall and to her surprise, nothing at the Pink store fit her. She had been shopping there for years and suddenly she's too big for it! On her way out of the store, she did see some sweatpants that fitted her, she bought two of those. She went to a normal department store and bought some size 16 1/2 skinny jeans that hugged her legs perfectly. She took the bus back to her building and fell asleep without eating dinner, well except for that pizza she had at the food court, and the large chicken fried rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Natalie...    </span></div></div>",

While sitting on the bus, she noticed that the clothes she had bought the previous day were already somewhat small on her. Her breasts that in no way compared to those of Jessica were making her shirt and her hoodie feel tight. Her stop came and she quickly exited the bus and excitedly walked into her new place of employment and, unbeknownst to Natalie, her fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Natalie!\"  Jessica said, \"Go on in back and get dressed in your brand-new uniform and I'll set you up for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her locker, Natalie found her uniform that was composed of pink leggings, a black t-shirt that had the company name on the back, and a pink apron. All of these items were stretchy, allowing for expansion without having to buy a new uniform. She put it on and it fit her perfectly, partially in thanks to its stretchy properties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it'd fit you perfectly!\" Jessica exclaimed, \"Now come over here with me.\" She led Natalie behind the counter and said, \"Here's the key to the cases and feel free to take anything whenever you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you won't fire me for taking too much?\" Natalie asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, silly,\" Jessica said playfully, \"Just holler if you need anything, I need to help George cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica left, Natalie immediately reached into the case and took out a chocolate cupcake with pink frosting and wolfed it down in seconds. Not 5 minutes went by in the shop when Natalie wasn't enjoying a sugary treat. The only challenge she had was when a man came in looking to order his wedding cake and she didn't know how to take it, so she had to get Jessica's help with that. Jessica offered her a lunch break, but she declined saying that she was full, which she was, for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 4:00, Jessica came in and said, \"Alright, your shift's over, you can head home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already?\" Natalie said disappointedly, \"I was just getting started.\" She was eating a small piece of cheesecake at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, this is all we can afford to pay you for,\" Jessica said regretfully, \"If we kept you any longer it'd be slave labor in the eyes of the government.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll go and get dressed.\" Natalie moaned. She was upset because she didn't get to have anymore free food until the next day and would have to pay for more until then. She was somewhat bloated from that day's snacking and had trouble fitting into her \"skinny\" jeans, but she eventually got them on. Her shirt and sweatshirt had no trouble fitting. She purchased a doughnut on the way out and walked home, as she hadn't anticipated getting off this early and the bus didn't come for another hour. She finished her doughnut and stopped at a diner for dinner. She had a large bacon cheeseburger with fries and a water, you know to... cut back, a little. She got home at 4:45 and called her best friend from school and told her about her new job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a sweet gig!\" Her friend said, \"Pun intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crack me up, Ashley.\" Natalie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm very punny!\" Ashley said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you are,\" Natalie said, \"You need to go to the pun-itentiary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah!\" Ashley said, \"You know, we haven't seen each other in a while, maybe you could come over for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie had already ate, but food was now a passion to her. \"Sounds great! What time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be here at about 5:30, and don't be late.\" Ashley said before hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie sat and watched TV for a while before she had to catch the bus to Ashley's apartment building. When she arrived, she took the elevator up to her apartment and rang the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" Ashley said cheerfully. Natalie had not seen her in person a year in a half, she was always a little bit chubby, but now she was<b> fat <br>\r\n</b>, as fat as Natalie, maybe a bit bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash!\" Natalie exclaimed, \"You're... big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley replied...</span></div></div>",

Additionally, her hips were wider than the inter-state highway and they supported her jiggly, round belly. \"When I went away to college, I put on some weight and never got the time to work out,\" Ashley explained, \"And eventually, I grew to like it, now come on, the pizza's getting cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was still in shock about what her friend had become and surprised that she hadn't commented on her own gain. She followed Ashley into her kitchen and saw three large pepperoni pizzas sitting on the counter. \"That's a lot of food you've got there.\" Natalie said hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're growing women!\" Ashley said. She already knew that Natalie had gained when they talked on the phone earlier, hence the pizzas. \"We each get one and a half, no more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie, in her current mindset, was not one to turn down free food. \"Sound's good to me!\" She said and went to grab her pizza, then sat down at the table, and she dug in. Both Ashley and Natalie were completely focused on their food and didn't say a word to each other for the duration of the meal, nor did they care about how much grease they got on their clothes, which could be seen by the time they had finished eating. When they were both done, Natalie asked Ashley a question, \"Let me ask you something, where do you get your clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's clothes looked like something a skinny girl would wear, just bigger. \"Let's go to the mall, I'll show you.\" They got up, got in Ashley's car, and drove over to the mall. She led Natalie to a store in the mall's southwest wing called <i>Big and Stylish</i>. The store's customers were all women Natalie's size, examining the racks of clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley led Natalie to the jeans department, where she showed her skinny jeans with elastic waistbands and even stretchy denim. \"These'll last you about 24 pounds give or take.\" She said, \"They have everything here, underwear, shirts, pants, hoodies, you name it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go shop for a bit.\" Natalie said, then went to explore the vast collection of clothing contained in the store. She saw that there was a buy one get one free sale on all tops and she took advantage of it, picking up everything she needed that was in her weight range. Additionally, leggings were 25% off for holders of the store's rewards card, so she signed up for one, and bought 4 pairs of leggings. When she went up to pay, she had bought 5 shirts, 5 tank tops, 2 sweatshirts, 4 bras, 4 panties, 4 pairs of leggings, and 5 pairs of \"skinny\" jeans for only $123.17. When they were both done, they went to the food court for a soda and got back in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll take me home, right?\" Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, intersection of Main and 3rd?\" Ashly asked for confirmation of her friend's address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as always.\" Natalie confirmed. They drove off and in 20 minutes, they made it to her building. They both got out and Natalie said, \"Thanks for dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Ashley said cheerfully, \"We should get together again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Natalie said earnestly, \"I'll host next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm counting on it,\" She got back in her car and said, \"See you later!\" and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie picked up her bags and hauled them and her stuffed belly into her apartment, undressed, and laid down for the night. She had a dream of herself and Ashley endlessly stuffing themselves and joking about how fat they were. She woke up sweating at 4:47, unable to fall back asleep. She grabbed herself a bag of mini chocolate bars and watched Adult Swim until it was time to go to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, Jessica and George were waiting with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She entered the bakery, she heard noise coming from the kitchen, confirming that the others were there. She went in back and got dressed, her uniform stretching the tiniest bit more. She clipped her nametag atop her breast and went out to begin her shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!!!\" Jessica and George shouted out when Natalie came back into the storefront area. They had a full-sized cake that said in frosting, <i>Thanks Natalie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only been working here for a day!\" Natalie exclaimed, \"How am I already getting a surprise cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you handled the storefront yesterday,\" Jessica began, \"George and I spent the whole day together cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've always been too busy with our separate jobs in the bakery to worry about our relationship.\" George said, \"It feels like we're in love for the first time in years!\" He gave Jessica a kiss on the cheek, who immediately returned the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came in early to bake this for you,\" Jessica said, \"I hope you like chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my favorite!\" Jessica said, more excited about the cake than her employer's reinvigorated love life. \"Let's dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the store didn't open for an hour or so, they all sat down in the kitchen and had a cake breakfast. Natalie ate about 70% of the cake, only allowing Jessica and George a slice each, but because of the occasion, they didn't mind. After they were done, they cleaned up, stocked the cases full of fresh treats, and went to do their separate jobs, Jessica and George in the back, Natalie in the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours into her shift, Natalie noticed a familiar person walking into the bakery. \"Ashley!\" She said, \"How'd you know that I work here? I just said, a bakery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know,\" Ashley explained, \"I come here all the time!\" She paused for a moment and examined her friend in the store's uniform. \"I guess I can eat cake and support my best friend at the same time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me,\" Natalie said, \"Now what can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take 4 whipped frosting cupcakes and 2 double-glazed doughnuts.\" Ashley ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie retrieved the items out of the case, boxed them, then bagged them. \"That'll be $15.37.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley handed her a twenty. \"Keep the change.\" She told her friend. She picked up her bag, then said, \"I'll be around.\" and walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's job went on like this for a month or so. 26 days to be exact. In that time, she gained 16 pounds, stretching her clothes and making a few more trips to her new favorite store, <i>Big and Stylish</i>. After work on the twenty-seventh day, she received a phone call from Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie, I gotta tell you something!\" She said desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Natalie said with a worried tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley answered... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Fired!?\" Natalie said, shocked by her friend's statement, \"I'll be right over.\" She quickly got dressed and did something she thought she would never do again, ride her bike. Her lack of physical activity and increased body mass made said bike ride was one of the most challenging experiences of her life, making her pedal for 1.2 miles on the flat city side-walk. By the time she made it to Ashley's building, she felt like she had just finished running a marathon. Her round face, adorned with a perfect double chin, was bright red and could easily have been confused with a ripe tomato. She stopped in the restaurant next door for five minutes to catch her breath and enjoyed a large soda. She finally got into the building, only to see that the elevator was broken. \"Christ!\" She yelled as she began to climb the stairs up to her friend in need. She had to stop three times to catch her breath and eat one of the brownies she had in her purse. After climbing 13 flights of stairs, she finally reached apt. 45, where Ashley lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie!\" Ashley cried, then embraced Natalie and squeezed her hard. \"Boss... says I'm... I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're what?\" Natalie asked compassionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too fat!!!\" Ashley cried out, \"Too fat, too fat, too fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Natalie thought of a way that she could help Ashley. At the bakery, they had recently remodeled the storefront to allow for more display space and another point-of-sale system to counter their increase in customers. Jessica had asked Natalie to find someone to fill the new position and she now realized that Ashley was the perfect fit. \"We have an opening at the bakery,\" Natalie said, \"You definitely meet the requirements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" Natalie confirmed, \"All you have to do is give people the food they ask for and take their money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just like my old job,\" Ashley said, \"But I doubt I'll make as much as I did at Hooters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's eight dollars an hour,\" Natalie began, \"Plus free food whenever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free food!?\" Ashley said surprised, \"I'll take it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley pulls up to the bakery that she once new as her one stop shop for all things tasty, but at that moment, her new place of employment. The previous day, Natalie and her went to the bakery and had her fill out the application. She was accepted, received a uniform identical to Natalie's, except for the small change that was made in which instead of the company name and logo on the back, there was the employee's first name. The staff welcomed her and set her up to work alongside Natalie. Throughout the whole day, Ashley ate many, many delicious treats, making it so they constantly had to be restocked, no bother to Jessica and George. Over the next few days, customers saw that every person who worked in the bakery was fat, which scared off many of their slim regulars. The bakery's customers soon became exclusively fat people, save for the odd cake orders and those who wished to become fat. One of their regulars, who came twice a day in fact, Nicole, was a twenty-something woman that was probably 370 pounds. She lived in the apartment building next to the bakery and only ate McDonald's and food from the bakery. She only left her ground-floor apartment to get her food and usually ate in the restaurants. Jessica and George actually had to install double-doors so that she could continue to get in the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie had begun to notice that she was seeing Nicole everywhere: work, the mall, restaurants, even the internet, where she followed her on every social media platform. One day after work, Natalie decided that she'd go to McDonald's and confront Nicole to see if she gets an answer as to the motivations of her possible stalker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waked up to her table near the fast food joint's bathroom and said, \"Nicole, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Nicole asked through half a quarter pounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have you been stalking me?\" Natalie blurted out, somewhat disgusted by Nicole's manners, but knowing that she had done the same herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Nicole paused. \"You mean you really don't remember me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say that I do.\" Natalie said coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took off a brunette wig, revealing a blonde bob haircut. \"My name's not Nicole, it's Janelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie knew Janelle, but hadn't seen her in years. Janelle was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did remember the bullying that she took part in, having made fun of the nerds, the emos, the geeks, and of course, the fatties. It was them that the athletic types attacked the most, booth verbally and emotionally. She specifically remembered one prank in which one of her teammates donned a fat suit and befriended a fatty, only to humiliate her in front of the whole school. Natalie regretted everything she did, especially what she did to Janelle. One day at lunch, they paid a football player to flirt with her and eventually kiss her. The act went on for about a month, then the next phase of the plan was put into action. He started \"cheating\" on her with a slim soccer player. The soccer player and him kissed right in front of Janelle and the volleyball team was there laughing and cheering on their hired defensive lineman. She was left to cry there in the middle of the hallway with the whole school laughing their asses off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janelle I...\" Natalie began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what!?\" Janelle said, wolfing down a handful of fries. \"You're sorry?

Once there, she tried on the bra and shorts, the bra with <b>FAT</b> written across the front in bold font. The same was on the short's butt. Definitely the most humiliating outfit she'd ever wear.

One thing that was different was that the player numbers were on the backs of the bras, Natalie just thought it was a coincidence that hers had 15 on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been plotting this for years.\" Janelle sneered, \"Now everything falls into place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Natalie asked, intrigued by her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was the one who got you hired and fired at the first bakery!\" Janelle said with a smirk, \"And who made sure that you saw the help wanted sign in the window.\" She got off of the bench she was sitting on and waddled up to Natalie, getting right in her face. \"I made sure that your girlfriend dumped you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Natalie was working at the first bakery, she had a girlfriend named Lauren. They were perfect for one another, until one day, she was told that Natalie was cheating on her with a boy, not true of course, but all part of Janelle's plan. After that, Natalie began nicking bits of food at the bakery as comfort eating and the rest was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of these girls,\" Janelle motioned back to her old team, \"I did that to most of them, some were fat when I found them, isn't that right, Hannah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not proud of this,\" Said Hannah, \"but if this makes you happy, I'll do it all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the ice cream's melting!\" Janelle yelled, \"Everyone on the floor, I'll pass out the tubs.\" Janelle handed each girl a tub of ice cream and one inquired as to why there were no spoons and Janelle responded with, \"No Michelle, you're all going to eat with your hands!\" She took a seat on one of the bench presses and yelled \"BEGIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls began to scoop the ice cream into their mouths, some pouting, some smiling, some crying. Natalie didn't say a word or make any expressions, she just did what she had to do to make things right. Every time a girl finished a tub and thought that she was done, Janelle motioned for her assistant to bring them another one. Whenever someone stopped to catch their breath or recover from brain freeze, she scolded them, adding another tub to their sentence. Eventually, she allowed all of the girls to stop, each laying down and rubbing their stuffed, sore belly. All except Natalie, who had to go on for hours before she was allowed to stop. By the time it was over for her, she looked like a pig, ice cream all over her hands and face. There was even some that fell into her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home!\" Janelle ordered. \"You will never see me again.\" That much is true, Janelle was never seen again by another living soul. Some believe that she had a heart attack and died a few days later. Others think that she found a feeder and never left her apartment again. Both were equally plausible, but neither was true. What happened to Janelle would remain a secret forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie got some phone numbers from her former teammates, hoping to rekindle some friendships, and went home to clean herself up. She didn't sleep that night, nor did any of her teammates. They were all horrified with what they had done. Natalie came into work the next morning, happy to be around those that cared about her. She told her co-workers about what happened and they helped her take her mind off of it with some delicious baked snacks. After work, Ashley took her to <i>Big and Stylish</i> to replace the clothes that she had grown out of. Then they went to see a movie together and afterwards, Ashley drove Natalie home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie?\" Ashley asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Ashley?\" Natalie asked in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

But today she was actually excited to get off from work. Not only had she made plans with her plumping companion, she told Jessica the whole story and she was nothing but sympathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a jerk.\u201d Jessica fumed. Jessica had a soft spot when it came to girls who didn\u2019t conform to the small waists club, and from that Natalie was telling her, Ashley seemed like just the kinda person Jessica would get along with. \u201cYou are a good friend Natalie. Tell you what, I\u2019m going to sponsor your little get together tonight, take as much leftovers from the bakery tonight as you want on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Natalie was filled with glee, at first by the generous offer, but then also by the thought of being able to eat all sorts of sugary treats after hours in the comfort of her own home. \u201cJessica, you are like the best boss in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell us plump bitches need to stick together. Plus it's part of our company motto \u201cMaking people happy\u201d, and it sounds like your friend Ashley needs a little happiness tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now that it was the end of her shift, Natalie was was gathering up some goodies to take home. A dozen donuts, a cheesecake, a batch of muffins, choco chunk cookies, and a sheet cake seemed like enough for one evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo, picking out some goodies I see.\u201d Jessica said as she came slinking out from the back, letting the bakery doors slap behind her, narrowly missing her wide plush hips. Jessica made her way up to the counter to see what Natalie had put aside already, spying inside each bag. \u201cIs that it?\u201d Jessica gawked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah. I thought I grabbed as much as we could handle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, this just won\u2019t due. What if Ashley isn\u2019t in the mood for strawberry cheesecake? Maybe she wants raspberry, or maybe chocolate peanut butter. You better take one of each just in case. And how can you deny her the delight of our cupcakes? You need at least two dozen for any proper evening. George just got finished with a fresh batch of donuts, you guys are going to melt when you have some, you can\u2019t beat fresh. Here, have another dozen of those. Now let\u2019s see, what else are we missing? Ah, brownies obviously. OMG these are so thick and chewy, make sure you have some milk around to wash it all down. There now it looks like you are all set.\u201d Jess looked over at Natalie, who\u2019s arms looked comically full. Natalie wore a look of astonishment on her face, but she didn\u2019t have the willpower to turn down any of her bosses generosity. She just accepted the gifts, and started to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again Jessica, you are really going to brighten up Ashley\u2019s day.\u201d Natalie said as she pushed her way out of the bakery\u2019s entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time.\u201d Jessica wore a smile that reached from ear to ear, and she waved her flabby arm as her plump employee disappeared into the city street.</span></div></div>",

Breathing a sigh of relief having all that weight off her shoulders. As she took a sizable breath, her chest lifting up closer and closer to her face, her phone started to buzz in her pocket. Breathing out quickly her boobs slapped back into place, and Natalie furiously tried to free her phone from her tight pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Natalie said tepidly into the phone, not having a chance to see who it was from before she picked up, for fear that she spent too much time squeezing the device from her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Nat, it\u2019s Ash!\u201d The cheerful voice of her reacquainted friend rang out. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to your place. Not sure if you thought about dinner yet. I know I bought last time, but I know you just started your new job, so I wanted to treat you again. Also I\u2019m like famished. After everything with Trent I\u2019m ready to have like a sizable dinner. So I picked up some Chinese... like a lot of Chinese.\u201d Ashley giggled. \u201cIf Trent thinks I\u2019m fat, he will just have to wait and see.\u201d Ashley said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I didn\u2019t even think about dinner.\u201d Natalie said dumbly. \u201cBut that sounds great. And I grabbed some stuff from the bakery for us. My new boss let me take a bunch of stuff for girls night, totally free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s great. OK I\u2019ll see you soon!\u201d With that the girls hung up and Natalie finished out the rest of her bus ride staring at her phone, looking at social networks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home she barreled into her apartment with all the bakery goods, placing everything on the counter. She couldn\u2019t even get her coat off before there was a knock at the door. \u201cI know who that is!\u201d Natalie cooed, as she waddled back over to the door. If it wasn\u2019t for the sweet smell of baked goods, Natalie would have been easily able to smell the Chinese food that await on the other side of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door revealed her bestie Ashley, looking ever so plumper then she did just 26 days ago. Ashley was holding two big bags of steamy Chinese food. \u201cWow, you were not kidding when you said a lot.\u201d Natalie remarked, knowing just how many bakery goodies they had to eat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot? This is just what I could carry, there are four more bags in the car. Come on, give me a hand.\u201d Ashley handed the bags to Natalie so she could store them in the apartment while they went back for more. Natalie took a moment to pause. \u2018There is even more in the car?\u2019 She thought to herself. \u2018God I hope my stomach is ready for this.\u2019 Natalie followed Ashley out to her car, not giving one thought about how all this food was only going to make her even rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Natalie cared about tonight was her best friends happiness, but also in the back of her head she was thinking about their conversation earlier. \u2018If he thinks I'm fat now, just wait!\u2019 Ashley\u2019s words echoed in her head. \u2018I need to be a supportive best friend. I should help Ashley see that she is beautiful because of her curves.\u2019 These thoughts trickled back and forth in Natalia\u2019s head, thoughts about how if they ate together more often she could make sure Ashley was eating well, and how she could make sure her friend was getting the best food around. Natalie was snapped back to reality when Ashley tossed two bags, equal in size to the two previous ones, into Natalie\u2019s arms. The chubby girls brought the bags back inside to begin their girls night.</span></div></div>",

Ashley continued to dig through the bags of treats. \u201cYeah those donuts were fresh right when I left.\u201d Natalie explained as her friend explored the selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFresh? They can\u2019t get better than that. We should try them before we have dinner. We wouldn\u2019t want them to go too long without being eaten.\u201d Natalie shrugged at Ashley\u2019s suggestion and took two of the donuts for herself, the first one going down in only two bites. Jessica and Ashley were right, fresh was the way to go. The donut tasted heavenly, and it wasn\u2019t long before the tubby girl was biting into the next one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was having the same euphoric experience next to her, her belly jiggling as she quived in pleasure. Natalie licked her fingers and instinctively reached for two more, she didn\u2019t want this enjoyable feeling to recede even for a second. Two more went down the hatch and before long she was working on five and six. Their double thick glazing was starting to coat her fingertips, as they were still a little warm from the bakery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls moaning in agreement at the good decision they had made. When they each reached for another, they realized there were none left. The girls simultaneously pouted, but their sour faces would not last long, there was plenty of food for them to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point they opened the first bag of warm Chinese food and dug right in. The hungry girls ate without restraint, letting themselves totally go. Ashley has just been dumped and was willing to eat any pain away. Natalie was still reeling a bit from getting fired less than a month ago. Also both girls were able to let their guard down knowing they had each put on a few pounds recently. This culminated in a perfect storm of appetite fueled by the obscene amount of food each one had brought to the table.</span></div></div>",

This allowed them the opportunity to talk a bit and get emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrent is such a dick.\u201d Natalie said bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s been like a year since we\u2019ve done anything like this. He was always such a prick when ever you wanted to have fun like this. Because of him our friendship became more distant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad we are back.\u201d Ashley said gleefully. \u201cIt feels so good to have the mole removed from my life. I should have cut it off long before he ever did. In a way he was actually doing me a favor.\u201d Ashley plopped the last chicken finger from her bucket into her mouth. She shifted her filling tummy as she reached for another course. The fleshy middle shook as the lack of abdominal muscles was ever apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChinese was a good call.\u201d Natalie commented as she sucked the remainder of her sweet teriyaki beef off it\u2019s stick and into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrent used to hate when I wanted to order out like this. Any time something might be a little bit fattening for me he\u2019d flip out. That\u2019s when I started going to that bakery and getting a few treats on the side so he wouldn\u2019t know about them. He was so controlling, I\u2019m glad I\u2019ll finally able to indulge whenever I want. It will even be nice to pack on a few pounds without having to worry about judgement from you know who.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, screw him, no need to worry about pounds any more.\u201d Natalie scurried across the room to the kitchen counter to help drive her friends point home. The padded girls boobs bounced up and down as she tried to move as fast as her rotund body allowed. Natalie grabbed one of the large cheese cakes and took it back to the couch where Ashley was plopped down on. Popping the top off she handed her best friend a fork. \u201cTo freedom.\u201d Natalie cheersed with her fork in the air, before stuffing a big bite in her mouth, causing her to instantly moan with pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley followed suit and before you knew it both girls were attacking the cake pan like this was the last cheesecake on the planet. Luck for them there were two more of equal size in the kitchen, but not for long. As crumbs became the only thing left of cheesecake number one, both blimping bimbos waddled into the kitchen taking one of the each remaining cheesecakes for themselves. Scarfing them down in record time, each wide woman reached a sugar high at the same time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the night consisted of the two unrestricted girls devouring every edible morsel in sight. It was a shock to them when the last of the Chinese food went down the hatch. Surprised they were able to finish that big of a meal, they just turned their attention to the stack of sweets before them. As they ate more and more their stomachs grew fuller and fuller, and they pushed out further and further. Their shirts started to be unable to contain their growing bellies, inches of juicy flesh started to show itself, but it didn\u2019t slow their appetite one bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they filled up, lethargy set in and their chomping slowed to a crawl. It was more and more of a daunting task to hit the kitchen to grab another treat, and standing in the kitchen had long been abandoned. The bakery goods were running out though, so they just brought the last of it to the coffee table. One of the last things they ate was the large sheet cake. It was so big they decided to split it, but it was too big to hold. Leaving it on the coffee table the girls slid their butts to the floor. Their cushiony butts gave them all the padding they needed to sit comfortably on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter such a large meal the two of them were wearing more food than they were proud of, but at this point forks were unnecessary. They each took a big chunk of cake in their hand, cramming the sugar laden treat straight into their own mouth. Grunts erupted as the cake was wolfed down, handful at a time. Both girls were in sinful bliss as they stuffed the last bits of sugary delight for the evening into their awaiting maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie couldn\u2019t help but reflect. \u2018Man if Ashley keeps eating like this, she will balloon in no time. She\u2019ll be bigger than Jessica even. She just looks so happy when she is enjoying all this decadent food, it can't be my place say anything. Plus I don't know why but just like Jessica, Ashley actually looks kind of cute with all her chubby curves.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie looked across the table at her bloated companion noticing just how fluffy she was looking. Her massive chest rivaled any of the big girls that she knew, and below that her pillow like billowing belly was fuller than full. Her belly even started to spread into her cushiony clap on top of her thick thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod we really should call it a night.\u201d Natalie filled the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean call it? I think our stomachs have done that for us. There\u2019s not a container left in this whole apartment. No that I can eat another thing.\u201d Ashley laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie giggled. \u201cI guess you're right, we did quite the number on this feast. God I'm so full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least you don't have to drive yourself home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time we will just have to do this at your place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d Ashley braced herself and slowly got up on her feet. After dusting herself off and washing her hands, the two friends hugged and Ashley took her leave. Natalie, too lazy to pick up the giant mess left behind, just retired for the evening leaving the clean up the next day.</span></div></div>",

Jessica and George had already arrived and were hard at work getting baking up a storm, Natalie could smell the scent of confectioners sugar in the air. The production in the kitchen was at an all time high, and management thought it was because of a boom in business. Sadly it was because they had hired Natalie who ate any opportunity she got. It also didn\u2019t help that Jessica had upped her intake now that she had somewhat of an eating buddy, she was definitely putting away more than she was before the new hire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie lumbered in, still a little full from the previous night. She pushed the heavy swinging kitchen, letting it slap behind her as she made her way into the back, getting the attention of Jessica. Natalie made her way into the locker area but Jessica followed her in. As Natalie started to change into her uniform, Jessica startled her from behind.\u201d So how did last night go!?\u201d Jessica using a loud voice, shaking awake the still tired Natalie. \u201cWas your friend cheered up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Natalie could answer all she could let out was a grown. \u201cNeed coffee.\u201d Natalie continued her grunting. Jessica pulled out a box a freshly crafted gourmet donuts, pushing it in Natalie\u2019s direction. \u2018It\u2019s a start.\u2019 Natalie thought to herself as she took and powered one with frosting spiraling out of it. \u201cAlso it's the  fact that we ate a quite a lot last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a good night if you ask me.\u201d Jessica smiled, living by the philosophy that good food makes people happy. \u201cNo way your friend Ashley could be down in the dumps after the stuff I sent you home with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, thank you so much again for that generosity. Ashley thoroughly loved all the things that you gave to us. Thank you so much for helping me lift her spirit in such a hard time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she is welcome here anytime. A friend of yours is also a friend of mine. We will treat her proper right if she ever wants to come to visit\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she actually comes in quite frequently. She actually started coming here before I ever worked here. I\u2019ll have to introduce you two next time she is in.\u201d Natalie\u2019s tone was upbeat and positive, but then it took a turn. \u201cComing here almost daily actually has a little to do with why her boyfriend broke up with her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Jessica was taken aback. \u201cWell I bet she is better off without him, and she has a good friend like you to help her pick up the pieces.\u201d The conversation petered out, not before Natalie had taken a few more donuts. Natalie pulled at the hem of her uniform trying to get it down as far as possible before hitting the front counter at the bakery. It did little to help, because as soon as she plopped her rear down on her stool, her shirt popped up, revealing several fleshy inches of her back.</span></div></div>",

Jessica brought tray after tray to the front, just as soon as George had finished baking something. Natalie could not resist trying so many of the freshed baked goods as soon as they were ready. Jessica tagged along, eating here and there with her working comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about lunch time a fantastic idea sprung up in Natalie's head. She pulled her phone out of her apron and called Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ash, wanna meet for lunch?... I thought since we work so close we should take advantage of the situation\u2026 Great. Fat Burger is pretty close, wanna meet there in 15?...

Now that she doesn't have to worry about that creep Trevor anymore, she should be free to eat whatever she wants.\u2019 Natalie thought to herself as she gleefully grabbed another muffin from the case in front of her. Natalie didn't realize that if she was constantly eating with her friend, every pound she gained would also pack onto her frame as well. Natalie didn't have time to think about that though, she just wanted to look out for the best interest of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later Natalie was on her lunch break and opening the door to Fat Burger. Standing off to the side was her rounding companion Ashley. Natalie soaked in Ashley, head to toe. She was in her formal business attire, wearing a tightly fitting work blouse and a pencil skirt that outlined all of her lower curves. Ashley was more bountiful than Natalie had ever seen, and Ashley seemed happier than ever. Natalie correlated the two in her head and thought it was up to her to make sure her best friend was as happy as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ash!\u201d Natalie threw her arms up in excitement from seeing her best friend and with the anticipation of a tasty lunch together. The soft girls hugged, and after a few simple pleasantries they approached the counter to order. </span></div></div>",

Can I get an extra Large Fry on the side. Also a Large Chocolate Milkshake. Can you also add in a Bacon BBQ burger, that looks good.

She gleefully took her drink cup over to the soft drink machine to quench her thirst before her meal came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them carried their burdensome trays over to a nearby booth, after getting another soda refill of course. Plopping their tray\u2019s down, followed by their plush backsides, both hungry girls started in on their sizeable meals. Big chomps of greasy burger meat mixed with sauces came one by one. Handfuls of salty fries slathered in ketchup disappeared by the fistful. Slurps of soda and gulps of milkshakes could be heard by the nearby tables, not that there were many people around, and those that were had the same mentality as these two young beauties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first there wasn\u2019t much room for chit chat, but as their bellies filled and their plates emptied, there opened up the chance for conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatalie, this was a great idea, this food is delicious.\u201d Ashley said as she adjusted the waist of her tightening skirt mindlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we should really do this again tomorrow!\u201d Natalie said eagerly, wanting to make sure Ashley stayed entangled in a web of eating. Ashley who was still riding a fast food high was more than agreeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon their trays were empty and they were licking their grease covered fingers clean. Natalie wanted to see what they had for dessert, but she didn\u2019t want to push it. Plus there was always tomorrow. They each refilled their soda cups after dumping their trash before leaving. Outside the stuffed girls parted ways, Ashley reassuring Natalie that she would stop by the bakery soon for her after work goodie run.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach felt quite full, Natalie was used to taking it easy after such a large meal, but unfortunately the bakery was a few blocks away, so she had to endure the short walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving back at the bakery, completely out of breath and face beat red. Natalie\u2019s sizable chest rose and fell as she tried to catch her breath and also warm up from the crisp cold that had embedded itself in her puffy cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stood watch from the other side of the bakery counter as her employee huffed and puffed. \u201cWelcome back\u201d Jessica smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late!\u201d Natalie, finally settling herself rushed to the back side of the counter to take her rightful place and relive Jessica. Natalie, normally given only 30 minutes for lunch, had come back 15 minutes late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok Nat, if you need to take an extra 15 minutes don\u2019t worry about it at all.\u201d Jessica could clearly tell from her distended belly that Natalie had used her time wisely and had eaten much. She was willing to cut her some slack if it lead to a fuller than normal belly, for food only brought happiness to the burgeoning employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Jess.\u201d Natalie sounded a little defeated, but relieved that her boss was so understanding. Natalie didn\u2019t realize it now, but if they kept up their new burger lunch tradition 15 extra minutes was going to become the norm if not lead to the need for an hour long lunch. But Natalie was too frazzled to think that far ahead, for now she just wanted to finish her shift for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon went by like normal, Natalie\u2019s sizable burger meal settled in her stomach in due time. Jessica was always in and out of the kitchen, always wearing a big smile on her face. George was rarely seen during the day, Jessica told her at the start that George took his work really seriously, so he was always out back toiling, but he loved it so it was all worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost time for Natalie to leave when a round figure approached the front door. The door swung open to reveal Ashley waddling in for her after work snack pick up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley!\u201d Natalie rang out in excitement to the empty store. Ashley looked just as she had before, but as well her burger meal had found a way to spread out from her stomach, fleshing out the other parts of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley approached the counter ready to have Natalie get her normal order. \u201cWait, hold on. Let me go get Jessica, the owner, she really wanted to meet you.\u201d Natalie turned tail, her bubble butt swaying back and forth in front of Ashley\u2019s eyes as she ducked out back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moments later it looked as though Natalie had multiplied, as the almost equally plump Jessica now stood with her behind the counter. \u201cJessica I want you to meet my friend Ashley.\u201d Jessica stuck out a soft warm hand to the bundled up, but obviously curvy, young business woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure  meet you.\u201d Jessica smiled wide, but she got the inkling she had seen this girl before, Jessica was pretty good at remembering another fat girls face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley was actually buying tasty treats here long before I ever even started.\u201d Natalie helping jog Jessica's memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I love the food here so much! I guess you can tell.\u201d Ashley said patting her ever growing belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you looked familiar!\u201d Everything now clicking in Jessica\u2019s head. Jessica had not been out front as much recently, since that was now Natalie\u2019s job, so she wasn\u2019t seeing all her usual customers. Also Ashley had substantially plumped up since Natalie had taken over so she was starting to look much different than before. \u201cWell any friend of Natalie\u2019s is a friend of mine, especially when that friend loves my baked goods. Natalie, from now on give Ashley the friends and family discount, 50% off everything she gets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, really?\u201d Ashley was stunned. She was getting an order daily now, and this would surely save her a lot of dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! What good is making all these amazing creations if I can\u2019t share them with the people we are about. Well Ashley it was a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance, unfortunately I must be off, my Georgie in the back was just preparing everything tomorrow and he\u2019ll need my help. I hope to see you again real soon Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame to you\u2026\u201d Ashley tried saying before her words could only trail off, as the plump Jessica disappeared behind the swinging kitchen doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only just a moment of silence before Natalie's jumped in to break it. \u201cWow I guess she must really like you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so, I wasn\u2019t expecting her to give me any sort of discount, that\u2019s so nice of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s not let it go to waste.\u201d Natalie was excited, this would surely help her friend plump up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll take the usual order then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Just the usual? You\u2019re getting everything 50% off! You can at least afford a few extras, right? And you\u2019ll still be saving money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk fine. Give me one of those cheese cakes, they were so good when you brought them over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and remember how good these brownies are? You need some of these too.\u201d Natalie got to ringing up her large order, and it was even cheaper than before with the new discount. Both girls were extremely happy, as Ashley left with her treats and Natalie started to close up shop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything for Natalie and her close circle of friends continued to go well. In the following days Natalie and Ashley continued to frequent Fat Burger for lunch, and Ashley made good use of her friends and family discount at the end of each work day. Natalie on the other hand snacked so much at work it was a marvel that the business was able to stay open with her eating into the profits. But she knew her employers didn\u2019t have any issue with it as Jessica was frequently seen sampling the goods as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of weeks later, the weekend was fast approaching and as usual the bakery would be closed. Natalie had recently gotten back from her lunch break, which was now lasting about an hour as she (and subsequently Ashley) started to add on menu items to their order. It started with just some dessert, but then an extra burger or two joined the list, followed by the addition of some more breaded chicken options. Jess had reworked Natalie\u2019s hours to compensate for the extra long lunch so Natalie wasn\u2019t always stressing about getting back on time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was tending to the front of the store when Jessica popped out from the back. The day was growing late, and since most of their customers came in the morning or after work let out, there was a usual calm before the storm. Jess opened glass case, fetching out a cream horn before taking a bite and turning her attention to her lone employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you and your friend Ashley have any more girls nights planned?\u201d Jessica said and she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually not really. We\u2019ve been meeting for lunch every day, but I haven\u2019t really been seeing her outside of work. Maybe I\u2019ll see if she is around this weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should see about tomorrow night, that way you can take some goodies from work home with you and they will all be fresh. And don\u2019t worry it\u2019s on me. You were both abuzz about them last time, and I know it really put your friend in a good mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was taken aback by Jessica\u2019s continued generosity, it seemed she only knew how to be nice and charitable. \u201cReally? Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica\u2019s lips curled into a smile as she wiped the excess sugar from her hands where the cream horn once was. \u201cOne condition though.\u201d She paused for emphasis. \u201cI get invited!\u201d Natalie let out a big sigh, as she wasn't sure where Jess was going there. \u201cI could use a good night out. I love George to death, but a night out of the house will do me good. Plus if you guys are half as fun as you sound I know I\u2019ll have a blast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk sounds like a plan!\u201d Natalie was actually excited by this turn of events. Jessica was the coolest most fun boss she had ever had, and she knew there was no judgement because she was just as wide as her. Natalie got her phone right out and started texting Ashley before a rush of customers came in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the 5 o\u2019clock rush started, Natalie slipped her phone back in her apron, and almost forgot she had even texted Ashley. Thankfully for the two owners business was at an all time high, and the last minute rush was no joke. Natalie spent the next hour helping patrons with their orders, barely even able to manage a break to have a brownie for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just about 6 o\u2019clock when the store front closed that a familiar large lumbering form entered the store just as the last customer was leaving. \u201cAshley, great! You mind locking the door behind you? It\u2019s close enough to six, I don\u2019t need anyone else coming in.\u201d Natalie said as she fell back on her stool, wiping the sweat from her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley flipped the lock, and made her way over to the counter. \u201cLooks like some one could use a creme puff.\u201d Ashley chuckled, as her thick chins collided with each other as they moved up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm that's a good idea.\u201d Natalie said as she slid open the glass case, fetching a flakey yet refreshing creme puff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod if I could just grab whatever I wanted for free whenever I wanted, I would go hog wild in this place.\u201d Ashley said as she watched her friend gobble down the creamy treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh trust me, I have. It\u2019s hard to have restraint in this place.\u201d Natalie said like she had any to begin with. If it wasn\u2019t for customers Natalie would probably be munching 8 hours a day. \u201cI\u2019d sneak ya back here for a few freebies, but I wouldn\u2019t want to get in trouble with the boss. I\u2019ve already been fired from one bakery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus Jessica was nice enough to give me a big discount, so I have no problem paying for my snacks. By the way, way to text me and then never respond. Did you want to have a girls night or not?\u201d Ashley chided her good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I completely forgot, it got so busy here. But yeah I was thinking if you were free tomorrow we could get together.\u201d Natalie was eager for Ashley to say yes, as she wanted to make sure her quest to make her best friend happy by expanding her waistline was still going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the only plans I had were with myself and a stack of pizzas, so I guess one more couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Ashley, ever the jokester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell actually Jessica wanted to see if she could tag along. She offered to donate snacks from the bakery again, and she was so nice to give us all those treats the first time, I didn\u2019t see the harm in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, the more the merrier!\u201d Ashley responded. \u201cI\u2019ll order the pizzas, you guys show up with the sweets, and we\u2019ll all have a good time.\u201d Natalie was very pleased. Ashley and her always had fun together, and she felt like Jessica was going to be even more of a hoot outside the walls of the bakery. And what could go wrong with plenty of good food around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie wrapped up Ashley\u2019s normal purchase, and after she left she went about her normal business of closing up shop. It wasn\u2019t until the following night until things got interesting again.</span></div></div>",

Jessica had offered to give Natalie a lift to festivities that night, as she had a car and could transport not only the voluptuous pair, but also all the baked goods they would be bringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica emerged from the back of the building, already dressed for the evening in a stunning dress that hugged her curves perfectly. \u201cReady to go?\u201d She tracked down her sole employee. Natalie had also changed from her work uniform to prepare for the evening. She was now dawned in a comfy fall sweater and a pair of leggings. Natalie loved how easy it was to just throw on a pair of dark leggings rather than try and battle with a pair of jeans. \u201cI\u2019ve already got the car packed, all I need is my plump co-pilot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\u201d Natalie huffed as she got the last of her things from the front of the store. They bumbled into the car and off the went across town to Ashley\u2019s place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I just want to make a quick stop.\u201d Jessica said as she pulled into a liquor store. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She said as she jumped out of the driver's seat and made her way into the neon lit store. Natalie was confused by the detour, but didn\u2019t want to rock the boat. Suddenly the smell of baked goods wafted into her nose and her stomach let out a large rumble. It\u2019s not like she wasn\u2019t surrounded by the smell all the time, but as Natalie was fully aware, the last hour of work was so hectic she could never stop for a bite to eat. Jessica has rushed her to change as soon as the doors were locked, and then rushed her out of the building before she was able to satisfy her hunger. Besides sleeping, it was rare for Natalie to go for more than an hour these days without some sweet or savory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, Jessica was on her way back carrying two large cases of beer. She popped them in the trunk and then they were back on the road. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were going to stop for beer\u2026\u201d Natalie softly brought up the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t drink last time at girls night?\u201d Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I mean, I guess not. We just didn\u2019t think about it I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw man, a nice tasty beer to wash down some pizza and sweets, nothing better. And don\u2019t worry I don\u2019t get the light stuff, that's like drinking piss water.\u201d Jessica seemed cheery, so Natalie played along. Natalie wasn\u2019t the biggest drinker, but it wasn\u2019t like they were throwing a rager, it was just the three of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough they arrived outside of Ashley\u2019s building. They grabbed as much as they could, but would need to make a second trip with Ashley to get the rest. Once inside the warm studio apartment Jessica was the first one to crack open a beer and take a swig.\u201dAhh that hits the spot!\u201d She sighed after the long work week. \u201cHere don\u2019t be shy.\u201d Jessica said as she popped the tops off two more bottles and passed them out. Natalie and Ashley saw no problem in having a couple of beers, so they both joined Jessica as the beverages quickly slid down their throat. \u201cAlright, get me at that pizza, it smells amazing.\u201d Jessica said, not wasting anytime getting right at home. Ashley led the trio into the kitchen where everyone found something they liked and took it back to the couch. With a beer in one hand and a pizza in the other, each of them was ready to dig right in.</span></div></div>",

She scouted every inch of Natalie, who kind of thought it was awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of scribbling some things down on paper, Jessica walked over to a closet in a corner of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rummaged through the closet, her big jiggling butt shaking about, showing its hugeness and roundness, like a plump ball shaped peach. It was definitely an area of her body that was really fat, next to her jiggling belly, thick arms, pudgy fingers, and jiggling fat huge thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha here it is\" Jessica said with a eureka sounding tone. She took out and outfit that looked like a pink elastic uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have one just in your size Natalie\" Jessica said.  \"In fact, this uniform is designed to stretch to ANY size\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any size\" Natalie asked curiously. \"That's right, so you don't have to worry if you get fatter. It will grow with you and assimilate itself to your body, so you can get as fat as you want\" she said in a somewhat cheerful tone. Somehow Natalie felt suspicious of the way she said those last words so pleasantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie examined the outfit closely. It was a pair of elastic pink leggings, a rubbery looking skirt, a pink t-shirt and an apron with a blank name tag. \"This outfit is made out of the stretchiest material. you can stretch it to any length you want. Even if you haven't changed in size that much, you can make the outfit stretch to humongous sizes\" she went on to say. \"For example, you could turn the small collar of this t-shirt\" she said, demonstrating with her own uniform \"into a hoodie\" she said pulling the collar of her shirt over her head, squishing her chubby round cheeks. Natalie supposed it wasn't bad and she never had to change it since it could accomidate her anytime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, lets go get changed\" Jessica said. Natalie was caught off guard. \"Wait, NOW\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course now, we have to see how you will look\" Jessica replied. She showed Natalie into a changing room. After a while of struggling to take off her clothes, that became too tight for her and her puffy jiggling belly sticking out of the lips of her pants, she got her new uniform on. She stretched the rubbery shirt over her big breasts and jiggling belly. It fit like a glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming out of the changing room Jessica said \"Oh you look so cute\". Natalie blushed. She was feeling a bit embarassed over this outfit. Jessica grabbed Natalie's chubby hand. \"Come on, lets show you your workplace\" she said. Natalie was dragged by Jessica while her jiggling fat bubble butt squashed into Natalie's hips, she was sure in a hurry. \"OoOoKkk\" she said vibrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica brought her to the front. \"All you have to do is take the money and put it i the cash register\" Jessica said. \"Cool\" Natalie replied. \"Thats good that you got it\" Jessica exclaimed happily. She stuck her chubby hand into her apron pocket and pulled out another gingerbread cookie like the one before. She unwrapped it with vigor and bit into its chocolaty goodness. \"MmmMMM, i love these cookies\" she said holding the half eaten gingerbread man. \"Itsh shooo goodd\" she said chewing with joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was look a bit enviously at Jessica. She wanted the cookie, in fact, she wanted to eat as many sugary delicious treats as she could right now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at Natalie between a bite of her cookie. \"Oh dear me, you must be starving\" she said. Natalie was a bit nervous. She was hungry, she was VERY hungry. Her belly gurgled and she wanted to devour all the sweets she could. It was just how she was. Despite that she was also humble, and didn't want to impose after just being hired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no I'm not hungry I just- she was saying but was cut off by Jessica. \"Nonsense, i can see it in your eyes, you want something to eat, something sweet and sugary. Its perfectly understandable if you have a healthy appetite and this is a bakery so you may have been influenced\" she said. It was like she could read Natalie's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go to the back and eat\" she said. \"A treat for your first day and whats to come\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie... </span></div></div>",

Maybe it was a good thing she had been fired. She might be able to burn off some of the flab building up on her middle. She grabbed hold of a little bit of meat in her spare hand. She had gotten chubby. That was undeniable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she withdrew her phone, and dialed her friend, Sabrina. She knew that girl had just arrived back from Baltimore. She had spent a long amount of time there with relatives who had visited from France--or was it Italy? Either way, it was from some foreign place, so she seldom had time to see these people. She had been gone for about a month, maybe more, so now that she was back, Natalie was going to pay her friend a visit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sabrina? How's it going?\" Natalie asked, excitedly when Sabrina finally picked up the phone. It sounded like there was a weird crunching sound on the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Just was chewing,\" Sabrina's lower, but not necessarily huskier, voice replied, \"It's been weird back here. I haven't seen anyone I know, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's been slow. Look, do you wanna hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.

They hung out all of the time in high school, but Sabrina had gone away to college while Natalie had stayed local.  They called occasionally, but got together every time Sabrina returned to town.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina had beautiful dark hair and eyes as well as a curvy figure that made her very popular with the boys. Natalie had always been her cute blonde accompaniment; together they were quite a gorgeous pair.  As she approached Sabrina's house, Natalie thought about this, and began to feel a little embarrassed about how she had let herself go.  Sabrina said she had put on weight, but surely she hadn't gotten as fat as Natalie had by raiding the bakery every day, had she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's answer came quickly when Sabrina answered the door, and it was no, Sabrina had actually gotten fatter than Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  Natalie said with surprise in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  Sabrina replied, as she gave her friend a hug.  \"Come on in.  I was just having a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina led Natalie to the kitchen, where a tray of pastries were set out on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are soooooo good.\"  Sabrina said, grabbing one.  \"I literally can't stop eating them.  It's part of the reason I've gotten so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not fat.\"  Natalie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph.\"  Sabrina said with her mouth full.  \"Oh yes I am.  It's cute, though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie couldn't argue that her friend didn't look cute.  She had a sweet round face, boobs that had gone from big to humongous, and a bulbous butt that was packed tightly into a pair of yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\"  Natalie admitted.  \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was already grabbing another pastry as she began to explain...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By spring break, you had a cute little belly.  At the beginning of the summer, you had boobs, and now they're BIG.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it - I got fat.\"  Natalie said.  \"I still don't understand why and how you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The how was easy.\"  Sabrina explained.  \"I went to visit my family in Baltimore, and my relatives from Italy were there at the same time.  Let me tell you, those people can cook, and if you tell them you want more, they love it, and you get more; a LOT MORE.  I ate all day, every day.  I ate so much that I outgrew all of my clothes twice this summer.  I seriously thought that I might explode sometimes because I was so stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"  Natalie asked.  \"Don't tell me that it was for boobs; you already had those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I didn't have THESE.  They're HUGE!\"  Sabrina cupped her monstrous chest for emphasis before reaching for two more pastries, taking one in each hand.  \"Seriously though, it was for all of it: the cheeks, the double chin, the soft belly, the boobs, the butt, the thighs, all of it.  You looked so cute, and I just wanted to see what it felt like.  Now, I know - it feels good, I've never looked better, and it's fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabrina, I did this on accident, and hope I can stop before I'm as big as a house.\"  Natalie whined.  \"I can't believe that you gained, what, 30 pounds? In three months?  On purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"37, to be exact.\"  Sabrina corrected as she licked her fingers.  \"Anyway, if anything, you need to step up your game.  Now help me finish these pastries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie had been craving one since she came in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabrina, this is why I lost my job.\"  She said.  \"I was eating too many baked goods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell.\"  Sabrina said with a grin.  \"Those clothes are getting pretty tight.  The good news is that there's no job on the line here, just delicious pastries.  As many as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sabrina.\"  Natalie protested weakly.  \"I'm getting too fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\"  Natalie argued.  \"We need to get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Natalie and Sabrina were laid out on the couch, pants unbuttoned and bloated bellies laid to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we ate all of them.\"  Natalie groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That last one was a struggle.\"  Sabrina admitted.  \"But so worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I could eat another one right now, but they WERE really good.  Where did you get them?\"  Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some new place off Sixth.\"  Sabrina said.  \"Looks like a gingerbread house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if they're hiring.\"  Natalie mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I did see a 'Help Wanted' sign.\"  Sabrina said, yawning.  \"Let's let this food settle for a bit, and I'll take you by there so that you can apply for a job and I can restock the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan.\"  Natalie said with a reciprocal yawn, and within minutes, the two friends were sleeping off their binge.</span></div></div>",

Also true to her word, there was a \"Help Wanted\" sign in the window.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\"  Sabrina said.  \"I'm just going to come in as a regular customer after you've had a chance to speak with the management.  Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie entered the shop, finding that it smelled incredible.  How could she be hungry after the gorging that she had done earlier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front desk was a woman slightly older but a little pudgier than her. No, a lot. She held a gingerbread cookie in her pudgy fingers, biting into it, her round face almost glowing in revelry, her eyes alight with joy. Her ginger, wavy locks stuck out in all directions as she swallowed, her bountiful breasts bouncing as she leaned forward, pushing herself up slightly against the counter. With a wide smile, cheeks dimpling, she asked, \u201cHi! Can I get you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe a job application?\u201d Natalie asked, noticing how the name tag clipped on her bust was labeled \u201cJessica.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica eyed Natalie up and down.  \"We don't really have an application, but we are looking for somebody.  In fact, you're the only person to even apply in a month.  Do you want the job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like that?\"  Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make change?\"  Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I...\"  Natalie started to share her experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get a cupcake out of the case when a customer asks?\"  Jessica inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"  Natalie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like to eat cookies?\"  Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I mean, cookies are good and all, but...\"  Natalie stammered and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you've got the job.\"  Jessica said.  \"Something you want to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie thought for a moment before blurting, \"I got fired from my last bakery job for eating too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled.  \"That won't be a problem here.  Our employees are our best advertisers, so we fully expect that you're going to eat what we make.  So, are you in?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
