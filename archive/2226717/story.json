Queen Haruka, Queen of the Monsters <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 10, but her powers also stops her from aging, making her immortal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 160ft<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: A fair skin girl with brown hair and blue eyes. Because of her Kaiju transformation, her body swelled up, putting some additional looks to her breasts and butt, making them more curvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: An extremely powerful Kaiju roar that can easily scare anyone. It also has the additional power of disabling nearby electronics and causing some destruction from the sound waves. Her body thanks to her mutation makes her stop aging, and she is easily immune to any weapons thrown against her. Breathing underwater, and also has laser breath as well from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes: Gonna use these picks as a reference of what Haruka would wear, but is often in a blue bikini outfit,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPics: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/sarugetchu/images/5/51/Helga.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20130228064012\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/saru...</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/erodriguez199698/art/helga-in-summer-274422028\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/erodriguez199...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSide: Neutral with a side of good<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackground Info: Haruka Kayoki was just a normal girl who had a pretty basic life. She went to school, have friends, have a loving family, etc. But all of that changed one day when a strange meteorite comet came by and hit Haruka\u2019s home, destroying it. Luckily her parents got out, but Haruka wasn\u2019t quite as lucky as the meteorite hit just as she got out. She was nearly killed by the blast, but then somehow strange energies were emitted from the meteorite and was absorbed into Haruka. She survived the blast but was transformed into a towering young girl who\u2019s body also got a But oversexed by the radiation with powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional info: This happened when she was just 8 years old, and while it took some getting used to, she decided to use her powers to help the people in Okita, Japan in anyway she can, while also trying to live a normal life as much as she can, just with a monster sized twist of course. The people also, while in fear at first, adore her and they loved her monster side so much, that they call her monster names. She actually likes the monster names a lot, and decided to embrace her Kaiju and kinda goddess status. Everyone helped the girl with food, housing, clothes, etc... and she helped out the city by demolishing, building, etc, soon she embraced her Queen status, and while not in charge, the people would view her as a goddess of some sort. She enjoys the power she had over them, but never abuses it, but still tries to live a good life as much as possible, even if it\u2019s monster size,</span></div></div>",

She loved when General Tanaka invited her over to the military base for testing. It was one the few times she could use her powers uninhibited without fear of demolishing the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Tanaka had been one of her most vocal detractors when she first became a kaiju and wanted nothing more than to exterminate her before she became a major threat. But over time he began to slowly change his tune when he saw how helpful she could be and how the people adored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still wasn't her biggest fan by any stretch of the imagination, but at least he wasn't petitioning anymore to drop missile on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently she was in the military's battle arena which was reserved for the general's latest weapon tests. Because of how durable she was, she was the perfect test subject for his scientist's latest weapons of mass destruction. Last time she tanked a bunch of borderline nuclear missiles, this time she was unsure what she was facing and excited nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was the general's turn to smirk from the safety of his testing window. \"Well aren't we confident.\" he then turned towards his scientists. \"Release project Monster Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" one scientist answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Releasing Project monster Hunter.\" Another stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final scientist punched in a few codes on his keyboard and turned to the others. \"Are we sure project Monster Hunter is ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, advanced statistical analysis says the project is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crunched the numbers like the rest of us, how could you have any doubts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General?\" the keyboard scientist called. \"the last experiment ended in failure as did the other nine. I'm not sure about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Tanaka was silent. \"Begin the test. If it fails... then we're all in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientists all nodded. The higher ups were getting tired of their constant failures to produce a kaiju killer, if they failed this time then that meant serious repressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" the scientist gulped. \"Releasing Project Munster Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the battle arena, Haruka waited patiently for the test. Her calm composure was rewarded by the lights in the facility going dark and the alarms blaring. This happened whenever a new test was issued. It warned everybody present that shit was going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red light flared around Haruka as she stared at the large steel door. Slowly it began to creak open, white smoke emerging from the other side. She had no idea what was coming, yet she welcomed it with open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was so ready to rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited with barely contained anticipation as she continued to eye the white fog. Whatever emerged from their would no doubt be exciting. She lived for exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard it. The sound of footsteps, large footsteps, fallowed by the sounds of scraping metal. Whatever was coming must have been mechanical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't surprise the young Kaiju if her opposition was mechanical considering she's scrapped more than her fair share of the generals menacing machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only downside was they didn't tend to last very long when she went all out and because of her insane level of durability, she could pretty much tank whatever the dished out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could still remember the first time she came to the military's testing facility and they had her fight a bunch of mini robots with experimental blaster technology. From what the general explained, those blasters had enough power to cut through 12inches of metal like a hot knife through butter. Yet, they didn't even burn or break her skin. Needless to say he was pissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's how all his tests went. He'd bring in the latest... whatever, and she'd either tank it or destroy it. Either way the outcome was always the same... Girlzilla wins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka was broken from her thoughts when suddenly the footsteps went silent. The kaiju didn't know what to expect, but all of a sudden the alarms stopped blaring and the lights retuned to normal. All that was left was the white fog and what was concealed within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what was in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside his window the general and scientist looked on with anxious expressions. This was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka tightened her fists in preparation and met the glowing red eyes of the automaton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So she was right after all, another robot for her to scrap. Knowing that made her smile, the general was about to hold another 'L' in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hand reached out to grab the other side of the doorframe. Whatever kind of robot this was, was sure taking it's sweet time. This slow pace kind of reminded her of when she fought the general's tanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd seen turtles that moved quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka was starting to lose her patients now. \"Would you just hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the machine had herd her demand, the metal menace broke through the fog. When it did Haruka was left stunned. Ever since she first came to this facility she'd faced numerous robots and weapons... but never had she faced a machine version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis iron maiden looked almost exactly like her, minus the metal frame. Neck-length brown hair, glowing blue eyes, and curvy in all the right places. She even wore the same swimsuit as her outside of the color change. Bloody crimson to contrast against her sky blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck was this!? Haruka turned away from the metal pretender to the general's window. \"Mr. Tanaka!? What the heck is this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. Every other trial before this led us all to the same conclusion, nothing we built could stand against you. Your body is the perfect war machine, and what better way to harness that kind of destructive power than to mold our latest creation in your image.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka didn't know weather she should be flattered or angry, maybe a little bit of both. She never signed on for a mirror match. She hated mirror matches. Especially when she was still small and could play video games and her father would mess with her by picking the same character. She hated that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Haruka huffed before turning back to her iron double. \"It doesn't matter if she looks like me or not, I'm gonna send her back to the scrap heap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStream seemed to shoot from the metal Haruka's ears, the sound reminiscent of a tea kettle. \"Error. This unit will send you back home crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It talks!?\" Haruka breathed before getting serious. \"And it talks trash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who added a trash talk feature?\" General Tanaka sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me sir.\" one scientist admitted. \"We had parts leftover and I didn't want them to go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Just as long as Project Monster Hunter (P.M.H) can get the job done.\" The general then locked eyes with the kaiju. \"Let the battle trial begin in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say the general and the scientist were stunned would be an understatement. The horror in their eyes combined with their slacked jaws conveyed the message that they were not just stunned, they were embarrassed. The 'fight', if could even be called that didn't even last five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirlzilla stood triumphant over their latest with her arms crossed and her foot planted firmly on the automaton's chest. She wasn't even injured, tired, or sweating, she just looked victorious like she always did when going head-to-head against their latest creations. Once again they had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General? What do we do?\" A scientist asked with dread in his voice. That dread was shared by the rest of his colleagues and for good reason. This was their last chance and constant failure would be met with severe consequences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute, there was nothing but silence. The general could still hardly believe what he witnessed. One punch. That's all it took to fell project monster hunter. Girlzilla managed to snuff out almost a years worth of hard work and dedication with one blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Tanaka looked back at his scientist with mechanical slowness on par with the scrap currently under the giantess Kaiju's foot. \"See her out and send the trial data to high command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" the keyboard scientist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it.\" the general ordered. \"There's no sense in keeping her any longer and there's no use in delaying the inevitable. Get her out and send the battle data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" A scientist said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the arena, Haruka basked in her victory. Once again she'd sent another bucket of bolts back to the scrap yard where it belonged. When would the general learn he could never invent anything strong enough to defeat her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, maybe she shouldn't have gone all out and destroyed the metal monstrosity in one hit? Normally she'd drag things out a bit but her hatred of mirror matches demanded she end things on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she could only imagine the general's face right now. He was probably foaming at the mouth at how quickly she dispatched his mechanized monster. Serves him right. Next time he won't try to copy her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello!? G-Girlzilla!?\" A voice rang below her. Looking down by her foot she noticed one of the general's scientists calling up to her with a megaphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The battle trial is over now. T-the general said to see you out.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka smiled before removing her foot from the robot. \"Oh don't worry, I can see myself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she began walking away through an open slide door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time tell the general that he'll have to come up with something more original if he wants to beat me! Bye-bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gone... leaving the lone scientist with an almost broken frown. \"What next time?\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in the window the general sat by a computer screen with a blank expression, his men huddled behind him. Each of them anxiously awaited a response from high command for their embarrassing defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen to us sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill we be terminated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general turned towards his scientists. \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA message then popped up on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Tanaka's face remained stoic as ever as he read the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says that as of today, all of you are being reassigned... and I'll be going up to high command for a hearing.\" he answered, shocking his men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reassigned!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't say. All I know is that come tomorrow, nothing will be the same again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka yawned before giving her body a good stretch. Playing with the general was fun, but she was ready to call it in early. Looking up at the sky she could tell she'd been at the base for a while. The sun was setting and the sky was bathed in orange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to swim home and rest. Maybe next time General Tanaka will come up with something that'll give her a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All he could think about was yesterday's miserable failure and the fear and disappointment on his men's faces. Because of his failure as a general they were reassigned to god knows where and he was trapped here at this hearing waiting to see what would become of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all because of that damn Kaiju girl. No matter what he tried or how much he strategized, none of his creations could so much as hurt her, let alone defeat her. Project Monster Hunter was supposed to be his magnum opus, the culmination of everything that came before. It was supposed to leave her crying and ensure the future of technological warfare. Now it was scrap and he was back to the drawing board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General Tanaka?\" a meek voice called. \"It's time for your hearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded and straightened his tie. \"Let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed open the double doors that stood before him and entered the private office. Inside was the chief of high command and a woman he had the rather unfortunate circumstance of knowing. The man was chief Sakurai and the woman was head scientist Junko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Sakurai sat behind his desk while Junko stood beside him with her clipboard in hand. \"I trust you know why you're here General Tanaka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise.\" Sakurai ordered. \"As a general your duty is the safety and protection of the people, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is because of your role that you were given a private division and men capable of creating any project you saw fit. We gave you a base, men, resources, and near unlimited funding. Yet none of your creations bore fruit. Then when this... this, freak shows up on our doorstep, you can't even take her down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Tanaka looked down in shame. \"We did our best sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your best was not good enough!\" he growled. \"We have a living breathing 160ft female monster living in our city that could rampage at any time if left unchecked and time and time again you fail to deliver a contingency plan! That girl is a danger to Japan and herself! The fools just can't see it yet! They're blind to this girls size and 'charm'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Tanaka answered. \"We've tried numerous times to take her down or find a weakness with our battle trials and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet time and time again you fail to deliver results.\" Junko interrupted. She pushed up her glasses before continuing. \"Your job was to make sure in the event this monster ever lost control she could be contained or taken out. Instead she's made the military and your division look like chumps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka tightened his fists. \"We did our best. That girl is a scientific mystery. Nothing we created could even break her skin. All ten battle trials only confirm that Girlzilla might just be invisible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I disagree.\" Junko said casually. \"Everyone one has a weakness, you just have to find it and push.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that simple.\" Tanaka argued. \"The battle data--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your problem. You rely too much on the numbers, general. All ten of your battle trials were based on the data crunched from previous encounters and recorded footage from news copters as well as estimations. You let the math dictate your next course of action and as such you failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you realize how ridiculous you sound!?\" The general asked in disbelief. \"The numbers are everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool.\" Sakurai cut in. \"Why play the odds when you can make them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka looked confused. \"What are you saying, sir? The numbers--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Sakurai shouted. \"No more excuses about the numbers! I'll hear no more of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko smirked. \"Despite your string of failures, your last one wasn't actually as bad as you believe it to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Project Monster Hunter wasn't a bad idea on paper, just in execution. Which is why I believe with a little tweaking, we might just have ourselves the perfect war machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakurai's eyes narrowed. \"Tell the man, Junko.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As of today you work for me now general and you'll be aiding me with my personal project.

Numbers were everything, they dictated the best course of action on the battlefield and most likely saved more lives than anyone would ever know. So say that they didn't matter was just ludicrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Junko. He couldn't stand this woman. Everything about her simply rubbed him the wrong way and the way she could suck up to people made him want to puke. Not to mention he'd been a witness to some of her more... covert projects. Needless to say the woman had no morals. If she was heading a new monster hunter project then that meant nothing good for those involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly is your plan?\" Tanaka pried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko smirked. \"All in good time general, all in good time. Anyway, why don't you head back down to base while I make preparations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, for first contact with the enemy of course.\" Junko giggled. \"I want to meet this Kaiju girl face-to-face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why on earth would you want to do that? Surly your time would be better spent behind a laptop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tut, tut, tut, general.\" the head scientist mocked. \"No need to get all dramatic. I'll get behind the screen when I'm good and ready. For now be a good little grunt and do as your superior demands. Head back to base while I go confront this big bad threat to national security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general grit his teeth. \"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.\" she teased. \"Now run along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general did as he was told, but not with a few muttered curses under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such an amusing little man.\" Junko remarked. \"Now it's time to meet this Girlzilla and get this show moving.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All around her was the blaring of car alarms and cheers from the people below. Despite the destruction she caused the citizens of Japan still adored her. She could knock over a tower on purpose and they'd probably still sing her praises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to do what to do.\" Haruka wondered as she stopped in the middle of the road. Her sudden stop had caused the cars behind her to crash into her foot and stockpile on top of one another. Miraculously no one was hurt. Instead they were in awe of who they hit. Some of them even began to take pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane.\" someone said, watching the entire scene play out. That someone was none other than Junko herself, dressed in her more casual attire as opposed to her usual scientific one. \"It's like the people here are hypnotized. She shows up, breaks things with little regard for her actions and the peoples safety, and yet they act as if her just being near them is an honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat realization made Junko giggled. The people were ridiculous and their favorite Kaiju was as irresponsible as she could be. She probably didn't even realize what a danger her size represented in this little city. Ignorance was bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to kick start project monster hunter 2.0. That girl will do wonders for me.\" she smiled as she watched the giant take a seat in the road and pose with a few cars in hand for the locals. \"They really do love their monster genre in this country don't they.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, it was time to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"thank you, come again!\" Haruka waved. \"Anyone else want a monster photo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do called a woman from the back of the crowed. She was a buxom blond in a red sweater with blue eyes and... were those cowboy boots? \"I'd like a monster photo with the cities resident giantess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Haruka smiled what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my names Junko, Sayo Junko.\" she answered. \"And you're Girlzilla, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka smiled. \"That's me. So what kind of photo do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan I get a picture of me in your mouth like you're about to eat me. It would look great on my desktop.\" Junko smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka looked elated. Not a lot of people chose that pose. \"You got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka handed her cellphone to nearby civilian and asked them to take the shot. They of course nodded not wanting to say no to a beautiful lady and the blue swimsuit clad giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirlzilla lowered her head. \"Hop in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" Junko said causally before hopping into the wet and smell maw that belonged to the giant. To anyone else this would a terrifying experience, not to mention gross as hell, but Junko loved it. There was just so much DNA in here to steal. Her body was literally being saturated in it. She pulled a small vial out from her pocket and quickly began to scoop up some samples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\" Junko smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe civilian took the picture of Junko pretending to look terrified while Haruka played the part of an hungry predator. Despite the sinister intent behind this, the scientist supreme found the whole experience quite enjoyable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kaiju let her down and she wasted no time swiping back her phone. \"Not bad.\" she casually remarked about the photo. Perhaps she really would put this on her desk top?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the drool.\" Haruka apologized nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. You keep being awesome!\" Junko grinned before giving the girl a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka returned it. \"Will do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" and with that, Junko disappeared into the crowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was so cool.\" Haruka cheered. She then turned her attention to the line in front of her. \"Okay, who's next?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she was just getting back to the main base of operation, she goes to see the general Tanaka, who is of course annoyed and pissed. He was having is arms against the wall, knowing he is being mocked by the fact he has to work with the scientist Junko, but she seems happy to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there my friend.\u201d Junko said with a bit of a smile on her face, and the general sighed. \u201cHow is everything back in the base?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in the mood to say, but fine I guess. So, tell me what trouble did you went through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you wouldn\u2019t believe what I did today. I went and saw the giant 10 year old swimsuit clad Haruka, a.k.a. Girlzilla and got a picture with her with me as the terrified girl about to be eaten by her. I know she is a good girl and has done a lot for the people in Japan and is a worldwide sensation, but at the same time she is so reckless. Where she walks, the ground rumbles, and plenty of near accidents and vehicles gets wrecked. So careless for a girl her age, along other things.\u201d Junko said just as she show the pic on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, nice for you.\u201d The general said, kind amused by the situation that Junko put herself in to embarrass herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that is not all, in fact... its get better. During this, I was drooled on by Haruka, and I used that to get plenty of samples of what I am sure is to be DNA.\u201d Junko said, showing the vial with the sample inside, which got the general to look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting. Maybe I could see where you are going with this. I know the U.S. has done something quick similar, only with cloning technology.\u201d The general admit, impressed by Junko\u2019s effort. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2226717-Girlzilla-Giantess-Monsters-20/map/13?add_success=true\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive...</a>) (reference here)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s just say that I have something big planned in mind. But I think where you failed is actually quite in an area you didn\u2019t expect. You see, we need to actually need to understand Haruka a little bit more, and not just in her powers and size that we obviously see. We need to see the DNA side of it, and even kinda try to be her ally a little it.\u201d Junko giggled before the general snapped at the thought of being the giant\u2019s ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU SHITTING ME?????!!!!!!!\u201d Tanaka snapped in anger, ready to take it out on Junko, almost lashing out but Junko push him to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell think of it like this.... we need to try to win her over as a friend, and perhaps get her to open up to us a little bit more, and to actually see that there is more than just her, and what not. Basically, we need to understand Haruka. As a person, as a kaiju, etc. See what the people think of her, and perhaps use that as an advantage in our project.\u201d Junko then explained just as she starts looking on the sample on her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general had a thought for a moment, and then he signed and reluctantly agreed. \u201cVery well, we will try to be friends with the giant, perhaps opening up to her a little bit could be of benefit to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and also, that is what me and the head superior\u2019s were discussing earlier before the meeting. Rather than actually try to be an enemy or a tester to Haruka, we need to be her friend so we can understand her more and make our project, and when our project is ready, we will be ready to send her home crying and have her death with immediately, and when she least expects it.\u201d Junko then added. \u201cKnow the enemy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell its getting late. We have to be departing for the U.S. soon, as they are going to show a test of their kaiju.\u201d The general added as he remembers he has an event to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes, and I am a fan of what they are doing from what I saw so far, but my project will be... quite special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?</span></div></div>",

She knows she is popular and what not, but so much to where they don\u2019t care about the quakes and damages that she does to their vehicles as she stomps around the city all because they love her. Haruka was always mindful of being careful not to crush on stuff intentionally, though stomping around Japan is always a treat and fun thing for her to do. Maybe its because of her body maybe, bigger breasts, cuter butt, or just the sheer size and power she has that the people secretly live in fear of her, knowing she could snap at anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if anything though, she is a nice person at heart. She is a big help to the cities of Japan, and is massively popular around the world, so much so that other places across the world are trying to make monsters like her to compete with her. It would be interesting to see her making friends with other giants like her, and also nice as well. It was only two years since she became a giant, but the city and Japan changed a lot to help her. Like with specially made roads that she often goes on unless doing a shoot like she did with Junko, the island home off the coast of Japan, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they are things that she has to do today, and after her photoshoot with the vehicles, she gave her bikini a once over and proceeded to stomp in a certain direction, but where is she going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne job that she always loves to do, and on rare occassions, the people and government of Japan would ask her to destroy some buildings for reconstruction. This is easily her favorite thing to do, as it lets her be the monster that she really likes being, and its a favorite treat for the people of Japan to see the giant child monster \u201cterrorize\u201d Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing she tends to do is head to a specially made building for Haruka where they are making clothes for her to try on, mainly swimsuits but she doesn\u2019t mind being in just swimsuits all the time. The other outfit she likes surprisingly is a school girl outfit, even though people would look up her skirt, but she knew that would happen. It is fun also to be a giant school girl monster also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, she also constantly checks up with her friends from her previous school and at the play park where Haruka or as the kids call her, Harukazilla is a massive attraction and is beloved by children. Its also how Harukazilla got her giant monster names also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what will Harukazilla do right now? </span></div></div>",

And act like one she would once she reached her new destination. Apparently she was needed to level a part of the city for some new reconstruction project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe honestly didn't mind, in fact she could hardly wait. A chance to put on a show and rampage like a best? How could she be anything but excited? She loved whenever she got the chance to go out and be a true Kaiju. That raw feeling of strength, power, and broken metal and cracked earth under her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about it made her feel all warm and fuzzy inside. \"I can hardly wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leisurely skipped through the city she could hear the sounds of glass shattering and the honking of horns. She was causing all kinds of mayhem with her footfalls but was careful not to destroy anything or anyone important. No, the ground and surrounding windows will have to suffice until she reacted the demolition sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Harukazilla!\" a bystander cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harukazilla is here!\" another mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, take a picture before she walks away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess up above couldn't help but chuckle. The people really did love her. The movies totally got it wrong. People were supposed to freak out and the army was supposed to show up and blow everything to hell. Instead the army let her do whatever and the people wanted her autograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster's life was truly the one for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she came across the demolition sight where as usual, Mr. Watanabe was waiting for her. The older man in the yellow hard-hat gave her a grandfatherly smile before turning towards the area. \"It's all for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka grinned as she eyes the land. \"It's all for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatanabe nodded as did the rest of his crew and more than a few civilians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destroy it!\" the all cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she would destroy it alright. </span></div></div>",

She remembered seeing it more than a few times when she was smaller and parents told her it's where boring suits went to file papers. Oh, and the pay sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was more than enough motivation for her to destroy it. Anything as boring, oppressing, and ugly as this place had to go. The giantess grinned as she cracked her knuckles. It was time to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe casually walked up to the aged structure and ran her hand across the smooth roof. Even though the building was smaller than her, it was still much wider. It would take time to destroy this, and she honestly didn't mind. She was about to put on a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka took a deep breath... and shot a wave of flame at the structure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roof instantly caught fire which caused the giant to smirk. She jovially skipped around the building, causing small tremors on ground below. She then raised her hand up and smashed the side of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the ground were in awe of the destruction. Watching Harukazilla go to work was like watching a great matador. She was damn sure good at what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good riddance I say.\" Watanabe sighed as he watched Harukazilla start to level the offending building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concur.\" a nearby civilian agreed. \"I worked there for ten years and the pay sucked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that didn't matter now as Haruka drove her foot through the building's core, leaving behind a massive hole. Surprisingly though the building held. Everyone half expected that kick to make the structure crumble. But no, it continued to stand tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka clicked her teeth. This building was a lot tougher than she gave it credit for. She was trying to level the building in one hit. Well there went that plan. Fine, if the building wanted to be difficult than the show would continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka drew her arm back and gave the building a sort of karate chop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burning structure offered little resistance to the blow and began to tremble. Fire roared through the openings and cracks but yet again the structure refused to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one tough old bird.\" Watanabe commented with wide eyes. Normally whatever Harukazilla hit fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\" A construction crew member answered back. \"They don't make'em like this anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka was getting rather annoyed now. She'd kicked, chopped, and even set this building on fire and yet it simply refused to crumble. What was this building originally, some sort of nuclear fallout shelter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ruining her reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kaiju growled and took a massive step back. There was no way she'd let this building embarrass her any further. It was coming down now. Haruka dug her feet into the ground... and charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building couldn't hold on any longer and Haruka smashed her way through. The tower was little more than rubble and broken glass now, as it should've been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka turned to face her adoring public and yelled, \"Ta-da!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-clap-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-clap-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-clap-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowed began to shower her with praise. No doubt the internet will tell the story of the giant versus the tower for weeks to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, freak.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was once a collection of homes was now a rundown mess of rotting wood and rusty scrap. To be quite honest if it could be compared to anything it would resemble a dump or an atomic bomb testing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow appropriate considering there was kaiju sized bomb falling from the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor row of houses down below never stood a chance as they were instantly flatten beneath the massive rear of the giantess. The shockwave from the impact was so powerful a large gust of wind and debris kicked up into the air, instantly destroying anything in it's path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Hit the deck!\" Watanabe called as he and the surrounding civilians ducked down behind cover. The massive typhoon of dirt and debris brushed right over them and any cover was left pulverized by shrapnel. Thankfully no one was injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" A civilian breathed. \"Tell me someone caught that on camera!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did!\" Another groaned. \"I caught the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl.\" Watanabe sighed before turning his attention back to the destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka meanwhile giggled at carnage she called. All around her houses and roads were smashed to atoms. She literally dropped down with the force of an atomic bomb, minus the radiation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the entire surrounding area in ruins, except for the houses in the distance that did survive. That was good. The fun wasn't over just yet. She then turned her attention back to the crowd and was beyond pleased to see everyone recovering and snapping pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy to forget about them when she got caught up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking to herself she slowly rose to her feet and winked at the crowd. *ROAR*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound was defending. The loud roar of a beast ready to destroy. She then turned to the houses off in the distance and launched a laser beam from her mouth. In a flash the remaining houses were wiped off the map in a megaton explosion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ROAR*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KAIJU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-clap-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-clap-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KAIJU*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-clap-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-clap-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was getting into it as they usually did when she leveled parts of the city. It did her heart good to know she could have fun and appease the people at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all liked that, right!?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" they answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna see more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" they screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then watched this!\" She grinned before miraculously spying a few shops that managed to survive her controlled rampage. She wasted no time running up to the awaiting building, shaking the earth with each step. She eyed the convenient store with hungry eyes and slowly raised her foot in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crush it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stamp it out of existence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was she to disappoint her fans. Slowly she lowered her foot onto the structure and she could feel the bricks pressing against the underside of her foot. All it would take was a little pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe applied just a little force, and the building crumbled beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" the crowd cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, this girl is something else.\" Watanabe lightly smiled. She certainly made his job easy. All he had to do was ring her up, sit down, and collect a paycheck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest. Job. Ever.</span></div></div>",

Besides she got to try a few new poses she'd been working on and got to put that cool lady in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all that was finished she gave her loyal fans a goodbye wink before heading off to one her favorite places... Silk. It was a clothing store that specialized in specific designs and used only the finest materials from all over the world. It was also the only spot in Japan that could make her some actual clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to special order clothing from other places before, but they either couldn't do it, were too cheap with the material, or were simply far too expensive. Those were the dark ages were she was forced to constantly were nothing but her bathing suits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she was about to resign herself to her fate to wear nothing but swimwear, her friend Yumi told her about this fancy store in town called Silk that made all of her daddy's clothes. She remembered Mr. Kubo's fancy multicolored suits and thought to give the place a shot. After all it wasn't like she had anything to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first arrived to place an order and told them her measurements they weren't even shocked. They just asked what she wanted it made out of and told her when they'd be finished. She was quite honestly the only one that was shell-shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne problem that did arise though were the prices. She might've been a celebrity but she wasn't made of money. Her pockets weren't as fat as her friend Yumi's. But she was in luck. Silk knew who she was and cut her a deal. If she became their spokesperson then she'd get clothes for half off. She couldn't say yes fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been a loyal customer and spokesperson ever since. She drew up business like nobodies business. Which led her to right now. Seated in front of Silk while Ms. Sato and her seamstresses brought out her order.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Japanese school uniforms hadn't really changed much over the years and had become a staple of the culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much so that they even reached other countries through means such as movies, anime's, cosplays, and video games. They had become a part of pop culture all around the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially the schoolgirls uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat white sailor-style outfit with the blue skirt and ribbon. Haruka adored that look. She could remember the first time she'd ever set eyes on outfits like that. Her mother was going through her old VHS collection when she came across her old Sailor Moon episodes that she recorded off T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka could remember just sitting down with her mother and watching anime. She could recall Usagi running down the sidewalk with her cute little buns and that white and blue uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was love at first sight for the future Kaiju girl. Then she would transform into Sailor Moon and had an even cuter modified version that made her look so cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day forward the Japanese schoolgirl's uniform was forever burned into her brain and into her heart. So it was an absolute joy when she got to wear the Kaiju-sized version Silk put together for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just felt so comfortable against her skin and it was snug and colorful. It was the standard white and blue with a red ribbon. It made her feel almost like a high-schooler herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was an 160ft schoolgirl and loving every second of it.

Despite the protests of a few parents and teacher that didn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi and Ami were simply the bestest friends she could have ever hoped for. They even gave her nickname Harukazilla after she used her size to give that bully Yoshiko an atomic wedgie. It was a moment no one would ever forget. The way she dangled the blonde by her knickers with her fingers was legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut over time moments like that became less and less. Haruka left school, Ami's family moved to a different part of Japan, and Yumi was occupied with being groomed to run her family's business one day. The fun and games were over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... then those rare days happened. Haruka wouldn't be obligated to do anything, Ami would stay in town for a few days visiting her grandparents, and Yumi was free to actually be a kid again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like having a class reunion except is was just the three of them and no Yoshiko to rain on their parade. Speaking of the evil blonde, she really needed to remember to look her up to see what happened to her. She seemed to just vanish after that atomic wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows, maybe she just left Japan all together? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she could dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess remained lost in her thoughts until she spied the park. Haruka's grinned returned full force as she picked up the pace. The closer she got the more bubbly she got. There were only two people there, two very familiar people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AMI!

Needless to say getting to experience their own Kaiju's power as well as their technology for the future was very eventful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko made sure to take a mental note of everything she'd seen and would maybe apply some of their techniques to her own project. The general was very much the same, although he wouldn't admit to her. He still hated her guts. That was fine so long as he didn't fuck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general aside, Junko was eager to get back to work with Harukazilla's DNA. The first in depth viewing nearly made her head spin. Never before had she seen sequences like this. This girl wasn't just a mystery like the general described, she was a scientific marvel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever that meteorite did to this girl had almost completely rewrote her DNA and turned her into a walking weapon. No wonder Tanaka was having so much trouble taking her down, she damn near invincible. She was 160ft tall, had a sonic roar, stopped physically aging, could breath underwater, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko was almost salivating at the amount of information a simple bit of drool could tell her. That combined with all the info the general gleamed from his battle trials only made want to put that much more effort into Project Monster Hunter 2.0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently the general was out getting friendly with Harukazilla as per her directive. The man of course was vehemently against it, but a little threat to high command was more than enough to get him to play ball. All the information he brought back with him everyday only served to move her plans forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant had become comfortable around him, and to make sure she didn't get suspicious, she was still occasionally brought back to base for some pointless battle trials against some of her failed experiments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Junko finished recording the day's data, the sound of slide doors filled her ears. She turned her head to see the general walking in with his ever present scowl and a cup of coffee in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how'd your playdate with the giant go?\" Junko teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general grumbled before taking a sip of his coffee. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine?\" Junk asked. \"No talks about her hopes and dreams this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" the man said flatly. He wasn't used to being interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Don't tell me.\" Junko said unconvinced. \"Anyway, I've almost cracked this girl's DNA. Give me another month or so and I'll be reading it like a manga panel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the general questioned. \"What if you find out you've only cracked the surface?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko grinned before turning back to her computer. \"The more information the better. And besides, I would think you'd root for me to get this done so you can stop playing nice with the enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general grumbled. \"Whatever. It's getting late so I'm heading out. Try not to fall asleep at your desk this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises.\" Junko waved off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freak.\" Tanaka said under his breath as he left the lab. As he walked to his car he couldn't help but think about the last few weeks he spent with the giantess. Originally he'd seen her as a threat to his city and himself, but now he wasn't so sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kaiju girl was a bit irresponsible, yes, but he'd been able to help correct some of that by just talking to her and being around her. She was still a klutz and at time broke something, but it was never on purpose. So far she was as innocent as she came across on T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he... having second thoughts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the enemy... and he would see to it she was neutralized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if... she wasn't that bad.</span></div></div>",

She was now experimenting and trying to crack the cold to Haruka\u2019s DNA that she somehow managed to obtain, and wondered what she intends to do with the DNA sample when the time comes. Is it possible that she might use it herself to become a giant, or maybe something else entirely. The way that Junko acts sometimes seems like she wants to do something vile and evil, and the general wasn\u2019t gonna to have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to his briefing room and immediately contacted his superior Sakurai at the first chance he got. Tanaka wanted to hear his opinion on something on the matter. The video call shows Sakurai somewhere out of the country and he look at the general who contacted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there general Tanaka, how is the project coming along this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell whatever project she is doing, I am assuming she is doing well. She gave me the incredibly embarrassing job to befriend the giant monster girl Haruka as she got a sample of her DNA that she is trying to crack. I can show you the proof in a bit, but let me ask you this, do you really trust the idea of someone with a sample that can turn themselves into a giant at their own will if they wanted to. I mean I liked what the Americans did with their project, but I don\u2019t know if we should go this route.\u201d Tanaka complained with a grunt, in which Sakurai can only reply with a bit of a smile, knowing he mentioned something useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I will admit the U.S. project is impressive, and I get your opinion on the matter of having to trust a girl like her, but you got to realize that this is a very serious problem, if we can\u2019t find a way to either control the girl or terminate her, then we could be in danger. But... I kinda figured you would attempt this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka then replied surprised, and in anger. \u201cWhat, how did you know. I would attempt this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I was keeping in touch with them throughout this entire thing.\u201d The woman named Junko said, appearing with the sample in her hand. \u201cI am still currently working on this, but I can assure you, I have good faith in the project I am making will surely either control or defeat her. Besides, I been having him befriend her a bit in order to get info on why the people love her so much. She might be a klutz, but she may be good, but we all know that we have to deal wit her. And besides, I will tell you know what we are going to use this sample to make a kaiju of our own. Think of it like this... if we can\u2019t defeat Haruka normally, maybe a kaiju like her can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting... see Tanaka, maybe if you didn\u2019t trust your trials all that much, maybe you could have found an idea that would work. I actually approve of this, and actually that is the issue of all of your failures. You try to do it normally with human tech, when in reality, we needed to find a way to use the DNA from Haruka in order to make a being that will be her equal. Besides the saying this, if man won\u2019t kill god, then the devil will do it. Junko, I am very pleased with your report. Tanaka, trust her on this... and we will have not only the girl taken out, but also a monster we can use to ensure our nation\u2019s safety. I must be going, see you soon.\u201d Sakurai said before he closed the video call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka was now completely furious, the idea of making a giant monster to face a giant monster. Not only the damages that would be unleashed on the city, but ruining his pride as a general to take it out by any means necessary with what they have. He wouldn\u2019t attempt this at all. His attempt to rat out Junko failed, since she was a step ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figure you try to rat me out, so I told him already an idea of this, and he liked it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell lucky you here... I hope you are happy with this. But mark my words, you won\u2019t get far with your project, and when it fails, and it will, you will be sorry.\u201d Tanaka snapped just before he left the office room in disgust. Junko had the upper hand, and now her plan to make a kaiju that can rival Haruka is now in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

She even went to the U.S. to witness Koyukizilla, and that is how she got her inspiration for the project, well at least some of that inspiration. You see, the true inspiration came from somehow Junko becoming a fan of Haruka. She may say that she hates her, and what not, but in reality, she does like her. She actually didn\u2019t keep that hidden from Sakurai at all, in fact, that is why her project is sure to be a success. She is working on cracking the DNA in order for her project to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she hated getting drooled on by Haruka, she actually quite loved her. The feeling that the giant was so big and powerful, and how she cannot be destroyed by any weapon the humans make, and how she can live forever thanks to her mutation. Truly an incredible girl, plus she was kind and happy to her. Also for a kid, her body was quite hot, with the bigger breast and butt, but Junko knows she has those assets for sure, and perhaps they could enhance those as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact of the matter is, Junko loved the fact that there is a giant monster just like her. Big, powerful, what not, she could only imagine herself being a towering giant like her, stomping and roaring across the city, all while wearing a sexy swimsuit, towering over the people. She also imagined ladies like her becoming big, making a new giant monster filed world. She even thought of the idea that somehow Dr. Shea Tetlor was doing with her kaiju, making it out of her own DNA and being a mother to her, as she couldn\u2019t have children of her own, but that was also a sign of weakness. She wanted to make a weapon that can rival or defeat Haruka, or something else, but Junko only wants one thing, the power to control kaijus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could do so much with it. Her mind kinda goes insane from all the thoughts that goes in her head. She could make another girl just like Haruka be a giant and become her rival. So many possibilities.

This was all done at night to avoid raising any suspicion from the superiors on the general side of things. Apparently the general wanted to meet up with Harukazilla in the person to discuss a huge matter with her. She didn\u2019t mind, as she always wanted a challenge to see what he can come up against her. She makes her way to the market location to see a helicopter with the general inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I am glad you made it here.\u201d He said, a bit grimly. He didn\u2019t wanted to drag Haruka into this mess, but he knows he needed to warn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s up, another project to beat me? Or really me to beat up?\u201d She teased jus as she places her hands on her hips of her bikini thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wanted to ask, is it true that you meet Junko sometime ago?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that lady, how do you know her?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is a scientist working on an upcoming Project Monster Hunter, and she told he that she got some DNA from you, do you recall doing something that let that happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka think for a second, and then remembered that during her photoshoot with her, she did drool on her by accident, which she did apologize her. \u201cWell I did drool on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell somehow she got a sample of your DNA and is cracking it. Didn\u2019t know you drool on her, but she got something out of it that concerns me. Your DNA, she is for some reason preparing to do something with that DNA from you. Meteorite energy something something, and I am concern for the people in this city, and that of the world. Look, I know you and I don\u2019t get along all that well, but... I am warning you that I think Junko is going to do something crazy with that DNA, I don\u2019t know what, but... you may not be the only one who is a giant.\u201d The general explained all that he could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that wouldn\u2019t be too bad.\u201d Haruka admitted, as she feels lonely as a giant. Even though she has friends and fans, she is still the only giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell true, but this is way more serious... I am thinking it will have massive consequences for the world if this were to get out.\u201d He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka then also thought of something with a smile. \u201cWell if you were looking for a way to challenge me, perhaps another monster like me could work, the irony of it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see the joke about that.\u201d The general joked a bit, seeing the irony of using a monster to beat a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?</span></div></div>",

If Junko's plans really did come to fruition, then it would be up to the two of them to neutralize the threat.

His mind was just playing tricks on him. She was too young to understand something like that. He pushed her words to the back of his mind and took off into the skies.

Sakurai had finally given her project the greenlight and now she could really get the ball rolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the elevator leading to the lower level of the military facility she couldn't help but revel in her own success. She still just couldn't believe how easy this all was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general practically eliminated himself from the equation with his constant failures, earning her instant favor in the eyes of the brass, and allowing her to pick up the pieces he'd left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kaiju girl Haruka was so innocent and trusting that she never once saw through her mask to see her true intentions. Getting that monsters DNA was, no pun intended, child's paly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking it was a lot more difficult she could admit, but in the end just like everything else she conquered it and turned it into a resource to further her own agenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko pressed the last button on the elevator panel and began to whistle as the doors closed. In about a minute or two she'd be able to make history with the project of the century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess wouldn't stand a chance against her latest and greatest creation. A monster to end all mounters. A creature with a burning hatred for the kaiju idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really was nothing like a steady diet of hatred and revenge to motivate someone. It was a fuel that could push people to do almost anything, even sell their soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator came to a stop with a ding and the doors began to slide open. Junko whistled a sweet whistle before walking down a long and dark corridor, the only light coming from the end of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde scientist entered the light and into her new lab. It was a large space filled with all kinds of computers, chemical equipment, and her own personal coffee machine. There were no staff members though, she didn't need the for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other thing  of not in this rather large space was the giant plexiglass window that lead into another equally large space. It was an all white room with nothing inside except for cameras, and small reinforced steel table. On said table was a black sheet covering the individual she'd chosen weeks in advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist supreme smirked before walking over to the glass window and placed a hand against it lovingly. \"It was time to finally put an end to all the waiting and make the magic happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko walked over to a nearby closet and pulled out a mask and two latex gloves. She then entered a mini fridge that housed a long test tube filled with an orange liquid. To think in her hands right now was the next step in human evolution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the power of god, in the palm of my hand.\" she whispered. She walked over to a table and opened a drawer. Inside was a syringe. A syringe that she used to extract the orange mixture. She too eyed this lovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held it close and entered the other room. She confidently waltzed over to the table with the black cloth and gently peeled it away to reveal the girl underneath. Junko smiled as her emerald eyes slowly flittered opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it time?\" she asked tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko nodded. \"It's time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl understood and looked down at the syringe. \"Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. This'll help you grow all big and strong.\" The blonde answered before gently taking the girl's arm. Carefully she found a vein, and pressed the needle inside. The girl winced slightly but didn't complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I finally get even with that girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko smiled and injected the fluid. \"You'll have your revenge and then some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe retracted the needle and pat the girl on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVengeance would be hers soon enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't wait for the slaughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen anger and revenge get married, their daughter is cruelty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh!

He'd been a part of Japan's hierarchy longer than Tanaka and Junko combined, so to say he'd pretty much seen everything there was to see would be an understatement of an understatement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there were those oh so rare moments that would make his his eyes pop. Just like the first time he laid eyes on the 160ft menace known as Haruka. That was a moment that would be etched into his memory forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he was seeing now though, would sit side by side with that memory. It had to be about 170ft tall if not more so. Looking up at this behemoth, he couldn't help but be rendered near speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as big as Harukazilla and covered head to toe in some kind of cybernetic armor. On the hands and feet were sharp silver gauntlets and shin guards, the torso was armored up as well with the a glowing reactor in the center, and the face was covered by what looked like a menacing silver kabuto. Overall the monster looked like a big metal samurai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Sakurai breathed from the other side of the glass. He'd lost track of how long he'd been staring at the girl in Junko's lab, and the blonde scientist was quick to tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stare too long now or you'll go blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to break Sakurai out of his trance and he did his best to regain his composure. \"Right. So what can you tell me about the subject and this... body armor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko smiled. \"Let's just say this girl right here has an axe to grind and will do whatever it takes to put Japan's resident kaiju idol in the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Sakurai nodded, leaving it at that. \"And the armor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The latest in cutting edge technology. We put roughly 207,724,000,000.00 yen into this cyber samurai armor. The metal is comprised Tungsten and outfitted with all kinds of cybernetics and Nano machines. There's also a few hidden weapons as well. The armor itself was tested against various weapons in our military and a couple of Tanaka's failed projects for good measure.\" Junko explained. \"This girl here... is the perfect war machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.\" Sakurai whispered. \"So what exactly are we naming our newest asset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked. This is first generation anti-kaiju weapon... Yagyu!\" Junko giggle. \"I kinda wanted a name to fit the whole samurai motif.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it. So how long before she's ready for actual deployment?\" Sakurai questioned as he watched the giant's head turned toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's ready whenever you see fit. She's been waiting a long time to get her revenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all Sakurai needed to hear.</span></div></div>",

The robot then started to walk out of the base and into the ocean, heading to Harukazilla's island. Sakurai was surely gonna get his vengeance now after Tanaka's continued failure to take her out. He then turns to Junko and smiled. \"I think your loyalty and hardwork has rewarded us with a weapon that is capable of taking out Harukazilla.\" he said to her before he then replies with some new papers in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?\" Junko asked just as she sees these papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well because of this project, I believe I have a thought of what I plan to do with Harukazilla.

Japan's resident Kaiju girl Haruka resolved to spend the entire day on her island's beach, simply watching the day go by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally the bubbly girl would be out and about in the city spending time with her friends and fans, but today she couldn't find it in her to indulge in these privileges. Instead she found herself curled up with her knees against her chest and a frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still couldn't shake that feeling in her stomach after her meeting with the general. That Junko woman had pretended to be her fan just so she could steal her DNA, and that scared her. For the first time in her life since becoming a giant she was terrified. What would Junko use her genes for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of other giant monsters and the world on fire came to mind. Sure she was young but she understood what pain and misery were. She'd seen them so many times as a giant when helping out the city or aiding the police. She'd seen death, destruction, and despair. They were some of her motivators to stay positive and help others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd told her parents about her inner strife and they did their best to stay optimistic for her. Maybe the military wouldn't do anything bad at all. Maybe there'd be other giants like her and they could all be friends. It was all sweet and innocent talk that bordered on childish, but it was still a nice thought all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite wanting something like that she knew deep down in her heart that that wasn't the case. If the army took her DNA it was because they wanted a weapon. She knew and the general knew it. That's why the man had gone out of his way to warn her of the coming danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about another girl just like her being used as a weapon of mass destruction made her feel sick. It made her feel guilty. Someone was going to be turned into a big gun that walks and it would be all her fault. All because she couldn't keep her drool in her mouth where it belong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kaiju girl sighed as she looked out at the sun slowly lowing itself from view. There was still light out and she was content to just sit here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she felt something was amiss. She turned her head to see smoke rising in the distance. \"Smoke?\" she questioned. Upon closer inspection she saw the black cloud was coming from...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened and she shot up to her feet. She began barreling through the forest, not caring about the trees she toppled or the bushes she crushed. A pit was forming in her stomach and it was only growing with every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!? Dad!?\" The giantess called as she burst through the foliage. What she saw made her breath hitch... fire! Fire everywhere! The forest was burning, her home was burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking the monster girl rushed into the inferno and began overturning any debris she came across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!? Dad!?\" she cried as she searched and searched, but so far found nothing. Tears were beginning to well up in her eyes as she grew more and more desperate to find any trace of her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was this happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she let this happen...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right here the whole time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts where soon interrupted by a horrible blinding light. It was so bright she actually threw her arms over her eyes. Then there was the sound that accompanied it, the sounds of grinding metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the light died down as well as the sun. The only light now was the burning fire around her and the light of the crescent moon. Haruka looked up to see a sight that nearly made her jaw drop and her legs tremble. A humanoid figure slightly taller than herself and covered in armor. There was also and ominous glowing circle in the center of their chest. They also had a helmet that obscured their face and eyes. All in all they looked like a big metal samurai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka gulped nervously... could this be--? \"W-who are you!? What have you done with my mom and dad!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal titan didn't answer, it just held out it's hand and let the shredded remains of meat fall from it's grasp. Haruka looked on in shock and horror as she put two and two together. This mechanized monster killed... her family!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a vicious roar of pain before without thinking, charging the killer robot. She only took about three steps before she was sent flying through the flames and into the side of a boulder. The monster girl let out a cry of pain and tried her best to sooth the pain coming from her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast hit her and it hurt. It actually hurt. She looked up at the beast with scared eyes as the flames dance behind it, giving it the appearance of a vile demon straight from the depths of hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally spoke, it's voice cold and mechanical... yet at the same time, familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time, Haruka. You've made my life a living hell and now I'm going to burn yours to ash. Prepare to die!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But if its a fight you want, then a fight you will get!\u201d She said just as she had to put the thought of her dead family at the moment and continue to focus at the threat at hand. Haruka charged forward and tried to charge at the giant metal samurai, but then the eyes of the helmet reacted, and then suddenly the robot grabs her arm and twists it, making Haruka roared in pain before the robot grabs her with the other hand by the chest and slams her into the mountain several times, bringing even more pain to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo predictable.\u201d The metal titan girl said just as she walks right up to a weakened Haruka. \u201cI saw that move coming from a mile away. Stay down if you know what is good for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!!!! Not after you killed my family!!!!\u201d Haruka roared just as she got back up and fired a beam from her mouth right at the metal robot girl, in which the eyes reacted again and the core from the chest fired a beam that hits hers, causing a stalemate for a few moments before the samurai\u2019s beam hits her. Haruka was taken back by the blast and was screeching in pain just as she was knocked to the ground. The metal samurai then stomps right over to the weakened Haruka and stomps her metal foot right on her chest, causing Haruka to growl in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWondering who is underneath the mask.\u201d She smiled, just before the helmet begins to disappear in a very machine like fashion to reveal the face. A face that Haruka knows all to familiar. Haruka was then in total shock. \u201cNo way.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was none other than the blonde girl that she gave the wedgie to, Yoshiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprised! This is payback for not just that wedgie, but also making me, one of Japan\u2019s most prized idols and popular people with powerful connections look like a fool!\u201d She smiled evilly just as she pulls out an energy sword and brings it up to her chest. \u201cNow this is payback for you ruining my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I am sorry about that wedgie, and how I made you look like a fool, but trust me, I had nothing to do with your life being ruined.\u201d Haruka said just as she pleas for her life, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really, well... let\u2019s put it this way... me and my family wanted revenge so badly not for just that incident, but also for the other ways that you have mocked us, which we will get into later, but for now, I think its time for you to rest, as you got a new purpose coming for you.\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell why did you kill my family, I never did that to you.\u201d Haruka cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let me put it this way.\u201d She said just as she grabs the meat once more again and brings it up to her. \u201cThe meat that was just a random animal, I just had you think it was your family. Don\u2019t worry, they are safe, but they are getting a good talking to by Sakurai and Junko about you. But for now, I think its time for you to sleep.\u201d Yoshiko responded just by punching Haruka\u2019s head 3 times, and then stomping her face. The young giantess was now motionless almost like a dead corpse. She has been knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshiko smiled in glee as she got her revenge. \u201cThat will teach you to mess with a family with powerful ties to the government, and besides, its fun being this big! I never thought about that.\u201d She smiled just as her speakers play right in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat job knocking out Haruka, now bring her back to base so we can start our next plan, and besides, I have a special reward for you when you get back.\u201d A Japanese sounding guy on the radio spoke. \u201cYes commander Sakurai.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka was then carried right by Yoshiko right off on the island, with Yoshiko using her cybernetic implants to fly. Boosters came right out of her feet and she flies into the air. She also carried Haruka with no issues at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the home base briefing room, Sakurai only had a smile on his face, as he saw the whole operation played out. Knocking out Haruka so he can do something to her later, and even kinda breaking Haruka\u2019s spirit a little by seemingly \u201ckilling\u201d her family at first to enrage her, but then revealing that they are alive. Then one of the soldiers then came in. \u201cSir, the parents of Haruka are here to discuss with you, also Junko and Tanaka are coming as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, time we had a little chat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2226717-Girlzilla-Giantess-Monsters-20/map/1141311111123\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive...</a> (Yoshiko reference)</span></div></div>",

One minute they were at home making dinner and then before they knew it they were suddenly jumped by some men in all black stating they were under arrest. Why? They hadn't committed any crimes as far as they knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they saw the logo's on the men's shoulders and the conversation they had with their daughter the night before came back to them. They weren't under arrest for any type of crime, they were being into custody so that the military could get to their beloved daughter. They didn't matter in the grand scheme of things at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the two were sat at a long dark table in a dimly lit room that looked more at home in a police station rather than a military base. No doubt the army was watching them through that tinted window. All of this made them feel sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken? I'm scared.\" Haruka's mother whispered. \"What do they want with Haruka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband held her close. \"I don't know Mako, I just don't know. But we have to stay strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words seemed to calm her down a little, but the worry didn't leave, not entirely. As a parent she'd never stop worrying, even if her daughter was large enough to chuck a tree for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair's moment unfortunately was interrupted by the sound of screeching metal. The duo turned towards the door to see four armed guards entering followed by the familiar faces of Sakurai, Tanaka, and... some blonde woman. The guards flanked all four corners of the room and Sakurai took a seat at the head of the table while Tanaka and Junko stood at his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen didn't know what was going on but he could already tell this wasn't going to be good. Mako on the other hand was quick to make her voice heard. \"Sakurai? Tanaka? Why are we here? Where Haruka? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka looked like he wanted to say something, but instead turned his head away with a grimace. Sakurai himself however looked more amused than anything else. The same went for the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to answer your questions in order. You're currently in the interrogation room at our B.L.A.C.K headquarters. It's actually quite different from the standard base you're used to. As for Haruka... she's currently in military custody. Lastly there's what's going on... I think that's pretty self explanatory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako's eyes widened in shock while Ken clenched his fists. \"Do explain anyway.\" he ground out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakurai sighed. \"I'm tired of explanations. Give them the run down, Junko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\" the blonde cooed. \"Your daughter is a threat to national security as well as a throne in our sides. I think Tanaka could attest to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man again said nothing as all eyes fell on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...\" Junko continued. \"Because of her immense size we had the general here engage her in battle trials to find the perfect counter measure for her in case she ever lost control, but alas he came up short like he always does. So all duties involving neutralizing your daughter were handed down to me. I am scientist supreme Junko, the head scientist of Project Monster Hunter 2.0.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Project Monster Hunter?\" Mako parroted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct!\" Junko cheered. \"After Tanaka last failure I was tasked by our glorious head, Sakurai with finding the perfect counter for your daughter. You see, you're daughters body is like that of a tank. Big, strong, and powerful. But unlike a tank she can think for herself and won't blow up when a few bombs fall. In essence, she's the perfect war machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to say you want to turn our daughter into some kind of weapon!?\" Ken snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko was unfazed. \"Got it in one. She could be the greatest wartime innovation since the creation of the automatic rifle or sub-machine gun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was outraged while Mako looked horrified. She couldn't understand it. How could this woman speaks so casually about another human being like a tool on a utility belt? How could she be so callus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Ken pointed. \"You said your name was Junko, right? That means you're the one that stole our daughter's DNA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone get the man a cigar. Yes, I did steal her DNA. It was so easy too. She just let me get into her mouth and gave me more than enough samples to put my project in motion. Then after a couple of months of work and planning I cracked her DNA and was able to unleash Project Monster Hunter 2.0.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean unleash!\" Mako questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Sakurai took the reigns. \"She means we created our very own monster with the DNA Haruka so generously provided, We are now in possession of our own Kaiju and she not only obeys our directives, but she also dominated your daughter in combat before brining her in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monster!\" Ken shouted, before he could get up he was bunted by a guard's rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken!?\" Mako cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now.\" Sakurai teased. \"We're all friends here... Tanaka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general looked at the parents with an unreadable expression and began. \"We're here to discuss your daughter's future as well as cut a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!? What deal!?\" Ken growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't have Haruka!\" Mako finally snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka sighed, showing for the first time how tired her was. \"Please just listen. Either way the military has your daughter and they're going to do what they want. So this could be beneficial for all of us...\" then guards raised their rifles. \"Or some of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko snapped her fingers and then door opened again with a scientist rolling in an old T.V. He placed a VHS of all things in the player and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko smiled at the woman's question. \"Watch. Then well make our offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of movie is this?\" Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakurai smiled before pressing play. \"An instant classic.\"</span></div></div>",

What they'd spent the last hour watching was an in depth video of the cyberization of Yoshiko. The way that poor girl kicked and screamed from all the scalpels a needles made them both feel sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's out of the way, we can finally discuss business.\" Sakurai began, not at all bothered by the gore that was once on screen. \"We want your daughter to join our latest creation to aid us in protecting Japan. With the two of them together we can ensure the balance of power will be forever tipped in our favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.\" Junko added. \"If you willingly sign your daughter over to us, not only will you be doing your country a great service, but we'll ensure that the two of you and any other offspring you may have will be set for life. A nice house by the water, a white picket fence, maybe a pet or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka didn't say anything, both Sakurai and Junko made him sick to his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say? Do we have a deal?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was floored. Just when he thought these bastards couldn't stoop any lower. They actually thought they could put a price tag on his daughter's life like a cheap toy. How fitting considering that's what they were treating her like. \"Never.\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" Junko inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said never!\" Ken growled. \"We'll never willingly sign her over to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako then made her own voice heard. \"That's right. You can't put a price tag on people's lives. Haruka is a person, not a weapon! She has a heart, she cares about the people around her, she just wants to make people smile. You all though, you all are just... evil!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka did his best hide his wince while Junko stared blankly at the couple. Sakurai on the other hand looked slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now. This is bigger than any one girl. This is about the future of Japan. We could build an entire empire that stretches from here to the end of the world. Our kaiju will revolutionize warfare. Haruka could become the greatest innovation since the sub-machine gun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was out of his seat before Sakurai could even blink. He went to throttle the man only to be slammed down to the floor by a guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken!\" Mako cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard aimed his rifle at the downed man. \"Try that again and it'll be the last mistake you ever make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastard!\" Ken seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakurai sighed. \"Why can't things ever be simple. We're trying to extend an olive branch here. No matter what you say we're going to cyberize your daughter and put her on the front lines. We were only being courteous by offering you compensation. But if you want to act like children then you'll have nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakurai nodded to Junk who nodded back. \"Guards, take aim. We're removing these two before they can become a problem later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair's eyes widened and even Tanaka looked stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards all raised their guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako jumped to her husband's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aim...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you ken.\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\" he whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka was panicking inside.

Everyone was now staring at the lone general with confusion and curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is it exactly that we need to stop?\" Sakurai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka was at a loss. He didn't really know, he just blindly acted on instinct. This is why it was important to crunch numbers and exhaust all possible scenarios. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, wouldn't it be prudent to execute these two now before they become a problem later?\" Junko added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weary couple flinched at the casual way the blonde scientist spoke of killing them. If it wasn't already clear this woman saw no value in their lives, it was completely confirmed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general didn't know what to do. He had everyone's attention. He'd temporarily staved off the slaughter of innocents. Now he had to find someway to keep the military from making a huge mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't kill them.\" he said, inwardly sweating bullets at his bold move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko raised an eyebrow. \"You still haven't answered as to why. These two spit in the face of our offer and will only become a nuisance later. Immediate termination is the best course of action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. Better to get them out of the way now and proceed with our plans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't good, Tanaka needed to find some way to persuade them. \"But if you kill them then we lose the best leverage we have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakurai looked amused now. \"Oh? Please enlighten us Tanaka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cyberization process doesn't guarantee full control of the kaiju.\" the general began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko looked offended. \"How dare you. My project is flawless! I had complete control over Yoshiko when we sent her after Haruka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents winced at that but the general didn't look deterred. \"Ah, but that's where your wrong. I did my own research as well as reviewed the footage and I have to say, you're not as in control as you say you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on the blonde's face was venomous. If looks could kill then Tanaka would be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During the battle, Yoshiko went off more than I think you would've allowed. Not to mention the things she was spewing and taunting Haruka with. She went out of her way to attack her in a more personal way than you'd ever be able to. If you were in control you would've immediately tried to capture her instead of beating her down. Admit it, Yoshiko resisted you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko looked read to claw the man's eyes out with her bare hands, but was held back by Sakurai. \"Please continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we have Haruka's parents in our grasp she won't even think about resisting. She'll bend the knee and do so gladly. We kill them and she has nothing left to lose. The most dangerous person in the world is the person with nothing left to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the room for a brief moment as everyone soaked in what Tanaka was saying. Junko's process was imperfect and the only way to obtain absolute loyalty was through emotional manipulation. Haruka's parents felt sick and Junko still looked pissed as ever. Sakurai on the other hand... clapped. He clapped and clapped as if he was witnessing a college graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Tanaka my boy. Very good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like what I'm hearing.\"</span></div></div>",

She notices she is laying on a flat table. \u201cCan\u2019t get out.\u201d She wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka was currently trapped in the lab room, only a much bigger room as this time they are doing an experiment on a giantess currently, but just as Haruka begins to wake up and noticed her surroundings, a speaker is then activated. \u201cHello Haruka.\u201d Said by a man\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCommander Sakurai, is this you, what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was about to ask you the same thing, but at the moment you are tied up in our lab. Well I am going to explain this all to you, so pay attention. You are charged with being a national security threat to our entire country, and quite frankly, the world for that matter.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy so? I never did anything wrong?\u201d She complained just as she struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I knew you would say that. But to put it like this, you are a 160ft tall young girl with dangerous powers that must be maintained, and for you to have win the people\u2019s blind hearts with your reckless actions and monster like style, just blinds al of them to the bigger picture. I had Yagyu knock you out and capture you for our little experiment that we are about to do to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d She asked, now scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first, let me make an offer.\u201d He said, and then right in front of Haruka came a screen, with her parents held hostage with a gun towards their head by the soldiers. \u201cThis, is your dilemma, you will agree to our terms here about being transformed into a cyber kaiju, in which we will have access and control to you at all times, and you agree to serve our country as our weapon, and perhaps we might make even more kaijus just like you. Or.... you can refuse, in which case we will... or actually... you will kill your parents right here and now, and don\u2019t bother trying to make any offers or resist us, its one way or the another, and I am sure that your parents will agree with this decision, knowing that it is you who now decides this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka was shocked right to her core. Sakurai has her parents at gunpoint, and is forcing her to agree to be turned into a cyber monster or risk her parents and her life. For once she doesn\u2019t know what she can do. Does she agree to this and save her family, or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know....\u201d she said in tears. \u201cPlease don\u2019t harm them, I will do anything for them.\u201d She cried out, heavily in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do we have a deal?\u201d Sakurai reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She said, giving up on resisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good... good.... I promise you, you will really become a monster now.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

The government built her the island when she transformed, and she has often lived there to ease the pain of the city being caused destroyed accidentally, and also to have some privacy as living near the city was surely gonna draw crowds to come see her. Right now she has a simple uneasy feeling, a feeling that kinda makes her a bit sick. Is it possible that Junko plans to use her DNA for her own gain, or something worse, maybe something good even. What\u2019s her guess on the matter, who knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, she heads in to a cave in the mountain on the island and enters it, following the lights to reach her big bed.

Something about a scientist named Junko somehow getting my DNA for some project that she is working on.\u201d Haruka explained to them, and they reacted a bit surprised, but also understandable because given her size and power, she is in a way an asset to the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know. You could have told us somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want y\u2019all to worry.\u201d Haruka said just as she sat down by their side.

I mean you are indestructible, and such.\u201d Her mother reacted, surprised that her giant daughter is afraid. \u201cMaybe they could be some good out of this. I always told you to look sometimes on the bright side of things. Especially when you are a kaiju.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but something just isn\u2019t right.\u201d Haruka added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can tell us.\u201d Her father added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, was doing some monster poses for the city, then the nice lady Junko who I meet not long ago came in, wanting a pose with me, something about eating her. Did the pose, somehow she was cover in my drool. Always hate that when it happens.\u201d She admits to them. Both her parents gave a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that pose, it happens all the time I assume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen the general talk to me on how she got my DNA from it, and is working on cracking it to make something something out of it. Well, like I said, I am afraid a little bit because what if she somehow uses that DNA sample for evil or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am thinking that will be just fine, besides, nothing can beat you. I mean you are a kaiju, and sometimes, you gotta let loose every once in awhile, and not let your worries get to you. Maybe they might make more like you, and perhaps you can start having friends that are just like you.\u201d Her mother said with some encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka think for a moment on that statement. Not knowing if she wants to be afraid of the idea of an evil Giantess like her, or the idea of there being more than one kaiju like her, and then she responded. \u201cMaybe you are right, I shouldn\u2019t be too scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where do we go from here now?</span></div></div>",

Now even though they are millions of women across the world, only few would become a kaiju, as their DNA structure and such had to match the approval to the DNA that Haruka had, which had the full strength of the meteorite. Safe to say, that several end up growing to massive height, and at first has caused mass confusion and destruction, leading to numerous deaths. Even Haruka responded surprised to all of this, now seeing that they are now more than one giant now living in the world beside her. They even have different powers as well, as not everyone ends up with the same power as Haruka, but they all have something in common, never aging, being nearly invincible to all human weaponry, and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko also ended up becoming a kaiju herself as well, and proclaims herself as the Queen of the Monsters. The Japanese army was incredibly pissed and angry, but at the same time, they were actually quite surprised that she was able to pull off such a major feet. Making more monsters, and even turning herself into one using Haruka\u2019s kaiju DNA. This resulted in a huge cover up which lead to the general quitting completely in disgust, knowing that he wanted to get rid of the monster, but now ended up creating even more monsters in the process as well. Now Japan has plenty of kaijus now, and as stated, not everyone became a monster, but at least a few for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the incident didn\u2019t stop there, it also spread across the world, mutating more women into kaijus. Within several years, the rain stops, but the damage is done, they are now plenty of kaiju sized women in the world.

Soon the world would end up adjusting to the kaijus\u2019 needs, but the kaijus also return the favor by providing them protection, entertainment, among other things. Let\u2019s just say the world end up transforming big time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least every country had at least one kaiju, but several like Japan as quite a bit, but the cities around the world along with the people got used to living with them. Some giantesses lived on islands, some lived in specialty made buildings in the city, some live in the mountains, some in the oceans somehow, and more. Cities were redesigned to adjust to the giantesses, but still allowed enough focus to let the giantess feel like they are towering beasts. It would be so much to explain in one go, but you can imagine for yourself how life truly goes in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo ensure that there was peace across the nations and giantesses, every country would hold a special Olympics known as the kaiju games. These games let the wome do what they do best, rampage and show that they are monsters to be contended with. Because of how some of the giantesses don\u2019t age at all, they are adjusted by ranks, the kids are like rank 1, teens rank 2, adults rank 3. Obviously the adults would get more mature like games, but the kids would get more chances to behave like giant  monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently Japan has became a haven for monsters to live in, having Haruka, Junko who is known as the Queen of Monsters, and also Haruka\u2019s good friend now, and many other kaijus.

Because she already had a strong connection to the people, it made sense that she be the one to represent the other giants when at big meetings or special events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army had also gone silent since Junko's plan. They were still around, but there presence was next to nil. Even Tanaka seemed to fall off the face of the earth which saddened the resident kaiju girl since she wouldn't be able to go head-to-head with his experiments anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, she just hoped wherever the former general was, he was doing alright. But one funny moment that did come out of all this was her own mother's reaction. She'd been out in the orange rain and thought she'd grow like the others... only to be left feeling disappointed. No growth for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman complained and complained and Haruka could remember laughing her head off when she made that pouty face of hers. Even her own father Ken found it hilarious. He would constantly tell her at least they could be small together. Needless to say he slept on the couch a lot more now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brought everything back to Haruka who was lounging on the beach of her island. Today was her day off from all her other obligations and she free to basically do whatever. \"Hmm? I wonder what I'm gonna do today?\"</span></div></div>",

We will go over each of the 3 ranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel 1: Obviously the young children in appearance under 13. They are known as the Level 1 kaijus. Level 1 kaijus will have some of the most destructive jobs, like entertainment and demolition stuff. They tend to be much more active, playful, and kaiju like in their energy. Let\u2019s be fair, just because they are in one level doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t mature, they can be, but as level 1 monsters, they tend to get the most destructive kaiju like jobs. More details will be ironed out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel 2: 13-18 teenagers will be higher than level 1, but not quite at level 3. Here they are given more jobs, like watching over level 1s to make sure they aren\u2019t too reckless, protecting the city and enforcing the law, among other things. They also can do level 1 stuff as well being kaijus, but its also rare for level 1 kaijus to do anything higher than a 2, more serious jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel 3: This is where Junko is, she and level 3s are adults who have the most powerful over the other levels.  They oversee everything and has all the perks of the kaijus levels. They are also involved in government affairs and oversees a city\u2019s protection. This is where things get serious here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which level kaijus will you make.</span></div></div>",

So far the day had been rather slow and she hadn't seen much action on the streets. In fact the most vile thing she'd seen all day was a purse snatching, and even then the thug didn't get far. He gave up the second he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense, after all who in their right mind would want to get into a fight with a 68ft woman? The answer, a lot of people at first. They were either very brave or very stupid and Gwen was inclined to believe the latter. They had to be if they believed a few idle threats and bullets would work on her. If anything the petty resistance only served to annoy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't deny the thrill of taking down criminals and the cheers from the people thanking her for her service. Service she wasn't getting paid for by the way. Oh such was the tragic life of a superhero. Although Gwen guessed she couldn't really call her life tragic. Especially since she liked what she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that accident at the chemical plant she'd been rendered a 68ft woman in a big city. A city brimming with crime and criminals that needed to be taken down. So after giving it some thought she dawned her mask and bikini and became a Kaiju style superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little getting used to at first as she would accidently cause some property damage, but at least she took down the bad guys. Hearing the people cheer for her and the thanks she revived from the chief of police, how could she not continue? The mayor even put a division together to pay for property damage so long as she got the bad guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly she could say her life was good. \"Well there's no use standing around here.

Much more feral and monstrous.<br>\r\nClothes: Pink bra and panties<br>\r\nSide: Good, but there is a huge rivalry with Japan, so somewhat neutral also<br>\r\nBackground story: Koyukizilla isn\u2019t really a human at all other than appearance. She is a pure on kaiju, with dna from a human being up-merged with the meteorite fragment that hit somewhere in the desert. It wasn\u2019t long after the world knew about Haruka, so U.S. wanted to make a monster themselves but one they can control. That is where someone went Dr. Frankenstein and use human cloning (weird sci-fi shit) and the meteorite energy to create a young girl kaiju. The test was a success, and their monster was made. The U.S. did a lot more experimenting with the girl, like using a chip inside of her to control her, and have her train in being a monster and a weapon. And it was a massive success, but there is always concern that she is not really human, and the lady who gave her DNA to use to make her. Dr. Shea Tetlor, bonds to her like a mother as she couldn't Have children on her own, and wants her to be more of a true kid or what not. Koyukizilla bonds with her a lot, and actually spends time with her, learning to be more human in spite of her downside while keeping her monster side in check. Start learning human life, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional info: Big one, she cannot talk at all. She can only roar, growl, snort, etc. she is much more monstrous and feral, but around certain people, she is a sweet gal. Given she is a weapon often use for missions, she is extremely destructive. Enemies fear her for sure, as nothing can stop her. Lives in the desert at Area 51.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother Pic: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/megaman/images/6/60/Hope_Stelar.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090603035554\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mega...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig rivals to Japan as U.s perfected their weapon mostly</span></div></div>",

This creature is none other than Koyukizilla, a military experiment that is created by the U.S. military thanks to the use of some female\u2019s DNA, a human cloning machine (sci-fi stuff), and through using the spare samples of the energy from the meteorite and from understanding Japan\u2019s kaiju Haruka. Koyuki is only like 3 years old, but has the mentality of an older girl for sure, and a body of the most curvy 9-10 year old girl imaginable, but the big shocker is that she is extremely feral and monstrous. She was programmed and taught how to be a monster, and is controlled by the U.S. using computer technology among other things, but Koyukizilla always delivers her objectives brilliantly, and leaves nothing in her wake alive if they are an enemy, and anyone she spares are always in pure terror, and that is what this place is about to suffer when she arrives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Wallace and Spike, they continue to see the guarding through the time being, with some more banter between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, ever heard of Haruka by any chance? The monster girl in Japan?\u201d Spike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, that\u2019s actually a creature I hope we would never have to endure.\u201d Wallace added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for sure yeah, because from what we are told and what not, she is indestructible to any sort of weapon that man can throw at her, but also for a kid quite beautiful.\u201d He responded also, a bit embarrassingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell true, given the fact that DNA whatever did mess with her body other than the size. Still a sight to behold, and I wonder, what if we got to meet a creature like that in sight.\u201d Wallace then said in the process, and then he started to see the waters shifting very violently, and this started getting him worried. \u201cUh... Spike... you might want to look at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what...\u201d he asked when he looked at the ocean and noticed the waters shifting violently also, and then suddenly a huge wave of water erupted from the area, and for a few moments, the water was so blinding that they couldn\u2019t make note of what being it was. After a few moments, the being revealed to be a towering 160ft bra and panty (pink) clad black haired red eye preteen with the cutest body imaginable. Her towering presence cast a huge shadow over the two soldiers, who looked at her in awe and fear. The giant girl then gave out a growl, looking down viciously at them before given out a very Godzilla like roar. The wave of wind from her roar would knock the soldiers off their feet and send them screaming in terror just as she uses her fire breath to burn them alive, along with some of the buildings nearby. At that point, the base was completely on high alert, and everything would be sent there to stop Koyukizilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne interesting question, Koyukizilla smiles and smirks, knowing she got this mission in the bag. But what is the Mcguffin that she is securing?</span></div></div>",

Leumya\u2019s power goes way beyond that. For starters, she can adjust her height at will, all the way to a max of 220ft tall. She also has all of the powers that both Koyuki and Haruka has, but actually has full mastery of her abilities. She is also seen to absorb electricity for food, and can adjust her body\u2019s clothing and skin to adapt to any situation. Reportedly they are many strange new powers for her to discover, but that is the basics of it for now.<br>\r\nClothes: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.donmai.us/sample/59/70/sample-597060d7c5b5c8362848a1aef08a410f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.donmai.us/sample/59/70/sampl...</a><br>\r\nSide: She is good, but also more on the neutral side on some other ends, as you will see<br>\r\nBackground story: Leumya Temitazi is a scientist and soldier at the K.M.U. Kaiju Management Unit, that was formed by the world governments in the wake of both Haruka and Koyuki being made. Leumya trained hard to be in the program as she has seen the failures of the Japan trying to contain Haruka (remember she isn\u2019t evil), and the U.S. taming of Koyukizilla, a kid who was barely a kid age but has the body of a 10 year old and a mindset of one so young. While she knows those monsters aren\u2019t evil by any means, she does feel that they need to be controlled so that they aren\u2019t used as weapons, or become a danger to the public. Also, she wants to make them become more like heroes as well, and have them not be seen as monsters to the public, as if more could be it there because of those meteors, then she felt that something should be done to get them to learn what they are doing and to use their powers for better, and to also find a way to contain them if they go berserk. She also wants to become a kaiju herself, so she can become a superhero that the world needs, and feels that she can do it better, and one day she was selected for testing on the meteorite energy transfer. It hasn\u2019t worked on men, but she was a female and the first older one to succeed in the testing, and then sum. They were flaws with Koyuki and Haruka, as they only took a fragment of the energy from it when they absorbed it, Leumya absorbed every last bit of it. Of course, that means the transformation, but it also means that there is way more to Leumya than they know. She also learns she can change her clothing looks at will, absorb electricity for food, and that is in addition to the usual kaiju powers. There is much more to Lily, but let\u2019s just say that the world has its first anti-hero, if not evil, but first kaiju police.<br>\r\nAdditional Info: She works in various cities, but usually lives in New York City. Given her abilities, she can adjust her height at will, and is very well respected for not destroying stuff recklessly and is seen as a good hero among the community. She does the superhero stuff of stopping criminals, helping people in need, and what not, but she also wants to stop Koyuki from being used as a weapon, and to start making Haruka more aware of the damages that she causes unintentionally. She also does lots of testing for the government and other stuff. Leumya wants to be seen as a hero, and not just some monster, though she has an exception for the rule with children, as they are her biggest fans. She is a friend with Haruka and Koyuki also, but also a teacher to them. Btw, she went into the forest immediately after high school with high grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is set in the Haruka and Koyuki universe, and its more serious than the two, as its an older giantess and actually has more adult stuff in it.

Only this time something was different, there was an air of seriousness in the meeting hall that was never present before. Currently she was sat at a desk with someone she'd become really familiar with over the years...Agent Mullen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was near emotionless and had a layer of slime to him that honestly made her want to puke, but at the same time he was trusted enough to get whatever task assigned to him completed. Right now though he had a deathly serious look on his face and seemed to be irritated about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy his side were two different monitors that were currently displaying static. The whole setup could be described as odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeumya was broken from her thoughts when the agent's watch began to buzz. When it did, the two T.V Monitors came to life. On one monitor was Dr. Shea Tetlor, the handler for Koyukizilla. And other was none other than General Tanaka from Japan. That came as a surprise consider the U.S and Japan were currently in a rivalry for Kaiju weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, this meeting can now begin.\" Agaent Mullen began. \"Can the two of you here me?\" he asked to the monitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai.\" the general nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loud and clear.\" said Dr. Tetlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I trust you both remember Ms. Temitazi?\" Mullen reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth guests nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good.\" Mullen whispered. \"Now it's time to get started. The reason for this meeting is discuss a top secret mission between Mega-Lily, Harukazilla, and Koyukizilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Leumya questioned. This was new. The other's seemed to share the sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A top secret mission with three Kaiju?\" Dr. Shae gasped. \"Out of the question! Three Kaiju together would be too destructive and near impossible to keep under wraps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed!\" Said the general. \"Too destructive, the world couldn't handle that much power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but it's going to have to if the information that's come across my desk is legit.\" Mullen stated gravely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What information?\" Leumya dared ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMullen paused as everyone waited in anticipation. \"A brand new Kaiju has been born!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was suddenly in an uproar. \"What did you say!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Mullen stated. \"The information that's come across my desk says as much. A brand new Kaiju has been born, stronger than anything we've ever known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeumya was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god.\" Tanaka breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brand new Kaiju.\" Shae repeated. \"Who gave birth to this new monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dark division somewhere in Thailand. Apparently they've been working on this project for years to compete with the Japan and America Kaiju arms race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How powerful?\" The general asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big?\" Shae asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know that either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it look like?\" Leumya finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Female.\" Mullen answered. \"That's all we do know. We don't have any pictures or data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too little to work with. For all we know this could be some kind of ploy.\" Tanaka sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking general, but this is too big to ignore. If this is real then we're all doomed unless we combine our resources.\" Mullen argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in.\" Shae said firmly. \"If this thing is real then we're not taking any chances. Koyukizilla and I are in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I!\" Leumya added. \"I'll fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well general...? How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man grunted. \"Fine! We'll send Harukazilla  in! But this better not be a trick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. You all will be rewarded for this.\" Mullen sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better.\" Tanaka growled. \"We'll drop Harukazilla off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis monitor went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see to it Koyukizilla gets there as well.\" Shae smiled before her monitor went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get comfortable Mega-Lily. You're team's on there way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Junko had always excelled at her courses when she was young as she wanted to be a scientist one day who can help make the world a better place, but soon when Haruka came into light as a kaiju, her motivation changed. Initially wanted to take her out, she actually kinda became a fan of her in a way, admiring the giant child\u2019s immense power and size, and figured that she would want to become just like her in order to showcase her dominance. Cue Monster Hunter 2.0 project, which involved her getting a sample of Haruka\u2019s DNA and causing the rain to turn orange that would turn many women with acceptable DNA compatibility into monster sized girls like her. The project was a success, and even she transformed into a giantess as well because of it. She loved the extension of power that she has so much, that she decided to become the Queen, but the question is, will she be good, or evil. She wanted to make a world of giant monsters as she has always loved monster movies, and feels that Haruka was the perfect monster that she dreamed of being.<br>\r\nAdditional info: She loves her size and power so much, that she acts like a giant monster ever chance she gets, roaring and stomping all around, and kinda has a soft spot for children, small and giantess a like. Becoming a kaiju herself gave her a child like fun that she always dream of, so maybe she can be a hit with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne big choice here, depending on which kaiju world you select will decide her mood. Will she be good, or evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrange Rain: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2226717-Girlzilla-Giantess-Monsters-20/action/view/chapter_map/114131111113331\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive...</a></span></div></div>",

For a girl her age, she had a body that most people would die for, with big breasts and a cute butt. Often wears an ancient form of a lavender two piece swimsuit, but has been seen wearing royal dresses (not the best in describing appearances)<br>\r\nPowers: Water, fire, earth, wind, and lightning manipulation, impervious to all weapons, also a spirit maiden with mastery of those powers, user of magic, immortality, and obviously height changing<br>\r\nSide: Neutral definitely, as she had a godhood complex<br>\r\nBackground Story: Note that this is a fictional alternative timeline. Sayuki Maysakuri was the daughter of the Japanese emperor Matoks Maysakuri during the feudal era where their family ruled Japan and ensure peace and prosperity for all. Sayuki one day came down with a mysterious illness and no one knows who it was, but all they knew is that Matoks thought this was an attempt by his enemies to sabotage their rule. So he ordered his army to defeat them and bring them to justice. When that was done, turns out that there was a witch who was among them who knows of the cure for his daughter. Matoks was willing to do anything to save her, and accepted this. The daughter was cured, but soon the effects of her magic would take into place. When she was young, she would tower all of those and developed strange abilities. The people at first feared her, but the family refused to give her up, and stayed with her until her 12th birthday. The 12th birthday would soon be a horrifying reveal. The witch comes back and reveals that she has given her goddess like abilities with her magic, and that on her 12th birthday, she would be forever cursed with her abilities, never being able to age past her appearance. She would forever be cursed to become a giant goddess with powers. The father then ordered the witch executed for cursing his daughter, but the witch tells him on her execution that it can never be undone, she will outlive all of them, and her whole family would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know, the witch was right. Young Sayuki would soon be the only one in the family left after many years, but during that time the people, who became feared of her powers and abilities, and her immense size, would soon bow to her as their goddess, out of fear that she might do something to do. She didn\u2019t want this life, but she ultimately took it. She would soon be the Queen of Japan, ruling it to current day, protecting its people from war, and soon she would have to deal with problems from the other nations on her rule of the country. Some says that she is a dictator, some says that she is a kind and just queen. Its all up for the writer to decide, but one thing is certain, she rules Japan.<br>\r\nAdditional Info: During her years, she came to enjoy being a goddess and having power over the people, so that is why with the neutral route, she could have some fun if she wishes. She loves the feeling of people bowing before her, but is a kind person when she needs to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where to start?</span></div></div>",

Tonight was the Maysakuri Festival. It was a tradition that was started way back when when Emperor Matoks first born came into the world. On this special day once every year, everyone would host a festival in his daughter's honor and dress their best. It was a time of smiles, games, food, and worship.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alright, UltimateGiantess here. I was the original creator of the Girlzilla Giantess Monsters, and just recently looking at what I am doing lately with my stories and what not. I figured that it was time that this story got rebooted and I am now gonna start off with a new clean slate for the story here. So here it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a disclaimer here, they will be children characters as the option is allowed, but they will be rules to prevent total going of overboard for these characters. Please don\u2019t take it personally, I am just trying to keep the few fans out there who want to add this type of stuff going, There.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically what happens if you take the giant monster kaiju stuff and you mix in the giantess stuff. Well you get Girlzilla, Giantess Monsters. Here the girls can rampage cities, or defend them. Or try to live a normal life. I know I have a similar story to this with A Typical Life of a Kaiju Giantess, but here the options are all out, you can defend or destroy. Want good, want bad, or something in between, you got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow time for the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Male Giants<br>\r\nNo sexual stuff or nudity for kids under 13, they have to be at least in a swimsuit in that case. Any older is allowed to have nudity and heavier sexual acts.<br>\r\nNo scat or toilet stuff<br>\r\nNo unbirth<br>\r\nMake sure you follow the format closely and make sure that your writing is nicely detail and at least have a paragraph or two, fail and I either edit or delete your stuff.<br>\r\nHave fun, and they can be more than one giantess.<br>\r\nAlso, for the first time ever.... furries and robots are allowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is the format<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName:<br>\r\nKaiju Name:<br>\r\nAge:<br>\r\nHeight:<br>\r\nAppearance:<br>\r\nPowers:<br>\r\nClothes if anything:<br>\r\nSide: Good, evil, or neutral<br>\r\nBackground story:<br>\r\nAdditional info:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember to add to these stories as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife of a Giant Kid/Kidzilla: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2226082-Life-of-a-Giant-KidKidzilla\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2226082-Life-of-a-Giant-K...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Prison: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2225005-The-Tiny-Prison-a-new-type-of-prison\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2225005-The-Tiny-Prison-a...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Ruler: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2224922-Goddess-Ruler-A-GTS-Story\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2224922-Goddess-Ruler-A-G...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigantic Lolis: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2222635-Gigantic-Lolis-a-SSR-spin-off\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2222635-Gigantic-Lolis-a-...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Daibijin Interactive: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2219621-The-Daibijin-Interactive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2219621-The-Daibijin-Inte...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChild/Preteen Giantess: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2219542-ChildPreteen-Giantess-Story\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2219542-ChildPreteen-Gian...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1881854-Chantal-The-Dragoness-Giantess\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1881854-Chantal-The-Drago...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Typical Life of a Kaiju Giantess: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1845671-ATypical-Life-as-a-Kaiju-Giantess\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1845671-ATypical-Life-as-...</a></td>",
