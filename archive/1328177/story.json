The story takes place after Naruto fails his previous mission to get a lead on Sasuke. He is angry that when ever he comes so close, something always screws it up. He is very angry with himself but he refuses to give up. Naruto fails to realize that going after Sakura as a love interest is impossible and can never be done but there is only one person who can break him from his cycle and her name is Hinata</span></div></div>",

He rarely gets a good comment by Sakura unless he turns the tide of battle. She also scolds him a lot on stuff that happens by coincidence by punching him in the face and he barely gets respect until she starts to be a little nicer to him but not enough to like him. Naruto is constantly held down by fate's weight and no matter how high he jumps, he'll never reach his goal however fate has something else in store for him. Hinata just so happens to like Naruto but can't express her feelings because whenever he is too close, she faints on the spot. Naruto has never noticed her feelings until one day... </span></div></div>",

He suddenly gets this strange dream of Hinata coming up to him and revealing her feelings for him. She then proceeds to tell him about how her feelings came about and that she wants to be with him forever. She then removes her clothing and says \"You can do anything you want with me.\" Naruto was not only surprised, he was dumbfounded. He never realized that there was a person who liked him right next to him. Naruto wakes up in a sweat and then says \"I have to find her.\" Naruto ran out of his house even though it was pitch black. He looked around for Hinata and he couldn't find her anywhere. Naruto was about to give up but then he remembered one place he hadn't check. He then rushed there to find the girl he was looking for.

She felt the seal on her stomach rise\u2026she wondered if it was because she was close to him, like Orochimaru-sama said.<br>\r\nTayuya remembered losing to that fucking Shadow-nin. If she ever saw that bastard again he was a dead man\u2026<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t sacrificed everything in Sunagakure just to die in some kami forsaken Konoha forest. She left Suna to become strong\u2026to get away from her brothers and her overbearing sister. She was here to prove to them all how powerful she could really become\u2026and one day she would show Suna just what they lost by ostracizing her.<br>\r\nTayuya wasn\u2019t used to owing anyone anything\u2026she remembered when Sakon saved her life from that Taki-nin. She had had to wait nearly a year to pay him back, she didn\u2019t owe anyone except Orochimaru-sama. She had given him her freedom\u2026he had given her power.<br>\r\nShe put her hand on the doorknob to her room\u2026the Konoha-nin had been moved there; it wasn\u2019t Sasuke-sama. She wondered who it was\u2026who had sacrificed everything for Sasuke-sama to stay in Konoha?<br>\r\nOrochimaru-sama hadn\u2019t even seemed angry about losing Sasuke-sama\u2019s kekkei genkai. Then again Kimimaro, fucking bone bastard, was alive again\u2026all the sound five ninjas were alive again.<br>\r\nShe opened the door\u2026while she was grateful to whoever this Leaf-nin was, she didn\u2019t like being a babysitter. Orochimaru-sama had given all of his remaining elite guards a week to rest, she had looked forward to some sleep and training but baby sitting someone\u2026<br>\r\nTayuya opened the door to her candlelit room\u2026so it was that loud-mouthed blonde\u2026he was a Jinchuriki? He had a lot of friends for a Jinchuriki\u2026everything Tayuya knew from her experiences told her Jinchuriki were loners.<br>\r\nBut then again if Orochimaru-sama was going to save them from Akatsuki\u2026<br>\r\nHer room looked just like she remembered it\u2026stone walls, minimal furniture, candlelight\u2026wonderful. She looked around a corner and saw her clawfoot tub with it\u2019s faucet was still there, along with the washbowl and mirror and the small toilet.<br>\r\nShe looked over and saw the Blonde was sweating and convulsing\u2026according to Kabuto he was weak from giving so much of his demonic chakra and that combined with the Cursed Seal\u2026<br>\r\nHe was in her bed\u2026sweating everywhere\u2026fucking kid\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cYou little bastard\u2026\u201d she cursed under her breath. Not that her room was fit for royalty or anything but it was hers\u2026she liked the claw foot tub in her bathroom, her chest of drawers, her weapons... And this cute kid could die on her bed\u2026she didn\u2019t just say that.<br>\r\nThe covers were pulled down so that he was \u201cprotected\u201d below his navel. The seal she had on her stomach was also on his\u2026except it was flared red. He had her Cursed Seal\u2026where his left shoulder met his neck\u2026it also had a circular design over it, like an interwoven crown of thorns.<br>\r\nThis kid was weak\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Hey kid\u2026\u201d She was being a shithead and she knew it. Hell she had bit through the stick she had put in her mouth when Orochimaru-sama gave her the Cursed Seal. She shook him awake\u2026<br>\r\nHe opened one eye\u2026she saw he had goosebumps all over his body. He was doing better than she had\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t die on my bed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nHe took a shuddering breath, she thought he might have chuckled\u2026Tayuya couldn\u2019t believe he was able to stay conscious.<br>\r\n\u201cT-this\u2026I-is\u2026y-your\u2026r-room?\u201d He managed to grit through the pain.<br>\r\nTayuya nodded. She went over to her drawers\u2026she lit some more candles and pulled over her rickety wooden chair, if she was going to have to baby-sit... Hell this kid would need at least a day\u2026possibly two or more, and when he woke up out of Cursed Seal coma he was going to be super pissy.<br>\r\n\u201cS-So\u2026y-you\u2019re\u2026a-alive\u2026then?\u201d He was drawing, short quick breaths and speaking in short spurts. She was so surprised he was able to talk\u2026that she didn\u2019t scold him for sounding like a retarded baka\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026apparently Orochimaru-sama was able to use your demon chakra to bring me back. I guess\u2026\u201d She scoffed. \u201cI owe you.\u201d She waited for the inevitable, idiotic macho bullshit she always got from the men in Orochimaru-sama\u2019s ranks.<br>\r\n\u201cY-You\u2026don\u2019t\u2026o-owe\u2026m-me\u2026anything.\u201d His speech was improving, he was already getting closer to taking full breaths. If Kabuto-sempai was right, this kid had only had his seal for eight hours\u2026 \u201cI-I wanted to d-do that\u2026\u201d His eyes clenched for a moment and he let out a long huff.<br>\r\nThis kid was strange\u2026his shaggy blonde hair was everywhere. He was a runt\u2026probably small downstairs to match.<br>\r\nTayuya wasn\u2019t a whore\u2026but she had slept around. Mostly with various ninja who caught her eye and weren\u2019t bullshit trash ninja\u2026but none of the Sound Four. Gross. It was really an empty act\u2026all it really did was scratch an itch, nothing more.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you wanted to please Orochimaru-sama?\u201d she said offhandedly. She took off her beanie and ran her fingers through her hair. She wondered when he would pass out from the sheer pain wracking through his body.<br>\r\nHe shook his head\u2026he took a quick breath. Tayuya noticed his beautiful blue eyes\u2026she didn\u2019t just say that.<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026I don\u2019t l-like to see people die, e-especially when it\u2019s p-partly m-my fault.\u201d<br>\r\nTayuya looked at him\u2026this kid had went to get the Uchiha back, what did he mean it was his fault?<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThe kid was out\u2026Tayuya hadn\u2019t noticed the whiskery scars on his face. Probably an influence of his demon\u2026she wondered which one was sealed within his body. Orochimaru-sama had already said he was going to use the \u201cNew\u201d Sound Four to take on Akatsuki\u2026they were soon going to have special training in order to handle the S-Ranked ninja. Tayuya was actually excited\u2026three years of growth would be good for her.<br>\r\nShe winced\u2026the chakra medicine was already kicking in. Orochimaru-sama\u2019s medicine\u2026it was going to permanently triple her own chakra stores\u2026<br>\r\nTayuya studied her roommate\u2026she was apparently going to have to take care of him for a while. She hoped Kabuto-sempai could find him his own room\u2026she didn\u2019t like him here\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cI want my bed back\u2026\u201d she said out loud to the unconscious Leaf-nin.<br>\r\nTayuya fell asleep in the chair\u2026soothed to sleep\u2026she was alive\u2026<br>\r\nWhen Tayuya awoke\u2026he wasn\u2019t there. Her bed was warm\u2026<br>\r\nShe got up and walked over to the bathroom\u2026she remembered Sakon saying he pissed blood when his infection spread.<br>\r\nThe Blonde was nowhere in her room\u2026as she came out of her bathroom, she realized she stepped on her undersheet. What?<br>\r\nTheir was one of her two pillows on the floor\u2026this didn\u2019t make any sense. That small runt had put her in the bed and slept on the floor? What the fuck was wrong with this Leaf-nin.<br>\r\nHe had obviously taken a bath and cleaned up but the toilet seat was down and her tub was spotless.<br>\r\nTayuya just shook her head and crawled back into bed. She was off this week\u2026she was alive\u2026sleep called to her.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n\u201cUchiha Sasuke\u2026\u201d Tsunade said. The heavily bandaged, but walking Uchiha looked at her. His left eye was covered along with both legs and arms and chest. Tsunade smiled to herself, she was dehydrated from all the tears she had cried over the Blonde leaving, but at least he had beat the hell out of the Uchiha.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to clear you of the charges the Elder Council had brought against you\u2026Treachery, Dereliction of Duty, etc\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nUchiha Sasuke nodded. He did look pathetic mummified in those linen bandages\u2026Tsunade had never seen Uchiha pride take such a huge blow\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cYou owe Kakashi and Sakura big time\u2026if they hadn\u2019t pleaded your case I was more than willing to shove your ass in prison for a year or the rest of your life.\u201d<br>\r\nThe Uchiha again nodded\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026you\u2019re going to do something for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nHe looked up at her\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cI understand why you made the decision you did\u2026I\u2019ve already arranged for Jiraiya to train you, a Sannin, for at least two years. You\u2019re going to need it\u2026because it\u2019s your sole responsibility to get Naruto back.\u201d<br>\r\nSasuke looked up at her\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cThis comes even before Itachi\u2026do you hear me? I\u2026\u201d Tsunade held back tears\u2026 \u201cwant\u2026him\u2026back. I don\u2019t care what you do\u2026I don\u2019t care how you do it\u2026even if it causes a political disaster get him back\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cItachi\u2026\u201d The Uchiha said firmly.<br>\r\nTsunade sighed. \u201cThe closer you get to Naruto\u2026is the closer you get to Itachi. Your brother is after him remember\u2026Naruto is your best bet at getting to Itachi. But you\u2019re not ready for Itachi yet anyway\u2026you would have to be as strong as Jiraiya just to attempt it.\u201d<br>\r\nSasuke looked away\u2026<br>\r\nTsunade looked at him\u2026she really couldn\u2019t understand everything Sasuke went through. That was Naruto\u2019s job\u2026Kakashi had told her how lonely Naruto had been when he was little.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get that strong then\u2026\u201d Tsunade saw the Uchiha clench his fist that wasn\u2019t in a sling.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already informed Kakashi of this and he plans on forming a team platoon that will go after Naruto. You will be a part of that team\u2026Kakashi didn\u2019t want you but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nSasuke nodded. \u201cHai\u2026is there anything else?\u201d<br>\r\nTsunade hated this kid. \u201cNo\u2026dismissed.\u201d<br>\r\nSakura sat outside of the office, she kept pulling on her skirt\u2026her own nervousness and denial eating away at her from the inside out.<br>\r\nShe felt so guilty\u2026and it wasn\u2019t for the right reasons.<br>\r\nShe wanted to tell herself that she missed Naruto\u2026that she cared that he was gone. She wanted so desperately do believe that she was sad he went so far to keep his promise\u2026<br>\r\nBut she wasn\u2019t\u2026.she had never been happier in her life. Sasuke followed her around constantly\u2026and always wanted to train with her, to be with her. Last night it had rained and he wouldn\u2019t let her leave the Uchiha Mansion to go home\u2026he had made her sleep in his bed while he slept on the floor.<br>\r\nShe knew it was probably because she was really the only friend he had left. None of their other peers even spoke to the Uchiha anymore\u2026the ostracized him. Shikamaru had even said to his face that Konoha got the short end of the stick in Naruto\u2019s pact with Otogakure. But even though it might all be empty she loved the attention\u2026<br>\r\nSasuke actually spoke to her a lot now\u2026he had even held her hand the other day\u2026<br>\r\nSasuke shut the door to the Hokage\u2019s office and looked over at her. The injured Uchiha smiled a small smile\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to jail\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nSakura ran over and hugged him tightly\u2026he let out a grunt.<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine Sakura\u2026\u201c<br>\r\nThere was a silence and Sakura smiled at him\u2026glad she wouldn\u2019t have to visit her crush in prison.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you home.\u201d Sasuke said.<br>\r\nSakura went over and linked arms with Sasuke\u2019s uninjured one\u2026she nearly exploded inside when she saw him blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But then again, I\u2019m not displeased either. Lee, as fond of the little green bundle of sunshine that he is, he\u2019s not my type. Don\u2019t you dare say it\u2019s because I believe him to look strange. That\u2019s not it. I deeply admire his hard working attitude, his strength, but believe it or not..He\u2019s dull. Okay I know that sounds really stupid and ignorant since my other teammate is Neji, but he really is dull. All he ever talks about is training, Sakura, beating a genius, and did I already mention training? Don\u2019t even get me started on Neji. If you think Neji is a silent calm collected warrior, you\u2019re as wrong as seeing your grandparents go at it in your own bed. Don\u2019t ask. I already burned the sheets\u2026 Back to Neji. He\u2019s not as quiet as you think. He\u2019s got one hell of a mouth. He has nothing against putting down others harshly. His sarcastic tongue has even made Gai-sensei bow his head in shame. He\u2019ll pick you apart. Shredding you piece by piece. Half of his battles he won through his mouth. That Byakugan of his even makes it easier for him to tear his opponent\u2019s ego to ribbons. I\u2019ll admit it though. I did have a crush on him. Can you blame me? Top of the class, hansom, fiercely strong\u2026 In the beginning I went so far as deluding myself saying every harsh word from Neji to Lee was to spur Lee to work harder. I was such a fool. But he\u2019s mellowed out some. Ever since his fight with\u2026.Naruto. The short little blondie resting aginst my bare fee. Its so odd how his name just slides out of my mouth like I\u2019ve known him for so long. Even though I have, but nothing more than a \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cHow you are you\u201d every few months. That does not really equal to knowing someone. Meh. I think I first heard of his name nearing the end of my first year of a being a Genin. My team and Gai-sensei just came back from the forest after looking for a pendant some old fool dropped. Took a long, long time.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n\u201cGai-Sensei!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes Lee!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d He pointed to the Hokage Monument. \u201cSomebody painted graffiti all over the Lord Hokage\u2019s faces? Who could be so irresponsible, who could be so reckless who cold be so-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE DOING, YOU IDIOT? GET DOWN FROM THERE AND GET BACK TO CLASS!\u201d Some Chuunin we didn\u2019t know yelled. Sounded really motherly though<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever he is, he certainly has odd taste in clothes.\u201d Neji said sounding slightly amused, Byakugan activated staring in that general direction. \u201cOrange jump suit, if I didn\u2019t know any better I\u2019d say he was trying to get Gai-sensei\u2019s attention. Someone should tell him he\u2019s got the wrong color.\u201d He finished in a sneer. I suppressed a giggled. But not at what Neji said, but at what this stranger had done. It made the Monument so less boring looking. It wasn\u2019t that funny but when your old academy class didn\u2019t even have one comedian, and then teamed up with those three, looking at a blank piece of paper was fairly amusing. The giggle turned into a laugh. The laugh multiplied.Soon enough I was rolling around on the ground with tears coming out of my eyes. Gai-sensei had the nerve to look at me funny. I quickly recomposed myself and said, \u201cI think I know who did that. Only one person could have done that\u2026I think his name was Uzumaki Naruto.\u201d Gai-sensei visibly stiffened. \u201cA few months ago somebody had poured water on almost every singly toilet paper in the public restrooms. Even the spares. Everybody was fuming and the name Uzumaki Naruto was whispered all over the place.\u201d I neglected to mention how everyone seem to really detest him for doing something so trivial, and even went as far as calling him a demon. I just thought he did stuff like that all the time.<br>\r\n\u201cAh Uzumaki Naruto..\u201d Gai-sensei started, \u201cIf you see him say hi to him every now and then. He\u2019s a good kid. Just a tad lonely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThe three of us never did heed his words. Lee, Neji, and I were walking to our team\u2019s meeting spot and passed by the academy. It was already after 6 pm for crying out loud, but Gai-sensei said it was important. I didn\u2019t expect anyone to be there but when I first looked to the swing I saw someone, in orange on the swings all by himself. I felt like I knew the person but the name just couldn\u2019t pop up. From what I could see, he had blonde spikes and was wearing a jumpsuit that was a mixture of orange, blue, and white. Lee said something.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say something Lee-kun?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, never mind..\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys do you recognize that person by the swings?\u201d As I turned to look by the swings the person vanished.<br>\r\n\u201cTenten, what are you talking about? You must be seeing things.\u201d Neji, clearly annoyed.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------<br>\r\nI met him again at the Chuunin Exams. I didn\u2019t notice him. I couldn\u2019t help it. Sasuke-baka was looking so damn hot, who the hell would notice him? He did eventually get my attention. When we first walked right into the first exam room, Neji and Lee decided that going deep into the room with other foreign ninjas was a grand idea.<br>\r\nThose bastards nearly made me wet myself. Like hell I was going to show that though. That was when he yelled. \u201cListen up you bastards! I\u2019m Uzumaki Naruto and I won\u2019t loose to ANY of you!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but laugh, I felt weird being the only one laughing but relief washed over when I noticed a few other girls laughing as well. They must have been nervous being around other foreign shinobis as well.<br>\r\nHe got my attention again during the written test. When I saw a large number of other people about to raise their hand and quit, he yelled again. His little speech gave those little spineless cowards a confidence boost and ended up having that \u2026woman.. Complaining about how many students were still left. I remember once believing Sasuke-baka to be cute. In the Forest of Death, that got shot down to hell. Lee, as usual was an idiot and nearly got himself killed fighting those Sound-nin. Before Neji had a chance to step in, Sasuke-baka was glowing purple and had black tattoos all over his body. At first, I thought it was kinda fruity, until he went nuts. The way he attacked and disabled that loud mouthed Sound-nin was horrifying. He even enjoyed it. If there\u2019s one thing I hate more, it\u2019s anyone enjoying hurting other people. Its one thing to do your job, but you know you\u2019re going a bit overboard when you enjoy doing things like that. I then spotted Naruto on the ground unconscious. I had this weird squirmy jerk deep down, but I shook it off and left. When Neji was fighting in the preliminaries.. Naruto\u2026He stood out again defending someone be didn\u2019t even knew that well. Never remembered anyone, let alone Naruto defend Hinata. I thought it was sweet. Gai-sensei was over there crying muttering something about why couldn\u2019t Naruto have been on his team instead of Neji. Men. Still, I was actually agreeing with him for once. Neji was so cruel in that fight\u2026 Poor Hinata...Then there were the finals. I felt so sorry for him. Someone so spirited to get pitted up against Neji of all people. I felt guilty for helping Neji develop the Kaiten, but since I didn\u2019t know Naruto all that well I helped him anyway. Besides, I was still fairly infatuated with Neji at the time. But that gradually disappeared. I didn\u2019t even get a thank you for my help. It was a little hard watching the fight. Naruto couldn\u2019t even lay a finger on him. I\u2019m pretty sure everyone gasped when they figured out Naruto\u2019s clones weren\u2019t normal ones. They were solid. Hell, I was so jealous. That\u2019s supposed to be a kinjutsu! How could he have learned it? Anyway, I guessed Neji was getting bored with just pummeling him so he used his blood limit\u2019s specialty. After I saw him get into that stance I didn\u2019t pay much attention. Just when I thought it was all over..So what I doubted? That wasn\u2019t the first time Neji did that. Everyone he did that to, they couldn\u2019t even stand, let alone fight. Naruto had done the impossible. He summoned chakra, bizarre chakra at that, even though Neji closed up his Tenkutsu points. I was baffled. I couldn\u2019t even ask Gai-sensei, the weird old coot wasn\u2019t ever around when I wanted him to be! The shock and frustration was so much, I didn\u2019t even realize Naruto managed to heal all of his cuts and bruises. Then he got fast. Real fast. I didn\u2019t even see a blur when he moved. I then spotted Naruto rushing Neji head on. I was thinking it was all over, getting knocked with one of his Kaitens that close was a one-hit knockout. After the huge explosion, it looked like Neji won. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The ground seemed to just spit up something orange and you could barely make out Naruto knocking Neji in the chin. And won. With one hit! How unbelievable is that! After staring at them with my mouth hanging out for God knows how long, I was expecting Naruto to start rubbing it in. But..Naruto didn\u2019t gloat. He didn\u2019t look at Neji with disgust, or trashed talk him while he was down. He just pranced around like a little kid, like he just got invited to a party or something.<br>\r\nRight there. I fell for him right there. I think. Emotions are difficult things to understand. Maybe it was because of his strength? His dorky personality? He is rather funny. You don\u2019t see too many shinobi with a sense of humor now days. They tend to get perverted. Or just plain twisted. Meh. And as time grew on I grew subtly more obsessed with him. Okay maybe not obsessed, but definitely more attracted to the blonde. My greatest hero, Tsunade-sama, was brought back to Konoha to become Godaime. Rumor was it that Naruto had been traveling with Tsunade-sama\u2019s old teammate Jiraiya just to go look for her. I didn\u2019t believe it until I saw Naruto walking with him and Tsunade-sama. She even looked fond of him, it was brief and disappeared as fast as it appeared, but I saw it. All that did was make me yearn for him more. All those \u201cDead-last\u201d remarks seem so stupid now. Would a \u201cdead-last\u201d looser be traveling around with two sannin? Jiraiya was probably training him too. He was already strong.. Just how strong would he get with Jiraiya training him? Jiraiya was the one who taught Yondaime after all\u2026The next couple of days was a blur. Well, not really, I managed to befriend Shizune. That\u2019s a plus. Big plus. Still, it was really confusing that week.<br>\r\nRumors.<br>\r\nGossip.<br>\r\nThe last Uchiha defected.<br>\r\nThe demon\u2019s fault.<br>\r\nJust who the hell was the demon?<br>\r\nUzumaki Naruto?<br>\r\nLies\u2026<br>\r\nHe\u2019s not a demon\u2026<br>\r\nRetrieval mission?<br>\r\nTHAT BUM MADE CHUUNIN?<br>\r\nHE\u2019S LEADING THE SQUAD?<br>\r\nMission failed?<br>\r\nI learned all that in one day. It gave me a damn headache. I was loitering around the gates when it was suddenly opened to admit Kakashi with something orange and red on his back. My heart skipped a beat when I saw him. He looked dead to the world. The red I saw was blood all over him. With a feeble squeak, and berating myself for my Hinata-like behavior, I bolted to the hospital. I remembered Neji being brought here earlier so I thought I\u2019d visit him, at least that was the reason I told myself I was going there. At the hospital, I spotted Shizune-san. She looked extremely tired. Slumped on the couch like that, you\u2019d think someone told her that her mother died. \u201cTired?\u201d I asked softly. She wasn\u2019t exactly sleeping, but I think I could have gotten away with giving her the finger. \u201cTo a certain extent, yes.\u201d She retorted, a bit snippy I might add. She gestured her hand towards the empty seat besides her. \u201cSit.\u201d She droned. I didn\u2019t have the heart to say no, so I complied. I didn\u2019t know what to say, having not knowing her for long, but the silence was comfortable. Shizune turned towards me and was about to speak when Kakashi busted through the front door. Shizune immediately stood up and ran over to Kakashi, who was talking to some nurse. I didn\u2019t want to seem rude so I stayed put. Kakashi must have said something rude since the nurse looked really annoyed. Shizune was eavesdropping on the conversation and looked like she was about to hit the nurse.. \u201cWhat sort of nurse are you!\u201d With that, she took Naruto from Kakashi and stormed off to the upper floor rooms. I tried to follow but that damn receptionist wouldn\u2019t allow it. But me being me, I simply placed a Genjutsu on myself to look like a doctor and walked passed her. She didn\u2019t even give me a second glance. Great. Just great. I don\u2019t know what room he\u2019s in. I nodded to a few nurses and doctors until I spotted Shizune walking out of one of the rooms. I was just about to walk in when Tsunade and Sakura rounded a corner. I hadn\u2019t spoken to her yet, so you can\u2019t blame me since I was staring at her slack jawed. She noticed me staring but ignored me and went in. I\u2019m pretty sure she saw through my genjutsu, but I guess she was too busy to care. I checked Naruto\u2019s clipboard on his door read he was fine. I breathed a sigh of relief. Right when I dropped the disguise I bumped into Gai-sensei. \u201cAh, Tenten. Visiting your teammates? If only those too fireballs could be as supportive as you.\u201d He sighed and walked off before I could even respond. I glanced at a clock and grimaced. It was well over 9:00pm. I found Neji\u2019s room simply enough, but the guy was asleep. With a yawn I decided to go home. Regretted like hell the next day. The next morning I vowed to at least speak to him. On second thought, I better visit my own teammates first since I didn\u2019t even talked to either of them yesterday. I remembered what room Neji was in so I just asked a nurse nearby to make sure he was in. I let myself in the door and stifled a gasp. Neji never looks content, yet there he was, lying in the bed without a care in the world. He hasn\u2019t even noticed me yet! Or at least, it seemed like it.. \u201cHow are you?\u201d I ventured, afraid I might take him out of one of his \u201crare\u201d moments. \u201cMy left part of my body is numb. They said it is an after effect of the healing seals they used.\u201d He still was looking rather content, and he still hasn\u2019t looked at me yet!<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Seen Lee around? Is he alright?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe went somewhere with Gai-sensei. He\u2019s doing fine as well.\u201d He finally looks at me, with a hint of a smile there as well. About bloody time, if you ask me. Rude to not look at someone when they\u2019re talking to you. I guess I can forgive that though, I have no idea what sort of fight he went through\u2026.<br>\r\n\u201cHow long are you gonna stay in here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHiashi-sama is supposed to pick me up soon.\u201d<br>\r\nI grinned. \u201cMister Top Rookie needs to be taken home by his uncle?\u201d Neji flushed.<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Tenten,\u201d He hesitated, not exactly sure what to say next, \u201d\u2026 I won\u2019t be with the team often this year.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHm? Why, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNothing is wrong. Hiashi-sama is just taking me under his wing for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh. You\u2019re still going to do lame old missions with us, right?\u201d<br>\r\nHe changed positions so that he was sitting up and staring blankly at the window.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou make it seem so depressing. It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re going to leave the village or something.\u201d If he was, I vowed to kill him on spot. Leaving me alone with Gai-sensei and Lee. Grr..<br>\r\n\u201cI may not be leaving, but someone I know is.\u201d He turns to look at me, with an annoying smirk stretched across his face. \u201cUzumaki, Naruto.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s WHAT!\u201d I nearly fell over. Byakugan or no Byakugan I\u2019m so going to squeeze the life out of him if he\u2019s just jerkin\u2019 around. He frowns. \u201cI thought you knew? You still might be able to catch him.. before he leaves. He could still be at the gates..\u201d<br>\r\nHe might have said something else, but I was already out the door. Now that I think about it, it was in a small tiny way, funny. It took me three weeks later to realize that he knew I got over him and knew who was currently running in my brain.<br>\r\nWhile running, my traitorous mind kept telling me I was stupid. Chasing some guy who most likely doesn\u2019t even remember my name. Neji seemed like a new person. You should still be all over him. Stupid brain. There is no point in pining after someone with little to no feelings towards you anyway. It\u2019s just a waist of time. Besides, guys like Naruto were one in a million. By the time I got there I was too late. He\u2019s gone and for who knows how long. I spent the rest of the day moping around with Lee and Gai-sensei. I didn\u2019t really show it, we\u2019re supposed to do that anyway, but it felt so weird giving a fake smile to everyone.. Working with Gai and Lee was cruel. Overly cruel. I had to drag myself home. I appreciated Neji\u2019s company hell of a lot more after that. My parents left an official looking letter addressed to me on my table. I scanned it and there was supposed to be a meeting with Godaime next week. The letter didn\u2019t say what it was about.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\nI arrived at the meeting early. There were a large number of people here. Most of the Genins, about half of the Chuunins, and about a third of Jounins, and higher ups. I even saw some normal civilians. I spotted Lee in the crowd and walked over to him. Who could miss him? \u201cAh Tenten-chan! Glorious morning, is it not?\u201d Loud as usual. Its good to know some things never change. \u201cYeah sure thing Lee-kun..\u201d I didn\u2019t see Tsunade-sama around so I got bored rather quickly. \u201cTenten, wake up! Hokage-sama is about to speak.\u201d Lee whispered. I was instantly awake. When did I dose off?<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning everyone. Lets get straight to the point, shall we? I know of the rumors spreading like wild fire, and quite honestly, it\u2019s irritating to hear them. As you all know, last week there was a retrieval mission for a defected nin. With experienced shinobi low, I was forced into sending a team consisting of a newly selected Chuunin and four Genins. Though they were all handpicked.\u201d<br>\r\nShe allowed the crowd to murmur a bit. <br>\r\n\u201cIn the last moment, Sand\u2019s peace offering arrived in the form of three of their top Genins. I sent them to aid them as well. Without their help, there is no doubt that we would have lost some of the village\u2019s most promising shinobis.\u201d<br>\r\nMore murmuring.<br>\r\nShe cleared her throat. \u201cThe defected nin was none other than Uchiha Sasuke. He left with four sound nin escorts. Not Uzumaki, Naruto. Uzumaki was part of the team sent to retrieve him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous! This Uchiha is nothing like his brother! This one even saved us from Shukaku the Sand Demon during the Sand and Sound attack! Its that..that..Uzumaki! He must have done something to delude the Uchiha!\u201d Yelled a Chuunin, a large number of other people agreed with him. I wanted to smack him. So rude. There was a muffled scream. All eyes was on the disrespectful as the Chuunin was choked to death by ..sand? I gasped, Gaara? ANBU looked ready to attack but Tsunade-sama waved them off. Gaara was nonchalantly staring at the offending Chuunin. Still as intimidating as ever. How the hell did I not notice him before? Looking at him, he was dressed pretty normal. White long sleeved shirt and black pants tucked at the ankles. His siblings held a look of disgust on their face. It wasn\u2019t directed at Gaara. \u201cGaara, put him down.\u201d To be honest, Tsunade-sama didn\u2019t look mad at him. It\u2019s as if she forced herself to say that to him. \u201cSasuke Uchiha cannot and did not defeat me.\u201d With that he calmly walked out, siblings in route. Lee raised his hand. Tsunade-sama nodded towards him. \u201cHokage-sama, if Uchiha did not defeat Gaara, who did?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSee for yourself. Complimentary of Jiraiya of course.\u201d She pulled out a scroll, unraveled it, did a few hand seals, and suddenly a picture showed from the scroll. Almost like a projector. You could tell you were looking through a scope of some sort from the way the boundaries was set. Everyone watched in silent horror as Gaara transformed into some sort of brown ugly thing. Everyone gasped when Sasuke, with those freakish black tattoos struck Gaara in his right shoulder with the Chidori and shake it off like it was a fly. Just when it looked like Sasuke was done for, Sakura appeared which made Gaara distracted enough to get a fist slammed into him by Naruto. Gaara swiped Naruto away and slammed Sakura into a tree. This seemed to really piss Naruto off. They were talking, but we couldn\u2019t hear. It was a tad frustrating. I swear I saw the council, Kakashi-san, and Tsunade-sama smile when Naruto poked Gaara in the ass with a kunai and literally blew his ass up when the explosive note went off. Neji smirked. What a second, when did Neji get here? Must have been when I dozed off...<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t take anyone hostage when I fought him.\u201d He chuckled.<br>\r\nEveryone who heard gave a nervous but genuine laugh.<br>\r\nGaara must have said something to piss Naruto off again. The Kage Bunshin was already an amazing feat already, but to have made THAT many was astonishing. Despite the pounding those clones did, Gaara did the unthinkable. He got huge.Really huge.The view changed and we were now all staring at someone\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n\u201cShit. I better go help.\u201d That someone said. Must have been Jiraiya.<br>\r\n\u201cHeh..Maybe not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThe perspective shifted again and we were all staring at a huge cloud of smoke.<br>\r\nThere were a lot of gasps in the crowd. Wasn\u2019t all that surprising really. There aren\u2019t too many in the world that can call themselves a summoner. I was more than impressed to say the least. Neji stiffened. \u201cHe was holding back..\u201d He whispered. He took a deep breath. It must have been a major blow to his ego to go all at it at someone to not only get the shit beat out of you, but to know they weren\u2019t even using their full potential? Ouchies. I saw Kakashi-san\u2019s eyes widened a bit. Why would his own sensei be surprised of his own pupil? Jiraiya said something again. \u201cSheesh. Gamabunta two times in a row.\u201d There were startled gasps again. Wasn\u2019t it Gamabunta the toad boss that helped Yodaime defeat the Nine-Tails? It was amazing to see the summoned toad battle it out with Gaara. What happened next I doubt anyone saw it coming. The toad transformed into the Nine-Tails. I thought it was just a regular fox at first, but its hard to miss nine swaying tails. No one knew why until they saw it bite and dig into Gaara. Naruto leapt off the transformed toad and gave Gaara a savage blow to the head that should have put him back into unconsciousness after waking him up, seeing what it did to Neji after all...A head butt later, the scrolled sealed it self-back up and the lights were turned back on. Didn\u2019t even notice it was turned off in the first place.<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we got that cleared up we can finally get down to business.\u201d Tsunade-sama stated smugly, then turning to glare at those idiots from before.<br>\r\n\u201cAs of today, Uchiha Sasuke is a missing nin. He is to be treated like any other traitor of a village. If he is seen, do not attempt to engage with him unless you\u2019re certain you can take him. If not, just file the standard report for spotting them.\u201d<br>\r\nI was even more flustered when after seeing how powerful he actually is, some people resented him even more. I hate people with ego trips like that. On the way back home from the mission with Raiga, Naruto pulled me aside and asked me what my goal was. I told him and he started to laugh, it ticked me off at first, what he said next stopped me dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You honestly beleave that hogwash about men being stronger than weman? Get real, the guy who started that was as idot.It dosen't matter what anyone elese says or thinks, its how hard you work that determans how good you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKami-san...can I keep him?  </span></div></div>",

Has two kitsune tails (Eventually six) that can act like a second pair of hands. Kaizo wears a pair of shackles on her hands and feet, due to the people of Konoha trying to sacrifice her. (Really was a murder in disguise) She wears a uwagi with a hood to cover her head, along with a sarashi to cover her chest. (As a teen, she is really sensitive about this fact) She also wears a lower part of a gi colored green, and wears loose socks, but rarely wears shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Kaizo is very upbeat, which is very surprising considering the fact that the townspeople try to kill her on a daily basis. She won't attack anyone that talks to her. Kaizo WILL attack if either she is allowed to or if someone attacks one of her friends. Kaizo is very smart, due to her background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers &amp; Techniques: Kaizo can break a person's bones if she wanted to. With her tails, she can perform Fox Fire, a multi-purpose move that has gotten her out of trouble more than a few times. (She will learn more powers as the story continues) Later in her life, Kaizo will wield a kanab\u014d. In the meantime though, she is currently skilled in: (Note: the techniques named are the Kihon, or \"basics\" and are easily readable.)
