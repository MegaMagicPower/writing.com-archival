From across deserted asphalt, the geek watches as the last light goes out, signaling the retirement of the janitor Mr. Venucio.  'A test subject would be advisable,' her inner scientist assures her, 'just to make sure the ray's still functioning.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the woven branches of a manicured bush, Dawn watches as the janitor approaches.  He's fiddling in his pockets for the keys to his car.  'Pathetic,' you think, 'half that man's life involves keys, I'm doing him a favor.'  When you see his tan uniformed legs passing right outside, you slip out the gun.  There isn't any aiming involved at this range, you just point and squeeze.  No flash nor beam; its ray is invisible and the plump Italian simply 'vanishes.'<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenucio stops in mid stride, his foot once poised over a crack, now hangs over a trench.  Before he can begin to understand his predicament, his world of twilight gray goes darker.  Above, the shadowed visage of a girl, face unclear, ascends into the air like a Goddess of the night.  The janitor steps back and nearly stumbles into the 'crack'.  When he looks from the mortal fall back around he sees a black shoe raising before him.  To his children's shame, he screams like a woman.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn lifts her loafer over the now penny sized janitor.  For a moment a voice of mercy assails her, arguing, 'Mr. Venucio was never mean to you.'  She thinks on this a moment before responding outloud, just so her conscience will understand who's the boss, \"yeah and he didn't do anything to help either.\"  Only dimly does Dawn register the rodentine squeal as she brings the ball of her foot down on the blue collar worker.  A satisfying squish ends his feeble sounds of protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick the body into a nearby gutter, and leave the blood stain on the cement.  They'll just think one of the strays got a bird.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the street, you have a primitive camp set up.  You curl up there in your 10-degree sleeping bag, the only cold that of the steel ray gun pressed closely against your body.  'Tomorow, tommrow...'  The faces of a hundred bullies scroll past your mind's eye as you imagine the varied ways you might destroy them.   'I'll get my revenge on all of  you, I'll make you, I'll make you,' you stretch and let loose a yawn begging for sleep,'know how it feels.' </span></div></div>",

Only a nearby puddle into which he eagerly dives saves him from burning alive.  Dawn remembers both of them picking on her in the past so she only laugh at their plight.  Just as the burned drugee is raising his head out of the brackish water the dork lowers her foot down on him.  Her flat rubber sole is the last thing the stoner sees before being squished into the hard unyielding asphalt.  After the scream, the puddle's water turns red around her penny loafer.  Anger contained in thick black rimmed glasses, shifts to the second stoner.  A fat little sophomore he cries in the face of the towering girl and his own inevitable demise.  \"Mommy!!\" is his last word before Dawn's shoe silences him.  She grinds the remains into the black tar with relish, \"that's how you always treated me, an insignificant, bug..\"  The young inventor plays with the dials on the shrink ray adjusting the spray to maximum.  \"..now you're all going to find out how it feels.\"  As with the janitor, no aiming is required.  Dawn just points the gun at the broadside of the building and pulls the trigger, every milisecond laced with anticipation.</span></div></div>",

In truth it is only the vibration of the bedrock as it rips away from the shrinking bulding's foundation.  All four brick walls retract toward the school's center of gravity followed by the ceiling.  Pipes exposed by the collapse fountain up as the building passes by leaving them cracked and mangled.  Dawn watches some curious faces peering with noncomprehending fright through the classroom windows.  She waves to them as they shrink along with the building, becoming the size of pool balls and then ping pong balls.  Still the school keeps shrinking, the faces disappearing from view entirely hidden both by scale and the rubble left behind by the building's relentless retraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Dawn skips out through the devastation dodging upturned debris and growing puddles pumped up by the busted pipes.  She has to look around a bit to find her school, but when she does she can't help but laugh.  All those years she let her high school intimidate her...  Now no bigger than a shoe box, she couldn't believe she'd ever even hesitated at its doors.  She covered her mouth in awe over its cuteness as she knelt down before the tiny front face -- then she remembered her duct tape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking as busily as a spider at a captured fly she wrapped the building up in layer after layer of impenetrable adhesive.  Imagining the plight of her tiny schoolmates inside she smiles as she tilts and turns the school no doubt hurling entire classes back and fourth across their rooms.  When every escape route is sealed by that most trustworthy of inventor's tools, she hefts the block into her book bag and zips it up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the parking lot Dawn encounters a police car hurtling in, lights flaring.  \"Are you alright mis...\" <b><i>ZAPPP!!</i></b>.  They shrink to the size of pill bugs, their car a kit-kat.  The nerd keeps right on walking making sure to crush both car and cops underfoot -- she doesn't even hear the <i>squish</i>.  Strapped over her shoulders is every little brat who was ever nasty to her and now that she's minutes from justice, nothing short of an army could stand in her way.  </span></div></div>",

As soon as she had put some distance between herself and the scene of her crime, she cut off into the dense pine forest.  Needles sticky with sap dabbed at her cheeks as she passed.  Green briar clawed at her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of a most encrusted sylvan stone, the scientist unslung her book bag and extracted her prize.  There was no way her vengence would wait.  Growing the school to the size of a tree stump, Dawn holstered her ray and proceeded to tear off the roof.

The head beneath that wavy blond hair was now the size of its brain (in other words a pea).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky shrieked movie actress style again as she beheld Dawns monstrous face.  \"Do you remember what you and your friends put me through last spring.

Becky dangled in front of a jet of hot warm breath, catatonic with fear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn could barely restrain her glee.  'Here's a girl that just yesterday would have thought she was better than me just because she had a more perfect complexion and now she's just an appetizer.'  Dawn smiled initiating new screams from the little cheerleader who recoiled at the sight of the steel braces deploying like some cybernetic cage.  'She actually thinks I'd eat her...'  the edges of Dawns smile unconsciously hooked up, 'then again why not.'  She looks down at the tiny cheer leader in a new light, now as something less then human.  'They all proved that they're less than human by the way they treated me, and its not as if anyone will know...  '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost without intent, her hand begins moving again slowly passing Becky between her lips.  \"No!  Please, Dawn.  Please.  I'm sorry;  I'm soo sorry!! DAAAWWN!!!\"  Dawn's lips reduce the pleas to mumbles.  She looks down at the classroom and sees that all the students have fled to other less exposed parts of the school.  'Hide all you like,' Dawn thinks as she works Becky around the inside of her mouth.  'You'll all wind up in the same place.'  Not giving Becky the justice of a quick death Dawn gulps her victim down, cursing her to a slow gruesome dissolution in her bowls.</span></div></div>",

Once Brandy was up to her ankle's in Dawn's ear and her screams were amplified by the proximity to Dawn's ear-drum, she began to twist her captive.

Then finally after four or five thrusts she pulled Brandy out and examined her.  The naked girls body was literally yellow with Dawn's ear wax and huge dark clumps of it hung from her body.  Masses of the gunk seemed to have been pushed up between her legs.

With her free hand she pokes around through the paniced student body.  Knocking over the biggest jocks as if they were no more than pill bugs, her hand snatches up the nerdiest kids she can find.  Wherever acne and glasses converge her fingers come together.  One by one she plucks the geeks out of the crowd until she has a small crowd on her palm.

A drama began to play out on Dawn's palm right under her eyes.  The nerds encircled the girl who'd normally be way out of their league.  In response the cheerleader curled up in a ball and began wimpering; she was still covered from head to toe in the thick yellow custard from Dawn's ear.  \"Go on now, don't be timid, she's my gift to you.\"  One of the nerds, moved by her words, knelt down near the teens dainty feet.  Dawn could almost see the internal struggle displayed on his face, his revulsion versus his repressed hormones.  The hormones apparently won because he reached in and grappled the girl's feet.  She kicked a few times but he managed to wrestle them up to his mouth where he started sucking Dawn's ear wax off her tiny toes and licking it from her soles.  He even swiped his tongue in between her toes to get the gunk which had accumulated there.  Meanwhile Brandy was a mixture of wails and moans, simultaneously detesting and enjoying the violation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened by their fellow, the other dorks now fell upon her like lions on a carcass.  The fattest among them licked her cute face all over even going so far as to then thrust his waxy tongue between her lips giving the girl another taste of Dawn's ear. Meanwhile two others shared her arms and split her pert breasts between them.  A fourth very nearly dove between her legs.  Tearing back the hand which instinctively moved to block him he licked her golden pubes and the inside of her thighs as if they were coated with ice-cream rather than earwax.</span></div></div>",

He only saw the fist for a moment, then everything went black.  When he came too, Charlie at first imagined, he was emerging from the most insane nightmare he or anyone had ever had.  The booger the size of a rotweiller on the table above, however, quickly sunk that hypothesis.  Little had changed except there were now students sitting around the table, pale sad students in black clothing.  They were Emo kids and some Goths too, each with the meaty hands of a football jock holding them in their seat.  Few would have thought it possible but staring down at the massive wad of encrusted snot which was about to become their meal, they looked even more depressed than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Charlie, still the leader of the mob called, \"start eating Emo bratz.\"  With shaky hands most picked up the forks they'd been given.  The few who refused were soon convinced by a hard cuffs to the head.  \"The first one to eat, gets an early reprieve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne brave Goth, a pale fat freshmen named Gary Schneider (Dark Horse to his brothers in moodiness) took the bait and tentatively sunk his fork into the booger, it made a sickening squelching sound which sent shivers down the spines of even the toughest linebackers gathered round.  He pulled the fork out carrying a hunk of Dawn's booger and trailing a long line of viscous snot behind.  Unable to hold back his tears the boy cried openly as he put the fork and its foul package into his mouth.  Far above, the giantess Dawn was looking down with rapt interest.  She watched the student's pained expression as he started to chew upon her own booger and smiled as the tiny face distorted in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children gathered round heard the grueling crunch of the booger between the boy's teeth and made a collective groan.  Charlie, however, was not impressed, \"the mucus,\" he reminded his prisoner and pointed to the rope of Dawn's snot which dangled from the corner of his lips, \"don't loose any of that or she might discount the whole thing.\"  New tears streaming down his cheeks, the boy nodded, and sucked up the snot much like a rogue spaghetti noodle.  After two tortuous minutes, he managed to swallow the mass of snot and saliva and illicited a cheer from the gathered student body.</span></div></div>",

Lines of helmeted workers stand poised up and down its length, buckets and shovels in hand, all waiting for a chance at the prize.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jar is a mountain, but what drips down its side is neither lava nor mudslide but gold, liquid gold.  The junior workers clumsily mine what has pooled on the ground as a fleet of loading trucks back into view.  All is quiet save for the 'beep beep beep' of their safety meters as you watch the ladder touch home on a gooey ledge far above.  Beyond lay a sea of honey, sweet for the taking, enough to make  your multi-million dollar cooperation into a multi-trillion dollar cooperation.  But, reasons are many why other entrepreneurs hadn't attempted the gamble before.  One chief amongst them is that none of them are as crazy as you, Adrion Moxley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started out as a small time hustler, women, gambling, drugs (even cane sugar), anything that seemed hot at the time.  By the time you made your first mill the heat was on you like a giant's oven.  You decided to go legit, and let your wife think it was her ceaseless whining that won you over, 'the stupid bitch.'   When you were still a brat you dreamed about one day being a scavenger.  You'd even read some books, Adventures in Cabinet Climbing by Lawrence Gillinger, My Time Amongst the Giants by Tommy Schull.  It seemed like an exciting life and one that, like the hustle, could pay off big to someone with the required wits.  So you bought the fleet, the crane, and hired your first crew.  On their next pay check you go bankrupt.  'But that's no worry anymore,' you uses binoculars to watch the first shovel strike nectar.  You bite your lip in anticipation.  For anxiety's sake you turn your scope on the spotters camped out on the far cliff.  Knowing they also watch you, you give a wave.  A moment passes like a truck in low gear and then a white flag goes up.  You hide your sigh of relief from the nearby workers.  The chumps actually believed your hype about knowing the Therians' routines.  It was the only way, really.  If you'd run with the truth you'd never have been able to afford a crew big enough to gather the stash quickly: 'which is the real key to foiling the giants.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're watching the first ceremonial bucket traverse the ladder hand to hand, when a tremor throws the current tender and his precious load into the air.  His blood curdling scream reaches even his employer's ears far below.  You shift your scope around looking for the source.  It couldn't be the Therians, the spotters had an eagle eye on the kitchen...'or did they,' a very real tremor shakes the ground and Adrion sees the ladder start to teeter.  Workers hang to it for dear life like fleas to a hair in the wind.  A wave of fleeing trucks and personnel pulls your scoped eye down to the source of all this chaos.  Where your $400,000 crane once stood there is now only a paw with the arm of the device, the only unsmashed section, extending out between the toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scope falls from your hands.  The shattering of its lenses is a distant chime.  At the corner of your vision you barely see the spotters madly waving their red flag.  The twisting shearing sound of snapping metal spiced with screams is all you hear.  All you see is the scaling ladder and its hundreds of ill fated workmen carried up and up past curving heights of gray fur.  Paws provide the lift, their grip smashing many men into pulp in the process.  Some throw themselves into the void rather than meet whatever awaits above \u2013 they are the lucky ones.  Your eyes only break from the scene to follow these unfortunate few as they fall screaming to their deaths.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you see its...her face... 'a Mouse?'  You'd spent all your time worrying about the home owners forgetting that they had other parasites beyond man.  'But in all those books they never mentioned carnivorous rats?'  As the female Mouse looks the ladder of hanging workers up in down, there's no doubt what's going through her Animal mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing your vision to pan out from the doomed men, you take in the whole mayhem that surrounds you.  The first thing you notice is \u2013 she is not alone.  Screams from over your shoulder spin you around in time to see a paw crush two of your loading trucks at once.  Toes and claws wrinkle around the remains obliterating one survivor wriggling toward escape.  The Mouse snatches another vehicle up in his forepaw playing at its roof with a claw in an attempt to get at the juicy and no doubt terrified insides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the base of the bowl the junior employees, many of them underage workers (teenagers and younger with badly forged paperwork), stand quaking in their boots.  A rumble announces the approach of yet another giant and a big eared shadow confirms its species.  You blare at them through the megaphone, \u201cfor God's sake get the Hell out of there!!\u201d  Nothing moves them, however, until the source of the shadow, a young girl mouse steps out into view.  Her green eyes, lay claim to them all like a wolf surveying a herd of lambs.  Terror stricken, the rookies run according to their instincts, away from Her, but towards the honey.  Most wind up stuck and immobilized, a kicking screaming mass of arms and legs immersed in sucrose.  The Mouse with her hair done up in a pony tail and a checkered dress down to her knobby knees, looks almost like one of your daughters. When she bends down over the young men and boys giggling the resemblance becomes disturbing \u2013 'it could be Betty playing with some toys she found..except for the ears, and whiskers... and tail.'  The face she makes when she licks her lips, however, is decidedly not human.  The only time you'd ever seen your daughter make a face like that was maybe... before desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new round of screams from on high pulls your eyes up against your will.  There the first Mouse runs her red tongue along the ladder licking up multitudes as others fall, some by their own choice.  Her saliva sheathed muscle is nearly coated in a second layer of writhing workmen when she retracts it.  As they disappear into the void between her fangs, their screams reach their zenith.  Surely all are wishing they'd thrown themselves to their deaths when they had the chance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch transfixed as the giant Mouse chews.  You can no longer hear their screams but you can imagine their plight, tossed about in a dark cave full of mashing and slashing rocks.  Any who managed to dodge those horrible teeth would only wind up mashed into a ball of his ground up comrades and  the Mouse's spit, waiting to meet a much worser and slower death in her stomach.

Free fall wrests both unseated women up into the air where they hover like genies.  The men cringe, belts digging into their skin as they to are hoisted upward.  The mortal stop makes all into chaos, a blur of motion and pain that leaves non conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're the first to come too and the first thing you realize is that you can't breath.  Two soft objects, like leather clad pillows are suffocating you from either side.  A strain of your eyeballs allows peeking over the obstructions.

How embarrassing, at your size she's liable to smother you like an infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrgently you work your hands beneath her weight searching for your strap fastener.  Above you twist and shout against your otherwise pleasant confines.  \"Get off me you dike!\" you yell, your words instantly absorbed by her cleavage.  Still as if she somehow heard through the vibrations in her flesh she stirs and rises a bit on her arms.  Blessed air flows down into the opening space between your face and her massive boobs.  \"Dr. Conchlin for God's sake stay where you are,\" the words take off from your mouth faster than a squadron of jets at Def Con 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face looks like some inquisitive bird as its cocks down in your direction.  Features, just a tad to angular to be beautiful, start with a slightly slanted forehead and end with a sexy beak of a nose.  Oiled, spiked and pruned, her hair is a coating of feathers.  Only her human ornaments, the slender spectacles and barely obvious nose ring mar her animal nature.  You're speechless for a moment, not just from her exotic and attractive features, but their sheer size.  If birds had ever decided to evolve back into dinosaurs, the missing links might bear resemblance to Dr. Conchlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain...  I... I'm very sorry...\"  As her eyes glide down you and she realizes how fully she has you trapped, a disturbing (mutinous even) grin appears on her face.  You've never seen her, or any woman for that matter, look at you as she does then - like a chicken eying a worm.   \"Be honest, Captain, you liked it didn't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, the dike brings her beasts down on you again and the soft mounds easily envelop your head.  You can hear her muffled laughter outside as she presses her boobs together literally sandwiching your little head between them.  You yell every manner of reprimand but they're all lost in her gelatinous contours.  Dr. Conchlin had always been so tight laced and reserved -- 'maybe its an atmo problem (too much oxygen...?)'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breasts of your science officer finally release your face hot and sticky from its confinement.  The women who you always had pinned for a prudish intellectual, begins buttoning her uniform as if nothing had happened.  She preens her hair a bit with careful fingers and then pats you lovingly (or derisively) on the head.  \"Now we'll just keep that bit of fun between you and me.  Don't want little Ben being jealous, do we. \"  You're head is still spinning from that 'bit of fun' and you can hear another of your shipmates groaning in the background.</span></div></div>",

You place another empty beer on the hood of your truck and after a quick tally of its blurry companions you calculate it'll take at least another six pack to knock you out cold.  You crack open a cheap watery beer and raise it in salute to the faded American flag hanging over your yard, 'still the greatest nation in the world.'  But as soon as you speak the words your memory conjures images from the last decades that defeat all your faith.  It seemed like every moment of America's humiliating defeat was forever preserved by that evil tentacled brain: the internet.  You chug your beer flushing the images away with alcohol.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming it down, you reach for another when a red light illuminates the sky.  You feel yourself rolling off your pick-up, but before you hit the turf, you've already passed out.

Denial has you testing your bonds once more, but your wrenching only serves to hurt Stacy and doesn't even stretch the bands of seaweed that bind you and her together.  You rear back planting your head in the plump buttocks pressing in from above and suddenly they're gone.  When you look around you see a fat couple lifting off into the air, propelled by two bamboo shafts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian girl who dominates the sky inspects her next morsel with a sort of smug satisfaction.  Terrified between her chopsticks the middle aged couple cry and plead for their meager lives.  The rest of you watch in spell bound silence as your owner licks her lips, taste buds only stimulated by their terror.  She speaks to them in some 'chink' language you can't understand and don't want to you -- it sounds sweet but you're willing to bet the underlying meaning isn't.'  Slowly she angles her sticks toward her parting young lips, her smile promising pain beyond imagining.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer silken mouth closes on her chop sticks and she slides them free absent their American captives.  For a moment she tosses them about in her mouth, as one might with a rock candy or other succulant sweet.

'My God, she's chewin' them two up like they were no more thana' paira' corn fritters...'  The delayed realization hits you like an automobile wreck recalled by an amnesiac, 'in a matter of bites that's gonna be me.'

They land like fallen trees on either side, forcing you to conclude the inevitable -- you're next.  Then the 'trunks' clamp together driving all thoughts from your brain by sheer pressure. Stacy's squealing accompanies your crying as you both ascend to your mutual doom.  Below, you see the entire tray for the first time, its chambers populated by your kin and neighbors all prepared as delicacies for this Asiatic Giantess.

Even the young ones are overweight, 'is all they eat hamburger?'  The tiny faces, pictures of absolute terror, make her tummy groan and she wastes no time popping them in her mouth.  Silken lips shut off their screams and slide them both off the chopsticks and onto her tongue.  Deciding this couple tastes a bit less like wet dog, she decides to suck on them for a bit, her tongue having her way with the bound Americans who are now no more than another snack.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\nYour scream and Stacy's blend together as you are thrown back and fourth inside the sweet sticky cavern of this beauty's mouth.  Saliva coats you both in seconds, a symbol of the fact that you now belong to her and are soon to become part of her.  The tongue catches you both in its smooth shallow fold and then raises you up against a ridged pallet.  It then grinds you both back and fourth until you're sure your skin's about to rip free of your skeleton.  <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\nRecalling that she has a whole tray to finish, Hikaru tongues the couple over to the back corner of her mouth -- beneath her mashing molars.

Then she ends it.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n\"Please God, oh please no, God,\" you hear Stacy whimpering as jagged walls of dentine compress you both.  Knowing this is your last moment alive, you do the only thing a man like you can think to do.  You start humping the girl below you, turning her words into squeals of surprise.  Furiously, intent to have one last orgasm, you thrust into her helped by the hard bed of molars underneath.  Above, the top row presses down harder pushing you further into Stacy's tight slit.  By the time your ribs start cracking you're deeper in a girl than you have ever been.  Somehow the thought of being naught but a morsel in a Japanese woman's mouth has made you harder and longer than ever.  You're literally in her uterus and Stacy is howling, whether in pain or pleasure you don't know.  When the teeth finally clamp down, you bust your load at the same moment spraying semen as the force of the bite simultaneously sprays your guts.  Stacy comes as well, quivering uncontrollably as the diner's teeth maul her beyond recognition.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\nHikaru chews the couple quickly but thoroughly and after a barely noticeable gulp she goes for her next struggling bite.</span></div></div>",

These may be simple giants and giantesses or true Titans depending on which storyline you follow.  No rules, just have fun and try to stick to the theme of the storyline.  A summation of the five main options below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mini Societies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Schooled -- Dawn Silverman, a 14 yr old nerd  who's tired of being picked on at school decides to use her science genius to shrink her entire school.  Follow either Dawn, the popular boy she's crushing on (literally), a popular girl she's jealous of, or the boy who's been humiliating her since 1st grade (uh oh).   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt-Men -- In an African landscape populated by titanic anthropomorhic animals, the Abbatwa, or Ant-Men are a plague to all living things.  A mirror of our own culture along with all its bureaucracy, technology, and greed, their lighted cities are still seen as little more than glowing bug hives by the 'primitive' but God-like Animals that rule the world.  Once threatening to deforest all of the jungle and wither the savanna, the Abbatwa, after being exterminated in the billions, are now little more than a pest.  Any African animals are fair game as far as giants go, as well as, of course, gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan's Rightful Place -- A disease afflicts the earth, a virus that alters the Y chromosome.  The effect is only visible to the offspring, so before the mutation can be traced back to the cause, all the men on earth outside of isolated tribal cultures are mutated by the virus.  Those men born with the defect never advance past their childhood height.  In just a few generations the culture of earth is turned on its head with women towering over men.  In the advanced future, men become slaves and breeding stock, owned by their female masters like animals.  They loose even more height, averaging now at 2.5 feet; they also loose the ability to speak to even voice their objections.  Thankfully most don't have any for sexual selection has favored macrophilia over the centuries, breeding a race of men who actually live to lick the feet of their female owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspired by the Giantess Amy Interactive: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio.php?action=edit&amp;item_id=1526652\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio.php?action=edit&amp;item_id=1526652</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia -- Your city is not below a Goddess but upon her -- she is neither monster nor deity but the entire world.  For eons your industries have harvested the resources of her body while simultanteously cleaning her.  The old religion claims that your people exist in a symbiosis with this cosmic beauty, but she is so large and so truly unaware of your presence that some scientists among you contend that she is not even alive but rather geologic in nature.  This leads to the major schism in your society: whether or not to tap the rich region of resources lying beneath the skin (or 'mantle' as the scientists would call it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJapan's Destiny --  Japan ascended to dominance in the mid 21st century by being the first nation to develop shrinking technology.  Now in the 22nd century the Asian nations rule the world as the West did once long ago.
