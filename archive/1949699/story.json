            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was almost funny, how the tiniest, most insignificant events could so drastically alter the course of history. A kingdom could fall for want of a single horseshoe nail. A butterfly flapping its wings could result in a hurricane on the other side of the world. A twelve year old boy running away from home could turn the destiny of the world upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortune was fickle mistress, and Fate a hell of gambler. Whether the outcome of random chance, or a preordained sequence of events, you never knew how things would turn out until it was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the smallest differences can change everything. And for Sokka, that difference - his butterfly, his horseshoe nail, whatever you wanted to call it - was a single rotten egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story starts with a young man of about twenty-three years of age. He was Fire Nation, born and bred, as loyal to his government as any mainlander. He was a rather plain fellow, if easy enough on the eyes, according to his girlfriend. He was the third son of a reasonably well-to-do family, merchants of middling status with a couple of business partners in the Colonies. Nothing major, but enough that his parents were able to send him and his siblings to a decently accredited boarding school with a good - if unremarkable - history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis young man's name was Lee. A very generic name, perhaps, but fitting for an admittedly generic guy. He had graduated school with overall passable grades - although his marks in the practical sciences had been good enough to catch the eye of the Fire Nation Army Engineer Corps - and he was dating a pretty enough young woman of similarly modest standing and talent. They had been going steady for a bit over a year and half by now, and she had moved in with him a few months ago, to the tepid disapproval of both parties' parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy all accounts, Lee was a more or less completely average guy, another face in the crowd. In the grand scheme of things he was not at all important. Nor was he the sharpest arrow in the quiver, honestly. Not by a long shot. Oh, he was a good enough engineer, but Lee was rather lacking in common sense. He was also bit of a slob, and an incurable gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Lee loved having eggs for breakfast. This was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the impending arrival of Sozin's Comet, it was a day like any other for Lee. He was chatting with his girlfriend, who was drowsily nursing her morning cup of tea. Lee was excitedly rambling about his recent assignment to one of airships in the First Imperial Sky Fleet as he set breakfast on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had made fried eggs, as usual. Enough for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unbeknownst to Lee, one of the eggs he'd used had been rotten, and he had cooked the two helpings separately, one after the other. Neither he or his girlfriend were aware of this, however. Both of them ate their breakfast, oblivious to this fact. One of them came down with food poisoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in one iteration of history, the one most of you are probably familiar with, Lee set the plate with the bad eggs at his spot, and the plate with the normal eggs at his girlfriend's. He would then have gotten food poisoning and been forced to stay home from work, requiring his supervisors to find a last minute replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was important, because of what airship Lee was assigned to work on. It was, in fact, the very same airship that would be boarded by a certain trio of saboteurs, and he was assigned to the very section where the three intruders would enact the very first step of their plan. In the canonical history, as you might call it, Lee of course got food poisoning, and his replacement - a heavyset, silent fellow - would respond to a broken valve only to be ambushed and knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut since Lee didn't eat the bad eggs, and didn't get sick, he was the first one who got ambushed by the saboteurs. The outcome was the same, of course. Lee had no combat ability to speak of, whereas his assailants were three of the most dangerous people in the world: The young commander of the Kyoshi warriors, Suki daughter of Ai and Koi, a veritable prodigy in the traditional fighting styles of her order, both armed and unarmed; Toph Bei Fong, a prodigy earthbender, daughter of Grand Duke Lao of Gaoling, and the inventor of metalbending; Sokka son of Hakoda, of the Southern Water Tribe: swordsman, strategist, and initiate of the Order of the White Lotus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was foregone conclusion, really. Lee wasn't a firebender, or any sort of fighter, and he was caught off guard besides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outcome was the same. Sokka, Suki, and Toph ambushed the engineer, knocking him out and taking a map of the airship, before storming the bridge and beginning one of the most overwhelming examples of guts and strategic cunning triumphing over vastly superior firepower. The three of them working together were able to decimate the Phoenix King's air force, saving Earth Kingdom from perishing in flames. Just as in canon, the outcome was the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the aftermath wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a small tavern in the \"former\" Fire Nation colony of Yu Dao, a bedraggled, possibly concussed mainlander was chattering excitedly as he regaled a small crowd of drunks who had nothing better to do with his account of the Battle of Wulong Forest. He was not much of a story teller, prone to rambling and straying off track, and the stories of that battle had been traded back and forth for weeks, now, ever since the news of the Phoenix King's defeat, but his account provided an unusual perspective, and insight, into the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee had been there, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just gotten to the part where he had been ambushed by the three saboteurs lying in wait, having gone to great length in describing every detail of his assailants' features, when he was stopped by a scrawny old graybeard with a vaguely disgruntled air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that boy!\" he shouted angrily, jumping up in his seat when Lee finished describing the dark-skinned young swordsman. \"That's the Water Tribe boy who traveled with the Avatar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few snorts from the other assembled personages, and one of the drunks skeptically asked the old merchant, \"And how would you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark look came into the man's eyes, and he simply snarled, \"I'll never forget his face, or his friends' faces.\" Continuing, his voice barely above a hiss, \"He's a menace to cabbages everywhere. The whole lot of them are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally such a proclamation would have earned uproarious laughter from the crowd, but at the dangerous expression on the man's face the mirth died away in their throats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a heavy, pregnant silence for a moment, before one of the patrons finally ventured a nervous, \"Well, anyone could <i>say </i>that one of the Avatar's buddies was there. 'S'just common sense, innit?\" he said, and the others nodded in somewhat hesitant agreement. \"Yeah! Anyone could say that,\" the man continued, more confidently. \"But d'ya have any <i>proof?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mainlander grinned. \"What do you know about the Water Tribe boy?\" he replied with a question of his own. He had a look on his face like he had been counting on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was quiet for a moment as they collectively mulled over this question. After a couple of minutes, one of the more recent arrivals, who hadn't had much to drink yet, spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't his sister the Waterbender? The Avatar's lover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the more haggard drunks nodded. \"Yeah! And he were wunna them non-bendin' warrior types, 'ccordin' ter me cousin in the navy. Wit' a, what do they call it, a, a 'boomy-ranger', or summat o' the sort, weren't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, the Boomerang Guy?\" asked one of the slower patrons, to a chorus of nods and murmuring from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I thought he was Meat and Sarcasm Guy?</i>\" whispered another, but he was hushed by his drinking buddies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye,\" said a grizzled-looking campaigner in one corner of the crowd, gaining the attention of the listeners. In that single syllable, he had spoken with such authority that they were compelled to take notice, his face and arms marked with countless old battle scars, and a sizable chunk missing from his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've fought with tha sort before,\" he continued in a salty accent, \"them scurvy, savage Swertings. Ach, they're a fierce lot tae reckon with, I'll tell ye tha'. Near lost me right arm to one o' their warrior types back durin' Azulon's raids. Let me say, ye dinnae want ter unneressimate a Swerting wit' a boomerang! nay unless ye've a death wish. And I pertickerly wouldna want tae face agin' summan like tha' boy what's said tae travel with the Avatar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old sailor paused, his eyes flitting from side to side. He had the attention of the whole bar now - even Lee was paying rapt attention to the veteran's rambling - and the crowd had by this point swollen to near twice it's earlier size. After a moment of breathless silence, the man continued, his voice scarce above a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A<i> swordsman</i>, they say he be,\" he said the word with considerable weight, allowing the implication to sink into the minds of his new audience. \"Them Southern Tribe warriors be able tae fight well enough wit' nary more than clubs and spears and them whatsit boomerangs. Fermidable enuff, I'd say they be. Ach, but this lad, this <i>Boomerang Guy</i>, he dinnae settle jes' fer tha', ach no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Swerting wit' a sword!\" he exclaimed wonderingly, \"An' a magic one, a' tha', if half the stories're tae be believed. Able ter cut <i>snicker-snack</i> right through whatever ye please, easy as tha'. An' black as night, the blade be (or so they say), wit' a gilt handle an' magic spells an' all.\" The old man shook his head. \"Ach, tha's naught I'd e'er want ter face. That'd be tae mooch ter ask o' an old man. Tae mooch ter ask o' any man what be in his right mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving said his peace, the grizzled veteran reclined in his seat and took a drag of his pipe, letting the discussion return to the matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mainlander, Lee, grinned again, and he eagerly reclaimed the crowd's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right,\" he said. \"This Water Tribe boy, this boomerang guy, he had a black sword. Everyone who's heard the stories knows that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some nodding and a general tone of assent from the various gathered drunks and rascals, and Lee's grin widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just so happen to have irrefutable proof that he was there!\" he declared proudly, before withdrawing a long, slender object from the depths of his tattered outfit. It was a sword, a <i>jian</i> of peerless craftsmanship. The blade was black, with a gilded handle, and the pommel was engraved with the image of a lotus. \"This is the very sword the boy was using!\" he proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been pure luck that, when Lee swam ashore from being dropped straight from the airship's holding bay along with most of the other crew, he happened across this sword. The weapon had been embedded up to its hilt in the scorched and blackened trunk of a burnt and cracked oak. He almost hadn't seen it, at first, but while nervously looking for a place to do his business, he had been astonished to notice the ash-covered hilt sticking out of the charred, skeletal tree's trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, not being one to ignore such an opportunity when it's given to him, Lee had eagerly prized the weapon from the tree. And imagine his surprise when he saw it to be the same sword born by the Water Tribe boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one of the worldlier, more cynical patrons scoffed at Lee's claim, saying, \"<i>If</i> that is the Wet's sword - and that is one <i>hell</i> of an if - then why in the world would <i>you</i> have it, and not the Wet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Lee was not the one who answered this question. Someone else was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Wolf threw it,\" interjected a gruff, harsh voice. \"He threw it to take out one of my men. The blade sheared clear through one of the airship's wings. Cut through tempered, reinforced steel like it wasn't even there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speaker, a man who had been up until then sitting at the counter, quietly nursing a strong drink, shifted the hood of his cloak from his face to reveal sharp amber eyes and a stern countenance lined with the passage of years. He had a short, black beard shot through with streaks of pepper-gray. Yet even as unkempt and bedraggled as the man was, he still managed to project an air of unmistakable discipline and authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell's this Wolf?\" one of the drunker patrons inquired as politely as they could manage in their heavily inebriated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Wolf is the boy, if you could not infer as much from context,\" the man replied curtly, \"and the boy is the Wolf: Sokka of the Southern Water Tribe, one of the Avatar's original traveling companions, according to the reports. His armor bore the same clan markings as the armor of the Southern Water Tribe's current chief, Hakoda the White Wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis name garnered some recognition. Hakoda, the leader of a band of Southern Water Tribe warriors, had been a known thorn in the Fire Nation's side during the last several years of the war. His daring, unconventional tactics and ferocity in battle had earned him a good deal of infamy, as well as the moniker of the White Wolf, and no small price on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, seeing the crowd's reaction, pulled a water damaged scroll out of his pocket, unfurling it and showing its contents to the crowd. It was a wanted notice with the stamp of the previous Fire Lord, Ozai Azulon's son. On it, there was a sketch of the young man, giving his name as Sokka, along with a list of aliases, a general rundown of the offenses for which he was wanted, as well as a note that he was wanted <i>'alive, if possible.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As of my last briefing before the... <i>incident</i>... at Wulong Forest, I was informed that the boy was believed to be the son of the White Wolf after breaking him and two others out of the Boiling Rock-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis earned a collective spit take from those patrons familiar with Fire Nation strongholds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boomerang guy broke out of the Boiling Rock?-!\" exclaimed one, who looked to be of heavily Fire Nation descent. \"Ash and <i>soot</i>,\" he swore, \"That's unbelievable! How could a kid do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By being crazy, I guess,\" reasoned another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That or some sort of tactical genius,\" agreed a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, didn't he and those two girls take down the entire air fleet by themselves?\" interjected yet another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There had to have been more,\" someone else protested disbelievingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only saw the three,\" said Lee with a shrug. \"If there were more than that, I didn't see any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the discussion progressed, and the seeds of a legend began to grow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gossip was a strange thing. Jeong-Jeong, were he writing this narrative, might compare it to fire. It had a life of its own, it grew and changed and <i>consumed</i> as only a living thing could. It spread quickly, dangerously, impossible to control and all too often destroying everything it touched. It was dangerous, best avoided, best snuffed out before it grew too large to extinguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a rather apt analogy, all things told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumors, similarly, were also a lot like weeds. If you did not nip them in the bud as soon as they appeared, before you knew it they would be everywhere. They spread with uncanny ease, taking up all available space and choking out more desirable plants. If you failed to stop them before they could spread, then either you learned to live with them or you got down on your hands and knees and started the long, hard, dirty work of digging up the entirety of your lawn or garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it really was strange how quickly these things could travel. Spy masters with networks more vast and tangled than a modern celebrity's friend list on a social networking site, dedicated couriers and specially bred messenger hawks trained to take the swiftest routes physically possible with only the barest amount of rest, and still simple gossip traveled faster than could possibly be tracked, or matched, by even the best intelligence networks in the Four Nations - almost before it was here, it was already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed impossible how quickly simple barroom tales and idle rumors could travel, or how far and wide they could spread. Or how they could change in the spreading. Like living organisms mutating and evolving from one generation to the next, the tales that were told of Sokka son of Hakoda in that bar that night grew and changed with every retelling - and there were <i>many</i> retellings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne slightly scrawny engineer became a dangerous firebender became several firebenders became an entire army that he fought off with nothing more than a boomerang and his wits. Two female compatriots became two scantily clad female compatriots became two well-endowed scantily clad female compatriots who were also his secret lovers and part of a vast harem of beautiful and dangerous ladies from every corner of the world. A desperate attempt to catch Ozai or stop the fleet became a daring effort to blunt the tip of the proverbial spear that was the Fire Nation's air force became a perfectly executed plan to hold off the entire rest of the army while the Avatar dealt with the Fire Lord alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tale, you might say, grew in the telling. As it spread from one ear to the next, it became gradually more embellished, more fantastic. As it traveled up the coast and further inland, people who had met Sokka over the course of his travels with the Avatar added their own anecdotes and perspectives to the continually evolving legend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy with the boomerang? I remember him. He warned our village of a plot to blow up the dam upriver and helped us evacuate. Saved our skins, he did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kid was a damn fine fisherman, a real natural. Brought in a shark with his bare hands!\" (\"No he didn't, you crazy old coot!\" \"Get off my back, woman!\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka? Ohhh yeaahhh, I remember him. He's that kid with the arrow tattoo on his head, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard his first lover was the princess of the North Pole, but she sacrificed her life to become the Moon Spirit. They say he still longs for her embrace on nights of the full moon, too! Isn't that just the <i>most romantic?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember that boy, helped save my hide. Fought off a swarm of canyon crawlers in nothing but a loincloth, I tell ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, man he was a real chatty guy, wasn't he, Lilz? Yeeaaahh. A real funny little guy, that Sokka, with those big pointy ears and them fuzzy little paws. And he could <i>fly!</i> Maaaan, I'd never seen a monkey that could do <i>that</i> before! (...Well, okay, there was this <i>one</i> time...)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to the help him and his friends, myself and our village's other earthbenders were able to escape from that Fire Nation prison barge. His sister motivated us to rebel, and his ingenuity provided us with the earth we needed to fight the guards - the coal they were using for fuel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He helped me perfect my hot air balloon design, before it was stolen by the Fire Nation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SEEEECREET TUNNNEEEEEEEL! SEEEECREET TUNNNEEEEEEEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE BOULDER suspects that there may be a THING between him and the BLIND BANDIT. But you did NOT hear THAT from THE BOULDER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't hear it from me, but word has it that, this Sokka dude? His girlfriend is some sorta <i>crazy hot</i> amazon chick who can jump, like, ten stories into the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tellin' ya, man, that kid's the one pulling the Avatar's strings. It makes sense. <i>Think about it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear he's part of some sort of ancient secret society spanning all across the Four Nations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear he's its <i>leader</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on it went. Like a snowball rolling down a hill, the legend of Sokka grew larger and larger as it traveled, gaining more momentum with every retelling. From Yu Dao barflies and rumormongers, the tale passed to traveling merchants and sailors, who carried it with them as they continued along their trade routes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver land and sea it spread, the tale thriving in bars and taverns and inns and docks, where it passed from the tongues of merchants to the ears of locals, who themselves shared the stories with their friends and their families, and other merchants traveling by other trade routes. This process repeated itself many times, the legend of Sokka Hakoda's son, friend and adviser to the Avatar, vanquisher of the Phoenix King's fleet, defender of the Earth Kingdom, and Hero of the Hundred Year War spreading throughout the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who can say how or why his tale managed to grab the hearts and minds of the people so? Perhaps it was because this Sokka, like so many others, was a non-bender, and yet in spite of that still able to stand proudly - as an equal - alongside the likes of the Fire Lord, and the Avatar. Here was someone like them, someone who had been born with no special gift (save perhaps a certain knack for resourcefulness), no bending, and yet had still been able to make his way alongside the greats of his era.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo non-benders the world over, the tale of Sokka was, perhaps, something that gave them hope that they too could make a difference if they tried, that they too could become <i>great</i>. To the downtrodden masses, it represented a hope that one day the wounds of the war could be forgotten. After all, had not Sokka also lost loved ones to the Fire Nation? Had he not also fought them wherever he could? Yet now he was accounted a friend of the Fire Lord, a fellow liberator of the Fire Nation. If he could forgive and forget, than maybe so could they.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut frankly, to them he became as much a symbol as a man. He was like a living legend, a modern day folk hero. He was larger-than-life, but he still felt approachable. And perhaps<i> that</i>, more than anything else, was what made his tale so beloved, so compelling. He was, ultimately, underneath all of the enshrouding myth and memetic mutation, simply just another Average Joe, like you or me. Not a banished prince, or a destined savior, or a prodigy bender; he was just a guy with a boomerang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and it was also still one HELL of a tale.</span></div></div>",

In fact, if he was to be entirely honest with himself, the whole last month had really just been nothing but one headache after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all started with the news of the defeat of the Fire Lord (or was it the Phoenix King?) at the hands of the Avatar, and the report of the newly crowned Fire Lord Zuko's call for the immediate withdrawal of all nonessential Fire Nation military personnel from the Earth Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, ostensibly, this was a good thing for the Earth Kingdom and its citizens - <i>the war was over! the war was over!</i> - people like Lao Bei Fong and his wife, Poppy. And it <i>was</i>, for the most part. At the very least, Lao was certainly grateful that he no longer had to fear his estate being stormed and his assets seized by Fire Nation troops. No, now he just had to worry about being audited by the Earth King and strung up by the gibbet for the crime of treason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, yes, I suppose you could say that old Lao was in something of a pickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, the Bei Fongs had for generations been one of the wealthiest families in the world. They were a very old, very <i>prestigious</i> family that had for centuries profited heavily from international trade. They had strong ties to wealthy merchant and noble families throughout the world, ties of business and marriage dating back to several centuries before the Hundred Year War. For nearly a thousand years, the Bei Fong family had enjoyed its reputation as one of the wealthiest, most influential families in the world. For twenty-four generations, the heads of the Bei Fong family had benefited from partnership and trade between the Four Nations - Lao's own great-great-great-grandfather had dined with both the Earth King and Fire Lord, and negotiated the safe passage of Bei Fong merchant ships between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes after a dispute between the two Chiefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Winged Boar had endured through countless challenges and hardships, and always they had come out on the top of the heap. Through generations of ruthless political maneuvering and countless marriages of convenience (Lao's own wife had been the eldest daughter of a wealthy, young family of Yu Dao industrialists), the Bei Fong family had managed to thrive and prosper for centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genocide of the Air Nomads - the Rape of the Four Temples, as Lao had heard it called in a rambling poem by some unknown author - shocked the world, and the Fire Nation's subsequent assaults on the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes made it basically everyone's enemy. And for many years, the Bei Fong family - which had prior to the war profited extensively from a number interests in the Fire Nation's booming economy - fell into relative obscurity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor, you see, Mao Bei Fong, Lao's grandfather and the head of the family during the reign of Sozin, had been a very patriotic soul. The moment he learned of the war, he severed all of their family's <i>extensive</i> ties with the Fire Nation (no small feat, since more than a few daughters of wealthy Fire Nation families had married into the Bei Fongs over the generations), and invested the vast majority of the family's liquid assets into local Earth Kingdom businesses. Unfortunately, as patriotic as Mao was, he did not have the most economic sense, and several of his most important investments failed catastrophically, leaving the Bei Fong family in rather dire straits, financially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Lao's father, Long Bei Fong, had been a more practical sort. When Long took over the family business, the first thing he did was salvage their connections in the Fire Nation, secretly investing most of the Bei Fong family's remaining capital in various promising Fire Nation industries. Long's gamble paid off considerably better than his father's had, and by the time he retired to let his son take over the reins, the Bei Fong family had regained most of its former wealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLao, in turn, had followed shrewdly in his father's tracks, secretly continuing business with Fire Nation merchants and industrialists, with the continued prosperity of the Winged Boar to show for it. Everything had been going <i>swimmingly</i>, really. Aside from his daughter's blindness (an unfortunate condition that tended to pop up every few generations in the Bei Fong line) and his continued failure to produce a suitable heir - and goodness <i>knows</i> how hard he had tried - things had been going well enough for the Bei Fong family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, right until the day the Avatar chose to <i>grace</i> their home with his presence, demand <i>his</i> daughter as an earthbending teacher, and - when Lao quite reasonably said <i>no</i> - abduct said daughter and spirit her away to who <i>knows</i> where. And now the war was over, the dust was clearing, his daughter was suddenly a great war hero and NOT a helpless kidnapping victim, and the Earth King's tax collectors were beginning to ask Lao about his supposed \"off-shore accounts\" and more suspicious investments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLao glanced around somewhat nervously at the decor of the restored Bei Fong manor. Never before had he noticed quite how... <i>Fire Nation</i>... it looked. All dragons and volcanoes and wooden furnishings, with not so much as a single badger mole in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if this was the way the Bei Fong manor had been decorated for generations, Lao still knew that auditors might find it suspicious when added up with other small incongruencies, and suspicious auditors digging through his financial records was the<i> last </i>thing he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLao sighed. He knew that there<i> was</i> one way he might be able to salvage things without spending thousands of gold pieces on bribing high ranking officials, and his wife Poppy knew it, too. The time was come for their daughter to do her duty to the family. The two of them had decided as much the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arranged marriage would be for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question was, <i>who?</i> Lao knew that the most effective way to quash any rumors of treasonous past dealings would be to engage his daughter, Toph Bei Fong, to someone in high standing with the Earth King, at the very least. It would also be very helpful if this person were a war hero or commander of some sort, a man who had fought against the Fire Nation and been recognized for his service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdeally, the chosen suitor should be young, promising, someone who represented the future of the Earth Kingdom, and of the world as a whole. Somebody handsome, charming, charismatic - a darling of the masses and a friend to the nobility. Someone with plenty of business sense, and either a strong enough will to rein in their wild child of a daughter, or else enough patience to endure her antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLao shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but where could I ever hope to find such a person?\" he opined, shaking his head once more before looking down to go through the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when he saw it. That blasted messenger hawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scowled, thinking bitterly of the letter his daughter had wrote her. And by association, his mind went also to young Toph's traveling companions, and Lao recalled some interesting rumors he had recently overheard some of his servants sharing during one of their breaks, wild accounts of a certain Water Tribe boy's exploits in the war - a young man who just so happened to be one of his daughter's traveling companions, and one of whom his daughter was most certainly fond, if Lao still knew anything about a young maiden's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the head of the Bei Fong family smiled craftily, the seeds of a plan already beginning to take root in his mind.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka wasn't entirely sure when it started. At first, he didn't notice the curious looks sent his way, or the whispers that seemed to die out when he entered a room, only to redouble when he left. Not at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartly, this was because he had <i>already</i> been receiving some such treatment. When he and the rest of the team had come back to Ba Sing Se, they had been welcomed as heroes. There had even been a festival and everything, courtesy of the newly re-enthroned Earth King Kuei and the liberation forces of the Order of the White Lotus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been plenty of food \u2013 cuisine of every kind, from all over the world, and even some traditional Air Nomad dishes courtesy of King Bumi (not that Sokka touched those) \u2013 and drink \u2013 ranging from plain water and fruit juice to fine tea (the brewing of which Iroh had personally supervised) and strong wine (Sokka <i>may or may not</i> have slipped a few drinks for himself and his girlfriend, Suki) \u2013 as well as music and dancing. Just about everyone \u2013 from the leanest shoe-shining refugee to the fattest old money noble \u2013 had partaken in the celebrations, and all had hailed Aang and his friends as conquering heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had gotten no small amount of praise that night, and he and Toph and Suki were entreated to share the story of their sabotage of Ozai's airfleet so many times that, by the time the night was through, they had all but perfected the telling of their tale. Of course, Aang was still the star of the show, so to speak, and had received the lion's share of the accolades, but Sokka and the others still had plenty of admirers of their own to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara probably got the second most attention next to Aang, and a disconcertingly large portion of that attention had come in the form of girls asking about her love life and guys asking her for a dance. If Aang hadn't subsequently proceeded to, somewhat clumsily if not inarguably sweetly, make it <i>very</i> clear that he and Katara were a couple, Sokka was certain that someone would have wound up getting their ass frozen to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, Suki had also attracted no small amount of creeps (even if several of the guys flirting with her <i>were</i> genuinely charming and suave and respectful, the mere fact that they were hitting on <i>his</i> girlfriend meant that Sokka automatically categorized them as such), although she was perhaps more graceful in handling her unwanted admirers. It helped that they were much better behaved than Katara's: only one guy had been so foolish as to attempt copping a feel off of her. The fact that the creep's arm <i>just so happened</i> to SNAP quite suddenly and mysteriously the <i>instant</i> he tried to pinch the Kyoshi Warrior's butt probably had something to do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Ba Sing Se's continued existence, nobody was stupid enough to try anything on Toph. The fact that the blind earthbender had kicked off the celebrations by jumping off of Appa's back, stomping a foot on the ground to cause a tremor strong enough to flatten a whole city block, and shouting \"ALRIGHT, YOU LOSERS! LET'S KNOCK SOME HEADS!\" almost <i>certainly</i> had nothing to do with it \u2013 surely not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, even Zuko and his apparently-no-longer-quite-an-ex-girlfriend Mai got their fair share of praise and adoration from the Ba Sing Se citizenry, who were apparently just happy that there would finally be a Fire Lord in power who WASN'T visibly power-hungry <i>or</i> maniacal. The prince was visibly flustered by all this attention from people he clearly believed should have hated him, but his date looked as inscrutably uninterested as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sokka? Well, he was mostly just glad that the crutch and broken leg gave him a ready-made excuse for turning down all of those invitations he was getting from his female admirers to come and dance. He'd had enough trouble as it was just trying to convince the ladies that he was already in a committed relationship with Suki. (Though he was still more than happy to entertain them with exaggerated tales of his exploits, sprinkled with plenty of bad jokes.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah, it wasn't as though Sokka hadn't already been being treated as something of a celebrity. They all were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they <i>still</i> were, even a month after the end of the war and the liberation of Ba Sing Se. Even a month later, people would still stop them in the middle of the street to <i>thank them</i> for what they had done, especially Aang. He was the Avatar, after all. The keeper of the balance, the great bridge between the... spiritual thingy and the material whatsit. You know: savior of the world, mortal incarnation of the planet's immortal spirit, all that jazz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn comparison to all that \u2013 heck, in comparison to any of the Gaang \u2013 Sokka was nothing special. And now that the war was over, <i>he was okay with that</i>. Sure, it still smarted a little bit whenever he saw his friends doing these amazing things with magic or chi or whatever without even <i>thinking</i> about it while he had to work his ass off just to not look completely useless next to them, but he was okay with that. Honest, he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what if even his girlfriend, who was a non-bending warrior like himself, made him look so hopelessly clumsy and inept whenever they sparred? So what if losing boomerang and space sword had been like losing a <i>piece</i> of himself, a piece that he still missed? He didn't <i>need </i>to try to be this big, strong, fearless warrior anymore \u2013 he no longer had to pretend at being something he wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe war was over. He didn't need to act like a warrior anymore, didn't need to pretend that he could possibly make any real difference in a fight. He wasn't strong or brave or anything he felt a man <i>should</i> be, but that was okay. Katara didn't need him to protect her anymore, the tribe no longer needed him. The former had a boyfriend to take care of her (and was also <i>more</i> than capable of doing so herself!), and the latter now had waterbenders from the North <i>as well as</i> all of the men who had finally returned from the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Sokka was concerned, he wasn't strong or special or necessary, but<i> whatever</i>. The war was over. There was peace now, more or less. He was famous, kinda, and even a bit of a hero, perhaps. Hell, he had somehow even managed to catch the attention of an <i>incredible</i> young woman who was so strong and beautiful and completely out of his league (he pointedly ignored what his track record with women had to say on this matter), and yet had still decided to go out with him. As far as he was concerned, that alone made him just about the luckiest son of a polar bear dog on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still. Even with as nicely and admiringly people had been treating him for the past month, there started to be noticeable \u2013 if subtle \u2013 shift in their attitudes toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, he had generally just been seen as<i> that guy</i>, you know, the one who tagged along with the Avatar and did some stuff in the war. He'd gotten enough respect from the old officers and gray-haired veteran soldier types he ran into on the street, and he'd certainly had his fair share of female admirers, but honestly no special attention had been paid to him compared to the rest of the group. Even as a war hero, he had just been the meat and sarcasm guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the past week, something had <i>changed</i>. It was subtle at first \u2013 merchants giving him small discounts, girls flirting with him a just a little more forwardly, people more frequently nodding respectfully or saying hello when they passed him in the street. Subtle. Little things that he didn't even notice at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as the week progressed, subtlety diminished, and soon Sokka's friends were beginning to take note of the unusual treatment he was getting. They took it in stride at first, but when they saw that Sokka wasn't even aware of the change they started to ask questions, and make comments on these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey noticed the discounts that became steeper, and the merchants who began occasionally adding on a free thing here or there to his purchases. They saw the numbers of flirtatious admirers grow, and heard some astonishingly shameless propositions slipped in among the compliments and pleasantries. And they perceived that the nods and greetings became more frequent, more reverent, and they even caught a few outright stopping and bowing to Sokka when he was just passing by.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Seriously, Snoozles, did you even<i> see</i> the way those guys were looking at you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka quirked an eyebrow at Toph, who was lazily walking down the street beside him. Her hands were behind her head and she was whistling snatches of some refrain he couldn't quite place, her pale jade eyes staring ahead sightlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did <i>you?</i>\" he replied half-jokingly, eyeing his companion with a hint of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that. We both know that while my<i> eyes</i> might be blind, these feet of mine\u2014\" she kicked a leg up extra-high on her next step to illustrate \"\u2014can read people better than anything else, and they're telling me that those guys were looking at you like some kind of hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka shrugged dismissively. \"Well, we kind of <i>are</i>,\" he said, waving off his pal's remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, duh,\" Toph snarked. \"Of course <i>we</i> are. But <i>we</i> weren't the ones they were looking at. <i>You</i> were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there really a difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was quiet for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. I'unno,\" she finally grunted in reply. \"Maybe I'm just imagining things. After all,\" she said, a smirk growing on her face. \"I can't imagine why anyone would want to look at <i>you</i> when pure awesomeness incarnate is walking down the street right next to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka snorted, the sound almost covering the chuckle he got out of his friend's words. \"You're probably just so short that they didn't even notice you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's fist shot out and caught Sokka in the arm, causing the Water Tribe teen to yelp and rub the bruise that was already beginning to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, Toph, I was only kidding,\" Sokka grumbled, pausing to inspect the damage. He grimaced. \"Owww, geez. Those fists of yours are ridiculous. How can something so tiny hurt so bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grinned. \"I'm just that good,\" she said cockily, prompting Sokka to shake his head and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you <i>are</i> good, I'll give you that,\" he replied, giving a playful clap on the back. \"Probably the scariest little girl I'll ever meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would that be the good kind of scary, or the bad kind?\" Toph asked him frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, of <i>course</i>. I mean, one kind is like Azula, while the other is like\u2014\" she began to say, only to abruptly stop mid-sentence. She was frozen in mid-stride for a moment, an inscrutable expression on her face. But then it passed, and she said, \"\u2014<i>Suki...?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka made a weird face. \"What's like Suki?\" he asked. \"I mean, I know she's scary, but it's more a <i>hot</i> kind of scary, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph snorted. \"Not <i>that</i>, genius. She's <i>here</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Here?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka squeaked, sounding like he was almost afraid to hope. The morning after the post-war celebrations a month ago, Suki had taken the first ferry out of Ba Sing Se. She'd had obligations to the Kyoshi Warriors that she needed to fulfill, and aside from a few sporadic letters Sokka hadn't heard from her since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs inseparable as he and Suki were when together, neither of them were really very good at written correspondence, and the collection of letters from Suki that Sokka had stashed in his drawing desk drawer read more like official military status reports than love letters. They were both very tactile, expressive people, and the written word simply could not convey the subtle nuances of intonation and gesticulation that they so often relied upon to convey their meanings to one another. The two of them were very good at expressing their feelings through their actions, and they certainly were not afraid of physical intimacy, but try to get one of them to just put their feelings into <i>words</i> and suddenly they'd be stuttering and stammering and making a complete ass out of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them could work up the courage to actually write down any of the sorts of sweet nothings they would usually be trading all the time in person, and most of their correspondence could be more-or-less summarized thus:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'm fine, thanks. And you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good. How about you?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally as a result of this, Sokka was a little bit unsure of where exactly he currently stood with his girlfriend. So the news that she was present in the city, unannounced, was as much a cause for apprehension as it was for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Here?</i>\" Sokka repeated in what he would later insist was a perfectly manly tone of voice. \"Where's <i>here?</i> Define <i>here</i>,\" he exclaimed in a somewhat panicky tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph gave her college best at rolling her eyes, but she answered his question. \"In the city, somewhere. I dunno where, for sure, but I felt her presence at the edge of my senses...\" she paused, before turning and pointing a hand in a north-by-northwesterly direction. \"...somewhere <i>that</i> way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's eyes brightened. \"How close is she?\" he asked eagerly. It sounded like his excitement at the prospect of seeing his girlfriend again had officially overtaken his anxiety over why she might be here unannounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph frowned thoughtfully. \"Well, for all it's faults, this city is at least build on some real good, solid earth. It's packed in there real tight, see, so vibrations can travel a lot more easily than they would somewhere else, and that lets me pick things up a lot from pretty far away \u2013 assuming I can feel it through all of the background noise. I'm not feeling Suki now, so she was definitely at the very edge of sensing range, probably headed in the other direction... so I'd say maybe three, four miles at <i>least</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Sokka, a hint of something like awe in his voice. \"And you can detect <i>everybody</i> within that range?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In every direction,\" said Toph with a nod, \"as long they're touching the ground, or else something made of earth or metal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka whistled. \"Awesome,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one word, but the tone he used spoke volumes, and it was clear that he meant every ounce of the sentiment. The vibrations of their feet against the packed, hardened street bounced up and down Sokka's body, and the information Toph received from her feet told her of facial muscles shifting into a wide smile. The steady <i>ba-da-bump ba-da-bump</i> of his heartbeat, and the familiar clumsy, loping gait of long legs and big feet that the teen had yet to fully grow into filled Toph's belly with a giddy fluttering sensation. She felt a faint warmth in her cheeks as the older boy grabbed her hand and turned them around to go in the direction she had pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Lead the way, O fearless badgermole,\" said Sokka, half-facetious and half-sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph smiled softly, turning her face downwards to hide the expression, her fingers tingling pleasantly as his big, warm, calloused hands squeezed hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she said, before twisting her hand out of his grip and punching him again in the arm. Grinning widely, she began jogging ahead. Turning her head to face over her shoulder, she called out to the young warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick up the pace, Snoozles! You're gonna have to really hustle if you don't want to be left behind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blinked. Then, after a moment of staring, he snapped out of his daze and started jogging after her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a very fine day in Ba Sing Se. The sun was bright overhead, but it was not too hot out. It was about a few weeks into autumn, after all, and the worst of the summer heat was behind them. The air was cooler, now, the wind crisp and sharp with the soft nip of early fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough even during winter the weather in the Impenetrable City was warm, and the temperatures there had not once in living memory come even within spitting distance of freezing, there was still a difference to be felt with the changing of the seasons. Winter was still colder than the rest of the year, for instance, and it tended to be pretty rainy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the crowded markets and bazaars of the Middle and Lower rings, this difference was not yet noticeable. The heat of hundreds, even thousands, of bodies packed tightly together in massive, pulsing throngs as shoppers passed to and fro examining goods made it feel like they were still in the dog days of summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe indistinct buzz of merchants and shoppers chatting and haggling with one another filled the air, an almost deafening white noise that would ring in one's ears for hours afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt this scene would seem stifling, even suffocating, to someone from out in the country: the air hot and heavy with the smells of perfumes and incense and produce and meat, as well as the pungent, combined body odor of hundreds of city-dwellers, both washed and unwashed. It was borderline claustrophobic, so many people being packed together in so small a space, with scarcely any room to move or breathe without bumping against someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Suki, commander of the Kyoshi Warriors, who had only once before inside Ba Sing Se proper, it was an experience she would much prefer to have never repeated. She had never liked crowds. She worked best with just a few allies at her side \u2013 she tended to feel almost overwhelmed whenever she was faced with large numbers of people. Back on Kyoshi Island, this was never a problem. The population there was not very large, and people knew when to give a Kyoshi Warrior her space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were easily one and a half times as many people on this single street, in this single market <i>alone</i>, than lived on all of Kyoshi Island put together, and Suki could barely stand it. She did not like having her personal space invaded. It went against everything she had ever learned from her mentors to let people she <i>didn't even know</i> inside her private bubble. As a trained warrior, her instincts screamed at her every time she felt another body brush up against her, and as a woman she was certain that the only thing keeping the wandering hands of opportunistic perverts at bay was the manner of her attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor she was dressed in her uniform as a Kyoshi Warrior, resplendent in a practical green kimono cut and tailored to ensure minimal restriction of movement, over which she wore a layered lamellar of treated, hardened leather that provided sufficient protection to the torso for her purposes as a fighter. Her face was painted white as snow, with lips blood red and eyes lined in black that stretched up at the outer corners, creating almost the impression of some glaring, otherworldly creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weapons she carried at her hips probably also had something to do with it, as did the obvious rancor in her piercing glance as she flitted her eyes this way and that, instinctively scanning the crowd for potential threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Suki made her way through the mass of people. Her destination was near, she could feel it in her bones. Once she got through the worst of the heavy foot traffic in the marketplace, she would be finally able to breathe easily once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as Suki neared the edge of the crowds, she heard a murmuring begin. It was not like the cacophony of speech and laughter and pleasantries and insults that had been pounding in her ears before. No, it was quieter, much quieter. People had stopped and begun to stare at something she could not see, and she could hear a buzz of hushed whispers that were just scarcely at the edge of audibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not make out what was being said at first, but before she could strain her ears in an attempt to see if she could make anything out, Suki heard a familiar voice shout<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUKI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand suddenly the crowd before her had parted and a lean, hard, warm body had collided with hers, wrapping strong yet slender arms around her waist. Her first instinct, a gut reflex in response to this sudden, unwanted breach of her personal space, was to flip her assailant over and toss them to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost did it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then her brain stopped her. She remembered this body, she remembered its contours melding with her own in the heat of passion, recalled the warmth that filled her at its touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Suki smiled, and she leaned in to plant a soft, chaste, but undeniably warm kiss on the young man's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Sokka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boyfriend gushed happily and hugged her tighter.</span></div></div>",

The feeling of their heart rates skyrocketing as the two young lovers greeted one another in such a shamelessly touchy-feely fashion made her feel sick to her stomach, for more than one reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the first time, Toph cursed the insight her enhanced senses gave her into Sokka and Suki's little reunion. Spending the first half of her life well and truly blind had caused her to rely more on other senses, like smell and hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wished she could say that she didn't know the scent currently coming off of the pair \u2013 faint but still detectable under the numerous, varied aromas of the marketplace \u2013 but that would have been a lie. One could not spend over six years of their life with the ability to \"see\" through the earth without picking up <i>some</i> unwanted knowledge on certain facts of life, even growing up in such a sheltered environment as Toph did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she knew very well where babies came from. It was not something she was very <i>happy</i> to know, and she did her best not to dwell on it, but she knew very well what happened when a man and a woman (or a man and a man, or woman and a woman, or even a man and a woman and a man...) \"loved each other very much,\" as her matron had put it when she had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not, of course, to say that Toph was by any means an expert on the subject. She certainly knew much more about it than a girl her age probably <i>should</i>, but it was all stuff she had picked up through observation (and she knew it sounded <i>wrong</i> when said like that, but it really wasn't as though she could just switch her tremor sense on or off, short of suspending herself off of the ground on something made of wood, but even that only dampened the vibrations).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph did her best to ignore the heightened pulses, the hitched breathing, the certain bits of anatomy stirring to life as Sokka and Suki continued to get all kissy-faced with each other. It gave her the oogies, hearing and feeling the two older teens acting like this. And not just because the two were acting so sappy and sugary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scowled, feeling her stomach knot itself up in some decidedly unpleasant ways as she felt Sokka's and Suki's hands begin to roam, evidently uncaring of who was watching. Deciding to put a stop to this \u2013 more because she wanted that nasty feeling in her gut to go away than out of any concern for Sokka or Suki's dignity \u2013 Toph spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, as much fun as it is listening to the two of you swap spit,\" she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm, \"that order of tea leaves won't pick itself up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, Sokka and Suki blushed and immediately pulled away from one another \u2013 Toph didn't even need to see to know this. She could <i>feel</i> the blood vessels in their faces beginning to swell, could <i>hear</i> the rush of fluid being pumped to their cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, victorious, the ugly feeling vanishing from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Suki softly. \"Sorry. I didn't mean to...\" she trailed off, before changing tack. \"Well, where do you have to go?\" she asked, seeming to quickly rebound from her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" said Sokka slowly. \"I think it was something like...\" he went silent, most likely unable to remember the name of the store. Normally Toph would have gotten impatient and supplied the name for him once it was obvious he could not recall, but this time she felt like letting sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she was feeling vindictive, or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of stumbling over his own tongue, futilely wracking his memory for the name, Sokka finally gave up and began rummaging though his pocket for something. Toph could hear the rustling of skin against fabric and paper and more fabric, and she heard a crinkling noise as Sokka pulled out a small slip of scratch parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here,\" Sokka said, sounding relieved. \"Iroh wrote it down in case we forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'More like in case YOU forgot,'</i> thought Toph, but she did not voice this sentiment. She then \"saw\" Suki bend over slightly, the older girl's eyes probably scanning the piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Herb's Alism Shop?</i>\" the Kyoshi Warrior read out loud in a questioning tone, as though unable to believe what she was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph felt Sokka shift his weight on his feet as he shrugged. \"Guy knows his herbs, according to Iroh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph heard Suki \"Hm,\" and felt the girl pause, before leaning in to quietly whisper something into Sokka's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Do you know, if he might have anything for... more</i> private <i>use?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka stiffened, and Toph gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Suki had decided to tag along, wanting to spend some more time with her boyfriend (the suggestive look she had given him when she'd asked him what other sorts of herbs Herb might stock also clearly indicated that she had an ulterior motive, but he was not about to protest).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo...\" Sokka heard Suki venture after a few more minutes of awkward silence, \"What's a couple of war heroes like yourselves doing running errands for Iroh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounded curious, delicately quirking a single eyebrow at her boyfriend when she met his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka flushed slightly, some very distracting thoughts running through his head as he stared into Suki's eyes. Unbidden, his eyes glanced down at her lips, so full and sweet and inviting and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head furiously to rid it of these thoughts. He could save it for later, he told himself. Now was not the time to be getting all hot and bothered over thoughts of him and Suki making up for lost time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka...?\" said Suki, eyeing him curiously. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" he replied, stammering only briefly at the start before regaining more or less full composure. \"It's nothing, honest. Me and Toph have just had a lot of free time, really. Aside from going to the occasional meeting with the Earth King and his generals to help iron out the details of this whole Harmony Restoration thing, we really haven't had much to do. Even pulling sca\u2014er, I mean, practicing our forms... well, it gets <i>boring</i>, after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smirked at him. \"<i>Practicing</i>, huh? That's funny... certainly not what I heard from <i>Katara...</i>\" she singsonged teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka paled, making a sound remarkably like the squeak of a gerbil pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, either way, we don't really work for Iroh,\" he hurriedly explained, anxious to change the topic. He really did <i>not </i>feel comfortable discussing his and Toph's decidedly less than legal exploits in the Lower Ring. \"We just hang out at the Jasmine Dragon a lot, and help out a bit sometimes. But mostly we just drink tea, swap stories, play pai sho, and paint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then paused, before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, the painting and playing pai sho is more me and Iroh than Toph, but you get the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki nodded. \"I do indeed,\" she said, smiling knowingly at the Water Tribe warrior. Walking alongside him, she casually slipped her hand around his and squeezed. \"So,\" she added after a moment of silence, flashing a vulpine grin at Sokka, \"<i>Painting</i>, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed, ears turning red. He could hear the playful amusement in her tone, and he knew that she was thinking of how his earlier attempts at art had turned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he told her, \"but I think I've really improved this past month, you know? Sifu Piandao has taught me a lot about perspective and depth and stuff like that when he's had the time, and he says my art has really improved from what it used to be like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph nodded, finally deciding to contribute something to this conversation. \"Oh yeah, his art is <i>way</i> better now. It looks just like the real thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka beamed. \"<i>Thank you</i>, Toph! That's so nice of you to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka smacked his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you keep getting me with that?\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, you're just too easy,\" Toph said with a shrug, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki giggled at this exchange, but she also smiled reassuringly at Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If it helps any, I'd be happy to model for you if we have the time later,</i>\" she whispered into his ear, swinging her arm at her side and squeezing his hand in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka turned a shade of red normally reserved for select species of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a short stop at Herb's Alism Shop to pick up what they needed (Suki buying something special for later) and another brief stop at the house where Sokka and Toph and the others lived back in the Upper Ring to let Suki drop off what little luggage she had brought with her to the city and change into a simple, casual blue kimono in the fashion preferred by civilian citizens of Kyoshi, washing the makeup of off her face, before they made their way back to the Jasmine Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, using earthbending to move the stone cart loaded with Iroh's shipment, was the first of them to enter the tea shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Iroh!\" she called out cheerfully, stepping onto the very nice stone tile floor of the Jasmine Dragon. \"We've got your stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, excellent,\" came the old man's voice as he walked over to them. \"I am very grateful that you would go through all that trouble for a simple old man like myself,\" he said humbly, and she could feel the broad grin on his broad face as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Iroh glanced past Toph, and he saw Sokka and Suki come in behind the young earthbender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Young Suki,\" said the jolly old graybeard, recognizing the girl at once as Sokka's more or less official girlfriend. \"It is a rare delight indeed, for these weary, old eyes to see such a radiant young beauty as yourself,\" he said flatteringly, bowing with a flourish. \"You grace this humble tea shop with your loveliness, like a beautiful flower blossoming among the stones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>you</i> are the consummate flatterer,\" said Suki gracefully, smiling demurely at Iroh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alas!\" said the old soldier theatrically, \"It is the curse of such a man as I, to be ever intoxicated by the subtle wine of feminine beauty. Such a frighteningly potent laudanum is the smile of a beautiful woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki giggled, allowing Iroh to take her hand and plant a kiss on the back of it, while Sokka wrapped an arm possessively around her waist (though he was smiling).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph simply scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In all honesty, Sokka was not the biggest fan of tea. Sure, he would drink it if he was given some, and he didn't particularly dislike the stuff. He just didn't really see what the big appeal was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of this could perhaps be attributed to his youth, of course, but another, larger part of it was simply that he had grown up in the South Pole where there were only a few varieties of readily available, edible plants, and the primary source of fuel for fires was... well, <i>dung</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for obvious reasons, tea really wasn't much of a <i>thing</i> in the Southern Water Tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGran-Gran was the only person in the entire tribe that he knew to have been a tea drinker, but that had been back in her youth, when there was still some trade between the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom. But it had been many decades since a merchant ship had made the long and perilous journey to the South Pole to barter such luxury goods in exchange for pelts and furs. The frequent Fire Nation raids had simply made the waters of the South Pole too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, things were changing. With the end of the war and the gradual resuming of trade between nations, it was entirely possible that the Southern Water Tribe might see a resurgence in the popularity of foreign goods like tea and rice wine. Certainly, from what Sokka had read in the letters he had been receiving from his dad as part of their new, regular correspondence, several of the men of the tribe had picked up a taste for various Earth Kingdom dishes and drinks during their time abroad in the war, so it was honestly pretty likely, all told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sokka still did not care all that much for it, personally. He was drinking it more out of habit, honestly, not because he actually <i>liked</i> the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... This new chamomile blend of yours is pretty good,\" said the young warrior as he took an appraising sip from the cup in his hand, taking care not to scald his tongue as he did so. \"It's got a good, distinctive flavor... not too strong, but not weak... I'd give it an eight out of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, furrowing his brow as he took another taste, before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought,\" he said, \" make that a <i>nine</i> out of ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, sitting next to him, nodded. \"Yeah,\" she agreed, \"It's really good, but it could still use some improvement. Maybe you should try using a different pot, or else steep the leaves a little longer. It feels like you didn't give quite enough time for the flavor to diffuse before serving. But other than that, it was great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki blinked, staring from Sokka to Toph and back to Sokka. She was looking at the pair like they had each grown a second head and started singing a barbershop quartet. Then, glancing down at her own cup of tea - which had scarcely touched - Suki briefly felt completely out of her depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she shrugged internally and said, \"Well, <i>I</i> liked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh smiled, nodding his head and humming thoughtfully. \"Mm, yes, good points. They are all very good points,\" he said, before letting out a hearty chortle. \"Well, I suppose I will just have to see what I can do to make it better, then!\" he concluded, to a chorus of grins and nods from Toph, Sokka, and Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This <i>is</i> very good tea though, Iroh,\" said Suki after a moment, taking another sip. \"Nobody else brews it quite like the Jasmine Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh laughed, casually waving off her compliments. There was a faint tinge of pink to his cheeks, though. \"It is nothing special,\" he insisted. \"When you have lived as long as I have, it is only natural that you pick up a thing or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then raised his own cup and took a long slow sip. Setting the cup back down on the table, he was silent for moment, a considering expression on his face. Then he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yes, I think you were right, Toph,\" said he, addressing the earthbender. \"I really <i>should </i>have let the leaves soak for longer than I did. The flavor did not come out at all as much as it could have. I will have to make a note of that for future reference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need me to fetch you a piece of paper?\" asked Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh smiled, but he shook his head. \"No need, I have already written it down on something much easier to keep track of.\" He tapped a finger to the side of his head with a laugh. \"I have a memory like an iron vise grip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure it isn't getting rusty in your old age?\" said Toph teasingly, nudging the old general in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not <i>that</i> old!\" Iroh protested, though his eyes were smiling. \"For instance, I still remember that the last time Miss Suki was here, she was wearing a dark green silk dress had three cups of tea over the course of an hour and half long date: two green and one jasmine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's eyebrows shot up into his hairline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>date?!</i>\" he exclaimed, looking betrayed. \"How could you?! I thought what we had was <i>special!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki giggled. \"It was with <i>you</i>, silly. Remember? We came here the morning before I returned to Kyoshi Island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blinked. \"Oh. I knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sniggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing off their tea and chatting about recent events for a bit (\"How were things back on Kyoshi Island?\" \"Oh, they were great. We had several new trainees join up, and Ty Lee has been drilling the warriors in chi blocking.\") the subject of discussion gradually turned to more esoteric matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what <i>is</i> the Order of the White Lotus, anyway?\" Suki had inquired once Toph had finished regaling her with the tales of her and Sokka's exploits in the Lower Ring. \"I've been meaning to ask for a while, but I never got the chance before I had to leave. And nobody back home knew anything about it - or at least, nothing they were willing to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh cocked an eyebrow curiously at her, as though surprised she would ask such a question. But there was a gleam of something else in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well it is nothing much,\" he said after a moment of thoughtful silence. \"The Order is really just a club where old men get together to drink tea, play Pai Sho, and talk. Nothing more than what you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said this simply, as though that were all there was to the matter. But subtle tells in his posture and expression - signs that most would not have noticed - belied a world of meaning beyond the words themselves, and the faintest hint of a smile played across his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Come to think of it,\" he said, acting as though he was just remembering something, \"I believe I <i>did</i> promise young Sokka another game the last time we played, did I not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced in the Water Tribe teen's direction, and the boy saw the unspoken message in the old man's piercing gold eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did,\" he said, pushing his chair away from the table. \"Do you remember where you put the set when we finished with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so, but perhaps you could help me look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Grand Lotus Iroh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh smiled, returning the bow. \"There is no need for such formalities between friends, Initiate Sokka. I am just a simple, old man with a fondness for Pai Sho and gossip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But aren't we all, at heart?\" said Sokka, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki stared, mouth hanging open just slightly. It was clear to her now that this was not simply idle chatter - the words and gestures all seemed rehearsed, practiced. This was a routine, she understood, a coded exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little surreal, seeing her boyfriend like this. It was she had just caught a glimpse of a hidden side of him. He was most certainly not the same arrogant oaf she had first met all those months ago: his journeys had changed him greatly. And it seemed that his time here in Ba Sing Se was also changing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then her train of thought was interrupted when Iroh and Sokka stood up and left the room, heading through a door in the back. She smiled at Sokka as he left, blowing him a kiss and causing him to flush. Then he went through the door, and Suki caught Iroh giving her and Toph a meaningful look and nod before he too vanished through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt closed with a muted <i>click</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph chose that moment to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she say?</span></div></div>",

It was rather intimidating, really, how much the you were expected to do just to keep everything from going up in flames \u2013 quite literally, in this case, considering the impressive number of benders in the nobility \u2013 yet it was also a very rewarding job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you were doing your part to make the world a better place, even in spite of scheming nobles and bickering vassals, could really help you sleep peacefully. And the servants waiting on you hand and foot didn't hurt either, even if the abject servility did get a little old after a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, the only thing that really, truly sucked about being Fire Lord (aside from the aforementioned nobles) was the assassins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko could <i>really</i> do without those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the eighth one this month...\" the Fire Lord opined as he watched his guards cart off another would-be killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in his royal bedchambers, dressed in naught but a nightgown with candles flickering in the darkness around the <i>massive </i>four poster canopy bed. And in the bed next to him, boredly eyeing the slightly singed sheets on Zuko's side, was his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised they haven't given up on trying to kill you, by now,\" Mai remarked glibly, thumbing a throwing knife in the palm of her hand. She was dressed in a sheer silk negligee, very sensual and very expensive \u2013 only the best for the Fire Lord's girlfriend. \"Somebody out there must really want you dead, to send this many assassins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or many somebodies,\" Zuko responded glumly, shaking his head as he turned away from the unconscious body being dragged out of his room and off to the dungeons. \"The nobility hate me. They want my father back on the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people just have no sense at all,\" Mai observed in a toneless drawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but they still have the means to stir up rebellion,\" muttereed Zuko darkly, staring at the light of the flickering candles that ringed them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-haired girl delicately arched an eyebrow at her boyfriend. \"Oh, so it's a rebellion, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else can we call it?\" he replied. \"They're making light of my authority, sending assassins against me, spreading dissent through the population... if things keep going at this rate, we'll be looking at all out civil war by the end of the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai shook her head with a sigh. \"Zuko,\" she said slowly, \"You might be the Fire Lord and my boyfriend, but you are such a <i>paranoid idiot</i>. Have you really forgotten so much about how the game works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he said intelligently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're testing you,\" Mai explained dryly, rolling her eyes at his denseness. \"They're trying to see how much they can get away with, how far they can go. They're trying to figure out precisely how weak you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not weak!\" Zuko protested indignantly, the candles flaring to life and casting the room in a deep, crimson-gold glow. He was glaring angrily at Mai, who simply rolled her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said in a tone that made it sound like she was simply humoring a tantruming child. \"I know that, and you know that, but they <i>don't</i>. They haven't seen you in action. Not since...\" she trailed off, tactfully choosing not to put into words that the last most of the nobles had seen of him before his ascension to the throne had been a young boy, barely older than twelve, kneeling down and begging his father for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko winced, his face twisting into a grimace as he realized what Mai was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, then, would you have me do?\" he asked her. \"How can I make them see that I'm not just some scared little boy any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai sighed. \"You won't like what I have to say,\" she told him, more as a statement of fact than any sort of warning, \"But the only way to make them respect is to put your foot down and, well... <i>assert yourself.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko narrowed his eyes. \"And how, pray tell, would you suggest I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Single out one or two of the most notable troublemakers,\" she told him. \"Call them out and make an example of them before the court. Show the nobility that if they play with fire, they're going to get burned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Agni Kai</i>...\" he breathed, understanding her meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would certainly be one way of doing it,\" she replied, before yawning. \"Now, if you don't mind me, I think I'll go to sleep now...\" she began, only to feel a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Zuko told her firmly. \"We haven't finished what we started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then leaned in and kissed her deeply on the lips, holding her chin in his fingers. They maintained the contact for several long second, before Zuko pulled back and grinned softly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai <i>almost</i> smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it,\" she said, before grabbing hold of him and returning the kiss with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

The kiss had been pretty chaste, all told \u2013 Aang was still just barely thirteen \u2013 but that did not mean that it lacked at all for passion. Even a tiny peck on the cheek, a short brushing of hands, could communicate a world of emotion between the two young lovers. They might have only been at the stage of shy flirting and occasional soft kisses, but Aang and Katara were still a very loving couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppa rumbled beneath them, causing the two to break out in giggles briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, buddy,\" said Aang, smiling softly as he settled himself back down on his friend and partner's shoulder. \"But I'm sure we'll find you a nice girl too, one of these days. I just know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppa groaned, then let out a mighty <i>huff</i> of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure there are other sky bison out there, somewhere,\" replied Aang, answering a question only he could understand. \"Everyone thought the dragons were extinct, too, but then me and Zuko found... well, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppa hummed in response, and Aang laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Appa says we're almost there, Katara,\" said the Avatar, speaking to his girlfriend over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to dip lower in the sky, Appa's toes skimming the surface of the clouds as they slowly descended. Below them, far below yet, Aang and Katara saw the great walls of Ba Sing Se. They smiled, perceiving that their journey was finally nearing its end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there...\" Katara repeated, a soft smile playing across her lips. \"Let's hope those two didn't knock down too many buildings this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang chuckled, scratching the back of his neck. \"Well, they <i>did</i> say it was just an accident,\" he replied. \"I'm sure they behaved a lot better this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara shook her head as Appa circled lower and lower, gradually descending towards the Upper Ring. She had a slightly exasperated smile, and she sighed briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wish I could be so optimistic,\" she remarked . \"But those two have an uncanny talent for getting into trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled over to one side of Appa's saddle and looked down at the finely paved streets and well-tended gardens of the Upper Ring. Perhaps trying to see if she could spot any obvious property damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo, who had been curled up against her side, popped one eye open at the sudden absence of its pillow. Seeing that Katara had moved, the flying lemur lazily stretched and let out a churring yawn, before spreading out its arms and taking wing, letting itself ride the air currents that swirled around Appa's massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lemur chirped and chittered, before diving down into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, at the house...</span></div></div>",

There was just something so cathartic about raising boulders out of the ground and throwing them at other boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially if she pictured the rocks as Suki's head, with it slender profile and feminine bone structure and stupid, smug grin that stretched her facial muscles in just such a way that seriously pissed off the earthbender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking the surface of the ground with a snarl, Toph threw dust and gravel up into the air as a number of stone pillars rose out of the earth in a geometrically flawless semicircle before her. That girl really got her goat. She couldn't say exactly how or why \u2013 or rather <i>wouldn't</i> say \u2013 but it seemed like everything Suki did just grated at her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt drove her mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Toph took a deep breath \u2013 maybe to cool her burning temper, or maybe just to give her next move a little more <i>oomph</i> \u2013 she tried to focus on the smashing of stone against stone and NOT the giggles and laughter of Suki and Sokka coming from the teen's room in the apartment behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building was located in the same location as their group's place of residence the previous time they had stayed in Ba Sing Se, but it had been heavily renovated since then. Partly because Toph was like a wrecking ball in little girl form, and partly because of damage that had been done during the Fire Nation occupation of the city, little remained of the house as they had known it. Almost completely rebuilt, at close to twice its previous size, the house was closer to mansion, and it had been decorated in many different styles \u2013 according to the others, at least. Toph didn't really notice much difference, aside from the stone pagoda that had been added on as part of a brand new third story \u2013 apparently fashioned after the architecture of the Air Temples to help the Avatar feel at home, complete with a large, open air stable for Appa to sleep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevitating a large, coin-shaped stone disc into the air, Toph shifted her weight slightly and swung her right hand in a diagonal chopping motion. Once she threw the disc, she could no longer feel it, as it was in the air. But she knew that she had judged the angle perfectly, and indeed the earthbender was soon rewarded with the loud, satisfying CRUNCH of the disc impacting the right-most pillar (and she could feel the disc again, and she felt it fracture and break apart, the separate chunks of splintered rock disappearing from her perception again until they hit the ground).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused her attention entirely on the loud smashing of rock against rock, doing her best to drown the scene of Sokka seated on a chair in his room, holding what was probably a paint brush in his hand as his heart thudded audibly in his chest, most likely because of Suki, who was lying naked on the teen's bed in what Toph vaguely understood as a seductive pose. The crippled pillar toppled, impacting the next in line, and with minimal guidance from Toph the pillars fell one after the other in a great cacophony, each pillar knocking down the next, like they were just big, weirdly-shaped dominoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Toph was getting ready to set up for the next round, though, she felt a familiar, fuzzy weight land on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hey Momo,\" she greeted, a little surprised that the lemur was there. The last she knew, it had been with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Toph felt Appa set down on the roof of the house behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Twinkletoes and Sugar Queen must be back,\" she said to herself. \"I wonder how their trip went?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response, Momo proceeded to chitter and squeak in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say,\" she commented, as though she could actually understand what Momo was saying and <i>didn't</i> hear nothing but gibberish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that one could reasonably expect anything more from a flying lemur \u2013 they were intelligent, sure, but not nearly <i>that</i> intelligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Toph felt Katara's weight land on the stone, rooftop pavilion as the girl dismounted from Appa (trying hard, again, to focus on anything but the scene in Sokka's room) before making her way across the roof and eventually down the stairs. For a moment, Toph considered heading inside to greet the older girl, but then she decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd much rather be out here, where she could keep her mind busy with earthbending practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Toph shifted into her next stance. She held her hands out, palms facing the ground, and stretched out the joints in her fingers, causing them to pop and crack. This sound was mirrored in stereo surround by the ground at Toph's feet, the surface of which she could feel warping and buckling as she <i>reached</i> her earthbending deep into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could practically feel the earth between her fingers as she lowered her hands as far as her arms could reach, before curling her fingers into twin, tiny fists and quickly rocketing them back up, as high as she could reach. She felt a giddy sensation in her stomach as the ground beneath her toes began to shift and crack. The could feel the air breathing against her face as she used her earthbending to raise up a small, rocky hill. Its highest point was almost equal to their house's roof, and its base stretched nearly to the furthest borders of the rock garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a power-building exercise she had recently devised. The idea behind it was to move as much earth as possible as far as she could manage in a single movement. By doing this, she could theoretically train herself to be able to bend progressively, incrementally larger amounts of earth with minimal undue effort \u2013 because although it was <i>theoretically</i> possible to lift even a mountain so long you could build up enough momentum in your chi, this would usually involved a looooong sequence of movements as you went through multiple earthbending kata, during which you would effectively be a sitting turtle duck. But by training up the amount of force she could exert with a given amount of bending, Toph could move larger rocks with less effort than other earthbenders, and this could open up a whole new world of possibilities for her bending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Toph had gotten the idea from Aang's old friend, Bumi, the king of Omashu. The old geezer was probably the only earthbender in the entire world that Toph could accept as an equal. While Toph was a prodigy with a unique style of earthbending, as well as the only metalbender in the world, which helped her really stand out from the crowd as a truly exceptional bender, King Bumi used a much more standard and traditional style that was taught all across the Earth Kingdom, but he distinguished himself by just being <i>so damn good at it</i>, as well as using it in ways most could never even think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very rare that Toph could honestly say something complimentary about another earthbender's ability, but Bumi was someone she could genuinely respect. Seriously, the guy could earthbend <i>with his face</i>. She hadn't even thought something like that was physically possible. Not until she'd met him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph understood completely why the crazy old coot had been Aang's first choice for an earthbending teacher. <i>She</i> wouldn't have minded taking a few lessons from that magnificent bastard, and in her mind that was pretty much the highest compliment she could pay to any earthbender, anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of Aang, Toph felt the airbender land next to her on the impromptu hill, touching down on the ground so lightly that she still had trouble believing it was physically possible. She also felt Katara inside the building, and it seemed the girl was heading straight for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Toph,\" said Aang, greeting his earthbending teacher. But then the girl suddenly ducked down and covered her ears, and Aang wondered what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept on wondering right up until he heard Katara's shrill, horrified scream pierce the air, followed by similarly high-pitched cries from Sokka and Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Aang just got an awful sort of sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?</span></div></div>",

She muttered \"<i>harlot,</i>\" under her breath, spitting the word out with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki winced, hearing Katara's muttered remark.

This is a whole other level of unacceptable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of tense silence as Katara continued to glare at her brother, who looked very much like he would have preferred to be <i>anywhere else</i> at that moment, naked or not. But then that silence was broken by Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katara...\" said the Kyoshi Warrior. \"I know you're upset, but please calm down. Sokka and I are both adults, and we love one another very much. This isn't just some spur of the moment thing.

She shrank back from the furious waterbender, unwilling to meet the younger girl's eyes. And just when it seemed that things could not possibly get any more uncomfortable, Aang appeared, staff at the ready and wind swirling around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! I finally made it\u2014!\" he started to say, only to then stop talking when his brain finally registered the scene his eyes were showing him. The staff dropped from his hand, and his mouth fell open in a little 'o'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a moment of silence so complete that, were someone to drop a pin to the floor, it would have sounded like a cacophony on the level of a collapsing building. Then Katara shook her head and gave Aang a Look before storming out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo...\" said Aang awkwardly, looking from Sokka who was concealing his crotch behind a book to Suki who was gripping the sheets tightly to her frame, eyes downcast and stormy. \"...What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Aang,\" said Sokka, \"When a man and a woman love each other <i>very much</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know about <i>sex</i>, Sokka,\" Aang replied bluntly. \"I was talking about Katara. I thought I heard her scream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did,\" Suki answered. \"She walked in on us while we were... you know... and there was sort of a fight. She was very... angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Aang, looking distinctly uncomfortable. \"I see... I suppose I should probably go to her. See if I can't calm her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sokka. \"<i>Please</i>.\" He then paused. \"Just... don't do it where I can see, okay? Knowing the two of you, it'll probably end in another kiss-fest, and I'm <i>really</i> not in the mood to see that. Y'understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said, before turning around. \"I'll leave the two of you to your... well, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then left, shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Sokka and Suki resume what they had been doing?</span></div></div>",

She was not looking Sokka in the eyes. \"Maybe you should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put on some pants?\" Sokka supplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you,\" she said, a sad smile on her facee. \"And I'll get dressed as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was about to get up out of the bed when she felt a weight settle down on the end next to her. Sokka softly, comfortingly laid a hand on her shoulder. It was warm and calloused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said Sokka quietly, meeting his girlfriend's eyes. \"Need to talk? You look upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled weakly, shaking her head. \"No, Sokka...\" she said. \"I'm fine. Honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka smirked playfully at her. \"Yes, you <i>are</i> fine,\" he said, growling suggestively. But then his composure became more serious. \"But you don't sound okay. Katara didn't mean any of what she said, you know. She was... well, mostly I think she was just mad at me. Because I am just so much fun to hate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled self-deprecatingly, eliciting a little bit of a giggle from Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are,\" Suki agreed sarcastically, before shaking her head, her smile dimming again. \"But I'm alright, Sokka. It's nothing. Katara... I know she didn't really mean any of it. She's a sweet kid. Nothing like her brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punched Sokka playfully in the arm, causing him to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" he said, \"We really should get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sighed as she listened to the conversation going on across the yard from her. Katara's blow up at Sokka and Suki had been spectacularly vicious, and the blind earthbender couldn't help but feel a little sympathy for Suki. She knew all too well what it was like to be on the receiving of one of Katara's rants, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waterbender was a sweetheart most of the time (almost disgustingly so, in Toph's opinion), but when she got mad she could get downright <i>nasty</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katara...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Aang, I know I overreacted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang winced. \"Oh, I don't know... I wouldn't say that, exactly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Aang,\" she said. \"There's no need to sugarcoat it. I overreacted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, before gritting her teeth and clenching her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it just makes me <i>so mad!</i>\" she continued angrily. \"What right do they have? What right does <i>she</i> have?! Telling me I'm just a kid, while saying that she and Sokka are adults! They're just screwing around! Doesn't she even <i>care?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Katara,\" said Aang slowly, placing a hand on his girlfriend's shoulder. \"She does care. She just... has her own way of showing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean seducing my brother and calling me a child?\" Katara muttered bitterly. \"Yeah, I can just <i>feel</i> the love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not <i>quite</i> like how you said it,\" replied Aang, \"But she and Sokka <i>are</i> both adults, aren't they? I mean, I'm pretty sure that's what the whole iceberg dodging ritual was for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Katara who winced. \"Okay, yeah, Sokka <i>is</i> a man as far as the Southern Water Tribe is concerned, but he hardly acts like it! He's still such a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he?\" Aang asked. \"I mean, I know he likes to play and joke around with me and Toph and Momo, but that doesn't make him childish. Monk Gyatso <i>loved</i> playing around and telling jokes, and he was <i>ancient</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Sokka...\" Katara said weakly. \"Sokka's not like that. He's still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed morosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He plans to marry Suki, you know,\" said Aang. \"He told me all about how he's already got the whole wedding ceremony planned out in his head.\" He tapped a finger against his arrow tattoo. \"I know you still feel like you need to take care of him, but Sokka's grown a lot. He doesn't need his little sister watching out for him all the time, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed his hand against one of Katara's, taking hold of it and squeezing softly, comfortingly. Katara blushed faintly, softly smiling. There was a moment of silence between them, before Katara whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aang... How much do you know about the Kyoshi Warriors?\" she asked him. \"Because I've heard rumors, here and there... and, well, what if Sokka <i>can't</i> marry Suki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Avatar shrugged. \"Does it matter?\" he asked her. \"If they really love each other, then that's all they need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if she breaks his heart?\" Katara asked. \"You know how Sokka is. He's so emotional, and he gets so invested in stuff. I <i>still </i>hear him mourning that space sword of his sometimes, when he thinks nobody is around. And he <i>still</i> gets depressed during full moons. If Suki breaks his heart, Aang... I don't care if she's a friend. He was my brother before he was her girlfriend, and if she hurts him I will hurt her twice as bad in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka's lucky to have such a loving sister,\" Aang said. \"But I'm sure you won't need to hurt anyone. Suki loves Sokka as much as I love you,\" he said, blushing brightly and squeezing Katara's hand a little tighter. \"She wouldn't hurt him any more than Toph or I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't trust her,\" Katara muttered darkly. \"How can she act so lovey-dovey with him when she's... you know, sworn to Kyoshi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're letting worry cloud your mind, Katara. Avatar Kyoshi wouldn't have forbidden anyone from loving,\" Aang said firmly. \"Even if I don't see eye to eye with her, she's still my past life. No matter what sort of oaths the Kyoshi Warriors might make, I'm certain they're still allowed to love. What would be the point, if they weren't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She DID almost get you boiled in oil, you know,\" Katara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang chuckled awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, I didn't say she was <i>perfect</i>,\" he responded sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neither Aang or Katara noticed when Toph got up and stalked off into the house, grumbling under her breath. She was really not in the mood to hear them go on about Sokka and Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was knotted unpleasantly as she thought of what the pair had been saying. On the one hand, she knew what Katara was saying, and under other circumstances she might have been inclined to agree with the girl. But she couldn't quite bring herself to side entirely with Katara \u2013 not in this case. Even though she knew where the waterbender was coming from, she also knew that \u2013 if nothing else \u2013 Suki really <i>did </i>love Sokka, and Sokka loved Suki. Both of them were one hundred percent serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, it galled her, at times, to think of how the Kyoshi Warrior had swooped into their lives and taken Toph's chances at... well, nothing she would admit. Not aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph felt sorry for Suki, at least in this case. She knew how hard it was to get in Katara's good books once you were on her bad side \u2013 just ask Zuko \u2013 and also knew that, at least for this once, Katara had not been in the right. Not really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not to say that Toph might not have said similar things if she had been in Katara's place \u2013 she probably would have been far meaner, nastier, for reasons she would never admit to out loud. She certainly knew countless, exponentially more <i>colorful</i> invectives (it was amazing what people would say when they thought no one could hear them), and she would not have hesitated to throw all but the harshest, cruelest ones at that <i>floozy</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the benefit of her current perspective on the matter \u2013 having heard the argument go down without actually being involved, and having been able to sense how each party reacted \u2013 Toph could not help but feel sympathy for Suki. Heck, in another lifetime maybe it could have been <i>her</i> who had been caught by Katara \u2013 not that she would ever actually want to do something like <i>that</i> with <i>Sokka</i>, she insisted silently to herself in spite of the growing blush spreading from her ears to her chest, but hypothetically speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another lifetime it could have been her, or so Toph told herself vainly, hopefully. It could have been her who was caught by Katara, then berated and insulted. She could have been the one Katara cursed and derided for doing something like <i>that</i> with her brother. Somehow, in some world or other, it could have been her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Toph felt sorry for Suki, as strange a notion as that might seem. And perhaps this, more than anything else, was what led her to where the girl was sitting, by herself, outside Appa's massive stable, perhaps watching the gigantic bison sleep. Sokka, she could tell from the vibrations, was going through sword kata in his little training area off to the side of the house. Probably working off his frustrations by swinging around that heavy, sword-shaped hunk of wood he had taking to practicing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, trying to clear it of the thoughts of how <i>interestingly</i> Sokka's muscles coiled and released as he went through the motions with an almost uncharacteristic grace and fluidity, Toph took a seat next to Suki. She plopped herself down on the thick stone floor, crossing her legs and putting her hands on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she said, casually greeting the older girl. \"You wanna talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki gave a start, surprised out of her dismal reverie by Toph's words, but then she smiled softly. She knew that she had told Sokka that she was fine, but she also knew that he knew that she really wasn't. But he had understood what went unsaid, and he'd gone to practice, to give her some space to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that she had been reluctant to talk to her boyfriend about this, but she also knew on some level that talking would probably help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had not wanted to talk about it with Sokka, feeling like it would have been too uncomfortable to discuss with him, but maybe Toph would understand. She was a girl too, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" said Suki slowly. \"I'd like that. I really would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShow them talking, or focus on someone else?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toph Bei Fong was good at many things. She was a brilliant earthbender: a prodigy, and perhaps the most talented in generations. She was also exceedingly proficient in the courtesies and manners of high society, having been raised as the only daughter of the wealthy Bei Fong family. She was a natural at insults and witty remarks, and she could joke around with the best of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had many skills, both widely varied and finely honed, but there was at least one thing she was NOT good at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Girl talk</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, she had no difficulty with other kinds of talk, be it <i>trash</i> or <i>guy</i> or even <i>small</i>, but Toph simply had no experience with being a girl. She could be anything from a demure, sophisticated, high society woman to a crass, crude, shameless one-of-the-guys. She had experience with those things, and could do them well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Toph had very little experience with just being a <i>girl</i>. As a child, she never had any friends her own age, never learned the subtle nuances of casual interaction with other females. Her parents taught her everything about how to be a <i>lady</i> and a <i>bride</i> (the latter she had especially resented), but they had never thought to let her learn how to be a normal girl. The only things she learned about being feminine, were learned in the context of high society and nobility and how to be a proper wife \u2013 these stifling, repressive mores and traditions, whereby she was expected to be soft and meek and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would need to know these things for when she became a bride, she had been told as a child. When the time came, she would be expected to do her <i>duty</i> and submit herself as a flawless little doll to the highest bidder. This was what she had been taught from an early age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from the very beginning, she had resented it. She came, in some small part, to associate the concept of femininity with weakness, helplessness, passivity \u2013 things she despised with every fiber of her being. She REFUSED to be like this, she told herself in the silence of night. She would not be weak. She would not be helpless. She would not just sit back and let others rule her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Toph began to rebel, silently, unknown to her parents, she did not choose to go out and find other girls her age. She had no reason to <i>want</i> to. She knew nothing about what other girls would be like - what if they were just what her parents wanted <i>her</i> to be like? No, she wanted to distance herself from such things, remove herself as far as humanly possible from the concept of a helpless little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she practiced the earthbending she had learned from the badger moles, trained herself to become <i>strong.</i> Because in a life where everything was dictated for her, a life where she felt so powerless to shape her own destiny, earthbending was the one area where <i>she</i> was the one in control. For a young girl who had always been told what to do by others, never having any real say in anything, being able to enforce her will on the earth itself, having the power to move and shape otherwise unyielding stone to her desire, was... quite simply <i>liberating</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she threw herself into earthbending, spent every free moment away from her minders honing her skills. Toph put so many hours, so much blood, sweat, and tears into her training, that before she knew it she had far outstripped the vast majority of earthbenders. Because for her it wasn't just a weapon, something to use in a fight \u2013 no, it was a way of life, a way to \"see\" the world. She used it in some manner every minute of every day, continually strengthening her bond with her element. Soon enough, she found that earthbending came to her almost as easily as breathing, and she began to get curious about how good a bender she really was... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, one year, Toph secretly entered herself into Earth Rumble V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest, as they say, was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, getting back to the matter at hand, Toph just wasn't good at girl talk. She had almost no experience with it, and for the longest time she'd had no inclination to change this. Except now she found herself trying to talk to Suki, and comfort the girl. It was not easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough on the other hand, what better way to learn than by first hand experience? Everybody had to start <i>somewhere</i>, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does their talk wind up going?</span></div></div>",

So much for this going smoothly, she thought. At this rate they would never get to anything. Not if they kept sitting there and beating around the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, hey, she was an earthbender. She did better with blunt and direct anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katara can be kind of a bitch, wouldn't you say?\" she said, and she felt Suki next to her wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Suki. \"I wouldn't say that. She was just angry, right? Sure her words might have been... <i>hurtful</i>,\" she reluctantly conceded, \"but she didn't mean anything by them. Not really. She was just upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>sure</i>, if you want to be <i>mature</i> about it,\" Toph scoffed. \"But where's the fun in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki giggled a little bit at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maturity is its own reward,\" she said, and Toph could hear the small hint of a smile in her tone. \"There's a lot to be said for moral victory, and being the bigger person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been spending time with Aang?\" asked Toph, cocking an eyebrow. \"Seriously, you're sounding just like him. It's downright <i>uncanny</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Suki's face stretch into a wider grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said the older girl brightly. \"I try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph shook her head. \"I'm<i> surrounded</i> by weirdos,\" she muttered in a theatrically exasperated tone, before shaking her head and saying, more soberly, \"But seriously, though. I saw what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Really?</i>\" said Suki, and Toph could hear the amusement in the girl's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph huffed, cheeks heating up under the feeling of Suki's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean,\" said the blind earthbender testily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katara really got to you, didn't she.\" It wasn't a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki nervously looked away, even though rationally she knew Toph could not see it. She was silent, unsure what to say to this. Toph had hit closer to the mark than the warrior would have liked to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's silly,\" said the older girl, \"but it really... <i>hurts</i> to hear Katara disapproving of my and Sokka's relationship. Especially when she's doing so... so <b>vehemently</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph shrugged. \"What'd I say?\" she said. \"Katara can be kind of a bitch when she's mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make her point any less valid,\" Suki responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What point?\" asked Toph, quirking an eyebrow curiously. \"All I heard was '<i>blah blah you're a whore blah</i>'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph felt Suki tense up, facial muscles twisting the older girl's expression into a grimace. The Kyoshi Warrior exhaled through grit teeth with a faint sort of hissing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I certainly must <i>seem</i> like one...\" said the young girl morosely, self consciously, and Toph could have smacked herself on the forehead for her faux pas. \"I've been practically throwing myself at her brother ever since he rescued me from the Boiling Rock...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph scoffed, almost in spite of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what is this?!\" she demanded irritably, smacking a hand down on the floor and causing a just-barely-noticeable tremor to run through the building. \"Are you done feeling sorry for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was startled by this sudden occurrence, and she whipped her head around to stare at Toph owlishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind, younger girl shook her head. \"Seriously, since when have you been such a pushover? Just because Katara threw a little hissy fit, you're questioning your relationship with Sokka? No way! I will NOT allow that!\" she declared firmly. \"Who took out your spine? I don't remember you being so weak back at the Serpent's Pass. What happened to the sexy, badass leader of the Kyoshi Warriors?! I refuse to believe that you could have won Sokka's heart by being such a <i>fucking whiny pussy!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki nearly choked at Toph's vulgar choice of words, but she was also rather shamefaced. Again, the young girl was hitting painfully close to home, and Suki could not help but think about what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know, Toph, who it was that captured me and my warriors? Who it was who sent me to the Boiling Rock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph stopped right in her tracks. Belatedly, she remembered a certain conversation that had happened during the Day of Black Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Azula</i>...\" she breathed, the tiniest hint of horror in her voice. \"Oh, <i>Suki</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph felt the weight of Suki's head shift on the girl's shoulders as she nodded. She didn't even need her earthbending sense to envision the sad smile on Suki's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the look on your face,\" said Suki weakly, \"I take it that you heard the story straight from the serpent's mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph nodded, suddenly uncertain what to say. This was much harsher terrain than she had expected to navigate going into the conversation, but she would not turn back now. <i>When the going gets tough, the Toph gets going</i> \u2013 that was a saying she had come up with herself, though she never actually used it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" she said slowly, recalling the painful memories of that day. \"During the invasion, near the end of the eclipse, we ran into Azula while looking for the Fire Lord. She... we had subdued her and were going on our way, when she called out to us. <i>'So, Sokka's your name, right? My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time.'</i> That was what she said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I remember, now,\" Suki murmured, \"She told me about it herself, one day, shortly after the eclipse. Came to gloat, I suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki sighed sadly. \"She told me what she said to you guys, you know. <i>'She was convinced you were going to come rescue her. Of course you never came, and she gave up on you.'</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't believe her for a second,\" Toph insisted firmly. \"Azula always lies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" whispered Suki, \"Not always. Not when she doesn't need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly things were starting to make a lot more sense to Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really isn't about what Katara said at all, is it?\" said the earthbender shrewdly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, and it isn't,\" Suki replied. \"Even by itself, what Katara said was still hurtful, and yet... I can't help but think back to how quickly I gave up on Sokka, back then. How readily I began to doubt him. She's a horrible person, Azula... It was terrifying how she could always find some way to break down my defenses, how she always seemed to know exactly where to strike to make me crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the only reason she didn't break me completely was because she had more fun knocking me down every time I tried to pick myself back up. I was like a toy to her. She didn't even have to lay a finger on me... I felt so powerless. No matter how many times I defied her, no matter how hard I resisted, she always managed to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki trailed off, her voice weak. Whatever Azula always managed to do, it sounded like it was too painful for Suki to say. It must have been awful, being at that monster's mercy for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really hurt you, didn't she...?\" said Toph, placing a hand on Suki's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... She was such a horrible person...\" said the girl, clearly fighting back the urge to break down in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was quiet for a moment, before she got up and pulled the taller Suki to her feet with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what you need?\" she asked rhetorically, deciding to take it on herself to help Suki out of this bloody funk. \"A night out on the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her face to Suki, letting the girl see a wide, devilish grin that split the Blind Bandit's face from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who knows?\" she continued, \"Maybe the place will even still be standing when we're finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph laughed mischievously, and Suki could not help the sensation infecting her a little as well, a bit of impish glee spreading out from her ribs and down to her toes. She smirked, looking rather vulpine as her eyes gleamed with untold plots of madness and mayhem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoshi knows it wouldn't be constructive, but Suki'd be <i>damned</i> if she couldn't do with some catharsis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the two of us against the world!\" Suki all but cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or Ba Sing Se, at least!\" added Toph, looking not the slightest bit displeased with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the two of them set off to paint the town red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhiled, Chief Hakoda of the Southern Water Tribe, the famed White Wolf, was sitting in his hall when he got the letter \u2013 not an igloo, but an honest to goodness <i>hall</i>. Their long estranged brothers from the North Pole had done much already in the way of helping them rebuild, raising greater, taller walls of ice and snow, and building what they had insisted was a proper dwelling for the tribal chief and his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe structure was more of a palace than a house, or at least it seemed that way to the Southern Tribesmen and women, and it was impressive by all accounts, even if still considerably humbler than the hall of the Northern Tribe's chieftain. It was tall, with a whole two stories \u2013 something that had been unheard of in the South Pole for a very long time \u2013 and long, with a great hall and several various rooms and chambers to accommodate the family of the chief, as well as any guests. It had an exterior of solid ice, shaped by Master Pakku (or should he call the man <i>Father</i>, now?) and the other Northern Tribe waterbenders, while the interior was furnished with wood from the Earth Kingdom, plus the hides of many great beasts and an assortment of decorative weapons both exotic and traditional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one of the tribesmen came in with the letter, a Fire Nation messenger hawk perched on his shoulder, he was understandably impressed by the appearance of Chief Hakoda's hall. Construction of the building had only recently finished, and few had yet had the chance to see inside the completed structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, there were only a couple of people present in the hall at that moment aside from Hakoda himself \u2013 namely, Bato, his right-hand man, as well his mother, Kanna, and his step-father, Pakku \u2013 so the messenger's presence was immediately noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Narook!\" said Bato heartily, turning his attention from the simple lunch he had been partaking in with his chief and old friend to greet the fellow warrior. \"I suppose you are here with news from the merchants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe referred, of course, to the ship of Earth Kingdom traders who had weighed anchor just off the frozen coast outside the village earlier that morning, having come with some store of various trade goods in hopes of bartering for various goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and no,\" the man answered, bowing shortly in a show of respect. He was shorter than Bato or Hakoda, and slightly bow-legged, but he was also stockier of build, with broad shoulders and thick arms, strong and solid. His hair was held up in a warrior's wolf tail, and his square jaw was lined with a thin, black beard. \"There <i>is</i> some news from the merchants, but that is not why I came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indicated the messenger hawk on his shoulder, which had an empty scroll case tied to its leg, before addressing his leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This hawk arrived just minutes ago bearing a letter for you, Chief Hakoda,\" Narook explained. \"It bears the seal of the Bei Fong family, from the Earth Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda's eyebrows shot up into his hairline at this. He had heard of the Bei Fong family, and he knew that they were very wealthy, and <i>very</i> powerful. The Bei Fong name had considerable clou in and around the Earth Kingdom, and a message from them could potentially mean very good things for the Southern Water Tribe, which had been greatly weakened and diminished over the course of the Hundred Year War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" he inquired, curiosity piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Narook replied. \"I assumed it was meant for your eyes only.\" He then grabbed the scroll, elaborate wax seal still intact, and presented it to Hakoda, who accepted it before politely dismissing the man, who departed with another short bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence as Hakoda broke the seal, unfurling the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Bei Fong family could want with you?\" Bato wondered aloud as Hakoda started to skim the document.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps they wish to discuss the terms of a possible future trade agreement,\" suggested Pakku, who had up until then been quietly enjoying a bowl of stewed squid. \"They <i>are</i> a merchant family, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda hummed thoughtfully, only half-listening as he delved through lengthy sections of empty flattery and meaningless pleasantries in search of something actually important. It took a while, but the writer of the letter <i>did</i> eventually get to the point, and when they did Hakoda had to say that he was perhaps blindsided by it a little more than he should have been. But hindsight was 20/20, as they say, and looking back through the earlier sections of the letter, Hakoda did indeed find several points where it had been hinted rather strongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though, it caught him off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" said the Southern Water Tribe Chief. \"I was not expecting <i>that</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" said his mother, Kanna. \"What is it, Hakoda?\"</span></div></div>",

They seek to arrange a marriage between their daughter and... my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato raised an eyebrow curiously. \"Oh? Did you have another son we don't know about, or are you actually talking about Sokka?\" he said, half-jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda laughed. \"Hey, now!\" he said, \"I'll have you know that our little Sokka has grown into a serious lady-killer, just like his father was before him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now, we <i>definitely</i> can't be talking about the same person,\" said Bato teasingly. \"Kya hooked up with you mostly out of pity, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda smirked. \"But my sheer animal magnetism still played a very important part,\" he said insistently, a broad grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two probably would have gone on like this for a while, but they were stopped by Pakku stepping forward and snatching up the letter to peruse it himself. The expression on his face showed that he was entirely unamused by his step-son's antics, though Kanna was smiling indulgently behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda and Bato, for their parts, only looked a little sheepish as they fell silent and allowed the master waterbender to read in peace. After a couple of minutes, the man finished, and he had a thoughtful expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" he said. \"Very interesting. I notice they addressed you as '<i>his majesty Chief Hakoda of the White Wolf Dynasty</i>,' and your children as '<i>Prince Sokka the Brave</i>' and '<i>Princess Katara the Mighty</i>'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tone was dry, and Hakoda looked a little more sheepish now. Kanna smiled brightly, though, and she laughed softly, the sound like clear running water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been very long indeed since a son of the Southern Water Tribe has been called a prince, or a daughter a princess,\" she said almost wistfully. \"Not since the days of Fire Lord Azulon, at the very least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPakku's expression softened at this, and a small smile found its way onto his face. \"But perhaps times are changing,\" he said contemplatively. \"Sokka and Katara did many great things during the war, and in the company of Avatar Aang. Certainly, their deeds have earned them much acclaim on the world stage. Enough even to legitimize them as royalty, perhaps, considering also the deeds of their father, Chief Hakoda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded respectfully in his step-son's direction, and Hakoda reciprocated the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, more importantly,\" Pakku continued, \"there also is the matter of their offer to consider. This marriage proposal...\" He paused, glancing briefly back at his wife, who smiled and nodded, understanding in her expression. He then continued, \"...well, even if things are not traditionally done this way in the Southern Water Tribe, it is nonetheless an offer that should be considered very carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato quirked an eyebrow at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he means,\" said Hakoda, jumping in to explain, \"that even if arranged marriages are unconventional here, they are a common practice in many parts of the world. Usually as a way to secure alliances between families, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPakku nodded. \"Yes, political marriages are not at all uncommon among the upper classes of the Earth Kingdom, and it is not unheard of for a person's spouse to have been chosen them while they were still only infants.\" He paused again, before continuing more cautiously. \"I... understand that some may have certain... reservations... about arranging a marriage in such a way, but there is also the future of the Southern Water Tribe to consider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanna was silent, her expression peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand what you're talking about,\" said Bato slowly. \"Even with the aid of our sister tribe in the north, our tribe is still a far cry from what it used to be like in better days. Compared to the Earth Kingdom or the Fire Nation, we just don't have much in the way of <i>anything</i>, besides snow and ice. And that isn't worth much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Pakku. \"But this marriage offer, if we accept, could go a very long way toward ensuring a better future for the Southern Water Tribe. The assets of the Bei Fong family, and their numerous preferential trade agreements with families all over the world, would be a great boon to the tribe, and would do much also to increase its standing in the world at large.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is it the right thing to do?\" Kanna interjected sagely. \"No matter how greatly this marriage might benefit us personally, or even the tribe as a whole, I cannot in good conscience arrange a union between my grandson and someone he has never met \u2013 I could not in good conscience consent to that for <i>anyone</i>, unless I knew they would be happy together. The Southern Water Tribe has always valued <i>love</i> in marriage, above all else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, she smiled softly at Pakku, and he smiled back at her in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda though, looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he said, after a moment of quiet thought. \"it is not as though the Bei Fong's daughter is a stranger to Sokka \u2013 quite the opposite, actually. Toph Bei Fong was one of Sokka and Katara's companions, and the Avatar's earthbending instructor. I met her after Sokka and Fire Lord Zuko (well he wasn't the Fire Lord at the time, but you know what I mean) broke me out of the Boiling Rock. She and Sokka are very close, actually. They're both fond of each other, as friends if nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kanna looked considering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" she said slowly. \"...But would they be happy together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda frowned thoughtfully, contemplating. He reviewed everything he remembered of his son's interactions with the young earthbender (pointedly overlooking the matter of the Kyoshi Warrior, Suki). The two were headstrong and stubborn, in their own individual ways, but they got along famously, all things considered. He knew that neither would probably be very happy with the idea of an arranged marriage, if only out of principle, and Katara probably would not take it well either, but Hakoda had a hunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with how they had grown and changed, he knew his children well. Sokka, in particular. The boy was a man, now, and Hakoda knew that Sokka was smart, and would be able to understand why such an arrangement would be beneficial. He was clever and adaptable, if also emotional, and the young warrior had an almost inexplicable way with women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda was also perceptive, and he had noticed the way young Toph had occasionally acted around Sokka. There was a seed of something there, he could tell. Perhaps it was just a girlhood crush, but Hakoda had a feeling in his gut, a feeling that there was more to it than that, and he had learned to trust his instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could not honestly say that either one would take it well, at first, but Hakoda had a hunch, all the same. He had a hunch that, if nothing else, the two could learn to love one another \u2013 assuming they did not already, on some level. As it was, though, the two of them were so close that they were already practically joined at the hip. Had it not been for the presence of Suki, Hakoda knew he probably would have assumed that the two were already together, to some extent or other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be for the best, really. It wasn't as though Suki would be able to make an honest man of his son, not if half the tales he'd heard about the Kyoshi Warriors were true. He knew his son would probably feel betrayed by this, but it was for the best, for both his son and the tribe. Hakoda was sure of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew his duty as a chief and a father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes,\" he said finally, \"I believe they would be happy together. I truly do. They might be... reluctant... at first, but I daresay there is already love between them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will trust your judgment on this matter,\" Kanna said. \"If you believe they can truly be happy together, then I have no objections. I will go along with whatever you decide, Chief Hakoda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPakku and Bato both nodded in agreement with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda nodded in understanding, and he grabbed a brush, some ink, and a blank sheet of his finest parchment, before beginning to write his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was nothing quite like waking up in a strange, dimly lit place with a dry mouth and a splitting headache. Suki could now attest to this from personal experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnngghh,\" the leader of the Kyoshi Warriors groaned miserably as she blinked open teary, itchy eyes. \"What happened...?\" she wondered out loud to herself, before wincing as she felt a spear of molten agony lance through her brain. \"<i>Owwww</i>, my aching...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki cut off with a grimace, her own whispered words echoing in her sinus and rebounded off the sides of her brain cavity. She put a hand to her forehead, exhaling in a hiss through grit teeth. Her jaw was clenched as she tried to fight off the pain, as well as the accompanying nausea and sense of vertigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you woke up, Sleeping Beauty,\" came the coarse, girlish voice of her cellmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait? <i>Cellmate?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki stared around at her surroundings, bemused. Blinking as her sore, teary, bloodshot eyes slowly adjusted to the dim, green lighting provided by small glow crystals hanging down from the ceiling of a hallway or aisle at regular intervals, the young amazon realized she <i>was</i> in a cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wooden prison cell, of all things. It looked like nothing she had seen back at the Boiling Rock, which had been her only real prior experience with captivity or imprisonment, but there was no mistaking this place for anything<i> but </i>a jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, Suki thought belatedly, <i>hopefully</i> it was just a jail. Because she knew of other, worse things that it could also be, but she did not relish the thought of these alternatives. At least in prison you could usually expect to be let out once you served your sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...whatever her sentence <i>was</i>. Or her crime, for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki felt a little nervous about not being able to recall whatever it was she must have done to land herself in here, but hopefully it hadn't been anything too bad. The last thing she could clearly remember was her conversation with Toph, and everything after that was kind of a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened...?\" she wondered, sitting up and turning to face her cellmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, as she had expected, the Blind Bandit herself, Toph Bei Fong. The girl was sporting a split lip and matching shiners, as well as a few cuts and scrapes across her short, slender arms and legs, but she was nonetheless grinning like the cat-owl that caught the sparrowkeet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl's night out,\" Toph replied simply, looking all too pleased with herself as she sat cross-legged on the wood plank floor of their cell. She was beaming as she patted a hand on one of the thick, rectangular bars. \"It was <i>real</i> wild,\" she continued, before smugly observing, \"Been a while since they set up the wooden cage just for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki blinked, unsure how to take this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a <i>good</i> thing?\" she asked uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that I've really outdone myself this time,\" Toph replied in a self-satisfied tone of voice. \"Usually they'd just put me in one of the regular metal cages, 'cause they've got a bunch of those and they work perfectly fine for all of the other earthbenders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki frowned, briefly wincing slightly at the stinging pain this action elicited from a cut on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can't you bend metal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes I can,\" Toph answered proudly. \"But they usually trust me to at least wait until bail is posted before busting my way out. One of the perks of being a war hero,\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki sighed, though she was smiling, and she softly shook her head in a gesture of friendly exasperation. \"So they only wheel out the wooden cell for when they <i>seriously</i> want you locked up,\" she shrewdly guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Toph replied casually, picking a bit of wax from her ear. \"Me and Sokka usually have to at least knock down few buildings for them to bring in Ol' Woody here, so I guess you and me must've seriously cut loose last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and <i>I</i>,\" Suki corrected automatically, before glancing down at her body. She breathed a curse at the sight that greeted her. \"Kyoshi's sagging <i>tits</i>...\" she hissed, uncaring of Toph's presence. \"What did we <i>do</i> last night?\" she wondered. \"I look like I got into a fight with a saber tooth moose-lion. And<i> lost.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph shrugged. \"Ehhh, it's probably better if I don't say,\" she replied blandly, flicking a lump of earwax onto the floor of their cell. \"I don't think you'd be very happy with it, now that you're sober.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki sighed, massaging her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got drunk,\" she muttered. \"Of <i>course</i>. I went drinking with a blind, twelve year old girl.\" She swore again, this time much too graphically for it to be included in a T-rated fic. \"What was I <i>thinking?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph waved a hand dismissively. \"Hey, don't beat yourself up.<i> I</i> was the one who took you to the bar. You just went along with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she went quiet for a moment, looking as though she was listening for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long do you think we'll be in here for?\" Suki asked Toph a little anxiously, breaking the silence that had settled in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...not too long, probably,\" Toph answered after mulling the question over a bit. \"Katara usually comes to bail me and Sokka pretty promptly. I think she probably likes to lecture us while our crimes are still fresh in mind, so she never leaves in for more than an hour or two once she learns we've been arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, and how often <i>have</i> you and Sokka been arrested?\" Suki inquired a little nervously. She wasn't entirely certain how much she wanted to know of her boyfriend's criminal record, particular in terms of how much of it was shared with the blind earthbender before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a guard walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Toph,\" said the uniformed man, greeting the young girl in a friendly, conversational manner. \"Who's your girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, Suki?\" Toph asked. \"She's Sokka's gal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard's eyebrows popped up, and he gave Suki a second once over. Even looking she had lost a fight with a rabid boarcupine, the young woman was still decidedly stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a low whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno which I should say is luckier,\" he said appreciatively, eliciting an awkward smile from Suki. Then he paused, before asking, \"Where is that troublemaker, anyway? The way you two are always brought in together, I'd have figured you were joined at the hip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl's night out,\" Toph said simply, and the man nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any fun?\" the guard asked, and Toph just smirked in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in here, aren't we?\" she said. \"Of course it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, good point!\" he said, before shaking his head. \"Well, I've got to get back to my rounds. When you see Sokka, tell him I said hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Toph said. \"As long as you say hi to the wife and kids for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" the guard said amicably, bidding the two girls farewell before continuing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki merely stared, mouth agape.</span></div></div>",

I was beginning to think you were gonna leave us in here all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki sweat-dropped at this, not that Toph could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" came the sound of a voice decidedly unlike Katara's, \"Actually, Toph, it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's mouth dropped open just a little, and her ears flushed as she took a step out onto the stone floor of the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she murmured, sounding abashed as she let her head fall downwards slightly, long black bangs falling to cover unseeing eyes. \"Hi, Snoozles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki laughed weakly at this, looking a little nervous to Sokka's eyes as she followed Toph out of the jail cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where is Katara, then?\" the young woman inquired just a little anxiously, her eyes flitting down the rows of barred, iron doors set into the walls. She knew that most of the cells in Ba Sing Se's prisons were constructed out of metal, for obvious reasons, and it really struck her at that moment just how <i>out of place</i> her and Toph's wooden cell had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka cast his glance askance at Suki's question, and a sound somewhere halfway between a yelp and a sigh escaped his lips. Suki could pick out the fain sheen of sweat on her boyfriend's face in the dim, green glow of the earth crystal lamps. It gave him a somehow otherworldly appearance, the light of the phosphorescent mineral formations bathing him in an eerie, almost spectral light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... She couldn't come...\" he answered evasively, only for Toph to scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a very good liar, Snoozles. Even without my earthbending I'd know you weren't telling the truth there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" Sokka breathed out through his teeth. \"Yes. Er\u2014well, I don't know if I would call it a <i>complete</i> lie...\" he quibbled nervously. \"But, um... Katara...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still angry at me,\" Suki sighed, grimacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blanched. \"W-well, that is... it's a little more complicated than that, but... um, <i>yes</i>. And also no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind giving us a straight answer?\" Toph asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's complicated,\" Sokka reiterated. \"She is definitely <i>not happy</i>, and what happened yesterday probably didn't help matters... but, well, she's not exactly over the moon about you winding up in the drunk tank on your first day back here,\" he explained sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki winced. \"<i>Great</i>,\" she muttered. \"I've only made things worse, haven't I? She probably hates my guts now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Of course not! No, not at all!\" Sokka insisted with a forced, high-pitched laugh. \"Ha! Ha! She's just a little testy at the moment, that's all!\" He scratched the back of his neck, looking at Suki with weak grin. \"I'm sure it'll all blow over if we just give it a day, or two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started off down the hall, and the guard waved after them, before giving a short bow in Sokka's direction. The teen didn't see, though, his back being to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bless your heart, sir,</i>\" said the guard lowly in a respectful tone, though only Toph could hear it. \"<i>I reckon you'll need it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph shook her head, sighing in a long-suffering manner as she thought about what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This</i> should be fun...\" she muttered sarcastically.</span></div></div>",

What were you girls<i> thinking?!</i>\" Katara ranted, pacing back and forth across the living room as she viciously scolded Suki and Toph. If she'd been dragging her feet a little bit more, she probably would have worn a rut into the floor by now. \"Honestly! I am at a<i> loss!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, for her part, did look genuinely contrite as she stood stock still next to Toph. Her head was bowed penitently, and arms were hanging stiffly at her sides as Katara chewed them out. Toph, on the other hand, just looked bored, lazily cleaning her ears. The earthbender was so used to Katara's lectures that most of what the Water Tribe girl said just rolled right off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sokka, standing behind the Toph and Suki, looked unsure of what to do \u2013 usually he was the one getting getting scolded right alongside Toph, but this time he hadn't actually done anything wrong. But he wouldn't have felt right leaving the two to their fate, so he stood there with them, paralyzed by equal parts fear and indecision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them hadn't gotten more than five steps into the house before they had been confronted by the seething waterbender, and boy did Katara let them have it. She used just about every line in the book as she chewed out the two other girls, from \"<i>You should KNOW better!</i>\" to \"<i>What if you had gotten hurt?</i>\" and even the time-honored classic: \"<i>Just wait until your PARENTS hear about this!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this last one was what truly put the fear of Yue in the pair of miscreants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You wouldn't dare!</i>\" Toph shrieked, at the same time Suki wailed \"<i>No! Anything but that!</i>\" Even Sokka joined in with a yelped, \"<i>Oh, crap! Dad's gonna kill me!</i>\" in spite of the fact that, for once, he hadn't actually done anything wrong \u2013 he'd spent most all of the previous evening going through various sword kata in his little practice area off to the side of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what else can I do?!\" Katara retorted, sounded as much exasperated as angry. \"It's obvious you two won't listen to me! Maybe that's the only thing I can do to get it through your thick skulls! People look up to us, you know! I can't just have the two of running around all willy-nilly like a couple of <i>animals!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Toph got pissed at this, and she started yelling right back at Katara while Suki desperately apologized and swore she wouldn't do it again at the same time that Sokka strove in vain to break up the escalating fight before it got too out of hand. And just when it looked like things were about to come to blows between Toph and Katara, they heard a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone suddenly stopped what they were doing. It was like a bubble had been popped, and all of the mounting tension and emotion just... <i>vanished</i>. Toph fell out of her horse stance, Katara let her arms drop to her sides, Suki stopped shouting apologies, and Sokka removed his hand from the sling where his boomerang rested (not Boomerang, but a replacement made for him by his father).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once the four felt quite abashed, their argument somehow suddenly seeming very silly and inconsequential. Scratching the back of his neck, a sheepish Sokka was the one chosen to go answer the door, while the other three stared awkwardly at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Sokka was greeted with the slightly wrinkled face of their neighbor, Pong. The man had an exasperated look on his face \u2013 though his expression brightened just the tiniest bit when he saw that it was Sokka answering the door \u2013 as he held a certain, familiar flying lemur up by the scruff of its neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mr. Sokka,\" said Pong, looking a tad twitchier than usual. \"Is this yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed, with a slightly irritable expression on his face, to the lemur he was holding, a lemur with a visibly distended gut and a suspiciously contented look in its round, green eyes. It then let out a lazy, gurgled pip when it noticed Sokka's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka pinched the bridge of his nose with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, that's Momo,\" he muttered. \"Let me guess \u2013 he got into your groceries again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPong nodded darkly, a scowl on his face. Momo looked entirely unconcerned with the man's displeasure, however, even letting out a tiny, satisfied burp as it hung from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka glowered at the lemur, though there was no real heat in his expression, and he grabbed Momo from Pong's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad flying lemur,\" he said in a scolding tone. \"Bad. <i>Bad</i> Momo. We do <i>not</i> eat the produce of the nice man who looks like he's just one bad day away from a nervous breakdown, no matter <i>how</i> sweet and appetizing and succulent and...\" he trailed off as a growling noise emanated from a stomach, a small trail of drool making its way down his chin. \"...and how about I make us some breakfast?\" he said to the lemur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPong brightened up at this. \"Oh, yes!\" he said gladly. \"That would be most deligh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shut in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is a curious fact about storytelling and human nature that, while accounts of danger and drama and other such things that are never pleasant to experience firsthand may stretch out long in the telling, the storyteller laboring long and hard over every minute detail, accounts of plenty and peace and amiable contentment will almost invariably be only mentioned in passing, glossed over with a paragraph or two of description, and no more. Perhaps it is not something that is of the greatest credit to human nature, but people simply do not <i>enjoy</i> stories where everything is simple and peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStories require conflict to be compelling, it is said. Whether it be external or internal, grandiose or petty, conflict is the key to an interesting tale. A chapter of nothing but descriptions of food and beds and calm, peaceful times is scarcely more than fluff if not done well. And even then, many find such inane, banal details to be detestable and boring to uttermost degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, I, in my role as the weaver and teller of this particular tale, shall do my best not to bore you overmuch by lingering on matters of little import in the grand scheme of things (or even the lesser scheme).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days, things were peaceful for the Gaang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Aang got back from his meeting with King Kuei to see Suki doing Katara's hair with Momo sleeping in her lap while Sokka read some sort of adventure story to Toph, he had been relieved that no one was trying to kill anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of that day passed peacefully. He and the others gave Suki a proper tour of the house, and just hung out together for a few hours doing nothing of note or import. They ate lunch at some restaurant in the Middle Ring (the name of the establishment escaped them) before splitting up into separate groups to do their own thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph went to pay a visit to Iroh, while Sokka took Suki on a stroll in one of the nicer Upper Ring parks, and Aang and Katara took Appa out for a ride to give the Sky Bison some time to really stretch its legs. They all had a good time, and they returned to the house at varying times, all in good spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after proceeded in a similarly pleasant, but ultimately uninteresting fashion, as well as the day after that. During this span of time, only a few things of interest happened to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grinned as he unveiled his latest, proudest work to his girlfriend. He yanked the concealing cloth off from over the the canvas, revealing a painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki eyed it in interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe composition was, to put it bluntly, most amateur. The colors blended, but not entirely, and the perspective was a bit off-kilter. The lighting and shading were somewhat inconsistent, and the weak use of negative space leaved much to be desired. The anatomy was far precise, and quite frankly the painting did absolutely no justice to its subject matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet Suki could not help but picture her boyfriend laboring over every line, every drop of paint. She could envision him focusing, his tongue peeking out the side of his mouth in that cute way of his as he concentrated intently on the composition and creation of his work. She could see in every slight splotch and imperfection all of the blood, sweat, and tears he put into this piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painting was on all points <i>mediocre</i> at best, and yet Suki could not help the feeling of pride that blossomed in her chest as she looked at it. The portrait was not good by any stretch of the imagination, and yet when she looked at it all she could think of was how much <i>effort</i> her boyfriend must have put into his art to improve this much from the last time she saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still was a far cry from being called an artist by anyone who wasn't a fat, rich, collector, but to Suki that didn't matter. As far as she was concerned, even for all its flaws, and all its mediocrity, this portrait might as well have been a masterpiece of the highest order for how much emotion it managed to evoke in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Sokka asked her earnestly, such a genuine, innocent, eager expression on his face that Suki's heart melted that much more. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it,\" she said, with all the sincerity of a parent who takes one look at their child's crude, crayon scribbles and proclaims it a masterpiece, proudly pinning it to the door of their fridge with a refrigerator magnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka beamed, and he looked every bit as pleased as he could ever possibly be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki's smile widened as she planted a soft peck on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" she said, her eyes glimmering like lipid pools as she looked into his deep blue lamps. \"I'd be proud to hang it in my living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka chuckled. \"Would definitely be one heck of a conversation starter,\" he agreed with a nod. But then his smile faltered slightly. \"Do you really think that would be appropriate, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it would,\" insisted Suki. \"It's an artful nude, nothing inappropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grinned broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think I did the original any justice,\" he said, growling suggestively and waggling his eyebrows at his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki rolled her eyes, though she was also giggling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I think it looks just like me,\" she said. It was only a half-lie \u2013 the painting really <i>was</i> a striking likeness of her, even as amateurishly done as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about we compare them?\" Sokka suggested playfully. \"Just to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Suki. \"Just give me half a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed one of Sokka's (clean) socks, which she proceeded to hang outside the teen's door, to let everyone know they were \"busy\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, Sugar Queen,\" said Toph, greeting Katara as she walked across the zen garden to where the Water Tribe girl was meditating beside a small koi pond. \"I just thought of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara cracked an eyelid open, curiously quirking an eyebrow at the younger girl. She did not leave her lotus position, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember how you and Sokka and Aang were telling the story of Princess Yue to that crowd at the Jasmine Dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara frowned thoughtfully. She <i>did</i> recall the three of them sharing stories of their past adventures at Iroh's tea shop, though she had difficulty recalling any specific examples right off the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"I think so. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grinned, and set herself down on the ground beside Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Yue was a princess, right? Even though she was Water Tribe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, <i>yes</i>,\" said Katara, resisting the urge to roll her eyes, even though Toph wouldn't realistically have been able to see the gesture. \"One would assume as much from the fact that she was called <i>Princess</i> Yue. And,\" she added, her nose wrinkling slightly, \"being Water Tribe is <i>not</i> exclusive with being royalty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" said Toph, \"No need to get snippy \u2013 I just wanted to make sure. Well, anyways, Yue was a princess because she was the daughter of the Northern Water Tribe's chief, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" said Katara, uncertain what the girl's point was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you and Snoozles are the kids of the <i>Southern</i> Water Tribe's chief, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right,\" said Katara, still not completely sure where Toph was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph smirked, looking as though she knew something no one else did. \"Then wouldn't that make the two of you a princess and a prince?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara nearly choked, recalling something Sokka had said to Yue back what seemed so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not really...\" she said, after getting her breathing back under control. \"The Northern Tribe has been around a lot longer than the Southern one. And also...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara paused, feeling just a little uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well, while I know that neither I or Sokka like being called peasants or savages, in all honesty... Compared to the Northern Tribe, the South Pole lost a <i>lot</i> during the war. Our entire people were reduced to single, tiny village. We had no waterbenders, no scholars, no art or literature or anything. Our culture was all but <i>eradicated</i> by the Fire Nation,\" she explained grimly. \"Even if you WERE to call me and Sokka royalty, what would be royalty <i>of?</i>\" she asked. \"This iceberg? That snowdrift? Those elderly tribesmen? These little children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you were to call me a princess,\" she continued, \"it still wouldn't <i>mean</i> anything. I would just be princess of a few snow huts. Sokka would just be prince of fifty people, at most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet for a moment, and Katara sighed. Now, after saying all of that, she was simply too worked up and distressed to focus on her meditation. She flopped down on her back, stretching out her legs and letting her feet dangle in the koi pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Toph said something that caught her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" she said intelligently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Are you sure?</i>\" Toph repeated. \"You say you and Snoozles aren't really royalty because your culture was wiped out, but I don't believe you. If it was really wiped out, truly, <i>completely destroyed</i>, then why do you exist? If the Southern Water Tribe has really lost its culture, then why do you call yourself Southern Water Tribe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind girl scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because you grew up in a little village with no real books, no fancy pants art galleries and junk, can you really say your culture was destroyed? No, I don't believe that,\" she said firmly. \"You still exist. And so does Sokka, and your dad, and your Gran-Gran, and all those other warriors and tribesmen. I don't know about art or literature, but isn't it the <i>people</i> that define a culture, anyways?\" she asked. \"You're still alive. You still have an identity as <i>Water Tribe</i>. That's enough of a culture for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the way I see it,\" she continued, \"you and Snoozles are already as good as royalty \u2013 and I'm not talking about who you're dad is, either. You're friends with some of the most powerful and important people in the world: the Fire Lord, the Earth King, <i>me</i>...\" she trailed off, a smug look on her face. \"Frankly, if there's anything I've learned growing up as a Bei Fong, it's that status is all about <i>who you know</i>. And you and Sokka know all the right people. Besides, the Southern Water Tribe is rebuilding now, isn't it? It won't just be some little village, any more. It'll grow again, and recover and advance, thanks to you and Snoozles. The way I see it, if you two started calling yourselves a prince and princess, nobody will question it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara blinked, mouth agape. She was silent for a moment, before finally speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... never thought about it like that,\" the waterbender admitted, looking sheepish. Then she shook her head. \"Still, though... I don't know if I would really be... <i>comfortable</i>... with the idea. I've never thought of us as royalty, so it would seem weird to start doing so now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh,\" said Toph with a shrug. \"Everyone's gotta start somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the lore of the Fire Nation, it is said that the first Agni Kai was held when two Fire Sages were crossing a narrow bridge \u2013 one from the west, and one from the east. The two sages met at the middle of the bridge, and neither one could pass the other. Both had urgent business to which they needed to attend, and neither was willing to yield to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo do so would have been dishonorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor either one to kneel down or stand aside to let the other pass would have been tantamount to submission, and these were both renowned sages of equally high standing. They were proud, respected, powerful. Neither one would yield or stand aside. Neither one would submit to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo upon that bridge, they dueled. Each commanded the living spark and fire, each was a master of the dragons' arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash of dancing flames upon the bridge and in the sky could be seen far and wide as the two sages fought for the sake of their pride, their honor. Those who beheld the sight proclaimed that, surely, they must be witnessing a meeting of great and powerful fire gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this, the ritual of an honorable duel between firebenders got its name: Agni Kai \u2013 \"When gods of fire meet.\" And ever since then, when two firebenders had a quarrel with one another, it was tradition to settle the dispute with a ritual duel of the firebending arts, with an Agni Kai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what went through the mind of Fire Lord Zuko as he cast aside his robes, baring his leanly muscled arms and torso. He stepped forward onto the raised platform, feeling the eyes of the nobility and his advisers bearing down upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was not afraid of them. Not any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko narrow his unscarred eye at the man standing before him. He was a stocky, aging member of the nobility. His pepper black hair was flecked with motes of gray and streaks of silver, and his face was deeply lined with the passage of years, but Zuko did not let this deceive him into thinking the man was weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the man's thick, muscular arms and steadily rooted stance belied that he was anything but. Even a cushioning layer of fat could not wholly conceal the powerful, sculpted muscles which tensed and coiled just beneath the surface. The retired Admiral Jakka was anything but weak. He was a master firebender, a fighter of considerable ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Zuko knew this. Because if nothing else, he could at least be certain that his father would never have tolerated a weakling to command so many of the Fire Nation's battleships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we begin, I will give you once last chance to honorably recant,\" said the young Fire Lord. \"If you kneel down now and admit your wrongdoing, I shall be lenient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stony expression on the former admiral's face was unchanging. Scoffing, the man retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What honor is there to be had in submitting to a mere boy?\" the man demanded quietly, stoically. \"What wrong have I done, that I should beg the forgiveness of a usurper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko's expression was cold, unreadable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are stubborn,\" he said. \"Too stubborn to see the reality of the matter. I know you have plotted against me, former Admiral Jakka,\" he stated firmly. \"You make light of my authority, defy my will, call me a usurper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolden eyes flashed, and gouts of flame shot up on all sides of the platform, great walls of fire that ringed the two duelists in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But whether you like it or not, <i>I</i> am the Fire Lord,\" Zuko continued firmly. \"My father was beaten, laid low by the Avatar and stripped of his bending, his Inner Flame. My sister is insane \u2013 in the brief time before she would have been crowned Fire Lord, she lost herself to paranoia. She went mad with power, and she banished everyone but the Fire Sages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man, standing tall, shifted into a firebending stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me,\" he said lowly. \"Do you really think so little of me that you would prefer one of <i>them</i> on the throne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they were not weak,\" Jakka replied, his voice hard as he too took a firebending stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there truly is only one way to settle this,\" said Zuko, before throwing a punch and sending a large fireball straight for his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakka crossed his arms in front of his body, and then he brought them apart. The fireball split down the middle, its flames flowing harmlessly around either side of the aging firebender. He then cocked both arms back, punching them forward as one. Jets of red and yellow and orange blew forth from his fists, merging together in a mighty inferno that engulfed the young Fire Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the fire seemed to collapse in upon itself, shrinking and scattering and coalescing as a firestorm raging round the untouched form of the Fire Lord. Tongues of flame swirled around Zuko as he slowly, gracefully rotated his arms in a motion that seemed more appropriate for a waterbender than a firebender, the fiery glow concentrating in the palms of his hands as he drew in the fire from Jakka's attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then brought his hands together with a sound like a thunderclap, and the flames were sent back at Jakka with tenfold intensity. The man had to work quickly to keep from being overwhelmed by this attack, performing complex movements in an effort to still and disperse the wild inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too much for him to control all at once, and he was overwhelmed. The flames engulfed Jakka as he fell to his knees, yet they did not burn him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew why this was, recalling with a bitter taste in his mouth the words of his childhood firebending instructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A master of fire controls his element with absolute focus. Firebending is, in its purest form, an exercise in discipline, restraint. Any fool can set fire to everything around him, but the flames of a master shall burn only that which he wills them to \u2013 no more, and no less.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAnd Jakka was disgusted with himself. Not for his actions in plotting against the new Fire Lord, not for his crimes and his lies. No, he was disgusted with himself for receiving mercy from a mere boy \u2013 for <i>needing</i> that mercy in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time, he felt a hint of respect towards the young man who had bested him. Zuko was strong, strong enough that he could <i>afford</i> to show mercy. For mercy was a luxury of the strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Zuko</i> was strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakka could respect that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, Zuko was headed back to his throne room after the meeting had finally concluded. He was walking up to the head of the many-pillared hall where the great, carven doors of Fire Lord Kazan opened up into the Fire Lord's ruling chamber. He was just about to push them open when he was stopped by the sound of a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put on quite the show,\" someone behind him said in an almost lethargic tone of voice. Zuko felt a hand slip into one of his palms \u2013 smaller than his own, but with noticeable callouses and a deceptively strong grip \u2013 and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mai,\" he said quietly, warmly, turning his head to face his girlfriend. He squeezed her hand in his. \"I didn't see you in the crowd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, Zuko could have sworn that he saw the ghost of a smirk curve the pale young woman's beautiful, soft lips \u2013 but it was gone in an instant, if it were even truly there to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My seat was behind you,\" the weapons mistress answered, dark eyes peering into Zuko's own gold ones. \"I had a <i>very</i> nice view,\" she remarked, and this time Zuko saw the smirk quite clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reciprocated with a smile, a glint of amusement in his eyes. He tugged on her hand, pulling her forward to where he could wrap an arm around her waist. Mai did not protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that,\" he told her, before pushing the doors to the throne room open. \"Maybe later we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever he was about to suggest, Mai never heard it, because in that instant the two of them were accosted by a harried-looking messenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Zuko, sir!\" the man exclaimed. \"I have news from the salvage and recovery efforts in Wulong Forest and the surrounding areas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Zuko's attention. One of his earliest acts as Fire Lord, aside from ordering the immediate cessation of all hostile military activity in foreign territories, had been to call for a salvage of the wreckage of the Fire Nation's imperial air fleet \u2013 he'd had more than one reason for this. Aside from the rescue of survivors from the crash sites (and there had been dismally few \u2013 his father's final jab, a more irrational part of Zuko supposed), there had also been a desire to salvage parts and raw materials from the ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd also had a more private reason, as well, and he had given instructions for the men to keep an eye peeled for a few specific items. He wasn't sure why he had, unless perhaps out of a certain sense of... <i>obligation</i>, almost, or else maybe just because of simple camaraderie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I should know about?\" Zuko inquired coolly, doing his best not to let any sort of anticipation show on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gave the Fire Lord a look, clearly understanding what Zuko was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aside from a handful of reports from survivors and cost estimates for any further salvage operations in Earth Kingdom territory...\" the man answered in a clear, business-like tone. He no longer looked quite so tired or exasperated, now that he was back in his comfort zone. \"One object of interest was found in the possession of an engineer who was located... <i>recuperating</i>... in Yu Dao.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distaste in the bureaucrat's voice gave Zuko a fairly good idea of how exactly this engineer had been '<i>recuperating</i>'. Well, the Fire Lord wasn't about to judge. The nation's fighting men and women deserved a break after everything that had happened, and anyways it wasn't as though they especially <i>needed</i> to stay in fighting shape anymore. Not now that the war was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this <i>'object of interest'</i>?\" Mai interjected, almost sounding curious as glanced from the messenger to her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing important,\" Zuko answered, looking a little sheepish under the scrutiny of his girlfriend's sharp glance. \"It's just... something of sentimental value, I suppose you could say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai quirked an eyebrow at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe messenger, as though prompted, simply produced a long, thin object \u2013 it was about equal in length to one of Zuko's arms, and very slim and slender. It was a sword, clearly, though Mai noted that the sheath seemed to be of noticeably lower quality than the visible hilt and pommel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Mai drawled as she scanned the item in the messenger's hand. \"This is that <i>'object of interest'</i>? That must be some sentiment,\" she dryly observed, before stepping forward and grabbing the weapon by the sheath. She analysed the hilt, eyeing the lotus pattern on the pommel and the fine craftsmanship. \"This is a Piandao original. Another gift from your old master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko scratched the back of his neck. \"Well, it's not mine, actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Mai curiously unsheathed the weapon, and her eyes widened when she saw that the blade was black as jet, the color of gleaming obsidian. It was straight and narrow, double-edged \u2013 the gentleman of weapons, a stately jian all in black. Her eyes kindled with the spark of something akin to awe as she beheld the weapon in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's <i>beautiful</i>...\" she breathed, reverently running slender, pale fingers down the flat of the blade in what could only be described as a loving caress. \"No wonder you sent a search and rescue party after it,\" she remarked thoughtfully, after a moment of just observing the way the light played across the blade. After another moment, she added, \"If I had something like this, I'd never let it out of my sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko bade the messenger farewell, and he stepped into the throne room with Mai at his side, still inspecting the sword and testing its balance. There was silence as he went up and took a seat upon the raised dais where was set his throne. He sat down, cross-legged, and Mai sat down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt length, the brunette laid the weapon back down, re-sheathing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose is it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, for just a second, Zuko was uncertain what she was talking about, a little distracted the pleasant weight of Mai gently leaning her slender form against his. But then his brain caught back up, and he replied:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's Sokka's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai quirked an eyebrow at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the Water Tribe boy Ty Lee kept flirting with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko made a face. \"Yes, him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai made a thoughtful humming noise in the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well... I think I'm starting to understand what she saw in him,\" she remarked half-jokingly, glancing back at the sword lying by her side. Zuko spluttered at this, and Mai simply rolled her eyes before saying, \"I suppose you're planning on returning this to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he answered. \"He lost it stopping the airships from burning down the Earth Kingdom, had to throw it away to save his life. That's a heavy loss for a swordsman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf against his will, gold eyes flicked to a pair of matching, crossed dao hanging just above his head behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai's eyes followed his, and she nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a lucky guy, to have a friend like you,\" she observed, casually nuzzling her cheek into the crook of Zuko's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fire Lord smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that makes two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Meanwhile, back in Ba Sing Se...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even as the Fire Lord and his girlfriend spoke, back in Ba Sing Se a certain young swordsmen was in the midst of an intense training session. It was a vigorous workout, intended to push both mind and body to their limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no,\" said Piandao, shaking his head as he once more interrupted his student. \"It's step, step, pivot, step \u2013 not step, pivot, step, step. You must start over, once more from the top,\" he instructed firmly, but softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka winced, before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" he asked, holding his position frozen in mid-step. \"We've gone through this twelve times already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we will go through it twelves time more,\" Piandao replied, \"and twelve times again, until you finally get it right. If you truly wish to master the art of the sword, then you must not be willing to settle for anything less than complete perfection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get<i> that</i>,\" Sokka replied, nervously tugging at the collar of the stuffy Earth Kingdom dress clothes Katara had bought for him, trying to loosen it up as small drops of sweat slowly beaded down his face, \"but what does dancing have to do with sword fighting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side, Toph, Suki, and the others giggled and snickered. Sokka shot them a black look \u2013 <i>the traitors</i> \u2013 before turning his attention back to Sifu Piandao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swordsmanship,\" Piandao responded calmly, unfazed by his apprentice's remarks or behavior, \"is an ancient and noble art, and thus one who practices it must learn to comport himself in a manner befitting a noble. Moreover, with the harvest festival drawing near, it is my duty as your mentor to teach you how to behave yourself as a proper gentleman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then smiled at Sokka, the expression warm and proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father entrusted me with the duty of completing your training, and I intend to uphold his trust. You and your friends will be guests of honor in the Earth King's court \u2013 you will be under the direct scrutiny of some of the most powerful and important people in the Four Nations. As such, it is imperative that I impress upon you as much of the art gentlemanly conduct as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as an afterthought, he added: \"Besides, as I have said before, the feet are the foundation of any fighting style, armed or otherwise. By learning to dance, you will better improve your ability to coordinate your footwork, and as a result your swordwork will become more fluid and precise. I guarantee it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Sokka to perk up, and he beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why didn't you just say so?\" he said. \"C'mon, I still haven't got this Ostrich-horse Waltz down yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiandao laughed as he started correcting Sokka's form, and the others echoed his chuckles from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka had a number of penpals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the rest of Team Avatar, as he still mentally called their little group of friends, he had met many people over the course of his journeys. He had made several friends in far flung corners of the world, and he did his best to keep in touch. Of course, in a time and place before radio waves or mass communication, the only real way to do so was by writing letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he wrote a LOT of letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's contacts ranged from people his own age, like Zuko and Suki, to family, like Gran-Gran and Dad, to various others, such as Sifu Piandao or the Mechanist. It seemed like almost every other day he was receiving a new letter from one of his contacts, and he almost always sent a new letter out in response within a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, out of the members of Team Avatar, Sokka probably had the third or second most penpals. Katara had the absolute most, hands down, being the social butterfly that she was. It seemed like she was getting five new letters every day, and she still managed to send out replies as promptly as anything, without fail. The others couldn't even begin to imagine how she was able to do so, but Katara had a gift, in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang, for his part, wrote letters only sporadically \u2013 the young Air Nomad was more inclined to hop on Appa and fly over to a friend's place if he felt like talking to them, and he wasn't the most comfortable with writing letters. Even with how much he had matured since Sokka and Katara had found him in that iceberg, Aang was still very tactile and energetic and, well, <i>childish</i>, to an extent. He was just much more comfortable with face to face conversation, and hadn't really mastered the art of conveying thoughts and emotions through the written word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, of course, had no real penpals: her blindness made reading and writing <i>difficult</i>, to say the absolute least. So when she wanted to send someone a letter \u2013 and this happened only rarely \u2013 she would just dictate the general contents to Sokka and Katara, who would send it out for her. Usually, though, she would just piggyback comments into the others' letters if she felt the need to say anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, however, the point is that Sokka had a<i> lot</i> of penpals. And he got a <i>lot</i> of letters <i>from</i> said penpals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard some mighty curious things in these letters, too. There were a number of references to rumors about himself, for instance, and tall tales of his exploits during the war, but most of the time Sokka couldn't make heads or tails of what his penpals were saying. It made him wonder, from time to time, but for the most part Sokka just attributed it to \"hero worship or whatever\" and shrugged it off. Most of his correspondents seemed to assume that he already knew about the rumors, so they didn't really go into much detail about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka figured it probably wasn't anything too important, whatever the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>However</i>, getting back to the main point of all this, one of Sokka's many penpals was his father, Hakoda. And the two of them exchanged <i>many</i> letters, keeping one another up to date on the various happenings here and there in their respective corners of the world. This included news of occurrences both political and... more <i>domestic.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD'S COMING UP HERE FOR THE HARVEST FESTIVAL!\" Sokka exclaimed to the rest of the living room, looking up from the letter he had just been perusing. He had a look of barely contained excitement on his face, a wide grin spreading from ear to ear as he looked around eagerly at the others in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news garnered mixed reactions from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang, who had been bobbing a piece of string up and down for Momo to bat at, looked immediately to his girlfriend, perhaps wondering what her response would be. Katara, for her part, simply smiled at her brother, seeing how gleeful he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, on the other hand, looked a little anxious. She was smiling, but it appeared just a tiny bit forced. Perhaps she was nervous about meeting her boyfriend's dad \u2013 she hadn't really had a chance to meet the man during the post-war celebrations, and she'd left for Kyoshi Island almost immediately after that. Maybe part of her felt a little guilty over that, and wondered whether Hakoda would approve of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, in contrast, looked completely unperturbed. \"So?\" she said. \"Your dad's coming over. Big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun a finger in the air next to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it<i> is</i>, isn't it?\" Aang replied. \"It's a long way from the South Pole to Ba Sing Se.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A long, <i>long</i> way,\" Katara agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But the girls in the city,</i>\" Suki chimed in with a scarcely suppressed giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Are ohhh sooo prettyyyyy!</i>\" Toph continued in a theatrical singsong, before breaking down in hysterical laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka scowled, though on closer inspection it was evident that he was fighting the urge to snicker, his lips twitching minutely and his eyes flicking between the two girls with a glint of amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara rolled her eyes, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you <i>know</i> what I mean,\" she grumbled irritably. \"It isn't like Dad can just hop on a flying bison and come up here. It can take <i>weeks</i> to sail all the way up here from the South Pole. It's not a journey you would undertake on whim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then got a thoughtful expression on her face, and glanced over in her brother's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Sokka,<i> did</i> he say why he was coming up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen shrugged. \"Just that he had some good news,\" he answered. \"Something he wants to say in person, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang looked interested at this. \"Huh. I wonder what it could be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'unno,\" Sokka grunted in response. \"Maybe he's seeing someone and wants to introduce us to her?\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara made a face at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph let out a low whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wow</i>, Sugar Queen,\" she remarked. \"Are you having a heart attack or something? You must be <i>really</i> freaked out at the idea of getting a new mom,\" she said teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Katara retorted, a little too quickly. Her ears were red. \"Why would you say that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be sweet,\" Suki supplied. \"Your father must feel so lonely, with his children all the way off in Ba Sing Se, and no more war to occupy his time. It would be only natural for him to begin yearning once more for a woman's love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or a man's,\" Toph suggested nonchalantly. \"I mean, him and Bato <i>are</i> pretty close, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Sokka and Katara to nearly choke, their faces turning bright red. <i>That</i> was not a pleasant mental image for either one of them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of days later, while Aang and Katara were out doing whatever they did when they went on dates, a letter came in for Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow even by itself, this occurrence would have been unusual and worthy of note, because Toph <i>never</i> got mail, for obvious reasons. But what particularly caught the attention of those present was <i>how </i>the letter had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAWKY!\" Sokka exclaimed gleefully, jumping up to his feet at the sight of the sleek crimson plumage of his Fire Nation messenger hawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Toph, her head turning as she sat up from picking her toes. \"Seriously? That bird of yours is actually <i>back?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounded both astonished and anxious \u2013 why the latter was, neither of the other two could guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, for her part, only looked lost for a moment before her eyes widened as she remembered the bird from the stories she had heard from her boyfriend. She remembered the messenger hawk he'd told her he had purchased with his share of the proceeds from Toph's spree of scams in that one Fire Nation town, back before the Day of Black Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also remembered him telling her how the hawk had vanished without a trace, shortly after he had bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I can't believe it actually managed to find you all the way in the Earth Kingdom,\" said Suki, impressed with the clever raptor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird preened under the attention it was getting, looking as self-satisfied as physically possible with its avian features. It was roosted on the sill of the open window, head held high as its lethal talons gripped the fine plaster windowsill constructed in the fashion favored by many of the Upper Ring's wealthier residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Sokka noticed something sticking out of the scroll case on Hawky's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Do you have a letter for me, Hawky?\" he asked the bird, as though expecting it to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawky simply stared at him, as if to say <i>Are you some kind of moron?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Sokka understood this, he did not react. Instead, he simply held out his arm, allowing Hawky to alight upon it. The Water Tribe teen bit back a yelp at the feeling of his pet's razor sharp talons pinching holes into his skin, and he opened up the bird-sized backpack to see two scrolls sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, he pulled them out and checked to see to whom they were addressed \u2013 more out of habit than anything else, considering that Hawky <i>was</i> his bird. The first had Toph listed as the recipient \u2013 something Sokka found strange \u2013 and Grand Duke Lao Bei Fong as the sender \u2013 something that made him suspicious, considering what had happened the last time there had been a letter supposedly sent to Toph by her parents. The second, however was addressed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, he <i>assumed</i> it was. He didn't remember ever being called <i>Prince Sokka the Brave of the White Wolf Dynasty</i>, though. Even if he <i>had</i> told Yue that he was<i> kind of a prince, himself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's cheeks flushed faintly at the memory of that, and the memory of the verbal burn he had subsequently received courtesy of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" came Toph's voice. \"<i>Does </i>Hawky there have a letter for you, Snoozles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blinked, shaken out of his reverie by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" he said. \"One for you, too. From your parents \u2013 both of them are, actually. Odd, that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's ears turned bright pink at this, though Sokka didn't notice. \"Yeah... odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki gave the young earthbender a curious look, uncaring of whether or not she could see it (and she <i>could</i>, as it were). She highly suspected that Toph knew more than she was letting on, but she decided not to press the issue, instead turning her attention back to her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they say?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out,\" Sokka replied cheerfully, unrolling the scroll addressed to himself first. Quickly, his eyes skimmed the message, looking for anything of interest. \"Huh,\" he murmured, spotting a curious passage. \"I don't really get what they're talking about, but apparently your parents think very well of me, Toph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind chit quirked a thin black eyebrow at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously,\" Sokka said with a nod. \"They even addressed me as <i>Prince</i> Sokka, and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki stifled a giggle at this, but Toph looked more or less unsurprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you kind of <i>are</i> one\" the Blind Bandit stated matter of factly. \"It only makes sense they'd want to kiss up to the future Chief of the Southern Water Tribe, right? Especially now that it's being rebuilt and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blinked, taken aback by this, and Suki's jaw dropped slightly as she took in what Toph had just said. The former <i>had</i> known for a good while that he was basically the next in line for position of chief \u2013 because even if the rank was technically granted on personal merit, the tribe generally favored the family of the previous chief when it came to choosing the next one. And the Southern Water Tribe<i> was</i> rebuilding, so it wasn't as though they would be irrelevant forever, right? Eventually they would be a true world power, the way they used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, for her part, was surprised because this was the first time she'd really considered <i>who</i> Sokka was. She had known, of course, that his father <i>was</i> the current chief of the Southern Water Tribe, but whether because of the simple, unsophisticated manner in which he comported himself or something else, she simply hadn't made the conscious connection that <i>Sokka</i> would of <i>course</i> be the next in line. For all intents and purposes, her boyfriend was essentially a <i>prince</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki wasn't entirely sure sure how she should take this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Was there anything else?\" the Kyoshi Warrior asked at length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah!\" said Sokka, and he glanced back at the high quality parchment in his hands. \"They said they're looking forward to meeting me, though that doesn't really make sense. I mean, we already met once, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they didn't really get to talk to you at the time,\" Toph responded. \"As I recall it, you were too busy stuffing your face to make any small talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka at least had the decency to look embarrassed for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was hungry,\" he weakly protested, still blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled at the sight. Her boyfriend really was cute when he got like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought struck her at that moment, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what about Toph's letter?\" she inquired. \"I don't imagine she can read it herself.\" She paused, and turned to look at the younger girl a little sheepishly. \"Err... No offense, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" Toph said blandly. \"And no, obviously I <i>can't</i> read it. So, Snoozles? Mind reading it out loud for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded in understanding. \"Sure,\" he said, before unfurling the scroll... and unfurling further. After a few seconds of that, he stared at the rather lengthy letter, not looking particularly excited at the thought of reading it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" he said, \"You want the full version, or do you mind if I abridge it a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abridge away, Captain,\" said Toph without so much as a moment's hesitation. \"I can only handle so much of their whining in a single sitting, anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief, Sokka began to recount the gist of what the letter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see. They say hi... a lot of pleasantries and... ah, personal hygiene reminders...\" he trailed on, a faint mixture of pink and green tingeing his cheeks. \"Let's see, what else... what else... Oh!\" he exclaimed. \"Apparently they're coming up here for the Harvest Festival. Say they have some good news for you. I wonder what it could be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" she muttered, \"but knowing <i>their</i> definition of 'good'... I get the feeling that I am not going to like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sighed, before going silent and letting herself fall back down on her... well, <i>back.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the odds, though?\" mumbled Suki after a moment's silence. \"Both Toph's parents and your and Katara's dad coming up to Ba Sing Se for the Harvest Festival. That's some coincidence...\" she said in a manner which suggested that she did not f<i>or one second</i> believe it really was just a coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhh, not really,\" Toph replied. \"It is a pretty big event, after all. And we're guests of honor, at that. Only natural our parents would decide to come up here.\" She was then quiet for a moment, before somewhat darkly adding under her breath, \"<i>I'm still suspicious of this so-called 'good news', though...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Sokka, \"I'm sure it's nothing important. They probably just wanna be here with their kids.\" He looked unconcerned, apparently not having heard Toph's muttering. \"Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if we heard from <i>your</i> parents next, Suki,\" he added with a go-lucky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of her boyfriend's optimism, however, Suki could not help but feel pensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a feeling that this was <i>no</i> coincidence.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the Harvest Festival drew nigh, the Gaang threw themselves into preparing for the party. They would be guests of honor in the Earth King's palace, where a ball would be held in celebration of the year's traditional final harvest. It was one of the most important events in the Earth Kingdom, and just about everybody who was anybody would be in attendance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarming was an integral part of the Earth Kingdom's culture, after all. Many of the most widespread festivals in the nation pertained in some manner to planting or harvest. Of the Four Nations, the Earth Kingdom had ever been the most agrarian, and this shined through in nearly every aspect of life. For instance, grains \u2013 ranging from rice to corn to wheat \u2013 formed the foundation of the traditional Earth Kingdom diet, followed shortly by vegetables and fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeat was also considered an important part, of course, but it was simply much too expensive for the average citizen to eat in more than small amounts. Hunting was not very widespread in the Earth Kingdom, certainly not outside of rural countryside settlements, and livestock took a lot of time and investment to raise and sustain, much moreso than planted crops. In that way, the Earth Kingdom was the opposite of the Water Tribes, where meat was much more readily available than fruits or vegetables, and hunting and fishing were the primary sources of sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if most Earth Kingdom nobility were not themselves farmers, and perhaps even looked down on the peasants who did such work, the mentality of farming communities was still ingrained into the cultural subconsciousness. Even in the court of the Earth King, the mentality of farming communities still showed forth in their manner of legislation and regulation. Those who knew how to look for such things could easily find signs of the influence of communal farms and crop-sharing and self-governing villages in the prevailing political and economic theories of Ba Sing Se's scholars and intellectuals. Even if most of these people had never so much as <i>touched</i> a sickle or a spade in their life, they still <i>thought</i> like farmers, in a way, because their fathers and their fathers' fathers and their fathers' fathers' fathers had all thought like farmers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, and most importantly, the people of the Earth Kingdom valued fertility above almost all else. From the flourishing of crops to the fathering of children, the Earth Kingdom's people prized fertility in all its forms. Spring was the season of earth, and it was the season when farmers began once more to sow their seeds and let them grow. But autumn was the season of harvest, when the farmers reaped the last of what they had sowed and set down the last of their stores against the onset of winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harvest was where the fruits of fertility were made apparent, where those who had been blessed the most bountifully by the heavenly patrons of crops and livestock got their chance to make boast of the returns on their agricultural investments. Primarily via feasting, as well as singing and drinking and dancing and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was as much the case in the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se as it was out in the sticks. Indeed, the Harvest Festival was hands down just about the single most auspicious social event in the Earth King's court, and an invitation to the Harvest Ball in the Earth Palace was considered one of the most prestigious honors one could be granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Hakoda was contemplating all of these things as he disembarked from his ship, closely followed by his right hand man, Bato. Their vessel was a craft of Water Tribe make, a re-purposed cerulean longboat with its bleached-ivory prow carved into the shape of a leaping arctic wolf, Hakoda's personal device as well as the source of his moniker. The longboats of the Southern Water Tribe were swift and maneuverable vessels, capable of sailing across oceans or up rivers with uncanny ease \u2013 even when heavily laden with men and supplies, the ingenuity of their design enabled the ships to float high in the water, and there were few bodies so treacherous or shallow as they could not navigate. And they were easy to handle, or at least so long as one was raised in their use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even for these crafts, the journey from the South Pole to Ba Sing Se was an arduous one. It had taken twelve long days of sailing against inclement weather and marauding pirates to get here, to the docks of Full Moon Bay at the foot of the Impenetrable City, and they were weary and hungry and sore. Yet they had made it. It had been rough sailing, but they had finally made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda smiled, seeing his children waiting at the far end of the docks alongside their friends. Sokka was practically jumping for joy at the sight of him, and even Katara was showing signs of restrained excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiii!\" came the Avatar's voice as the young lad suddenly leaped several feet into the air before floating down in front of the two Water Tribe men, a broad smile on his smile on his face. When he set back down on the creaky, wooden plank surface of the dock, Aang bowed, once to each of them. \"Bato. Chief Hakoda,\" he said, speaking in a more polite, reserved tone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda could still see the smile tugging at the corners of boy's lips, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you, kid!\" Bato said exuberantly, reaching out with his unscarred arm to grab the mortal incarnation of the Planet's living spirit and give him a noogie. \"You still fire ferreting away maps?\" he asked goodnaturedly, teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Not really,\" said Aang with a sheepish chuckle. \"Not anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" said Bato, chortling. \"Too bad!\" he laughed, letting go of Aang with a final slap on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda, meanwhile, was currently being polar bear dog-piled by Sokka and Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!\" the chief laughed as his kids wrapped their arms around him, hugging him just about as tightly as they could. \"Yes, yes,\" said he, \"I'm happy to see you guys, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so awesome that you came all the way up here, Dad!\" Sokka gushed, and Hakoda could feeling his ribs groan in protest as the boy squeezed even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis son was getting pretty damn strong, the man noted with a hint of pride. <i>And so was Katara</i>, he found himself adding when the girl tightened her embrace as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Dad,\" said the waterbender in question, smiling warmly up at her father. \"It really means a lot to us that you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sokka murmured in agreement, and Hakoda could only grin and hug his children back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have missed this for the world,\" he told them warmly. \"I have to be the luckiest father in the world to have two such <i>amazing </i>children. I couldn't possibly be prouder of you guys,\" he finished, and it was clear that he meant every word of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled at the heartwarming sight, seeing how happy her boyfriend and his sister looked. Toph standing next to her, appeared less impressed, and had her arms wrapped tightly around herself as she shivered slightly in the cold spray of waves smashing rhythmically against the stony shore of Full Moon Bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former walked down the dock to introduce herself, more or less, while the latter stood her ground where she was on the wooden planks of the dock, wet and miserable and rooted in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said Suki, walking up to where Aang and Sokka and Katara were with Bato and Hakoda. \"I don't believe we've had a chance to meet, yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bowed to Hakoda, curt yet respectful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Suki,\" she said, by way of introduction. \"Suki of the Kyoshi Warriors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda, looking up from his children, saw the young woman. He greeted her with a nod and a polite smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Suki,\" he said pleasantly enough for the purpose of their conversation. \"My son's told me a lot about you. He seems pretty smitten, actually!\" Hakoda added with a short laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's ears turned red, and his cheeks quickly followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Daaaaaad!</i>\" he protested, embarrassed in the way that only a teenager with a parent could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda simply chortled, letting go of his kids to affectionately tousle their hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" he said fondly, a warm grin on his face. \"I'll try not to embarrass you,\" he promised noncommittally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato, however, had turned his attention from ribbing Aang to eye Suki thoughtfully, an unidentifiable glint of something in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" the man hummed thoughtfully, stroking his beard as he regarded Sokka's girlfriend with a speculative gaze. \"So you're a Kyoshi Warrior, right?\" he inquired at length. \"Is it true, what they say about\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Bato get to finish his sentence?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whatever Bato was going to ask, it was cut off quite suddenly by a sudden, loud curse from Toph, followed by splash and another, louder curse as the girl fell off of the dock and into the water, knocked off by some careless traveler who hadn't bothered to watch where they were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AUUUGH! YOU BASTARD!\" she cried furiously, beginning splash and thrash in a blind panic as she felt the cold water wash over her. \"I'M DROWNING! I'LL KILL YOU! ARGH! I'M DROWNING! YOU DAMN MELON HEAD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water wasn't even chest-high where Toph had fallen in, but you wouldn't have guessed that from the way she was so desperately flailing her arms and violently cursing whatever feckless jackass had knocked her off the dock. For all her toughness and skill as an earthbender, Toph still could not swim, and she was perhaps even a tad bit traumatized from the last time she had fallen into the water of this damnable bay and nearly drowned. At least<i> this</i> time that bloody serpent wasn't around to make things even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLARGH! I CAN'T SWIM! HELP ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if Toph was thinking logically, she would have realized that she could just wade her way back to shore by following the sandy floor of the bed. But going so suddenly from the wooden dock where she couldn't \"see\" to the water where she couldn't swim had left her severely discomfited and discombobulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome might have even gone so far as to say that she was slightly hysterical, though on solid ground Toph would kick the ass of anyone who dared even<i> imply</i> such about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M DROWNING! YOU'RE DROWNING ME! I HAVE BEEN DROWNED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, however, the fact of the matter was that Toph was not thinking straight, and if she kept up thrashing like that she could very well wind up <i>making</i> herself drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, kicking off his shoes, Sokka hopped into the water next to Toph. It went barely past his waist at that depth, but even if it had been deeper than twice his height he wouldn't have had a problem. Although the waters of the South Pole were far too cold for anything more than the absolute briefest of dips, the people of the Water Tribe still had a certain natural aptitude for swimming that bordered almost on instinct \u2013 in much the same way that even nonbending members of the Earth Kingdom or Fire Nation could work the soil or light a fire respectively with a borderline uncanny ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was irrelevant here, because the water was \u2013 <i>again</i> \u2013 barely even past Sokka's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly, the teen grabbed hold of one of Toph's madly flailing arms, earning himself a few new lumps in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY BADGER-MOLES!\" the blind earthbender howled as she struggled unthinkingly against Sokka's grip. \"MY BADGER-MOLES! DON'T FORGET ME, MY BADGER-MOLES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph,\" he nearly shouted. \"Toph! Calm down. You aren't drowning,\" he told her. \"I've got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph somehow managed to settle down at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka...?!\" she gasped, as she felt the Water Tribe teen begin guiding her to the shore. \"You saved me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked sheepish at this, though Toph couldn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I guess...\" he said, using his free hand to scratch the back of his head. \"For a given definition of <i>saved</i>, at any rate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he went silent, unable to process speech as his brain suddenly suffered a fatal exception when Toph <i>kissed him</i>. Not that it was anything steamy, mind you, just a soft peck on the cheek, but it was still enough to make Sokka turn a little pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hero,\" the Bei Fong heiress declared uncharacteristically primly, uncaring of whether he had really actually <i>saved</i> her from anything besides her own panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka coughed nervously, feeling uncomfortably aware of everyone's eyes on him and Toph as he led the girl by hand out of the water \u2013 more out of politeness than any actual belief that she really <i>needed</i> his guidance, now that she had calmed down. Sokka was quite abashed on the behalf of Toph, as well as himself. He was certain they must have made quite the pair of fools, walking out of the shallow waters with their clothes sopping wet \u2013 especially after that frankly embarrassing spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointedly avoiding the gaze of his friends and family, whom he was certain must have found this quite the sight, Sokka turned to Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, uh, how did you fall in, anyways?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" she replied after a moment of thought. \"I felt someone bump into me, and then I was in the drink. They weren't even watching where they were going!\" she muttered with a scowl. \"Stupid blind gorilla-goat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded, silently agreeing with Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was when someone chose to interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am sorry for that,\" came a vaguely familiar voice, one which Sokka placed as belonging to a middle-aged man \u2013 and probably some sort of noble or old money, judging by the crisp, precise diction of his speech. \"I really should have been watching where I was going, but these docks are simply so crowded with unsavory sorts that I was, perhaps, caught just a little off-guard. Not at all a pleasant place,\" he added in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka turned around to see a very well dressed man sending a look of distaste at the surrounding docks, and his jaw could have dropped to the ground when he saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you agree, <i>daughter?</i>\" said Grand Duke Lao Bei Fong to Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just <i>great.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, realizing that her father was here \u2013 and thus likely her mother as well \u2013 and that they had probably seen the entirety of her little freak out, suddenly found herself wishing that the ground would just hurry up and swallow her already. Even Sokka's own embarrassment didn't seem nearly so great as it had moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was mortified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ride back up to Ba Sing Se was perhaps the most uncomfortable one ever, in Toph's modest opinion, and this had nothing to do with the trolley operators. As a matter of fact, the trolley itself moved as smoothly as it ever did, and maybe even a little moreso than usual thanks to the presence of the exceeding wealthy and influential Lao Bei Fong in the earthbending-propelled carriage, alongside his wife Poppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Toph's discomfort was not so much physical in origin. It was something much more abstract, and deeply rooted than a sore butt from a bumpy ride. Quite frankly, it had nothing to do with the trolley, and everything to do with its passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be specific, it was her mother and father, and the events that had led up to her... <i>reunion</i>... with them. Particularly the fact that the very first thing that they saw of her since she ran away with Aang and the others all those months ago was the spectacle she had made almost drowning \u2013 in water that was <i>barely even three feet deep.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been humiliated by this revelation, especially when coupled with the fact that her parents saw every second of it. <i>They even saw her kiss Sokka.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just wanted the ground to swallow her up, at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mortifying. All that effort to establish herself as <i>strong</i> and <i>independent</i>, and it had blown up right in her face in a single moment of weakness. A moment of weakness which her parents had j<i>ust so happened</i> to be there to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sliming <b>muck!</b> </i>That was <i>just her luck</i>, really!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could have sworn aloud at the unfairness of it all. Hell, she <i>would've, too</i>, under any other circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not these. Not here, not now. Not in front of her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause they <i>were</i> her parents, no matter how much she despised their coddling, and on some level, perhaps, she still yearned for their approval. Not that she would ever admit as much, but eh, y'know. That was just the way things were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Toph resisted the urge to swear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need them. She really didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly. She <i>didn't.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been utterly humiliating, <i>absolutely galling</i>, to get back on solid ground only to feel those <i>damned knowing smiles</i> on her parents' faces. It was <i>mortifying</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the conversation. Oh bleeding <i>badger-moles</i>, the conversation. Now <i>that</i> had been truly humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, it really had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it continued to be. Oh, how it <i>continued.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you absolutely <i>certain</i> that you are well, dear?\" Poppy Bei Fong inquired concernedly as she worriedly eyed her daughter's simply <i>dreadful</i> appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Toph <i>did</i> look dreadful. There was a hot towel draped over her shoulders, even though Aang and Katara had easily dried her off after her little dip, and her cheeks were ruddy and flushed with a mixture of embarrassment and frustration. Her clothes were also terribly rumpled and disheveled, and her hairband was askew, leaving the girl's raven locks a mess as they fell to and fro and stuck out at odd angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ghastly, really. Completely unbefitting for a member of the Bei Fong family, let alone the <i>heiress</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt times like this, a small part Poppy would almost bemoan her husband's astonishing lack of indiscretions \u2013 at this rate, that small part of her reasoned, even a <i>bastard</i> would be better suited to inherit the Bei Fong estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy ruthlessly quashed these thoughts, however. She loved her daughter, even if she was also so often disappointed with the child, and she would never want to see her passed up for some <i>illegitimate...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy cut off this train of thought before it got any further. It would not do for her to indulge herself in such... <i>vulgarities</i>... even if only in the recesses of her own mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, <i>Rotten roots spawn rotten fruits</i>, as the saying goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm<i> fine</i>,\" Toph finally grunted in answer, for what had to be something like the umpteenth time. There was a dark scowl on her lips as she once more deflected her mother's concern. \"I just got a little wet, is all. No big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy frowned softly at this, no doubt thinking something along the lines of how it certainly seemed like it had been a <i>big deal</i> to Toph at the time, with how she had been yelling about drowning \u2013 and cursing in a <i>most </i>unladylike fashion, too! \u2013 but she decided to let the matter lie, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very<i> short </i>moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is most fortunate you have such a sensible young man looking out for you, daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it backwards,\" she muttered acerbically. \"<i>I'm</i> the one watching out for <i>him</i>.\" She jabbed a thumb in the direction of Sokka, who was sitting stiffly in his seat a few places down from them, next to his father and sister. \"He's hopeless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy giggled demurely, a small smile forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does certainly seem that way at times, does it not?\" she murmured, casting a sidelong glance at her husband, who was looking rather out of place, seated there next to her, behaving so self-assured in the crowded trolley. \"But, still, I daresay we need them even more than they need us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph snorted, a few silken ebony bangs falling down to dangle before unseeing jade eyes. She refused to dignify that with a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't NEED Sokka. She just liked having him around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka was very uncomfortable as he rode on the trolley back up to Ba Sing Se. His back was ramrod straight, and his posture almost painfully stiff. He was sandwiched between his father and his sister, who were in turn seated across from Bato and Aang, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from Sokka himself was also his girlfriend, Suki, but he was currently having a little difficulty meeting her eyes. He was a bit preoccupied with some particular thoughts, and furthermore he was even still a tad flustered over certain recent events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A kiss was planted on his cheek, surprising him as he guided Toph back out of the shallow water and onto shore. It was soft and warm \u2013 almost astonishingly so \u2013 and chaste as well, yet still it stunned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hero,\" the Bei Fong heiress declared uncharacteristically primly, uncaring of whether he had really actually saved her from anything besides her own panic.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blushed a little at the memory, the faintest tinge of pink coming to his cheeks. He was hardly a little schoolboy to get giddy over such a small gesture, and it was not so much the kiss itself that had him so flustered. After all, for all of his faults, one thing that could not be said of Sokka was that he was bad with women. For being \"just the Meat and Sarcasm Guy\", Sokka had had no small number of <i>interactions</i> with the fairer sex over the course of his travels with the Avatar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was something as little as a village girl giggling at his jokes and batting her eyelashes at him, or even as much as a short date or brief fling out back \"in gratitude for services rendered,\" as one particularly forward lass had put it, Sokka had <i>uncannily</i> good fortune with the ladies. Compared to all of that, such a little chaste peck on the cheek was barely even a blip on the radar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, no, it was not the kiss itself that had him flustered. If anything, it was in fact a matter of <i>who</i> it was that had given him the kiss. Coming from someone else, Sokka likely would have just brushed it off as simple gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, he might have gloated a little, internally, if the girl doing the kissing had been particularly cute, but it wouldn't have meant much. Not really. Coming from most other girls, he would have interpreted such a thing as a simple display of gratitude, nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom another girl, it wouldn't have really meant anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not from Toph. No, Toph was not a girly-girl, or even remotely touchy feely. She didn't <i>kiss</i>. A punch to the arm, or even a small smile, he could have understood \u2013 he <i>would have</i> understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not a kiss. No,<i> that</i> he could not understand. Something like THAT just <i>didn't make any sense</i>. It was like waking up one morning only to find that the sky had turned green and the grass was now blue. It just didn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka hated it when things didn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even when they finally disembarked from their trolley, having at last reached the main hub of the Upper Ring, Sokka was still wrapped up in puzzling over this development. Even when Toph's parents commandeered the girl to take her shopping for a \"proper party dress\" or something like that, he was still utterly bemused and lost in thought, trying in vain to make sense of a world that felt as though it had suddenly gone quite topsy-turvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when he and the others finally reached their house, Sokka was still pondering, still wondering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would Toph <i>possibly</i> have kissed him? It just didn't make sense. No matter how he framed it, or how he tried to reason it out, it simply <i>would not compute.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph hated being seen as weak, or girly. Trying to help her was likelier to earn one a bruise than any sort of gratitude \u2013 Sokka knew this well from many long weeks of firsthand experience traveling with and fighting alongside the blind wee firecracker. Toph was proud and willful and fiercely independent. She was about as far from the concept of a damsel in distress as was conceivably possible for a young, blind heiress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when Toph <i>did</i> get into a situation she couldn't get out of by herself \u2013 and that was exceedingly rare \u2013 she did not greet her savior with a kiss. At least, not as far as Sokka knew. For as long as he had known the girl, he could not once recall her showing such a side of herself. He hadn't even realized that there <i>was</i> such a side to Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would hardly be the first time he'd been so mistaken about something, though. And it would seem that he <i>had</i> been, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though. It was just <i>so hard</i> for Sokka to reconcile his image of Toph with what had seen back at the docks \u2013 well, not the almost-drowning part, so much, but the kissing his cheek and calling him her <i>hero</i> part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't even known that Toph HAD heroes. And even <i>if</i> that had truly been only in jest, could he honestly say the same of the kiss? Sure, Toph loved joking around and yanking people's chains, but <i>kissing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, regardless of how he looked at it, Sokka simply could not envision the Toph he knew doing anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut apparently he didn't know Toph as well as he had thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe he was just overthinking this whole damn thing. He didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka sighed, collapsing backwards onto a mat in the living room of the Gaang's house. Aang and Katara had taken Dad and Bato on a grand tour, and Suki was in the other room 'freshening up'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it...\" he groaned, frustratedly massaging his temples, as though he hoped this would somehow jump-start his brain. \"I just don't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What don't you get?\" inquired someone in a familiar, feminine voice, sitting down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Suki!\" Sokka yelped, his cheeks growing pinker, half from a sudden embarrassment with his thoughts and half from the interesting view he got of her body from his present perspective. He had not expected her to finish so quickly, or get back so soon, and it caught him off balance. \"Um. Er, it's nothing, really. I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled down at him, her cheeks dimpling cutely as her lips curved upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this about what happened with Toph?\" she all but singsonged, a knowing look on her face. When she saw the pink in his cheeks go straight to beet red, she laughed. \"No need to look so embarrassed, Sokka! I thought it was <i>sweet</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's blush only deepened at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was <i>so weird</i>, though!\" he protested. \"I mean, Toph doesn't <i>do</i> sweet. It isn't natural!\" he insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki just shook her head, smiling softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's perfectly natural,\" she replied. \"At the very least, she did the same thing with me back at the Serpent's Pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's eyes widened, and he sputtered as his cheeks grew even redder at the thought of Toph kissing Suki, only the kiss he was envisioning in his head was suspiciously much steamier than the one he had gotten, with much grappling and moaning and wet clothes clinging to some surprising (at least in Toph's case) curves. Feeling his heartbeat speeding up and certain... <i>parts</i>... stirring to life, Sokka, in a remote corner of his mind, noted with an almost clinical sort of detachment that he was unusually excited over these thoughts and this mental image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of all logic, Sokka did not feel the least bit upset that Toph had kissed his girlfriend. Quite to the contrary, he found a small part of him perversely wishing to see such a sight firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and strangely aroused, Sokka mentally filed these notes away for further consideration at a later date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph <i>kissed</i> you?\" Sokka asked, sounding perhaps a bit more intrigued than was strictly appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki just laughed it off, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, chuckling softly at the memory. \"Of course, she was absolutely <i>mortified</i> when she realized that I was the one she'd kissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka quirked an eyebrow at this. \"What? Was she expecting Prince Charming, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or something,\" Suki answered simply, bending over to plant a kiss on her boyfriend's cheek, on the opposite side of where Toph had. \"There. Is that better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Much</i>,\" Sokka growled appreciatively. He playfully waggled his eyebrows up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki just rolled her eyes, though she was still smiling. Her boyfriend was no knight in shining armor, but at least he was funny. Easy on the eyes, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And a good kisser</i>, she mentally added a moment later as he pulled her down on top of him, entangling their limbs and ensnaring her lips with his. <i>A VERY good kisser.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo could play at this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toph really didn't see what people liked about shopping. And, yes, she was <i>perfectly aware</i> of the irony behind that statement, so <i>shut up</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she still didn't get what was so great about it. Not really. It just didn't get her motor running. She didn't understand the appeal of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, sure, she liked having <i>stuff</i> \u2013 who<i> didn't</i> after all? \u2013 and of <i>course</i> she knew that shopping was basically the best way to <i>acquire</i> said stuff. And to that extent, she <i>could</i> enjoy shopping, but only as a <i>means</i> to attaining more stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't enjoy shopping just for shopping's sake. She didn't get any sort of thrill from comparing prices or finding bargains. That was more Sokka's shtick, honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, <i>no</i>, Toph wasn't really the biggest fan of shopping. She just didn't get that excited over it. She enjoyed it to the extent of that little bit of materialistic glee one might experience upon the acquisition of something one wanted, sure, but no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her, shopping really was ultimately just a way to get stuff. She only liked it if they were on the hunt for something she <i>wanted</i> to get. And the things she l<i>iked</i> getting were NOT the same as what most other girls liked \u2013 for obvious reasons, she didn't <i>care</i> how shiny or colorful or <i>pretty</i> something was. No, at the end of the day, Toph preferred functionality over fashionability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, <i>clothes</i> shopping, especially if done with people like Katara or \u2013 spirits forbid \u2013<i> her parents</i>, was in Toph's completely unbiased opinion the single most fiendish, heinously <i>mind-numbing</i> form of torture ever devised by mortal man. It was utterly <i>excruciating</i> in how mud-dammed<i> boring</i> it could be \u2013 and usually <i>was.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, no, Toph was NOT happy when her parents dragged her off to buy a \"proper party dress\". She knew that their idea of \"proper\" tended to be all but synonymous with <i>stuffy</i> and <i>boring.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, as her mother and father escorted her from high end boutique to high end boutique over the course of several long hours, Toph felt like she was slowly dying of boredom. They stuffed her into so many fancy-pants costumes that she could scarcely remember what her own clothes felt like at end of her first changing session. And, as a matter of fact, Lao and Poppy had initially been of a mind to <i>throw away</i> Toph's old, worn, patched, threadbare <i>commoner's outfit</i>, and their daughter'd had to do just about everything short of outright <i>threatening</i> her parents with actual, physical, bodily <i>harm</i> before they <i>finally</i> relented and allowed her to keep it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven <i>then</i>, though, it was only on the provision that she <i>at least</i> wear a dress for the rest of the day, once they picked one out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately for Toph's poor ribs, Lao and Poppy managed to find one soon after. The damnable thing felt at least three sizes too narrow and two sizes too long, and the only upside was that the fabric breathed pretty well and felt soft enough against her skin. That still did not even come <i>close</i> to making up for the number of times she caught herself only <i>fractions</i> of a second away from tripping on the hem of the absolutely <i>infuriatingly</i> long skirt, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph <i>hated it</i> when her parents used her as a doll to play dress up with. She really did. Her only solace was that this would only be for the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...At least, she <i>hoped</i> it would be only for the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a small part of Toph also recalled what Sokka had told her of the \"good news\" mentioned in the letter her parents had sent, and she could not help the strange and almost <i>foreboding</i> sensation that shot up her spine whenever she thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>really</i> hoped that this good news actually <i>was</i> good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our daughter has grown much, since the last time we saw her,\" said Poppy Bei Fong as she sat down beside her husband. They were at a table in a tea shop \u2013 the best in the Upper Ring, or so it was reputed \u2013 taking a break from shopping for dresses with their little girl. It had been a good first couple of hours, and they had already found about a dozen acceptable outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, excepting the one presently being worn by Toph \u2013 a simple, elegant white affair of finest silk \u2013 <i>of course</i> all of these dresses had been carried by servants back to the high class hotel where the Bei Fongs were staying for the duration of their time in Ba Sing Se. They certainly didn't trust the dresses to survive a stay in their daughter's personal wardrobe, not if the state of Toph's <i>preferred </i>clothing was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of Toph, the girl in question was currently conversing with the owner of the culinary establishment where they had decided to take a break. Apparently she was a close acquaintance of the jovial old man, or else a very frequent customer, as she spoke with him very warmly and familiarly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLao, for his part, reluctantly conceded no disapproval for the old tea server, finding nothing particularly objectionable with the man's conduct or demeanor. He was certainly pleasant and charming and all around polite enough. The only real strike Lao could find against the elderly store owner was that he was perhaps just a touch too informal for his taste, but even <i>that</i> was more a matter of personal preference than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the tea really <i>was</i> quite good, so Lao was willing to let this slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think so?\" he said, at last responding to his wife's remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed. It is subtle, but I daresay she will begin to blossom very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLao hummed thoughtfully at this, taking another slow sip of his tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the better, then,\" he said, his voice low, so as not to draw attention from unwanted listeners. \"A young woman makes a better bride than a child, regardless of temperament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy nodded her head. \"It is only a shame that she does not take more care for her appearance,\" she remarked. \"Heaven has blessed her with a natural beauty that few can boast, in my eyes. With time, she could be every bit as lovely as the heiress of the Bei Fong family <i>should</i> be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if only she acted the part,\" Lao softly opined. \"Even a diamond must be carefully and precisely cut and polished before it can truly be called <i>beautiful</i>. In its natural state, it is scarcely handsomer than any other common stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Poppy murmured. \"It is such a shame, but hopefully her husband will not be offended by her roughness. As a soldier, I suppose, it might be one thing, but as a<i> bride</i>...\" She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. Quite,\" Lao hummed with a short nod. \"Even the Water Tribe knows the value of proper femininity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah? But his sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I understand it, she is the exception which proves the rule,\" Lao replied. \"And she is involved with the Avatar, besides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, true. She <i>is</i>.\" Poppy nodded, understanding in her eyes. \"Even <i>she</i> comports herself more properly than our daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, a shame,\" said Lao. \"Hopefully the young prince will not be overly dismayed with our Toph's most... <i>unwomanly</i> manner of bearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnoticed to Lao or Poppy, Toph stiffened up slightly, pausing briefly in her conversation with the tea shop's owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy smiled softly. \"If he is anything like his father, then hopefully he will be understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLao nodded, taking yet another sip of his tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true,\" said he. \"Chief Hakoda did <i>indeed</i> come across as an intelligent man. I am certain that he will be able to make his son see reason, should he object to the marriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he whispered those words, Toph's furious shriek tore through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>WHAT?!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was Toph furious?</span></div></div>",

After everything else, she probably should have expected it. Of <i>course</i> they would try to marry her off the moment she was even just <i>barely</i> old enough to become a bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering their prestige and position, and aristocratic dispositions, she honestly should have <i>anticipated</i> this. After all, going behind her back to arrange a marriage wouldn't even be the worst or most <i>infuriating</i> thing that her parents had ever done \u2013 all of it, of course, allegedly in the name of Toph's well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still galled her, though. To think that they would be so<i> utterly inconsiderate</i>, even after everything she had done to assert her independence...? It was absolutely <i>unbelievable!</i> She <i>could not</i> believe them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could they be so <i>insensitive?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's blood rushed to her cheeks. White hot indignation surged through her veins like molten fire, roaring in her ears and making her skin burn hot to the touch. Her hands were curled into fists, her teeth tightly clenched as she ground them together, perhaps in the vain hope of venting some of this boiling, seething <i>anger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracks were quickly forming in the stone tiles at her feet as Toph tried to control her breathing. She remembered Iroh's advice about taking slow, deep breaths to soothe one's temper when it started to get out of control, but all she managed to do was lend more power to her unconscious ragebending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cracks widened and deepened, spreading out and splitting up into countless branches, looking rather like a spiderweb as the floor began to seriously buckle and break at Toph's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beyond livid at the revelation of her parents' so-called \"good news\" \u2013 and she was <i>certain</i> that THIS was the <i>true</i> reason they had come up here. Hell, it was probably even the real reason they'd taken her shopping for dresses. Her mother and her father were planning to sell her off \u2013 no, they <i>had</i> sold her off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not to just anyone, either, <i>oh no!</i> The lucky groom-to-be was none other than <i>Sokka.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Sokka!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>DAMMIT</i>, but Toph wanted to <b>scream</b>. All those <i>months</i> and <i>weeks</i> of crushing on the Water Tribe teen, only for her parents to <i>arrange</i> for her to marry him? It wasn't<i> fair!</i> How could they <i>do this</i> to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Why, oh WHY, did it have to be <i>Sokka?</i> Why couldn't it have been <i>anyone else?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph wanted to tear at her dress and drop the Jasmine Dragon on her parents' heads and scream her protests at the top of her lungs. But all she could do was stand there and shake with scarcely suppressed fury, glowering blindly in her parents' direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did it have to be Sokka? Why did they have to pick <i>him?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph felt something hot and wet prick at her <i>useless slagging eyes</i>. Her breath was coming in gasps, her frame shuddering as she clenched her fists tighter and tighter, fingernails biting into the skin of her palms, drawing thin lines of blood. Her knuckles were as white as her face was scarlet, and every minutest movement of her body caused more cracks to travel through the stone foundation of Iroh's tea shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn't her parents have chosen anyone else? Why? Why, oh WHY did it have to be <i>Sokka?</i> Were it anyone else \u2013 <i>anyone else at all</i> \u2013 this would have been so much simpler. If it wasn't Sokka, she could have already shouted her objections and stormed out the door to go knock down a few walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they hadn't picked Sokka, Toph would not have lost her voice, would not have been unable to force the words from her lips. She would not have felt so conflicted, would not have been so divided within herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was not so fortunate. No, her parents <i>had</i> chosen Sokka \u2013 and from the sounds of it, the arrangement had already been <i>made</i>, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit. She wanted to protest, but she also wanted it to go through. She wanted to stay independent, but she also wanted Sokka's lo... his lov... his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...well, nothing she was willing to admit <i>out loud</i>, she thought with an inward sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut <i>still.</i> She didn't know what to do. Under <i>any other circumstances</i>, it would have been SO much simpler. But it <i>wasn't</i> simple, much to Toph's chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dammit</b>. Why couldn't she just get the words out of her mouth? Why did she have to lose her voice? Why did this have to be <i>so freaking difficult?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn't she just say <i>NO </i>already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph cursed under her breath. She hated being weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what she thought as she turned on her heel and stalked away from her parents, using her earthbending to blow a hole in the nearest wall. Golden midday sunlight poured in through the hole, and clear watery tears glistened in misty jade eyes as Toph Bei Fong once more ran away from her from her parents and their thrice-damned <i>duty.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could apologize for wrecking Iroh's shop later, but right now Toph just needed to be <i>alone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She needed time to think.</i></span></div></div>",

No matter how thoroughly one might strategize, how meticulously one might strive to account for all possible variables, no plan has ever survived long unchanged. No matter how many moves one may think ahead, there will always be something <i>somewhere</i> along the way that will pop up just to throw the proverbial hog-monkey wrench into the works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it was unavoidable, a veritable cosmic law. A plan could never be expected to survive long in battlefield conditions. It just wasn't possible. There were too many variables to take into account at any given instant, and that wasn't even <i>counting</i> the chaotic influence of the human element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to create a \"foolproof plan\" was like setting a hundred rubber balls to bounce back and forth off of one another and expecting to then <i>accurately</i> predict down to the <i>millimeter </i>where <i>every single one of them</i> would come to a stop. It was an exercise in futility, at best: an object lesson in the dangers of hubris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to plan ahead of time for every possible eventuality. No mortal could do such a thing \u2013 even the vast majority of spirits would not waste their time trying. It just wasn't done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, yes. No matter <i>how</i> well they had plotted it out, there was simply <i>no way</i> that their plan could have <i>possibly</i> gone off without a hitch. Hakoda knew this better than anyone, and he had been prepared for things to go south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust not this <i>far</i> south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, a good strategist was <i>not</i> someone who tried to control every piece on the board. No, the best tactical minds were those who were adept in spur-of-the-moment solutions \u2013 the ones who could play a situation by ear and come out on top, who could devise a new plan at the drop of a hat when the current one failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda knew this, but there was still only so much that could be done in terms of last-minute adjustments. <i>Especially</i> under the current circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose circumstances being Lao and Poppy showing up unannounced and nearly out of breath on the doorstep of the house where his kids had been staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our daughter... found out our plans ahead of schedule,\" said Lao, maintaining a properly dignified poise even while red-faced and panting. \"She did not... take well to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That</i>, as Hakoda soon learned once they divulged the full tale, was perhaps the understatement of the century. Toph had overheard them discussing the wedding arrangements, apparently, and from the sound of it the girl had been <i>this close</i> to dropping an entire tea shop on her parents' heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the kids had been well within earshot of him and the Bei Fongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did they react to what they heard?</span></div></div>",

Their nostrils were flared and their teeth were bared in matching snarls. Even Aang was looking noticeably disapproving, narrowing cold gray eyes at the adults, his staff clutched firmly in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Suki didn't look angry, and that was mostly only because she was too busy being aghast. All color had left her cheeks, leaving them so ashen white that at first glance one might not be blamed for believing she was wearing her war paint, and her eyes were nearly as round as dinner plates. Her mouth hung open, wordlessly agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't <i>believe this</i>,\" Katara hissed, glowering furiously at her father and the Bei Fongs. Bato was hiding somewhere out of sight, having split as soon as he'd first seen the livid expression on the young waterbending prodigy's face. \"How could you do this to Toph? And <i>Sokka</i>, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Aang chimed in, readily leaping to his girlfriend's support. \"How could you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda nearly flinched under the pressure of the unhappy looks being sent his way, but Lao simply scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Toph's parents, it is our prerogative to ensure that our daughter is betrothed and provided for,\" he said this slowly, as though he were explaining something to a young child. \"It is only proper that we should choose a husband for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis raised Katara's hackles, the young, independent waterbender having a very strong opinion on this sort of thing. She shot Lao a glare so frigid that Aang and the others half expected the man to become spontaneously encased in a block of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph doesn't need a <i>husband</i> to provide for her!\" snapped the Water Tribe lass. \"Not so young! And even if she <i>did</i>, she shouldn't need to have someone picked out <i>for her!</i> It should be HER choice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" chorused Sokka, and Suki belatedly chimed in with a weak,<i> \"What she said!\"</i> before Sokka continued on with, \"Toph doesn't need my help, and besides! I've got <i>Suki!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrapped an arm around his girlfriend's waist \u2013 possessively, defensively \u2013 and the Kyoshi Warrior seemed to be emboldened by this. Suki's back stood straighter, and her eyes glanced more fiercely between the Bei Fongs and her boyfriend's father. She placed a hand on Sokka's hip, raising her nose defiantly at their meddlesome elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't force Sokka into this,\" she said lowly. Her voice was soft, but it held an edge as sharp as any sword. \"Not any more than you can force Toph. They have a right to <i>choose</i> who they'll marry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang and Katara and Sokka all grinned at this, but they were hard grins, warlike. Cold and sharp they were, like the points of spears held in array against the trio of marital conspirators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes sparked like torches in the black of night, flaring suddenly bright and hot as though under the whispered exhortations of a stoking breeze. Their spirits were growing stronger and brighter as they each affirmed the others' convictions in the rightness of their cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after the other, they pushed the assault, lobbing their protests and complaints and accusations at Hakoda and Lao. Their words grew sharper and fiercer with every turn of phrase, their indignation at the injustice of this plot \u2013 whether real or perceived \u2013 became steadily greater and more furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How could you betray our trust!\"</i> and <i>\"Do you have midnight sun madness?!\"</i> and <i>\"We refuse to let this happen!\" </i>they cried one after the other, and many more things also they said. One after the other, with unrelenting ferocity, they lambasted the conspirators, decried their plots and vilified them for lies of omission and commission. Every angry word, whether spoken in defense of Toph and Sokka's rights or in criticism of the outdated, backwards practices that these three were carrying on, was filled with bitterness and bile quite uncharacteristic for most of the Gaang, riled up as they were by Katara's words and the trio's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued in this manner for what could have been hours (or so it felt, but it was most likely closer to ten or twenty minutes, in reality), meticulously listing every single fault with the concept of arranged marriage, the practice of all but selling off ones' sons and daughters in such a fashion, and even the very establishment political which enabled and <i>encouraged</i> such things. They thoroughly deconstructed every point of this plan and cast multiple aspersions upon the character and integrity of any and all who were responsible for allowing Hakoda and the Bei Fongs to arrange a marriage between their eldest son and only daughter, respectively, ranting and soliloquizing until they were red-faced and panting, skin slick with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara, of course, had been the one to lead the charge with her impassioned speech and rhetoric, and she was also the last to lose steam. But she <i>did</i> finally come to a halt in her declamations of this conspiracy, her shoulders heaving as the last of her indignation and self-righteous fury left her. She was completely spent, emotionally, and she had thrown out every single thing she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she said lowly, giving her father a pointed look. \"Do you <i>still</i> think we'll let you go through this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did her best to glower at him, though it was a little difficult with how <i>drained</i> she felt, after having put everything she had into her long and passionate rant. But she felt satisfied, at least a little. Surely they would listen to this, she thought, and realize what a <b><i>horrible</i></b> idea this arranged marriage was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Hakoda had the gall to simply shake his head and <i>smile</i> at them. And <i>then</i> he proceeded to explain his reasoning behind why he had agreed to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their father spoke, Katara could not help but notice the look that began to dawn on Sokka's face. It was not a happy or accepting one, exactly, but still Katara could help but find that she felt that she did not at all like what it implied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't <i>actually</i> be considering this, <i>surely!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it had to be something else. It had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just mistaken, was all. Just mistaken.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nShe had to be.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Iroh was a kind man. He was a good friend and advisor, slow to anger and filled with decades' worth of sage advice and useful proverbs. He sympathized readily with others, and he treated the problems of total strangers as seriously as he would treat his own. He would sooner laugh at <i>himself</i> than at someone who came to him for his advice. (Though he <i>did </i>have a very good sense of humor, in his own modest opinion!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh was a good friend. He loved freely, in a grandfatherly sort of way, and he was always there when someone needed him. And he <i>always</i> seemed to know <i>just</i> what someone needed, whether they were angry or upset or just plain burned out. Whatever the problem, he would be at the ready with a cup of piping hot tea in his hand and a slew of old saws and aphorisms on the tip of his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the same for a complete stranger as it was for a close friend. And it was the same for Toph, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot your tea,\" the old man said kindly, sitting down next to the young blind earthbender atop a short stone wall overlooking much of the Upper Ring's more picturesque scenery. Behind them was a trail of destruction that led all the way back to the Jasmine Dragon, the tea shop barely visible to his eyes as a little smudge of earthy color in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sighed, accepting the cup from her elderly friend. The beverage inside was still hot \u2013 no doubt Iroh had used his firebending to keep it warm \u2013 and she could feel the fragrant steam wafting up into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked her legs back and forth through the empty air, rhythmically tapping her bare, calloused heels against the smooth stone of the wall. They weren't more than a few feet above the ground, but the wall was situated atop a gentle gradient, a softly sloping hillside that rolled downwards into one of a number of parks in the massive city of Ba Sing Se.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the intermittent vibrations of her heels slapping the side of the wall, Toph had by now picked up a very good picture of the park below them. She could almost count the individual blades of grass in her head, feeling each one like a little <i>blip</i> in the back of her mind, and she could <i>feel </i>the roots of the occasional tree reaching deep into the earth. If she paid attention, she could almost even feel the roots slowly growing, moving, <i>stretching</i> further and deeper along innumerable branching paths, an ever-expanding net that spread far and wide in search of moisture and minerals. She could perceive how these roots, from the oldest and thickest to the slenderest and newest, pushed aside the earth as they slowly <i>slowly</i> grew, shifting and packing the soil in such subtle, gradual movements that perhaps none but she and the badger-moles could truly sense them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beautiful, to her, in a way for which human language really had no words. Even if she were of a poetic inclination, she could never possibly explain it to the others. Not in words. It was, like the sunset (or so she supposed), something you had to <i>see</i> to really appreciate. Even if she were of a mind to do so, Toph could not possibly describe it in a way that could ever really capture how <i>breathtaking</i> it was, just sitting there and really thinking about the things she so often took for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a man gazing upon a painting with fresh eyes, Toph felt like she was really \"seeing\" the world for the first time in years. It was amazing what a change of perspective could do, and there were few things that could really turn your view of the world and your place in it upside down quite like learning that your parents had gone behind your back to secretly engage you to your best friend. <i>Especially</i> when you have had a crush on said friend for nearly as long you have known him, yet also possess a nearly instinctive aversion to such things as arranged marriages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sighed, belatedly taking a sip of her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good, as good as Iroh's brew usually was. Which is to say, it was<i> excellent</i>, and the steaming hot concoction did wonders for the painful, writhing knot in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Old Man,\" she said with an uncharacteristic quietude to her speech, her lips barely so much as twitching as she slowly and thoughtfully sipped at her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not mention it. It was the least I could do, for such a valued customer and friend,\" Iroh replied with a smile that stretched the wrinkled skin of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could tell, however, from a slight, scarcely perceptible shifting in the pitch of his tone and the very particular way in which he currently set the weight of his muscles upon his stout, weather-worn frame that there was much more beneath the surface than he consciously expressed. He was concerned, but he was also not saying as much, knowing how proud the young earthbender could be. He had no desire to coddle her, or talk down to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just wanted to be there for Toph, and help her however he could, even if it was just by sitting there quietly next to her as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something Toph really appreciated about the retired general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes, they sat there in silence, just sipping at their tea and relaxing in the sunlight. Both knew that they would have to talk, sooner or later, about what had happened back at the Jasmine Dragon, but for now they were content to simply sit and think and bask in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did wonders for Toph's anxiety. She knew that Iroh would want to talk, eventually, but he was willing to wait until she was ready. He knew that forcing the matter would not help anything, in the long run. Toph had to confront it on her own terms, and at her own pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was perfectly willing to wait until she was ready to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Iroh was just a good friend, like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka and Logic had something of a love-hate relationship. He was a man of science, to be sure, a believer in reason and fact and demonstrable results, but this did not mean that he and Logic always saw eye to eye. If anything, this only made things more noticeable on the frequent occasions when he <i>did</i> find himself at odds with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as much as he fancied himself a Renaissance man and an enlightened modern soul, Sokka was still very much prone to sudden bouts of irrationality. As intelligent as the young man could be, he could also be incredibly foolish when the mood struck him, and his friends and family could readily attest to his utter, apparent<i> idiocy</i> during such periods. He was emotional and impulsive at the best of times, and regardless of how smart he might have been, he still did some very stupid things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sokka WAS smart. At the end of the day, underneath all the jokes and japes and horseplay tomfoolery lay a keen intellect \u2013 unhoned and raw, perhaps, but still undeniably sharp. He was brilliant, in his own way. He had a mind for wheels and gears and strategies martial, a very secular and pragmatic brand of cunning and wit. In some ways, he had a mind that was ahead of his time \u2013 a mind best suited to invention, innovation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogic, in this way, could be both Sokka's greatest ally, and his most dire foe. This time was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>His father was right.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Sokka was loth to accept it, but he knew it was true. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but they <i>would</i> need all the help they could get if they ever wanted to restore the Southern Water Tribe to its former glory. The South Pole had been absolutely <i>devastated</i> by the war, and even with the assistance of their sister tribe in the north it might yet take <i>decades</i> for them to rebuild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the rate of reconstruction described in his father's letters, Sokka knew that it might be generations still before the South Pole could again be considered a world power. As it stood, he knew that just about the only thing keeping them relevant <i>at all</i> on the stage of global politics was his and Katara's status as the Avatar's closest friends. And even <i>that</i> was more Katara than himself. Sokka and Aang really weren't particularly close. Not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the fact that the last airbender was dating his sister, or maybe it was the fact that the warrior had been so insistent on dealing with Ozai in a more... <i>permanent</i> fashion than the Avatar ultimately chose. But whatever the case, these days there was just a little bit more distance between them than there used to be. Maybe not so much so that it was readily apparent to an outside observer, but the distance was still there all the same. Aang and Sokka just weren't as close as they used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Katara, to be perfectly honest. <i>She</i> was the Avatar's girlfriend, the last South Pole waterbender, the future of their tribe. She was, in a way, a symbol of everything the Southern Water Tribe had lost to Azulon's Raids, but also of everything they might one day reclaim. She was a pillar of their tribe's culture, the last southern waterbender. And she was also a bridge between the North and South, the one who had challenged the backwards traditions of the Northern Water Tribe and gotten them to begin to <i>change</i>. She was the hope of the tribe, a beacon that guided them to a better future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to all of that, Sokka really just could not help but feel so small and insignificant. He knew, in some corner of his mind, that this was foolish, that they were both equally important to the future of the tribe, both equally beloved of their father, but the young warrior could not help the feelings of inadequacy that started to pop up like weeds whenever he began comparing himself with his sister. It might have been stupid and illogical to think so, perhaps, but still he felt as though he had little to nothing to offer to his tribe, to the world. Certainly nothing that couldn't be offered by any other man or warrior, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had given so much, already, to end the war and bring about peace, but now Sokka felt like he had nothing left to give. And that thought pained him more than any broken leg. As son of the Chief, nay, a son of the TRIBE, Sokka was defined by his duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was that not how Yue had felt? Regardless of whether it made them happy or sad, they all had their own duties to the Tribe, to their people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what she had told him, wasn't it? Certainly, it was how she had lived her life. She had been willing to marry a man she did not love, just to ensure the continuation of Northern Chief's line. She had readily given up her life to revive the moon spirit, to save her people and the world from certain destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue had placed her duty above even her own happiness, and in doing so she saved them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs great as Sokka's love for the princess had been, equally deep was his admiration of her. In a way, she was everything he could ever hope to be. She had not been a warrior or a chief, but she had still been so strong, so brave. She had given everything of herself to protect everyone she loved, and everything they stood for \u2013 in that way, she represented to Sokka the ideal of what a warrior should be, of what a <i>chief</i> should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka admired Yue more than anyone else. Because of her, he believed in his heart of hearts that he must place his duty to his people above all else. And because of this, it pained him so greatly to feel as though there was nothing he was needed for, nothing he could do that could not be done better by someone else. For so long, his duty had been to protect his sister and the tribe, but neither one needed his protection anymore. The former could take care of herself, and the latter once more had real men and warriors to defend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy all accounts Sokka had fulfilled his duty, but once the satisfaction he got from this knowledge had faded, he was left with naught but a feeling of emptiness in the pit of his stomach. He no longer knew what his duty was, what he was supposed to do. For so long his only goal had been to help Aang defeat the Fire Lord and end the war, but now it was done with and over, and he simply had no idea where to go with his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka, in some dark forgotten corner of his mind, felt <i>lost</i> without his duty. To believe that you were without a purpose, that you had no reason to exist, was an indescribably <i>horrible</i> feeling \u2013 perhaps the worst in the world. The young man was far from the point where he might despair of life or long to end himself, but still. In the middle of night, when all was dark and all were silent, he could not help but feel a little melancholic, staring up at the ceiling and pondering morosely about just what he planned do with his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was adrift, lost in a world so different from everything he had ever known, Sokka did not show it. Not where his friends could see. But that did not mean that he felt no sense of malaise at the lack of direction in his life. Even if it was only a small concern at the back of his mind, it was still there, and it still upset him in those lonely, quiet hours when he had no one but himself for company. When he was alone, he silently bemoaned what felt like a complete loss of purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like there was nothing left that he could do for his people, like his life no longer had any real meaning. He did not show it, but it bothered him that he was so often left behind while the others went off to help decide the fate of the world. The depression and sense of useless which had been dispelled and forestalled by his lessons with Piandao had now returned, had been stalking him from the moment he cast away Space Sword and Boomerang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world didn't need warriors any more, but a warrior was all he had ever been. He was unneeded in this new world, or so whispered to him the voices of doubt and self-loathing when all else was silent. He did his best to focus on the positive, to distract himself from these ugly feelings, but they did not go away. He could not so easily banish them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka felt lost because it seemed there was nothing more for which he was needed, nothing more he could do, but according to his father this was not the case. There <i>was</i> yet something that he could do for their people, a duty to their tribe which only he could fulfill. It was NOT something that he would be <i>glad</i> to do, but still it WAS something that he <i>could</i> do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn offer had been made to his father, the offer of an alliance most useful. The wealth of the Bei Fong family, as well as its considerable political clout, could go a <i>very</i> long way toward restoring the Southern Water Tribe to its former power and glory. An alliance with the Bei Fongs, and by extension with all the other families with which the Bei Fongs were allied, would be just about the best possible thing to help their tribe regain its rightful place in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, the Southern Water Tribe had been a nation unto itself, but the Hundred Year War had diminished it to a pale shadow of its former self. If ever they hoped to restore their tribe to its former glory, they would need all the help they could get. This alliance, this union, could be just what they needed. They could have all the considerable resources of the Bei Fong family backing their reconstruction efforts, and the only price they asked in return was a marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween their daughter and Hakoda's son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Toph and Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really hated it when logic was used against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of this and more was going through Sokka's mind as he sighed and glanced aside at his girlfriend. The look on her face, the look of somber resignation, was all he needed to see. She, like himself, was a warrior. She understood the need to place duty above happiness, to sacrifice of yourself for the good of your people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were alike, him and her, in a way that none of their other friends could entirely match. On a basic level, Suki understood Sokka, and he understood her. They were cut from the same mold, two warriors, two leaders. Even the differences only served to emphasize how alike they really were, on a fundamental level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them knew their duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm sorry.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's lips formed these words, though no sound came out. He didn't need to say it, of course \u2013 he knew that Suki would have done the same thing in his situation \u2013 but it still helped him feel a little better, even just doing that much. It was a small gesture, insignificant really, but sometimes those were the most powerful of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki gave him a hollow smile, and she nodded in understanding. Sokka weakly reciprocated, before turning once more to face his father. With a heavy heart, he sighed, and then he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" said he. \"It's for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka deferentially lowered his head in something somewhere between a deep nod and a short bow. When he straightened back up, he then turned to face the Bei Fongs. His friends' eyes widened in shock, realization dawning on them as they watched with almost horrified expressions as he bowed low and forced out with a faintly cracking voice the words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be <i>honored</i> to take your daughter as my wife.\"</span></div></div>",

Words of advice or encouragement were often a great help, to be sure, but sometimes all you really needed was to have a friend beside you. Even without saying a word, just knowing that someone was there by your side could do you wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the opposite was also true. Simply talking about your problems could do so much to help you overcome them, and sometimes the only way to get through something <i>at all </i>was to talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you <i>really</i> didn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does everything have to be so <i>complicated?</i>\" she groaned, listlessly tapping the heel of her foot against the side of the wall upon which she was seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first thing she had said for several minutes, and it took Iroh a moment to think up a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, things are complicated only because we make them so,\" he sagely replied, before somewhat sheepishly adding a second later, \"Of course, there are also many other times where they were simply just that complicated to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Thanks</i>,\" muttered Toph sarcastically, feeling a bit shorter with the elderly tea server than usual. \"That's <i>real</i> helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh shrugged. Through the stone of the wall, Toph could feel the shift in how he distributed his weight as he moved deceptively thick arms and broad shoulders in a gesture of <i>'What can I say?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no single, absolute answer,\" he told her simply, matter-of-factly, \"What is right in one instance may not be so in another. What looks simple at first glance may in truth be a very <i>complicated</i> matter, and likewise what <i>looks</i> complicated might actually be quite simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled knowingly, and Toph could feel the muscles moving around his mouth, pulling his lips up at the corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are upset because your parents arranged a marriage between you and your friend, yes,\" he continued, \"but I also sense that there is something more to it than just that. Something <i>deeper</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph winced. That hit a bit closer to home than she was willing to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said,\" she replied evasively. \"It's <i>complicated</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it would seem,\" said Iroh with a short nod. \"Such things usually are, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You<i> 'suppose'?</i>\" Toph repeated, a hint of disbelief in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh's smile widened, and Toph could practically <i>feel</i> the dimples forming in his weather-worn cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The marriage between myself and my late wife was also an arranged one,\" he responded plainly. \"Her father was a very important figure in the Fire Nation nobility \u2013 a distant cousin of my own father, as a matter of fact. Count Fuusen was a man of high standing and great power even among the nobility, and he held the loyalty of many of the lesser noble families,\" he explained. \"The marriage between myself and his his daughter was arranged by my father, Fire Lord Azulon, as a means of consolidating his support base, back when the two of us were but children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph blanched. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, sounding uncharacteristically sincere in her apology. \"That must have been <i>awful</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Iroh simply waved off her concern, laughing good-naturedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\" he said. \"Not at all! Do not feel sorry for me. I knew well my duties as the crown prince, and I accepted it gracefully.\" He sounded somewhat nostalgic as he continued. \"Besides that, my wife was a good woman, and I was happy with her. We may have been pushed together by the designs of our parents, but still we made the best of our situation. We made our own happiness with one another, and I came to love her dearly. She felt the same way about me, too, with time, and she gave birth to my dear son as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off after this, sounding wistful, and Toph could not help smiling just a little. She recalled the happy tales Iroh had told her of his beloved son, Lu Ten, who had tragically lost his life before the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se at the end of the Six Hundred Day Siege. She knew the old man had cared deeply for his only child, and she felt almost like she knew late Fire Prince a little bit herself, just from all the stories Iroh had shared with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really loved her, didn't you?\" she murmured softly. Her cheeks felt a little warm and tingly, and there was a strange sensation of weightlessness in her stomach. She was trying hard not to think about how this could potentially relate to her and Sokka, because she <i>did not want to go there.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Iroh, placing a large, warm hand on her shoulder. His palms were rough and calloused from many long decades of fighting and firebending and working with his hands. The gesture was comforting and reassuring, a sign that the old man was there for her. \"Yes, I truly did. She was a wonderful woman, and it grieved me deeply when I learned of her untimely death, all those years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was quiet for a moment. Her head tilted forward slightly, allowing a few loose obsidian bangs to fall forward over her eyes. Her cheeks felt nearly as hot as Iroh's tea, and she was sure the blush on her face must have been obvious to anyone with a working pair of eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...\" she said slowly, quietly, forcing the words off her tongue with no small effort of will. \"Do you think... Do you think that me and Sokka...\" she stammered, having considerable difficulty getting these words out of her mouth, \"that we could be like... like... like <i>youandyourwife?</i>\" these final words fell from her lips in a nervous jumble, spoken so quickly that it sounded more like one big word than four short ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh still managed to get the gist of it, though, if the way he comfortingly squeezed her shoulder was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not something that would happen all at once,\" he said in a half-cautionary sort of tone, \"but who can say? Perhaps you could, and perhaps you could not. Love works in mysterious ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a second, and Toph could<i> hear</i> the grin in his voice, let alone feel it with her tremor sense, when he resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But then you <i>are</i> fortunate, in a way, to be arranged a marriage with a man for whom you already harbor such profound affection...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph punched the old campaigner in the arm, her face burning hotter than a grease fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, youth!\" said Iroh, chuckling indulgently as he rubbed his victimized arm. It was more for show than anything else, of course. Not only was he tough enough to tank earthbending attacks with his own body, but the punch had been halfhearted, besides. \"To be young and in love, once more!\" he said, giving a theatrically wistful sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph snorted, doing her best to cover up the sound of her giddily skipping heart pounding in her ears. She was still blushing, the heat reaching now all the way down to her chest and shoulders. Her dress felt painfully restricting as she thought of Sokka <i>as her husband</i>, but it was not entirely unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Even if I <i>wanted</i> to marry Sokka \u2013 <i>and I'm not saying I do!</i> \u2013 he loves <b>Suki</b>. If I allowed my parents to take that away from him, I'd be just as bad as they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you may be presuming too much, to call them '<i>bad</i>',\" Iroh remarked. \"They are your parents, after all. Misguided or not, I am certain that they have only your best interests in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Toph scoffed. \"But what about Sokka? He and Suki are together, and I... well, I <i>like</i> Suki. I don't want...\" she trailed off, stumbling over her words a little as she spoke. \"Er, that is, even <i>if</i> I wanted Sokka as a... um...\" She felt her blush deepen, unable to say it out loud. \"...well, even <i>then</i>, I wouldn't want to take him away from Suki. She's cool, even if she has a lame sense of humor. I couldn't do that to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh smiled, squeezing her shoulder reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a good heart,\" he told her. \"I understand why you are uncertain. And I can respect that. Young Suki is fortunate to have a friend like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not such a good friend,\" she muttered. \"As far as Suki goes... Well, that's only a part of the issue, really. And a small one, at that.\" She sighed. \"More than anything, it's because I just don't want to give my parents the <i>satisfaction</i>,\" she confessed. \"If I ever marry Sokka, or <i>anyone</i> \u2013 and that's a BIG if! \u2013 I don't want it to be because my parents <i>arranged it</i>. Do you get what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think I do,\" replied Iroh. \"You are strong-willed, independent. You desire to make your own path in life, to shape your own destiny. Your pride demands you object to this union.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Toph somewhat bitterly, her expression darkening just a little. \"That sounds about right. If I went along with this marriage, I'd be letting my parents win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is this really a matter of winning or losing?\" wondered Iroh rhetorically. \"Pride can be a dangerous thing, if you let it rule you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph scowled faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to say, old man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh smiled enigmatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" he said. \"I am not trying to say anything. In the end, this is <i>your</i> decision to make. I cannot tell you what to do. It is not my place to do so.\" He patted her shoulder companionably. \"In the end, we must all shape our own destiny. We must each make our own choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sighed, looking uncharacteristically vulnerable as she pulled her knees up to her chin, wrapping her arms around her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I don't <i>want</i> to shape it?\" she murmured, her voice unusually soft and quiet. \"I don't want to choose. It's too hard. Why can't things just stay the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change is inevitable, young one,\" said Iroh gently. \"The year grows old, and the seasons continue to turn. Nothing can stay the same, forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph looked morose as she all but buried the lower half of her face in the fine, smooth silk of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to change,\" she whispered. \"I don't want Sokka to change, or Aang, or Katara, or any of them. I want them to stay the same. To stay with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all friendships are destined to last,\" Iroh told her, \"but that does not mean your friends will leave. They may change, as the years pass, but so will you. Perhaps you will grow closer as time passes, or perhaps your paths in life will lead you apart from them. But remember this, Toph: whatever might happen in the future, we<i> live</i> in the <i>present.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make the best of every day, and live your life to the fullest. Every choice has its risks, and there is no doubt that you might regret some of the choices you make, later on down the line. To do anything is to take a chance, after all, and you might regret some of the chances you take. However, I <i>can</i> guarantee that you <i>will</i> regret the chances you <i>never</i> take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was silent for a long moment, minutes passing by as she thought about Iroh's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you know what? I think I get what you're saying,\" she said at length. \"And you're probably right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, softly at first, but it gained strength as she continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm the Blind Bandit</i>,\" she breathed, her posture straightening as she uncurled and began to once more sit upright. There was confidence in her voice once more as she talked. \"I control my <i>own</i> fate. No matter what path I take, it will be because <b>I</b> <i>chose</i> to take it. I'm not some weepy lily liver who can't even think for herself. I'm TOPH BEI FONG, and I won't let ANYONE tell me what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed triumphantly, the sound ringing loud and clear in the air. Then she hopped down from the short wall, her feet landing in the soft, grassy soil of the park's gently sloping hillside. She was grinning from ear to ear, looking as though she had just gotten a great weight off of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was somewhat comical, seeing the rowdy young chit act like her usual, cocksure self while wearing such an elegant, no doubt <i>expensive</i> dress. Iroh half expected the girl to immediately drop onto her back and start rolling in the dirt, half to spite her parents and half just because she simply <i>loved</i> getting dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't, though. Instead, she kicked the soil, causing the ground to shake in a slight, only <i>just</i> noticeable tremor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again, and Iroh smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you have made your decision?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Toph beamed, spinning around to face in the direction of Iroh's voice and vibrations. \"I've made up my mind! Ha ha ha!\" she laughed again, sounding downright <i>giddy</i>, in that rough and tumble manner of hers. \"For once, I'm gonna just do what I want, and to the <i>Pit</i> with the consequences!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh's smile widened, and he wisely refrained from commenting that this sounded an <i>awful lot</i> like how she usually lived. Wisely, because he <i>knew</i> Toph \u2013 he was one of the very few people she had ever truly opened up to \u2013 and so he knew <i>exactly</i> what she was implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly, he remembered an old saying he had come across in a rural part of the Earth Kingdom, one which had allegedly been co-opted from the Air Nomads long before the War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You only leaf once.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh didn't really get what that was supposed to mean, even with all his lore and wisdom, and neither had any of the people he'd asked, but he had a feeling it was applicable to Toph's situation. Somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head in something like amusement, the old general gingerly heaved himself off of the wall. His backside was aching in discomfort from sitting for so long on the hard stone surface of the structure, yet he could not help but chuckle at the way Toph was carrying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you luck,\" he told the girl, speaking from the bottom of his heart. She was a good child, and he sincerely hoped that she found what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph simply laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't <i>need</i> luck~!\" she declared with complete confidence. \"I'm <i>Toph Bei Fong!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was probably right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

There are many people who would gladly, <i>eagerly</i> give it a big, whopping knuckle sandwich, or maybe a good old fashioned kick in the balls. Because, in practice, Destiny has probably screwed over <i>far</i> more people than it has ever <i>helped</i>.

His ocean blues gleamed with an uncanny intensity as they pierced her through. \"Never forget that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flushed, and she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't,\" she promised him, though she found herself unable to meet his gaze. \"You have my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned wryly, gently cradling her chin in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me.

But the smile stretched unnaturally, and it did not reach her eyes \u2013 it was clearly forced, and Sokka's heart broke a little at the pain he saw in that expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Sokka,\" she said, tears glistening in the corners of her eyes. \"But as the future chief of your tribe, you will need a wife. Not a lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's smile, already weak, faded, and his eyes dimmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...is it true?\" he asked her. \"I've heard people talk, but... I didn't put any stock in it. I didn't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said again, smiling sadly at up at him even as she drew his body close into hers. \"I should have known it wouldn't work. I should have told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka shook his head, clamping his eyes shut. He looked as though he were fighting back tears, and he sniffed weakly before speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that,\" he told her. \"You don't know that. I... we could have made it work. I'm sure of it. We would have figured <i>something</i> out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki silenced him with a kiss. It was short and chaste, but the electric warmth of it stirred up such a hungry longing within the young man that it was all he could do to hold himself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't,\" she told him, and that single word held so much meaning in that moment. \"You have your tribe to think of. What would people have said, do you think? A chief who didn't marry, who took a lover but not a wife? No. I couldn't do that to you. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest heaved, rising up as she took a deep breath, then falling back down as she let it back out in a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think I always knew it would have to end like this,\" she whispered, and the tears ran freely down her cheeks, hot and salty. \"On some level, I think I knew that it could never work. Our cultures our too different.\" She tried to smile, but it came out as more of a grimace. \"As a man of the Water Tribe, you need a wife \u2013 but as a disciple of Kyoshi, that is the one thing I can never be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it was Sokka who silenced Suki with a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk like that,\" he told her, pulling back after a painfully short and wonderful and <i>whymustitend</i> moment of contact between their lips. \"I... would have liked to marry you, but... as long as I had your love, I think, it honestly wouldn't have mattered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's too late,\" she said softly, sadly. \"Your wife's been chosen for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could have said no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki wrapped her arms more tightly round his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't have,\" she said. \"You know your responsibility to your tribe. You're a good man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure don't <i>feel</i> like it,\" he muttered. \"A good man could have thought of a way to stay with the woman he loved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a truly great man knows when he must sacrifice of himself for the good of his people,\" she said solemnly, gravely. \"I don't blame you for your choice, Sokka. You know I would have done the same thing, if I were in your shoes. We're warriors.\" She smiled weakly. \"Sacrifice is our <i>life</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you <i>would</i> blame me,\" Sokka whispered weakly, his breath hitching slightly as he stared into her eyes, fiercely blinking away the burning tears of shame. \"I wish you wouldn't be so willing to accept this. I wish I didn't have to do this. I wish it didn't make <i>so much sense</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If wishes were fish, there'd be no room in the ocean,\" said Suki with a wan sort of smile, holding Sokka firmly in her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled weakly in spite of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"You're probably right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am,\" she breathed, a halfhearted smile curving her soft, warm, sweet, inviting lips. \"The woman is <i>always</i> right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just this once, I wish you weren't,\" he said, looking away from her, unable to meet her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki's smile drooped almost as quickly as it had risen, and she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I,\" she whispered, pressing her cheek against his hard, bare chest and closing her eyes. \"So do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

The young waterbender was clearly unwilling to come to terms with certain recent events, her eyes hard and hot as they flitted this way and that. Her lips were drawn into a thin, tight line as she wore a hole in the rug with her feet, stalking to and fro with an almost manic glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato and Hakoda (she was NOT in the mood to call the man father right now) had gone off with the Bei Fongs to do something or other, she wasn't sure what, exactly. Maybe they were going to look for Toph, or maybe they were going to discuss the specifics of the wedding or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara didn't know, and honestly she could not be bothered to <i>care</i>. Not now. She was too busy thinking and muttering, pacing and pondering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has gotten into Sokka?\" the young Water Tribe lass wondered lowly, her eyes narrowed nearly to slits as she kneaded her temples, perhaps in an effort to jumpstart her brain. \"I can't <i>believe</i> he would agree to this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang, seated on a thin woven mat a few feet away from his girlfriend, frowned just the tiniest bit. His legs were crossed and his fists were held barely inches apart, knuckles to knuckles, tattoos outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young monk's eyes were closed. He was meditating, attempting to center himself and still the whirling, turbulent thoughts and emotions going through his head and heart and gut. It was still clear, however, that he heard his girlfriend as she spoke to herself, even as he sat and meditated. He controlled his breathing, recalling the basics of his bending training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath was the source of power not only for fire, but for all bending arts. Everything started with breath \u2013 without it, there was nor energy nor life. Breath was spirit. Breath was chi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In with the good air, out with the bad air. Draw in the pure energies of the cosmos. Expel the impure energies of the body. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathe in. Breathe out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathe in. Breathe out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think he's just trying to do what's best for your tribe,\" said the young monk slowly, after a moment of thought. His voice was steady and even, almost monotone as he gradually centered himself. \"He... probably sees it as his duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it,\" she said. \"I still don't like it. Why does it have to be like that? Why does it have to be my <i>brother?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Toph will hurt him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara blinked, surprised by her boyfriend's question. She frowned, then shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she said, softly at first, before more loudly, more firmly repeating herself. \"No. Toph's a friend. Of course she wouldn't do anything to hurt Sokka.\" She paused. \"But... I can't imagine she'll be very willing to go through with this. Not if her parents were telling the truth about how she reacted to finding out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang was silent for a moment. He was still, serene, sitting there in a traditional Air Nomad meditation pose. He seemed to radiate peace and tranquility, and just seeing him like this helped Katara calm herself down a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it would be better if Toph refused?\" he asked, after what felt like several long minutes of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to say yes,\" she said. \"I really do.\" She shook her head. \"But as much as I hate to admit it, our tribe <i>does</i> need all the help it can get. There's still so much rebuilding we need to do, and... and this alliance with the Bei Fongs really <i>does</i> seem like the best option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you still don't like it.\" This wasn't a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't.\" Her shoulders drooped, and her eyes fell. \"It just goes against everything I believe in. People shouldn't be forced together like that. Not when they don't even love each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang cracked a single eye open, and he smiled at Katara. It was a small smile, more <i>serene</i> than happy, but it nonetheless caused a similar one to take shape on his girlfriend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you aren't upset with Suki, anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara's cheeks flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... no, I guess I'm not,\" she conceded, sounding a little reluctant to say as much. While they had mostly resolved the tensions between them the other day, Katara had still been a little prickly towards the Kyoshi Warrior, and silently disapproving of how intimate she was with Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really does care for him...\" the waterbender mumbled, a little red-faced at saying this. \"Whatever else, I can't help but feel sad for her. And Sokka. They really like each other, and they've been forced apart so many times before.\" She sighed. \"It just seems <i>unfair</i>, I guess. Like the Universe isn't even giving their love a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang gave Katara a funny look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That almost sounds like something Sokka would say,\" he commented, and Katara's blush deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my point still stands,\" she insisted. \"It does seem like every time my brother falls in love with a girl, she gets taken away from him. And he and Suki have been through a <i>lot</i> together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have he and Toph,\" Aang pointed out, playing the role of Ozai's advocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara shook her head furiously, her blush further deepening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <i>different</i>, though! They're just friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So were we, at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara spluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose side are you even <i>on?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize there <i>were</i> any sides,\" he said in an infuriatingly sage tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've been spending too much time with Iroh,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Aang, but there was a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara rolled her eyes at him, but she didn't say anything more. Not for several minutes, at least. She simply sat down beside her boyfriend, allowing herself to lean against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

There was a deceptive strength in his youthful frame, and Katara had a feeling that he would be <i>very</i> well built once started to fill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, she could not help absentmindedly noticing that he seemed to be an inch or two taller than he had been when they'd first met. And going along this train of thought, Katara found herself smiling a little too much at the mental image she concocted of what she and Aang might look like as adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she let herself relax like this for several minutes, soaking in the sense of tranquility which her boyfriend seemed to radiate like a tangible aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, she could not stop her thoughts from turning back to the matter of her brother and Suki, and her smile wilted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katara...?\" Aang asked her, noticing the tension that seemed to be building back up in his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember the village with that one fortuneteller, Aang?\" she said rather suddenly, catching him off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" he said, blushing a little at the memory. It popped to the forefront of his mind as soon as she mentioned it, and he recalled with crystal clarity how he had... ahem... <i>overheard</i> the old mystic telling Katara that she would marry a quote-unquote<i> 'powerful bender'</i>. \"Her name was Madame Wu, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Wu,\" Katara corrected automatically, still looking rather gloomy and morose, \"but yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aang... I'm afraid she might have been the real thing,\" Katara murmured. \"She... well, my fortune seems like it will probably come true...\" She blushed beet-red, and Aang joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really a bad thing...?\" Aang asked her awkwardly, confusedly, his meditation by now long since broken. \"I thought your fortune had been a good one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara's cheeks probably would have gone even redder if it were humanly possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, mine was good...\" she said absently, her voice a bit unusually high-pitched \"But it's not me I'm worried for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a jolt, Aang recalled what had at the time seemed like a funny, completely harmless thing, something to which he had paid no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka...\" he breathed, remembering now the words that Madame\u2014no, <i>Aunt </i>Wu had said to the Water Tribe teen when he had expressed his skepticism regarding the authenticity of the village celebrity's fortunetelling abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Your future is full of struggle and anguish.\"</i> That was what the old woman had said to Sokka. <i>\"Most of it, self-inflicted.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time, they had been amused by it, seeing it as the gray-haired mystic just messing around with a skeptic's head. But now, in hindsight, those words seemed to have a new, menacing weight to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang realized now why Katara looked so <i>worried.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Aang said slowly. \"I'm sure it's nothing. That kind of thing only has power if you believe in it. I'm sure that someone like Sokka would never let his life be ruled by what some fortuneteller said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed a hand on Katara's shoulder and squeezed comfortingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" he continued, \"I'm sure she was just messing with him because she overheard him saying he didn't believe in fortunetelling. I'm sure it didn't mean anything. Sokka's life will be good and happy and peaceful, whatever might happen. I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara looked him in the eyes, smiling gratefully, and she drew him into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Aang...\" she said at length, squeezing him tightly. \"I'm sure you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang smiled weakly, though Katara didn't see it, with her eyes closed and her chin on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt too much like he had lied to be entirely comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not half as certain as he sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mai <i>hated</i> travelling by hot air balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, to be fair, there were few things that the melancholy fl\u00e9chette fanatic <i>didn't</i> hate, but she reserved a <i>special</i> brand of loathing for aerial travel. It was, out of all the boring things in this boring world, the singularly most mindnumbingly <i>boring</i> of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing to do, so high above the ground, and furthermore the way that the balloons could be so easily swayed this way or that by the slightest breeze seriously annoyed her. It was far too whimsical for her tastes. The idea of drifting along on air currents, floating over the world in a cramped metal box that, in the event of a crash, could at most serve as a particularly spacious, burning coffin, was simply not to her fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Mai fancied much of anything, but that was beside the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not like travelling by balloon. There was nothing to do, nothing to see, nothing at all except boredom, boredom, <i>boredom</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she couldn't even relieve her boredom in the usual way, as the bedrooms in the repurposed airship had almost nothing in the way of soundproofing. And no matter how bored she might get, Mai wasn't the sort to experiment with exhibitionism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot yet, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGive her a couple of years, and maybe once she and Zuko had been married for a while and things had started to cool off between them, <i>then</i> she might consider spicing up their nightlife. And day-life. And, honestly, really just any-time-she-and-Zuko-got-randy-life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, she was bored, and he was willing. What more reason did they need? They were young and in love/lust/mutual-nonhatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd certainly, Mai had come to <i>expect</i> a certain amount of regular quality time with her boyfriend every once in a while. (\"Once in a while,\" in this instance, being defined as \"whenever Mai was in the mood and they could find someplace private\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Mai's <i>needs</i>, privacy was <b>not</b> something one could easily come by on such a small zeppelin. Or at all, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was not good for the continued well-being of the people around her, because when Mai was forced to go without her daily dose of Vitamin Zuko, she got <i>cranky</i>. And a cranky Mai was a very <i>dangerous</i> thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe private airship's crew of engineers could attest to this, and they had plenty of material evidence in the form of exceptionally holey clothes, and any number of cuts on their arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Ba Sing Se had never before seemed so far away)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, by the time the balloon <i>finally</i> reached its destination, Mai was about as sexually frustrated as it was humanly possible to get without snapping and either going on a murderous rampage or grabbing one's respective love interest, tearing their clothes off, and making hot, angry love to them regardless of where they happened to be at that particular moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, it<i> still </i>took her some considerable effort of will to hold off from dragging Zuko to the nearest hotel the instant they disembarked from the zeppelin, which was set down in a very empty and remote part of the Lower Ring, practically right up against the outermost of the inner walls. It had taken no small amount of diplomacy and compromise on Zuko's part to get the the Earth King's generals to allow him to land a Fire Nation hot air balloon <i>anywhere</i> within the walls of Ba Sing Se, and this was the furthest inside the walls that the city's leadership would allow them to land their zeppelin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Kuei might have been relatively willing to give Zuko the benefit of the doubt, but the Council of Five were much more stubborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the new Fire Lord could really blame them. Not after everything that had happened between their countries during the Hundred Year War and the Occupation of Ba Sing Se. It was only natural they would be a little mistrustful, particularly when he was still so new to the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko simply hadn't yet had the time to firmly set himself apart from his predecessors. He had made a good start, to be sure, but there was still a LOT of work to be done yet. The world at large was still somewhat wary that he might fall down the same path as his forefathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Zuko couldn't blame them for worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Mai was certainly willing to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe they're making us walk <i>all the way</i> to the Upper Ring,\" the pale, sharp-eyed young woman groused in a dull, low tone. It was early morning, yet, and the Fire Lord's girlfriend still looked half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Though only Zuko and a couple others could really tell the difference between \"sleepy Mai\" and \"regular Mai\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko, sitting beside his girlfriend in the royal palanquin \u2013 which had been a right <i>pain</i> to stow on the small, ten man airship \u2013 chuckled in spite of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not the ones doing the actual walking, though, are we?\" he remarked, looking around at the curtains which were drawn closed over the sides of the ostentatious, manually borne transport. He had not particularly wanted to bring the gaudy, cumbersome thing all the way to Ba Sing Se, being quite happy to walk on his own two feet, but Mai had <i>insisted</i> on taking it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't exactly just the prince, anymore, she had reminded him. As Fire Lord, he could not just go about like a commoner. He had to travel and bear himself in a manner befitting the sovereign of their great nation. It would not do, <i>apparently</i>, for him to walk around on his own two legs when there were loyal, adoring servants ready and willing to carry his lazy ass wherever it deigned to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko wasn't sure he entirely followed her logic, but he had conceded the point regardless. The fact that she had brought this up while wearing aught but a thin, loosely-tied silk nightgown that did an <i>astonishingly</i> good job of flattering the young noblewoman's lithe, graceful form more than likely had something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, Zuko thought as he glanced sidelong at the fair yet sharp visage of his girlfriend, this was probably the closest he and Mai had gotten to some honest-to-ancestors <i>alone time</i> since setting out from the capital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai rolled her eyes, though this didn't stop her from pressing her soft, slender frame a little more into Zuko's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still going to take us <i>forever</i> to get there,\" she tonelessly griped. \"Why couldn't they let us land in the Upper Ring? I'm sure the Avatar wouldn't have minded if we set the balloon down in his back yard, or on his roof. It was certainly spacious enough, last I saw of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably notable that, despite Zuko's friendship with Aang, Mai wasn't exactly on a first name basis with the last airbender. She didn't put much store by <i>friendliness</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko shrugged. \"It's a political thing,\" was his only response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai looked almost considering for half a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... They're making a statement, then,\" she shrewdly concluded. \"<i>'You might be the Fire Lord, but that means nothing, here.'</i> Or something like that. Does that sound about right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think that's probably as much the reason as anything,\" he said. \"After the way Azula...\" he grimaced, his face drawn and his skin looking a shade paler at the thought of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused his scar to stand out even more than usual, and Mai was probably one of the only people who would have been able to resist having their gaze drawn to it. As it was, however, she simply shifted her weight a little so that her boyfriend was more leaning into her than she was into him. She also casually placed a hand on her boyfriend's lap, and if she gave him a short, blink-and-you'll-miss-it comforting smile, well, there was nobody there to see it but him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko sighed, but his expression lightened a little bit, the corners of his lips twitching ever so slightly upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, after everything that happened during the War, it's only natural they'd be a little uneasy letting a Fire Nation balloon set down right in the heart of the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai nodded slowly in apparent understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" she conceded. \"I still think it's a pain, though. There's nothing to do but sit here and wait while the palanquin-bearers carry us to the Upper Ring. And that'll probably take most of the day, with how big this city is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko discreetly wrapped an arm around the slender brunette's hips, allowing a small smirk to curve his lips as he leaned in to whisper into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know if I would say <i>'nothing'</i>,\" he breathed, the words (or was it his mouth?) hot against Mai's earlobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Mai purred, a pleasant shiver running up her spine as her boyfriend light, playfully nibbled her ear. \"Tell me <i>more</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko did so gladly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai might not have been an exhibitionist, really, but making out in the royal palanquin, she had to admit, was probably one of her new favorite things about dating the Fire Lord.</span></div></div>",

Long, jagged gashes carved up the surface of the street, looking like they had been gouged out by the claws of some great, massive beast, and the roadside was littered with shattered boulders and rude, blunt spires of rock like the worn, battered teeth of a living mountain stuck out here and there everywhere at odd angles. Many of the houses and storefronts nearby looked to have also been the victims of some collateral damage, chunks of stone stabbing into walls here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, it had all the appearance of a war zone, and judging by the presence of the earthbenders dressed in the garb of blue-collar civil servants who looked to be in the process of repairing the damage that had been done, it had probably been even worse before they got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm not sure I <i>want</i> to know...\" muttered Zuko morosely, a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach as he found himself recognizing certain familiar aspects in the pattern of destruction that carved its way up the street and out of sight. He had seen enough earthbending over the years to notice the differences in the ways different styles produced different results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the boulders and spires and pits and troughs, Zuko felt like he might as well have been looking at the portrait of a certain blind earthbender. Fortunately for the sake of his mental health and stress levels, before he could ruminate more on the implications of this, or further ponder what might have caused it, the young Fire Lord heard a very familiar voice calling his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Zuko!\" came Iroh's voice, and the scarred firebender turned to see his aged uncle walking towards him and Mai \u2013 not from the Jasmine Dragon, but coming down the street from where the trail of destruction led. \"I was not expecting you so soon. And lovely Mai, as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was smiling broadly at the two of them as he approached, easily and effortlessly sidestepping the various hazards and obstacles which littered the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle!\" said Zuko, and there was a rare sort of smile on his face as he went up to greet the man who had practically been like a second father to him (and certainly a better one than Ozai had been).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon of the West was soon and shortly pulled into a tight and rather undignified hug by his nephew, but the retired general did not mind. He was just as happy to see Zuko as Zuko was to see him, and Iroh did not begrudge the lad this show of affection, no matter how inappropriate his brother or father might have considered such behavior to be for the Fire Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropriety, as far as Iroh was concerned, was for people who were <i>not</i> family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good to see you, too, Nephew!\" said the stout old man with a cheerful belly laugh. \"I have missed having you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he agreed, hugging his uncle even tighter. \"Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for their tearful reunion, Mai chose that moment to interject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to interrupt your hug fest, or anything,\" said the young woman, her voice getting Iroh and Zuko's attention, \"but what <i>happened</i> here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lazily gestured with one hand to indicate the scenic tableau of property damage and roadway vandalism which surrounded them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko blinked, unconsciously letting go of his uncle. He looked as though he had almost for a moment <i>forgotten</i> about the sight of destruction that had welcomed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh, for his part, looked almost sheepish for half a second, before he too let go of his nephew and took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" he said, looking maybe just a little bit shifty-eyed for a moment. \"Yes. <i>That.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forced a cough into a closed fist, clearing his throat as he started walking in the direction of his tea shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Come with me, then,\" he said, gesturing for the young Fire Lord and noblewoman to both follow him. \"Let us go inside my shop, where the two of can sit down and get comfortable. I will prepare a pot of tea, and then I will then tell you the story, or at least as much of it as I can. It is not the longest tale, perhaps, but is still one better heard in comfort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll want to sit down for this, won't we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a question, so Iroh did not answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Mai couldn't help feeling a little apprehensive. Somehow, she had a feeling that things were about to get <i>very complicated</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just hoped it would be for someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In this world, there are times and places where the paths of multiple people will cross and intersect. The fates of many can, in these instances, become tightly wound specifically into the fates of a very few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese times, these occasions, when the doom of multitudes can rest on something so small as a butterfly's wings, or a spoiled egg, are as cornerstones in the vast, intricate masonry of fate. From these moments, these instances, are built up the histories and futures of entire <i>nations</i>. If they go in a bad way, entire civilizations, whole <i>ages</i> of human history, can be toppled into chaos or oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese times, these places, these <i>crossroads of destiny</i>, are as lynchpins in a vast, cosmic clockwork. The doom of nations can turn upon the axle of the briefest moments, the smallest, most seemingly insignificant decisions. Something as simple as a single person stopping at a specific diner for a sandwich can lead to a cascade of events resulting in two of the largest, bloodiest wars in recorded history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, so often these important events will so seem so innocuous, at first. Such as was the case with a certain teenager and his girlfriend stopping off to visit his uncle on the way to a party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the teenager and girlfriend, in this case, were the Fire Lord, Zuko, and the noblewoman, Mai \u2013 the latter of whom had betrayed the Princess Azula to protect her love, catalyzing the firebending prodigy's descent into madness and ultimate deposal from the throne. Additionally, the teenager's uncle was the Dragon of the West, Grandmaster of the Order of the White Lotus, the famed, retired General Iroh, and the party in question was the Harvest Festival, in the court of the Earth King himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the original point still stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the reason that Zuko stopping to see his uncle was so important is a rather complicated tale in and of itself, but essentially it can be summed up as such: If Zuko had foregone or postponed the visit in favor of doing anything else, he and Mai would not have heard the account of certain recent events at the specific time that would result, when they went off to see their friends (well, when <i>Zuko</i> went off to see <i>his</i> friends) about said events, in them arriving at the house of the Avatar at the same time as a certain blind earthbender was also arriving, and furthermore just as a certain commander of the Kyoshi Warriors was leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mai and Zuko had not been there at that time, Suki would have left for her home \u2013 the distant, remote village of Kyoshi Island \u2013 then and there, disheartened and dismayed, but ultimately accepting of her fate. Toph would not have stopped her. Maybe under other circumstances, but not these, not then. Not like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki would have left, and Toph would have gone inside and announced her intentions to go through with the marriage to everyone present. Things would have gone fairly predictably from there, and Toph and Sokka would have ultimately gotten married. Not the most mutually-loving couple, perhaps, but they could have found some measure of happiness with their fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki would have also moved on, herself, ultimately, though she would always regret the loss of her first real love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as it was, Mai and Zuko WERE there. And when the Fire Lord saw the Kyoshi Warrior leaving the Gaang's house, when he saw the melancholy \u2013 almost <i>resigned</i> \u2013 expression on her face, he did what only came natural to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you heard about the arranged marriage, then?\" Zuko blurted out as Suki was walking past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kyoshi Warrior blinked, and she stopped in her tracks. Slowly, pivoting stiffly on her heels, she turned to face Zuko. She stared at him for several seconds with a seemingly blank, unreadable expression, lips tightly drawn and cheeks faintly pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she slapped him. <i>Hard.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko, reeling back from the blow, just narrowly missed bowling over a determined-looking Toph as he staggered away from Suki. The young earthbender, noticing this, and recognizing the footsteps of the people beside her, snapped out of her single-minded, girl-on-a-mission sort of trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zuko?!\" she said, surprised to quote-unquote 'see' the Fire Lord here, at this moment in time. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making an ass of himself, apparently,\" drawled Mai, eyeing Suki with just the faintest hint of hooded malice in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"Touch my boyfriend again, I<i> DARE</i> you,\" her look seemed to say, her sleeves appearing almost to subtly bristle with the threat of hidden steel)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki blinked. She was silent, looking faintly shocked as she glanced down at her own hand, as though unable to comprehend what it had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>Kyoshi</i>,\" she breathed, and she looked as though that was the first breath she had either taken or released for several long minutes, going by the way she seemed to deflate, shoulders slumping. \"I...\" she murmured, looking put out as gazed at the mark she had left on the Fire Lord's face. \"I'm so <i>sorry</i>, Zuko! I didn't mean to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't worry about it,\" said Zuko, sounding slightly out of it as he rubbed the bright, splotchy red palm-shaped mark on the scar-free side of his face, \"It's okay. I probably deserved that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side, Toph looked a little uncertain as she listened to the events unfolding. She seemed almost rooted to the spot, yet at the same time her frame occasionally jerked away from the group and toward the house, as though she were making to once more begin walking in that direction, only to be cut off by some internal obstacle or stumbling block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was frowning, something almost like a scowl on her face. She seemed to be at war with herself, or nearly so, looking veritably conflicted. Whatever schism she was experiencing within, the others were not privy to it, and if Zuko or Suki noticed, they did not say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" the Kyoshi Warrior said softly, glancing sidelong at Mai \u2013 almost appearing to be asking permission for something, or else forgiveness. \"I shouldn't have hit you,\" she admitted, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second it looked like she was about to raise a hand to Zuko's cheek \u2013 perhaps in an attempt to alleviate the pain he was no doubt feeling at that moment \u2013 but then she jerked the appendage back with a weak grimace, and she averted her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said. It didn't sound like she was speaking to Zuko at this point. Her eyes were staring off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked, at that moment, to be so profoundly <i>sad</i> and <i>vulnerable</i>, nothing like the strong, capable young woman whom Zuko had seen unhesitatingly rush the guards at the Boiling Rock whilst armed with nothing but her own two hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at his girlfriend, Mai, a lost, almost pleading expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she take pity on him and help?</span></div></div>",

I <i>know</i> it needs to be done.\" She shook her head. \"There's no point wallowing in regret, right? He has his duty, and I have mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's expression seemed to grow pained at this, though the others were not paying her any mind at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko frowned, though, and he again glanced over at Mai, but she glowered at him and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's your friend, not mine</i>, her expression seemed to say. <i>Deal with it yourself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zuko turned back to Suki, and he forced a smile onto his face. It was painfully, <i>obviously</i> fake, but she could tell that the sentiment, at least, was sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's still hard for you to accept, right?\" he ventured a guess, looking completely out of his depth as he tried to comfort the Kyoshi Warrior. \"If you really loved him, then of course you'd have trouble letting him go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the words left his mouth, he knew that he had said the wrong thing, and he winced immediately, as though half-expecting another slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Suki's shoulders slumped, and she let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you REALLY loved him.</i> Honestly, that was probably about the worst thing he could have said, while still trying to cheer her up. Those words rang painfully in the Kyoshi native's ears, aggrieving her like an arrow through the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right...\" she said, sighing sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko once more desperately shot a look at Mai, but the dark-haired young woman simply shrugged. With a grimace, turning his attention again back to Suki, the firebending swordsman furiously backpedaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" he exclaimed. \"I didn't mean it like that! Of course you still love him: that's obviously why you're having trouble accepting this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not seem to cheer her up, however. If anything, it only further deepened her malaise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Kyoshi was probably right, to forbid the founders of my order from marriage,\" the girl whispered, more to herself than to those around her. She was unable to look Zuko or the others in the eye as she spoke. \"I mean, look at me... I'm supposed to be the commander of our order, the inheritor of Avatar Kyoshi's will, yet I'm acting so <i>pathetic.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it would be better if I <i>didn't</i> love him...\" she muttered. \"At least then I would not be so weak. At least then I wouldn't <i>hurt</i> so much at the thought of letting him go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Mai, for the second time, interjected to interrupt Suki's pity party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a <i>completely idiotic</i> way of looking at things,\" said the young woman snidely, but there was an uncharacteristic amount of force behind her words, and her eyes seemed to flash as she spoke. \"Love doesn't make you weak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked up at Mai, surprise evident in her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love hurts,\" said Mai. \"<i>Big deal</i>. Just because it leaves you in pain, that doesn't mean it's bad for you. I'd think that a <i>warrior</i> of all people should know this,\" she remarked derisively, condescendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet when Suki looked into her eyes, she saw one of the last things she would have ever expected from the young weapons mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sympathy. Understanding. <b>Camaraderie.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Suki murmured, uncertain how to take this. \"I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Mai. \"Listen. Lift your chin, stand up straight, and <i>quit being a baby.</i> You love him, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes,</i>\" she said, and there was so much emotion, so much <i>passion</i> conveyed in that one simple word that Toph, who was still off to the side, listening, frozen in place with an almost morbid fascination, suddenly looked incredibly guilty. Yet, after a moment, the young woman added, \"...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Mai interjected again, stepping forward and grabbing the Kyoshi Warrior by the arm. \"No buts. Either you love him, or you don't. There's no in between.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer golden eyes smoldered with a frightening intensity as she stared straight into Suki's... brown? gray? ...<i>blue?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai shook her head internally. Now was not the time to bother with something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Though she seriously<i> did</i> wonder what color the girl's eyes were supposed to be)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki sighed, her (brown? gray? blue?) eyes downcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>do</i> love him...\" She shook her head. \"...I'm not the only one, however...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked askance at Toph, and Zuko and Mai followed her gaze. The earthbender's ears turned bright red, and she hardly even needed her earthbending to feel they way they shifted their weight and swiveled their heads to face in her direction. She could practically feel their eyes upon her like a physical pressure against her skin, and a prickling sensation at the base of her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph blushed. <i>Heavily</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai blinked. Zuko sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Seriously?</i>\" said the former, apparently finding it hard to believe what she had just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter seemed less surprised though. Certainly, not so much so as he was simply weary,<i> exasperated. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't actually plan to go <i>through</i> with this, do you, Toph?\" he asked weakly, before groaning when he saw the blush on Toph's face go full-on fluorescent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my own decision,\" the girl said. Her voice wavered a little, but still they could hear a certain conviction in it. \"I'm done running away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all she said, but those few words conveyed a world of emotion, and meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>'Some of use prefer to actually go and take what we want, rather than sit around and mope all day about not getting it handed to us on silver platter'</i>...\" she whispered, recalling her own words back at the Jasmine Dragon, what seemed like a lifetime ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph gave the older girl a wan smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Sorry it had to be like this, but I guess I've decided to take your advice,\" she said. \"And Iroh's, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the one who convinced you to go through with this, isn't he?\" grumbled he, feeling a headache coming on. It had been a while since he'd felt so frustrated with his uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph shrugged, not needing to say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai quirked an eyebrow at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko resisted the urge to facepalm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty big detail to omit,\" drawled the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for Uncle Iroh,\" sighed Zuko in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved the old man, he really did, but sometimes he felt like just he could strangle him for always being so blasted <i>close</i> (in the sense that he rarely divulged all of what he was thinking, and kept many secrets close to his chest).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long moment of silence followed between the four of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I should probably go inside,\" said Toph at length, after a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked at Toph, and smiled sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" she said, \"And I'll suppose I'll go\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014<i>with</i> me,\" Toph interjected, surprising Suki. There was a deep crimson flush, still, to the young bender's cheeks, and she was holding out a hand, as if to gesture for Suki to follow her. \"I like Sokka, but I like <i>you</i>, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Toph's blush seemed to deepen at this, and Suki felt a bit of warmth in her own cheeks, which was certainly curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly, the Kyoshi Warrior smiled and took Toph's hand, which felt disconcertingly <i>small</i> inside her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" she said warmly, almost surprisingly so. Her expression seemed to lighten, no longer so morose as she gently squeezed the blind lass's hand. \"We'll figure this out <i>together</i>. Us and Sokka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Toph in apparent agreement, grinning unusually brightly as she tugged on the older girl's arm and began leading her back towards the house. \"The three of us against the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki giggled, and off they went, into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko stared blankly after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What just happened?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai was too busy fighting her gag reflex to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka felt inordinately weary as he went through the motions of various sword kata. He felt profoundly <i>drained</i> as he gripped the hilt of his heavy, arm-length waster, thrusting and slicing with a fluid, feline grace as he practiced his forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone danced he across the yard, his feet describing a path of bloodshed and combat through an invisible horde. He moved his weapon in efficient foining and sweeping blows, shifting his weight ever in constant movement \u2013 no more than he needed to, but no less, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothly, like a well oiled machine, his arms and legs and torso and head moved all together, every bodily member fulfilling some role or other at any given moment. His body and sword moved in perfect harmony. Each was merely an extension of the other. In perfect concert his members flowed from form to form: lean, hard, steadily-building muscles coiling and rippling and tensing and loosing in a kinetic symphony of war and peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was art in motion, as he trained, as he allowed himself to simply become lost in the movements of his wooden blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as drained, as<i> weary</i> as he was, all exhaustion, all stress seemed to fall from him as he become one with the sword. This was more than just a way of fighting, more than just a means of dealing injury and death. It was a kind of meditation, an expression of the soul upon the world, a veritable religious experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo fight with the sword, one had to focus all of their attention on the sword, had to live in the moment and shut out all else as they handled their blade. To allow one's focus to stray could prove fatal, when handling an implement as simply, sublimely lethal as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was zen. To truly handle the sword as a master, one had to forget completely all memories of the past, block off entirely all thoughts of the future. When the sword was in your hand, there was only the present, only <i>this moment</i>. You had to focus your entire being on your sword, the grand sum total of your intellect and experience and strength and <i>chi</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword was all. There was nothing but the sword. There had never been anything but the sword. There would never be anything but the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword was life, that which safeguarded the body and its vital members. The sword was death, that which cut down all enemies and laid low all threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword was Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. It was light and dark, push and pull, yin and yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword was <i>all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grunted in satisfaction as he felt his limbs slowly, gradually lighten. Worry and stress and dread and regret had lain heavy upon his shoulders, and his members had felt slow and leaden in their movements. But the exercise he did now, the training into which he threw himself, served as a distraction from his anxieties, and his misgivings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kata he now went through brought living warmth to limbs which had before felt so deathly cold, and the pain of exertion in his arms and legs and back and shoulders was as a soothing balm to his soul. The forms he now practiced brought solace to his troubled mind, a bittersweet nepenthe of blood and sweat which washed away troubles and fears and worries all with a burning as hot as wine down one's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was alone as he trained himself, or so he believed, and there were none to see him strive and struggle and persevere through every step and stroke of the intricate, advanced forms to which he tasked himself with the goal of mastery and escape. He did not train, now, to impress any others, or to show off his prowess. He did not flow with the sword in the sweet warmth of motion for the benefit of another. He did not lose himself in the blade and the blood and the steel to prove himself to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trained for himself, not for his friends, not for his family, not even for his master. He held the blade in his hands, and there was only him, only the sword, only the enemy right before him and the battlefield about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept there were no enemies, unless the ones which dwelt solely in the darkest, most hidden recesses of his mind and dreams. And there was no battlefield, unless all of life should be accounted as war, and all the world its theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was alone. There was only Sokka and the sword. The sword and Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil he heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Beautiful</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the word breathed in the distance, in a voice painfully familiar to Sokka, one which brought up pangs in his heart, pain unwanted, a loss which he had been attempting so hard to bury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" came another voice, and this was also one which pained him, for reasons related yet different to the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" said a third voice, low and gravelly, and somewhat toneless, yet also unmistakably feminine. To this one his heart had no attachment, his mind owed no sorrow, and so Sokka Hakoda's son felt his cheeks grow warm, his face glow red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted, feeling himself blushing from this praise, praise unasked for and, more importantly, praise given not from one who made him feel the pain of sorrow or loss just with the sound of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlustered, Sokka stumbled, missing a step in his forms. His face red, he tripped over his own feet, pitching forward and landing face-first on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp pain in his forehead, he saw stars, and then nothing.</span></div></div>",

He was laying on his back, the sky overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, buddy?\" the Fire Lord asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grunted, clutching a hand to his forehead with a pained groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Slush</i>,\" the young tribesman cursed through grit teeth, recalling all at once how he had come to lose consciousness in the first place. \"<i>Please</i> tell me the girls didn't see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bei Fong didn't, at least,\" came the dry, laconic wit of Zuko's girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka didn't know what the Fire Lord saw in the girl, although he supposed that she <i>was </i>at least <i>kinda</i> pretty, in the right light \u2013 not that he went for that sort of look, himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sniggered from somewhere out of sight (Sokka was a little too stiff and sore at the moment to turn his head to look for her).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All hail Snoozles, Lord of the Pratfall!\" she teased, but her tone was warm \u2013 perhaps a bit suspiciously so, given the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Sokka heard Suki giggle, the sound clear and beautiful, like the tinkling of silver wind chimes, soft and girlish and gay. He felt his face grow red in spite of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Suki,\" he said, greeting his technically-kind-of-an-ex-now girlfriend. \"Hey, Toph,\" he added a second later nodding slightly in the direction he had heard his friend's voice coming from. His neck was already feeling a bit less stiff now as he did so, and he risked trying to sit up. He felt his back groan a bit in protest at this sudden movement, but otherwise he was able to attain a seated position without overmuch difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced around, seeing that he was still in the yard, where he had been practicing his sword forms. It didn't look like had been out for too long, judging from the sun's position in the sky \u2013 certainly, at least, it couldn't have been more than five, maybe ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyed the people present around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko had been kneeling over him when he first awoke, but now the Fire Lord had moved back a few feet, and was sitting next to his girlfriend. Mai, in turn, appeared to be eyeing Sokka boredly \u2013 and the Water Tribe teen felt his cheeks heat up under her piercing gaze, suddenly feeling a little self conscious about the fact that he had been training shirtless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, meanwhile, was off to one side, sitting not far from Toph, who was herself resting her back against a boulder that Sokka was fairly certain hadn't been there he'd passed out. The former was smiling at him, looking glad to see that he was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(And Sokka was glad to see that she was glad)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd I miss?\" he asked his assembled friends, a gormless grin forming on his face. He was consciously focusing his gaze more in Zuko's (and Mai's) direction, a mite too conscious of how complicated things had recently gotten between himself and the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(He tried not to think too hard about how the relationship dynamics between him and Suki and Toph would be forced to change by recent events, and he also hoped that the earthbender would not take out her frustrations with her parents on <i>him</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko snorted, a rather undignified sound to be coming from the leader of an entire nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said the marginally older teen, the faintest note of sarcasm in his voice, \"Suki was about to leave for Kyoshi Island when Mai and I arrived, and apparently Toph has decided to go through with the marriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three major pieces of information to be gotten from that statement. The first, he already knew \u2013 he had <i>been there</i> when Suki had made her decision to leave... except she was still here. And she did not look like she had any intentions of moving from that spot. Maybe she wasn't leaving after all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(...Sokka probably should not have felt so hopeful at this thought)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two details, however, were new to him. The first, being that Toph was going to go through with the marriage \u2013 <i>why would she do that?</i> he asked himself, but somewhere in his subconscious, he got the strange feeling that he should <i>know</i> the reason, that he <i>did</i> know the reason, but simply refused to accept it. And the second was that Zuko and Mai apparently knew about the arranged marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the detail his brain chose to latch onto, it being the relatively most innocuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long did you two know?\" he asked Zuko, Mai, and his voice most certainly did NOT crack. Also his tone was <i>perfectly</i> masculine, and not at ALL high-pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just found out about it today,\" replied the Fire Lord, a sheepish look on his face, shrugging with his palms face up in an almost <i>apologetic</i> fashion. \"We heard it from Uncle Iroh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai did not deign to add anything to this, simply fiddling uninterestedly with one of her many ever-present throwing knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" said Sokka, and he nodded silently, understanding writ on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell quiet for a minute or two, obviously still curious about the other big revelations, but fearing to broach the subject. It was too awkward, he thought, too strange, too surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn't things ever be simple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he sighed, at length, glancing sidelong at Toph, and Suki. He frowned just the tiniest bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can't believe you're actually willing to go through with this,\" he confessed to the former, eyeing her curiously, as though it was his first time really <i>seeing</i> her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph blushed, her cheeks dusted a light shade of pink (and Sokka was surprised to realize that the young girl could actually look <i>cute</i>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't read anything into it, Meathead,\" she said brusquely, crossing her arms over her chest. Yet her blush only grew deeper as she spoke, and if Sokka didn't know better, he would almost think that Toph was <i>intentionally</i> facing her head away from him. \"I-it's not like I <i>like</i> you, or anything,\" she stammered out, and her words sounded the tiniest bit forced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked <i>this</i> close to gushing and fawning over the way Toph was acting, and the look in her eyes all but screamed <i>'eeee too cuuuute~!'</i> Zuko also seemed a little taken aback at how Toph was talking, and even Sokka felt his cheeks warm a little in a mixture of confusion and something else. Mai was the only one to appear wholly unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course not,\" said Sokka, finding that the words came out unusually weakly, and why was his face getting so hot? \"It's just political, is all... My tribe needs this, I can't afford to refuse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" said Toph, and her voice was coming out as more of a squeak than anything else. \"E-even if I refused to go through with this, my parents wouldn't give up. They'd keep pushing until I finally married someone. And,\" \u2014 her blush, at this point, could have glowed in the dark \u2014 \"it's not like being married to you would be <i>too</i> awful,\" she murmured softly, almost everything about the way she was talking just seeming to be one hundred percent uncharacteristic for the willful Blind Bandit. \"Y-you're probably one of the best options I'll get, as far as people my parents would pick for me to marry... At least you aren't some fat, dirty old merchant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said this last part with a weak, kind of forced laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka felt unsure how to take what Toph was saying, though he was certainly blushing hard enough. He wasn't sure <i>why</i> Toph's words were eliciting this reaction from him \u2013 and why was Suki just sitting there and <i>smiling</i> at the two of them? It was making him feel weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly a <i>bad</i> weird, mind you, but it was still vaguely uncomfortable. And this was not a nice time for him to be outside his comfort zone. He wanted things to make <i>sense</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...or at least, not that he was willing to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(since when could toph be so CUTE?)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka had always known that Toph was a girl. He was no fool, whatever anyone else might say. He may have frequently forgotten that she was <i>blind</i>, but not once did he ever forget that she was a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just never seen why it <i>mattered</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to what many might think, from first impressions early on, Sokka was not really a sexist. Not anymore, at least. He was an intelligent person. He was perfectly able and willing to realize and acknowledge when he was wrong, and adjust his worldview accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, before meeting Aang and traveling all over the world with the young Avatar, back during the War (and it still really <i>struck him</i> now and again that it was actually finally <i>over</i>), he had hardly even believed in spirits, or the old stories Gran-Gran had used to tell him and his sister when they were little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokk had always been a fairly practical, pragmatic sort, the kind of person who based their worldview on what they could see, what they could perceive with their senses. Before traveling with Aang, he had never seen a spirit, never had any reason to believe they even existed <i>at all</i>, aside from the word of his Gran-Gran and the old stories of their people. And as spirits, before then, had never had any tangible, observable, <i>provable</i> effect on his life, he had not cared about them, had hardly put any stock in the old myths and legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara might have eaten that kind of thing right up, back when they were kids, but Sokka had always been a more skeptical sort of person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, however, after traveling with Aang, Sokka had gained a considerably greater appreciation for the<i> reality</i> of spirits, and magic, and junk like that. Hell, he had actually been <i>spirited away</i> once, by the Hei-Bai, and his old girlfriend was now the <i>moon</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's not even getting into his encounter with Wan Shi Tong, and the whole Spirit Library thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, after all of that, Sokka was just much more accepting of the idea of spirits. And in the same vein, while he had once been of the belief that men and women each had specific, written-in-stone roles, and that women could never be as good of warriors as <i>men</i>, this had not been something he had clung to irrationally out of some misguided sense of male chauvinism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this idea, this notion, had been a part of his worldview as a child, growing up in the South Pole where the only warriors and hunters were the men, and the women had their own jobs to take care of. He had, back then, believed that men were naturally stronger than women quite simply because, until he met Aang at the age of fifteen, the only women he had known had been Gran-Gran and the other tribeswomen, all mothers or homemakers, and Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had always been one to base his worldview on empirical evidence. And back then, all of his experience had pointed to men being stronger, men being natural warriors. <i>Now</i>, of course, he knew that the data had simply been skewed by the small sample size he had to work with as a child, but back then he had not yet been given any reason to question this belief. Not even by Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Especially</i> not by Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Sokka knew his sister would probably have his hide if she ever heard him say it out loud, but back before they met Aang, before they left to find him and Katara a waterbending master in the North Pole, his sister had been, quite frankly, <i>weaker than him</i>, and he had found it very difficult to take her rants about equality and <i>women can be just as strong as men</i> seriously when Katara herself had been, in all honesty, <i>weak</i>, and really incapable of contributing to the tribe's survival as a hunter or warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange notion to contemplate now, with Katara being recognized as one of the greatest waterbenders alive \u2013 an honest-to-Yue <i>prodigy</i>, who had, after just a short period of formal instruction, risen to a level of skill great enough to be entrusted with valuable scrolls of the Northern Water Tribe's bending techniques, and more importantly the continued education of the Avatar himself \u2013 but back when it was just them in the South Pole, Katara's only contribution to the survival of the tribe had been to do what Sokka, back then, would have termed \"woman's work\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been the one who went hunting out on the ice, staying out for days at a time, on occasions, before finally returning to the village with a kill in tow. Katara had not been strong enough to heft a spear, nor club a downed tiger seal in a killing blow. She had never learned how to use a boomerang, how to track prey across the endless white tundra, how to pick out at a glance the weakest, most vulnerable members of a herd or pack, or how to isolate those sickly, young, or elderly specimens from the rest of the group and pick them off alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had, quite simply, not been a hunter. And, back then, when she got on Sokka's case about leaving all his laundry to her, or making some stupid, sexist remark, he could not help but scorn her a little, in the back of his mind. As far as he had been concerned, back in those days, Katara had been full of herself, had wasted too much of her time playing with magic water and dreaming of far off lands and great adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did things go from here?</span></div></div>",

In all honesty, before leaving the South Pole, Katara's waterbending had been <i>entirely</i> self-taught, without even any waterbending scrolls to work from. She hadn't even known that <i>the moon was the source of waterbending</i>, for ocean's sake! That was just how fragmentary and incomplete his sister's understanding of the art had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, naturally, even with as talented as she eventually proved herself to be, there was only so much Katara could have done just by teaching herself. Without any documentation to work from, or elder benders to study under, or even anybody who could show her what the proper forms l<i>ooked like</i>, Katara had had to essentially develop her waterbending through trial and error, try to build up an entire martial style from scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Sokka himself had been better off, in teaching himself how to fight, because he was at least able to draw from vague childhood memories of watching the men of the tribe train and hunt and fend off raiders. Until reaching the North Pole, Katara had never before even <i>seen</i> another waterbender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo even with as much as her brother's abilities as a warrior had languished and stagnated and poorly developed, without senior warriors to show him the ropes and correct him when he made a mistake, Katara's abilities as a bender had suffered even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite frankly, until they met Aang and began traveling the world, Katara had been weaker than Sokka. And until they met the Kyoshi warriors, Sokka had not been given any reason to doubt his preconceived notions as to the natural order of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Suki had made a fool of him, and forced Sokka to reevaluate his worldview. And thinking of Suki brought Sokka back to the matter of Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting <i>complicated</i>,\" he heard himself mutter quietly under his breath, more to himself than any of the people seated around him, in the shade of an impromptu earth tent erected courtesy of the Blind Bandit. \"Toph's decided to go through with this, but she also doesn't want to alienate Suki? Gah, how is that supposed to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised, though,\" he said more loudly, so the others could hear. In particular, he was speaking in Suki's direction. \"You're talking about wanting to make our relationship work, yet you also don't want me to try and call off the marriage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" replied the auburn-haired young woman with a shrug. \"I couldn't make you do that. Your tribe <i>needs</i> this, after everything that happened to it during the war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko visibly flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, get over it, Zuko,\" Mai said to her boyfriend, rolling her eyes at the way he seemed to take every little reminder of the Fire Nation's crimes so personally. And not even in a funny, murderous rage sort of way, either \u2013 it was just downright <i>depressing</i>, and that was saying a LOT, coming from <i>her</i>. \"I mean, it's not like you <i>personally</i> raided the South Pole yourself, or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko's face turned a rather interesting shade of puce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" she said, her tone bland. \"I forgot about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not sound even remotely sheepish. Zuko looked like he was about to say something, but he was interrupted before he could get any words out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" interjected Toph's voice, \"Back up. What's this about Sokka's tribe <i>needing</i> him to marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If anybody noticed that she used his actual name, and not any sort of nick, well, they didn't show it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I thought you knew,\" he said, looking slightly perplexed, eyeing the young chit somewhat curiously. \"If the two of us get married, that will mean an alliance between the Bei Fongs and the Southern Water Tribe. With the help of your family's assets and trade agreements, my tribe would be able to rebuild a lot more easily. That kind of influence would go a very long way towards restoring the South Pole to the way it used to be, before the war. Didn't you know that?\" he inquired. \"I thought that was why you decided to go through with the marriage...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questioning tone in which he said the last sentence caused Toph's cheeks to pinken, and she seemed to tense a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yeah!\" she said, her voice sounding unnaturally high pitched. \"<i>That!</i> Yes, that was why!\" She laughed, but it was rather forced-sounding, a little nervous, even. \"Ha! ha! ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka cocked an eyebrow curiously, but he did not say anything. He noticed the way Suki was smirking at Toph, a rather knowing expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would rather not think too hard about why that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, he decided to get to the original point of what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, though. I'm a little confused, Suki,\" said the Water Tribe teen, changing the topic for the benefit of everyone present. \"The way you're talking... well, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to take it.\" His face reddened. \"It... er, almost sounds like you <i>want</i> me to get together with Toph, yet you still want to keep what we have going...? Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched the back of his neck. He looked sheepish, a little anxious, and he seemed to be having the tiniest bit of difficulty meeting the bright hazel eyes of his he-really-wasn't-sure-what-to-call-what-they-had-a nymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I hope you don't take this the wrong way Suki,\" continued Sokka, \"but shouldn't you be a little less... ah, <i>accepting</i> of something like that? I didn't think polygamy was really... <i>practiced</i> in the Earth Kingdom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko frowned, confused, and Mai also looked maybe just the slightest bit lost, if you knew her expressions well enough. Suki, though, turned a bright, fluorescent pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep! No!\" she said anxiously, appearing flustered at Sokka's remark. But then, fighting to regain some of her composure, she added, \"Er, not as such, no,\" in a slightly calmer tone. She still looked a bit embarrassed though. \"And, besides, Kyoshi Warriors can't get married, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai's eyebrows nearly rose into her hairline at this, though she looked a tad more amused than outright astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does <i>Ty Lee</i> know this?\" she wondered. \"I can't imagine she would like that very much...\" she murmured, before almost <i>frowning</i> as she added. \"But, what does this... what did you call it? Polygony? What does that have to do with marriage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki gave Mai a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she knows. It's the first of the vows a prospective Kyoshi Warrior is expected to take before they can be accepted into the order,\" she said. \"<i>'And thus, for love of mine home, I shall wed myself unto Kyoshi, and serve her most faithfully until at last I be returned to the Earth. All other vows forswear I, who lovest Kyoshi so above all else, and none other shall claim my hand as theirs but Kyoshi.'</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said this fluidly, firmly, as though quoting from heart a passage of holy scripture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Zuko and Mai react to this?</span></div></div>",

No, of course not!\" Suki responded. \"By 'Kyoshi', we don't simply mean the Avatar, or the woman. We mean the ideals for which she stood, the people she fought to protect, she island she split off from the mainland,\" she explained. \"All of those things are <i>'Kyoshi'</i>, and <i>that</i> is what we Kyoshi Warriors marry ourselves to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Mai muttered. \"Marrying an<i> ideal?</i> You Earth Kingdom people are crazy,\" she said ignoring Toph and Suki's twin cries of <i>\"Hey! Don't lump us sensible folk in with those loony mainlanders/backwards island-dwellers!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko sighed slightly, and he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still doesn't explain what geometry has to do with marriage,\" said he, curiously turning his gaze on Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage tribesman blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geome...? <i>No!</i>\" he exclaimed in exasperation. \"It's <i>polygamy</i>, not math. Po-ly-ga-my,\" he carefully, clearly enunciated. \"You know? When a guy takes more than one wife. (Or when a girl takes more than one husband, as Katara always used to insist, but I've never heard of <i>that</i>).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean, like, concubines?\" he asked, face a bit red. \"I didn't think the Water Tribe did that sort of thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka turned kinda purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Concubines?!</i> No!\" he exclaimed. \"I'd never do that to Suki or Toph! I respect them <i>way</i> too much for that!\" he said, looking flustered and a more than a little vexed by that remark. \"I just mean... well, Suki can't really marry me anyways, because of her vows and all, but if I <i>did</i> marry her, as well as Toph, <i>that</i> would be polygamy. I know it's not done a whole lot, nowadays, but I'd think you would have at least <i>heard</i> of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zuko was having a little difficulty processing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, do you mean, some people actually get <i>married</i> to more than one person?!\" he spluttered, sounding almost aghast. \"But\u2014! I\u2014! How would that even <i>work?!</i>\" he exclaimed. Even Mai appeared to be having some difficulty processing this, if the way her eyes were faintly glazing over were any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In reality, she was more just distracted with the idea of multiple husbands, particularly Zuko and... a certain young Water Tribesman, whose dark complexion and sculpted physique she could <i>certainly</i> appreciate)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked at the pair like they were out of their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what's so complicated about it,\" he said. \"I mean, yeah you would need to provide for multiple wives, and any kids you had with them, but it's not exactly <i>airship science</i>. You just need the capital to keep them all fed and happy, and clothed and housed. Nothing complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, <i>seriously</i>,\" she said, getting everyone's attention. \"Quit arguing semantics! Honeybuns can't get married, anyways, so it doesn't <i>matter</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka and Zuko had the decency to look sheepish. And Mai was too distracted with thoughts of a steamy Fire-Knife-Water sandwich to pay much attention to the proceedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"It's not really that complicated, anyway. If it comes down to it, me and Sokka can just carry on a relationship as secret lovers.\" She paused. \"...at least, if that would be okay with <i>you</i>, Toph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earthbender blushed, but she snorted derisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what you two do,\" she said, \"As long as you let me in on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki and Sokka, at that moment, turned both red as beetroots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph frowned, crossing her arms over chest. She looked a mixture of peevish and flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she said, cheeks erubescent. \"I just want don't want to be left out of the loop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka and Suki only grew more embarrassed by this, thought it was for a much different reason than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt probably wasn't a good sign that they needed to mentally remind themselves that Toph was only <i>twelve</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending on how you chose to interpret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some things were easier said than done. Though Sokka, Suki, and Toph had eventually come up with a general idea of how they could make this whole relationship thing work (Sokka still not realizing the nature of Toph's feelings), they all knew that plans were much easier to come up with than they were to actually carry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Sokka and Toph would go through with the marriage plans while also still maintaining a \u2013 hem \u2013 <i>relationship</i> with Suki was fairly simple, in itself. But to actually do what was said would be a very daunting task, in all likelihood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, there was the matter of their parents to consider. How would things go, should the Bei Fongs or Chief Hakoda learn of this... planned affair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, by all accounts, an affair it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Suki's parents would likely not object, particularly, should they find out, Sokka's and Toph's were a much more imposing prospect. Kyoshi Warriors, Suki had explained, and by extension the people of Kyoshi Island in general, did not traditionally view marriage as a very important thing. At best, they saw it as pointless, a meaningless affirmation of what everybody already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove, they believed, needed no pomp or circumstance or legalistic ritual. Love was love, they believed. It was a self-evident thing, when two people were in love, and most of the people of Kyoshi Island viewed marriage as a quaint, foreign ritual, after three hundred and some years of separation from the mainland, a pointless declaration of love, at best. And at worst, they saw it as a self-destructive chain. When people stayed together out of love, they would be happy together, but when they were<i> forced</i> to stay together, bound by the expectations of family and society, the love would die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Ai and Koi of Kyoshi would logically, likely, see no reason to object, should they learn of the... <i>affair</i>. Love was love was love. It was, to the denizens of Kyoshi, as simple as that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not, of course, to imply that the Kyoshi way of handling it was without its own flaws and pitfalls, but then what thing was? It was hardly idyllic, but that was fine by them. Because most things rarely were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the people of the Earth Kingdom proper \u2013 the upper class, in particular \u2013 did not hold nearly such a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude regarding the institution of holy matrimony. Marriage was marriage was marriage, as far as they were concerned. In the upper class of the Earth Kingdom where political marriages of convenience were the norm, love was optional, not a requirement. When people got married, they were expected to stick it through for the sake of duty and propriety, regardless of however so intensely they may have despised one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn such an environment as this, what could they really expect from people as blue-blooded as Lao and Poppy? Surely, the Bei Fongs would disapprove of such a thing, would see it as a violation of the marriage oath. If they found out about it after Sokka and Toph's marriage, no doubt they would demand their proverbial (and literal) money back, and that could cause untold amounts of havoc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's father, as well, would probably be leery of such a thing, though perhaps more because of a fear that it should be taken in offense by the Bei Fongs than any personal opinions on the matter. The Water Tribe was very pragmatic about marriage, and while it was certainly seen as a natural progression in a couple's relationship, it was more a promise on the man's part to provide for his wife (or wives), and on the woman's part to keep a home ready for the man, than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome tribesman, particularly those from the North Pole, might take it poorly that Suki and Sokka should carry on an intimate relationship without the ritual affirmation of marriage, but Chief Hakoda himself was an intelligent man, and knew his son well, besides. If not for the matter with the Bei Fongs, Hakoda likely would not have cared if Suki and Sokka had an ongoing affair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarriage was important to the Southern Water Tribe, in its own way, but so was <i>love</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill though, in spite of all of this, it had been Suki who had suggested they plainly state their intentions. After several minutes of sitting there and listening to Sokka come up with increasingly wild and outlandish plans for how to carry out a secret relationship, she had finally decided to just cut through the proverbial Gordian Knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why don't we just tell them?\" she suggested, sitting there beside Sokka and Toph, across from Zuko and Mai. \"If we keep it a secret, that will only make things that much worse when the cat-owl finally gets out of the bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said this, the others stared at her like she had just suggested they have Momo officiate a secret marriage between Sokka and Zuko. There was a silence so complete that she could hear the heartbeats of everyone in the room, could have told them apart just by the sound of their breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she said. \"Don't look at me like that. It makes SENSE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" Sokka murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" chimed in Zuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a stupid idea,\" scoffed Toph. \"They'll shoot us down right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, <b>maybe</b>,\" Suki said with a shrug, \"but think about it. Maintaining a long distance relationship is hard enough, but also keeping that relationship SECRET? It just isn't done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others looked skeptical (apart from Mai, whose golden eyes were narrowed shrewdly, thoughtfully), so Suki elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One way or another, no matter how we did it, something would eventually have to give. Either the stress would become too much and we would drift apart, or something would slip and they would find out,\" she said. \"The longer you keep something secret from people, the more upset they will be when they learn it. If we try to keep this relationship a secret, things will blow up in our faces. It's inevitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka deflated with a grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" said he, \"but... I don't imagine they would approve...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" said Suki. \"I don't care about THAT. But as long as we're straightforward and up front about our intentions, they won't have any cause to accuse us of deceit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still sounds like a bad idea...\" muttered Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" interjected Mai, her voice quiet, tone even. \"It makes sense, when you think about it. Sometimes you just have to face these kinds of things head on, instead of running away from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis phrasing caused Toph to wince, but then her expression hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" she said slowly. \"If that's the case, then I guess I can see where you're coming from.\" She nodded, determination written in the set of her jaw. \"Yeah, I think I get it. All or nothing, right? Enough tenderfooting around. Time to take this boarcupine by the tusks.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they had come here, to outside of the hotel room where the Bei Fongs were staying for the duration of their time in Ba Sing Se. Zuko and Mai had stayed behind at the Gaang's house (the former had mentioned having something he wanted to show Sokka when he got back). They did not go with Toph, Sokka, and Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko could not officially support what they were doing, or so Mai had said. It would be unwise for him, so early in his reign, so soon after the end of the War, to be seen meddling in the affairs of the people of the Earth Kingdom or Water Tribes. Even if the people in question were his <i>friends</i>, spectators could very easily misconstrue any interference by Zuko in the matter of Sokka and Toph's arranged marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not want to give off the wrong impression, did not want people to think he was trying to bully the people of the other nations, so he could not directly interfere. And besides, Mai had pointed out that it would hardly mean anything unless Sokka, Suki, and Toph did this for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to fight for this by themselves, had to earn it on their own. Just the three of them working together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki could not help but be reminded of the day of Sozin's Comet, when the three of them had alone taken down the entire Fire Nation air fleet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn comparison to something like that, facing Toph's parents did not seem like an even remotely intimidating prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Sokka and gave him a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do this,\" she told him. \"They aren't that scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka weakly returned the grin, and he took her hand in his \u2013 more for his own reassurance than hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right,\" he said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph snorted. There was confident tilt to her lips, a faint, barely noticeable smirk. Unusually subtle for the brash, bullheaded girl, but then she was the one with the most reason to be daunted by the prospect of facing her parents. That she wasn't showing any sign of anxiety or nerves was, surely, a credit to how greatly the words of Suki had heartened her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is,\" said the Blind Bandit dismissively. \"The woman is <i>always</i> right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" he said with a wry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere they let in?</span></div></div>",

When they announced their purpose for being there, Toph stepping forward (still wearing the dress her parents had bought, though it looked a little dirty and bedraggled) and saying that she wished to speak with her parents, the servant had looked relieved, as though he had been anticipating their arrival for some time already, and been going slowly spare from the anxiety of waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led them to a luxuriant, elaborately furnished sitting room, gaudy and garish with hangings of green and gold and elaborately carved furniture of marble and mahogany. Lao and Poppy sat at a small table. Between them was a small, elegantly decorated ceramic bottle engraved with the characters \u71d2\u9152 \u2013 a label of its contents, judging from the scent and color of the liquid held in the cups from which the two drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir sips were slow and sparing, but there was a light, faintly pinkish flush to their cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy was the first to notice their presence, and her eyes immediately zeroed in on Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, daughter,\" she said primly, but also warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLao, hearing this, and seeing where his wife's eyes were glancing, followed Poppy's gaze to their daughter, as well as Sokka and Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" he remarked. \"Well done,\" he said to the older two of the trio. \"You found her, just like we asked. You make a very good impression of yourself, young man,\" he told Sokka, smiling at the youthful Water Tribesman. \"I do not doubt, now, that Poppy and I made the right choice in our selection of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thank you?\" said Sokka, looking uncertain whether he was supposed to take this as a compliment or what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are welcome,\" said Lao, either unnoticing, or else uncaring, of the almost questioning tone in the lad's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Poppy then turned their attention to Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, dear?\" said the girl's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have to say for yourself?\" continued her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph blushed \u2013 though whether it was from embarrassment, frustration, or else the faint fumes of baijiu which wafted from her parents, it could not be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" she said, at a volume one or two decibels above her usual inside voice, her words spoken a bit quicker than was her want, and her voice a slightly higher pitch than usual. \"I'll go through with the marriage \u2014 But!\" she added, loudly, firmly, forcefully, \"I have <i>one condition</i>. I'm not doing this for you guys. I don't care about whatever plans you had to arrange this for. I'm doing it because I <i>want</i> to,\" she explained, her voice hard and stern, but with a hint of fire beneath. \"However, I... Well, I'm<i> not</i> going to force Sokka and Suki apart just for this. Right, you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" said Sokka, looking a little torn between his desire to get this over with and the sense of intimidation he got from Lao's and Poppy's stares. \"I'll marry your daughter, but, with all due respect, this does not mean I'll be leaving Suki. I love her. I like Toph, too, of course, but not in the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed, recalling absently memories of Toph's cute moments, many of which he hadn't even thought of as such until recently, when his face had been basically <i>slammed</i> headfirst into the fact that the Bei Fong heiress really <i>was</i> cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... not really, at least...\" he murmured quietly, half to himself, trying not to think to hard about the altogether too pleasantly warm, too familiarly <i>Suki-ish</i> and <i>Yue-like</i> feelings he got in his belly whenever he found himself contemplating his friend in this strange, new light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki squeezed Sokka's hand \u2013 and Lao and Poppy noticed for the first time that they were holding hands, all three of them \u2013 smiling warmly, affectionately. She giggled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think what he's trying to say is, he likes your daughter, and he thinks she's cute\" \u2014 under other circumstances, Sokka probably would have spluttered and protested at this, but at a single Look from Suki he wisely held his tongue \u2014 \"BUT he also loves <i>me</i>. And I love him, too. We've been through a lot together, all three of us. And we intend to <i>stay</i> together,\" she continued, her eyes flashing as she spoke. \"All three of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Toph. \"Even if Suki can't marry Sokka, she still really likes him, and I like her, too. She's cool and fun, and I won't make her leave him. I won't <i>let </i>you guys push her away!\" she declared quietly, but defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did her parents respond?</span></div></div>",

Her boyfriend was still a little innocent to how things were done in the Earth Kingdom. He didn't understand the subtle implications of Poppy's remark. This much was obvious, because Suki knew that if Sokka <i>had</i> understood it, he would have immediately leaped to her defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was better that he did not. Suki could take the insult. She could be the bigger person, could turn the other cheek when she needed to. Sometimes you had to take action to defend what you believed in, but you also had to know how to choose your battles. An argument with the Bei Fongs would hardly be worth it, not when they had finally resolved this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo need to bring in more drama when things were actually looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, if Poppy thought there were certain acts beneath a proper lady, then clearly she had never been with a man who had been willing to do <i>anything</i> for her. And Suki pitied her for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause as far as Suki was concerned, there was nothing degrading about making love. Not when you truly loved who you were with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she had the benefit of a boyfriend who was <i>very</i> eager to please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMm, <i>yesss</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was absolutely <i>nothing</i> degrading about <i>that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The path of a swordsman is demanding. It is not simply a fighting style, not merely a technique for using a weapon. No, the way of the sword is as much a spiritual journey as a physical one. It is a pilgrimage, a quest of self-discovery and enlightenment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo truly master the tenants of swordsmanship \u2013 of <i>any</i> martial art \u2013 the warrior must refine his spirit, must come to an understanding of himself and his place in the world. He must become one with the sword, must learn to identify the sword as a part of himself, a reflection of his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sword truly is as the warrior who wields it. Of all the many and varied kinds of weapons, the sword is, in principle and theory, one of the most simple \u2013 broken down to its most basic mechanical components, the sword is a lever and a wedge. Two of the most basic, fundamental machines in the history of civilization. And this simplicity is a very large part of what makes the sword such a flexible weapon, tactically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Give me a lever long enough, and I will move the world.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there have been countless, innumerable variations on the theme of the sword throughout history, and one could spend a lifetime and a half simply studying and cataloging all the myriad shapes and forms in which the noble sword has come. Like the warrior, swords can manifest in any variety of shapes and sizes. They can be specialized to a very narrow field of utility, such as the delicate but lethal katana, ideal for slicing through soft, unarmored flesh with a frighteningly preternatural ease, or generalized to a jack of all trades, useful in any situation, like the ever-reliable Swiss longsword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there are of course countless more obscure and bizarre kinds of swords out there, just as there are countless strange, unbelievable sorts of warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword is the warrior. It is an expression of the warrior's ideal state of being. Unlike the spear or axe or hammer or bow or sickle or scythe or knife or staff, the sword is no tool for hunting, or woodcraft, no peasant's weapon. The sword is the tool of the warrior. It exists for war, for battle, for bloodshed alone. It has no other purpose, no peacetime utility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly warriors carry swords. It is the mark of a warrior, of one who has been trained and groomed to fight and kill and defend. For a warrior, one's weapon is one's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour weapon is an extension of yourself. A part of your body. It is <i>you</i>, and you are<i> it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword is a warrior's soul. It is your identity, your brand, your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo lose a sword, or any weapon, which has seen you through thick and thin, aided you in your hardest, bloodiest days, and saved your skin in those desperate moments where your life hung in the balance, as on the edge of a knife, where to stray a little too far to either side would mean <i>death</i>, is like losing an arm or a leg. That weapon is a part of you, that sword as dear to you as a family member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko, as he sat in wait for Sokka and the others to return, thought and pondered all of this and more as he observed the long, slender, wrapped and swaddled object which rested upon his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter than most, he knew how much a sword could mean to its bearer, its master. Had not his own twin dao, after all, seen him through some of the hardest times of his life? He trusted to those swords as much as he trusted the fires which smoldered ever within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his dao had gotten him through some damn sticky situations, had saved his ass where even his firebending would have failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, though Zuko was born with the Inner Fire, there were times where he could not help but wonder if he wasn't more of a <i>swordsman</i> than he was a firebender. The blade he had taken up by choice, a conscious decision, an informed selection of a path in life. Where the Fire chose him, <i>he</i> chose the Sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Piandao had taught him much, had taught him more than just a way of fighting. Back then, Zuko had been unable to see it, too focused on simply finding some way to make up for what he perceived as his failures as a firebender, as a warrior, but now he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like Uncle Iroh, Sifu Piandao had been subtle. The man had taught him many things, yes, but many more still had he left for Zuko to figure out for himself, giving him just enough clues to work out those most important lessons on his own, once he was finally ready to understand and accept them. And Zuko was still learning, still unlocking the mysteries his master had left for him to unravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was just a White Lotus thing. Being all vague and meaningful sounding as they taught you the basics, while leaving you to figure out the most important things for yourself. Certainly sounded like something that a club his uncle belonged to would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Zuko sent a sideways glance at his girlfriend, Mai, who was boredly tossing knives at a slight indent in the wall \u2013 it looked to be about the size of somebody's elbow, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered what she had said about the sword which lay, wrapped up, concealed, across his lap.</span></div></div>",

Mai just sat there, fiddling with a gleaming, cold stiletto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt length, however, after sitting there in silence for a minute or two, she spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" she remarked, and her voice had a hint of something to it, something that Zuko only heard on a select few occasions. \"That sword, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes, as shining golden as the ornament Zuko wore in his hair, gleamed as she talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean the shape or the quality of it, of course \u2013 it's good, maybe the best of its kind, but that's par for the course when you're talking about a Piandao original.\" Mai shook her head. \"No, it's not the quality of it that's unusual. Rather, it's what it's made of. Or,\" she added, her lips curling in a thoughtful frown, more expression than she usual showed in a whole day dancing across her face in these few moments, \"to be specific, what it ISN'T made of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko gave her a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked her. \"I mean, I know that Sokka said it was made from a shooting star, but I don't see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zuko?\" said Mai. \"I've seen metal from meteors \u2013 most old Sun Warrior weapons were made with ore extracted from space rocks. And those weapons? Nothing special, really. It's just iron. Nothing meaningfully different from what you could find by digging in the earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Zuko intelligently. \"But, Sokka's sword\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014is some kind of strange, <b>unique</b> metal or alloy,\" said Mai. \"Trust me, Zuko. I know a lot about weapons, and I know a LOT about what weapons are made of. Whatever that sword was made from, it wasn't just from any sort of regular meteorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow furrowed, and she seemed to be deep in thought. Mai was almost never this passionate or talkative \u2013 the only other place Zuko had seen this side of his girlfriend was in the bedroom. Most other things just didn't arouse her interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know,\" she muttered, contemplative. \"I mean, the only kind of weapons I've ever heard about that were anything like this sword... well, they're all from old spirit stories and myths. Magic, blessed weapons from another realm, another plane of existence entirely. A sword like the one you're holding should only exist in the realm of fantasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko hummed thoughtfully at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well, he IS friends with Aang,\" he said, shrugging it off. \"This kind of thing just sort of... happens, when the Avatar is involved. I mean, Sokka's first girlfriend turned into the MOON.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai stared at him. Her expression was blank. It would have been unreadable to most, but Zuko could see the utter disbelief written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko chuckled quietly to himself, remembering with slight amusement how Mai had reacted to hearing the story of Princess Yue, or at least as much of it as Zuko himself knew. It was certainly a fantastic, outlandish tale, and if Zuko hadn't been there and also heard the story as well, afterwards, from Uncle Iroh, he probably would have dismissed it as false out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were strange times, though. Times when legends straight out of yore, figures of the sort which most had believed existed only in songs and old folktales, walked the earth again, alive and <i>real</i> for any to see. People there were like heroes of yore, masters of their elements, sages and bandits and saviors and villains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was times like this when Zuko truly realized just how fantastic the tale of his own life would be to most people. It was at times like this that he understood that they lived in an age of legends still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so was he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange, surreal thought for Zuko to ponder, but not a dismaying one. Rather, it heartened him, made him want to laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey truly did live in such strange and wonderful times, he mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko smiled, and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sometime between their last appearance in chapter nineteen and the events of chapter twenty-one, Aang and Katara, needing to make room for other characters, had seemingly vanished from the Gaang's house, along with Momo. They had not been doing anything particularly interesting, of course \u2013 or, at least, nothing strictly <i>relevant</i> to the ongoing narrative of this tale \u2013 aside from maybe putting forth a token effort in looking for Toph, briefly, but other than that, they had probably just been amping up the oogie factor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr having tea with Pong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho can say? Whatever they had been doing, clearly it had been either unimportant or else not <i>appropriately</i> entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were out of the way, not at the house. That's the important detail. Anything more would just be filler. Like this tediously self-referential meta-narrative thing I have currently got going, for instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, anyways, the point is that Aang and Katara were NOT at the house, and were NOT present for the events of the past couple of chapters. I feel it is important that we establish this, for what happens next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Also because I kinda forgot about them when I wrote those chapters but <i>SHHH THAT IS A SECRET</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, when Aang and Katara returned home after... I dunno, maybe a few rounds of tonsil hockey, or whatever you want to imagine... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, whatever the case, when they returned home, it was to find Sokka, Aang's friend and Katara's big brother, tightly embracing Zuko, Aang's other friend and Katara's alleged secret love interest, while Mai and Suki looked on. Toph, for her part, was just standing there, and it was kinda hard to tell when she was or wasn't \"watching\" something, for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even as Aang and Katara stepped in through the door, slightly bemused at the sight of Sokka embracing the Fire Lord (<i>and when had Zuko showed up?</i>), the young warrior then planted a kiss on Zuko's lips, exclaiming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Thankyouthankyouthankyou!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nin an excited tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Aang and Katara were stunned by this, then Zuko was downright <i>gobsmacked</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...though Mai, Suki, and even Toph looked a little<i> too</i> interested in what was currently happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" said Aang, his voice catching the attention of the others, who finally noticed his and Katara's presence, and his brain struggling to keep up with everything he was seeing. \"<i>When did we find Toph?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo chose that moment to pop a fuzzy, big-eared head out of Aang's robes, churring and chittering at the assembled group in quite unperturbed manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka, letting go of Zuko, turned around to face Aang and Katara. He was beaming brightly, seemingly completely uncaring that not even a second earlier he'd had his lips locked with Zuko's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she showed up a while ago,\" he said, somehow managed to sound both excited and dismissive at the same time. \"But look what <i>Zuko</i> found!\" he then exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up a sword, a straight black jian of peerless craftsmanship. It was a weapon they knew well, even if their acquaintance had been brief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really... <i>your sword?</i>\" said Katara, unable to believe what she was seeing. \"I thought you threw it over the side of that one airship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" said Sokka, nodding his head so fast and hard that almost Katara worried he would sprain his neck. \"But Zuko <i>found </i>it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe all but squealed this last part, and for a moment he looked nearly torn between hugging his sword or hugging Zuko. But then he simply shook his head and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like the best pal a guy could ask for!\" Sokka told Zuko, turning around to beam at the Fire Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko simply nodded, slowly, weakly. His face looked like it was uncertain whether it wanted to be red or white or green, and his skin was tinged with an interesting chromatic patchwork; splotches of magenta, and puce, and violet, and eggshell, and olive, and peach all coming together to form a collage of mixed, confused emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" was all he said, the words weakly spoken, his voice cracking just a little. He schooled his expression into one of relatively benign indifference, but he could not hide the fact that he now had something of a hundred yard stare, and was trying to look anywhere but Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also kinda slouched over a little, kinda awkwardly slumping his torso forward in a strange way, which Katara thought was weird because Zuko usually had <i>very good </i>posture. And now that she thought about it, the Fire Lord's cheeks also looked, at second glance, to be more ruddy pink than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara wasn't sure what to make of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Mai, Suki, and Toph certainly seemed to have their own opinion of the recent events, if their variously intrigued and... <i>intrigued</i>... expressions were anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara got the feeling that she did not want to think on this too long or hard, for the sake of her own innocence. Which was in and of itself a very strange, oddly specific feeling to get, but there you have it all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter to leave well enough alone and move on to less <i>confusing</i> matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike what the slush was going to happen with that whole arranged marriage deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

I will not run away.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the mantra going through the minds of several different teens, the morning of the Harvest Festival, though for very different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Aang, it was a matter of the Avatar and the Last Airbender telling himself that he <i>would</i> make tonight special for Katara. Not in the way that, say, <i>Zuko</i> might for <i>his</i> girlfriend, because the Fire Lord was a young man of sixteen, where Aang was just<i> young</i>. But the Avatar still wanted to make sure that everything went perfectly for his sweetheart, still wanted to ensure she had a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was intimidating, though. The eyes of the entire world would be on him, and he was <i>really</i> nervous. Compared to this, the night before the coming of Sozin's Comet seemed, in retrospect, positively <i>relaxing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Katara, she was telling herself to face the reality of her feelings for Aang, and the fact that, as the girlfriend of the Avatar, she effectively belonged to the entire world. Going to the Harvest Festival in the Earth Palace would not be the same as going to some mere party back home. She had to represent the Southern Water Tribe, show the world that her people were not mere savages living at the fringes of society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to show that the Water Tribes were every bit as civilized and cultured as the Earth Kingdom, in their own unique way. She had to prove that her people were different, yes, but not <i>lesser</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a daunting prospect, and a heavy burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Zuko Ozai's son, the still-kinda-recently crowned Fire Lord, it was very much a matter of facing the crimes of his forefathers. He could not pretend that the War never happened \u2013 as Uncle had once told him, those who did not learn from history were doomed to repeat it. But he did not want to bring it up, exactly, either, because he knew there was still resentment towards him and his nation for everything that had been done in the last hundred years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to face the crimes of his father, and his grandfather, and his great grandfather, without actually mentioning them, and he had to show that the Fire Nation was changing its ways, while also not ignoring the matter of the crimes which had been committed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite frankly, Zuko would rather face a tag team of his sister, Azula, cured of her madness but evil as ever, and his father, bending restored and utterly pissed, than go out there and stare down the nobility of the Earth Kingdom. But he had his responsibility as the Fire Lord, and he <i>knew</i> it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai just didn't want to go to some boring-as-soot Earth Kingdom party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for the three people on whom this story has most strongly focused, over the course of its length and the breadth of its telling, it was a very different, yet also fundamentally <i>similar</i> matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, two of the three of them would be having their engagement announced at this party, and the third would be helping supervise the Earth King's protection detail, which would consist heavily of Kyoshi Warriors, who had arrived by boat the other day as per the agreed upon terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two, Sokka and Toph, were both very nervous about their part, though for admittedly different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Sokka, it was chiefly because he still felt a little bad that he could not just tell everyone that he and Suki were still an item. While the Earth Kingdom nobility would not look down on a prince \u2013 especially not one as (<i>apparently?</i>) famed as Sokka \u2013 for keeping a mistress or two, as the Bei Fongs had phrased it, there were still certain expectations that had to be met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were always expectations. And in Sokka and Suki's case, they would be expected to at least make some nods to discretion, for today if nothing else. It would be<i> quite</i> the scandal, they had insisted, if the young prince were to be found having relations with his mistress the day the wedding was announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was still a little unused to being called a <i>prince</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though, he was nervous about the announcement, because while he had committed to going through with the marriage, for the sake of his tribe, it still seemed strange, to him, to be marrying <i>Toph</i>. Though a few days had passed since he, she, and Suki had made their intentions clear to the Bei Fongs (and then Chief Hakoda, later that day), Sokka was still coming to terms with the idea of Toph as a <i>wife</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartly because he was a little confused and flustered over how <i>easily</i> and <i>readily</i> he was able to envision it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Toph's part, while she was excited to the point of being nearly ill at the thought that she would be marrying Sokka, come her fourteenth birthday (a concession the Bei Fongs had made to the sensibilities of the Southern Water Tribe regarding the matter of the bare minimum as far as marriageable ages went), this was not to say that she was <i>showing</i> it. She still had her pride, after all, and she was still reluctant to let people know that she honestly <i>liked</i> Sokka \u2013 though a good few seemed to have guessed as much already, excepting, of course, the lad himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Sokka didn't know about her affections, yet, a very large part of Toph was exceedingly happy at the thought of marrying him. And if a smaller, more confused and repressed part of her was <i>also</i> happy that Suki would be staying in the loop, well, that was a <i>personal </i>matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this excitement also meant anxiety, and Toph was IMMENSELY nervous about telling the whole world that she and Sokka would be getting married. As far as she was concerned, that was as good as telling everyone that she <i>liked</i> the teen, and that was just too much for her poor, gruff little heart to handle. Toph did not handle mushy emotions well. She preferred keeping her soft, chewy center safe and secure behind a hard, crunchy outer shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Toph had a very strong sweet tooth, and she tended to indulge when seriously stressed \u2013 so she was seriously craving some rock candy, right about now)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for Suki?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I will not run away.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a reminder of her duties as a Kyoshi Warrior.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, girls!\" Suki called out to her assembled warriors. \"Listen up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eight of the armed and painted young women stood at attention. They were gathered in a rear courtyard of the Earth Palace, and the sun was nearing its zenith. The preparations for the night's party were well underway, servants and organizers scurrying this way and that as they hurried to meet the fast approaching deadline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Kyoshi Warriors were there to do their part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie Ying, Midori,\" the commander, Suki, snapped out, causing two pretty, black-haired warriors to sharply salute her in the traditional Kyoshi fashion. \"You two will be in charge of keeping rapscallions away from the... <i>ahem</i>... quarters of the Earth King's concubines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls, were they less professional, might have made expressions of disappointment at being assigned such a shift. But as it was, they simply nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kagura, Xin Xing,\" said Suki, turning next to the two youngest warriors. \"You two will be responsible for watching the kitchens and caterers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two looked happy at their assignment, the auburn-haired Kagura especially so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uwaaah...\" Kagura was drooling a little, eyes sparkling gleefully, no doubt envisioning all of the delicious foods that would be prepared and set out for the party guests. \"I wonder how many kinds of rice they will have, yes?\" she all but squealed, doubtless fantasizing about pigging out on the rich, abundant foodstuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki allowed herself the luxury of a scowl as she shot the impulsive young warrior a scolding look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No eating,\" she said, \"Not unless you're on break \u2013 and those have already been scheduled out, so <i>don't even think about pretending to be on break the whole time!</i>\" she said sharply, knowing all too well this one's somewhat gluttonous tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura had the decency to at least look chastised until Suki turned her attention to the next two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ti, Genqian,\" she said addressing the twin warriors with a short nod. \"I assume I can trust the two of you to work with the palace guards to cover any potential points of ingress or egress for uninvited guests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded. The twins were consummate professionals, two of the best in their order, and they were a dangerous pair for any opponent to face. The characters on their matching hair ornaments \u2013 one saying \u8fd1, <i>near</i>, and one saying \u9060, <i>far</i>, indicated their specialization as a tag team, as well as their similar yet contrasting personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Suki addressed the second to last of the warriors present. The girl had dark brown hair, worn loose, though her bangs she pinned up on one side for practicality's sake. Her hazel eyes matched the color of Suki's own, and the commander gave the girl \u2013 her third cousin twice-removed, actually \u2013 a short nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai, I assume you and Ty Lee will be able to handle any drunks or troublemakers that pop up?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded, the motion flowing into a brief but respectful bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"but. Um.\" She frowned. \"Where <i>is</i> Ty Lee?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helping color-coordinate the decorations,\" Suki muttered half sheepishly and half peevishly. She was still a little vexed over how <i>spacey</i> the otherwise talented fighter could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that Ty Lee was no idiot, of course. An idiot would not have the focus or discipline to master a martial art as arcane and esoteric as the former acrobat had, and at such a <i>young age</i>, too. Chi-blocking was by far one of the most obscure and difficult martial disciplines Suki had ever heard of, and yet Ty Lee was a <i>master</i> of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, no. The girl was not an idiot, or a fool. She may have acted bubbly and airheaded much of the time, and she might never have thought things through much further than the immediate, but that did not detract from the fact that she <i>was</i> very intelligent, after her own fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat <i>also</i> did not change the fact that Ty Lee was a most whimsical soul. The girl was a very 'in-the-now' kind of person, and she rarely sweated the details. So there were indeed times where she acted very idiotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she wasn't <i>really</i> an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi \u2013 who had the same name as Suki's mother, actually, and was from her side of the family \u2013 nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's making sure the curtains match the drapes, then?\" said the warrior, a lilting, playful tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLie Ying sniggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said shortly, not being particularly in the mood for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi pouted, a little, at not being able to get a rise from her commander, but she shrugged it off easily enough and said, \"Okay, sure. Yeah, I think we can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Suki, smiling a bit wearily. Though she and Sokka had more or less figured out how things were going to work, there had still been a lot of smaller, though no less important, details to address regarding the future arrangements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike where the wedding would be held, or who would move in with whom, and where would they live? Because Toph would not be able to use her earth sense to see in the South Pole, they were leery of making her move in with Sokka \u2013 and the young tribesman had smacked his forehead in frustration when he realized that he had overlooked such a major detail \u2013 but also if Sokka was to be the next Chief, he couldn't just move into the the Earth Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they had managed to strike a compromise on the living arrangements, such that Toph and Sokka, when they married, would build a house on Whale Tail Island. The isle had traditionally been something of an outpost between the Southern Water Tribe and the Earth Kingdom, and in the past there had even been a large, permanent Water Tribe settlement on the island's southernmost tip. It was solid earth, and Toph would be able to live there without too much trouble, and increasing the Water Tribe presence on the island would certainly do much good for trade with the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had also talked about holding a wedding ceremony on Kyoshi Island, which was, while ethnically more or less Earth Kingdom, politically and economically separate, and technically had been declared its own independent nation by the 48th Earth King in gratitude to Kyoshi for halting the conquest of Chin the Terrible (and the Great, and the Conqueror, and many other epithets besides), but nothing concrete had been decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, while things were certainly looking up, and they had established their terms, there was also still a lot to work out, yet. And it was a lot of work to finagle through the countless little details that they had overlooked in their initial rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Suki was satisfied, though. After what felt like so much drama, it was nice to know that things were being worked out. There was still a lot to do, but for now she felt content with what they had accomplished, she, Sokka, and Toph together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they would stay that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention to the last, and eldest, of the present Kyoshi Warriors, Suki smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tae,\" she said, addressing the slim, ponytailed twenty-three year old. \"You'll be overseeing with me. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded, smiling as softly and demurely and she ever did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be my honor, Commander,\" said she in perfect obeisance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled. She greatly respected the previous commander of the Kyoshi Warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae was a good woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrustworthy. Understanding. <i>Experienced</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was just what Suki needed.</span></div></div>",

As in the Lower Ring, there was plenty of singing and dancing and inappropriate fraternizing, but there were plays as well, theater acts put on by amateur performers, and much music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA handsome, mustachioed young earthbender trailed kisses up the arm of a flushed and giggling waitress possessed of fairly considerable <i>attributes</i>. Both were visibly intoxicated, but nobody interrupted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Upper Ring, the festivities were the most orderly, though this was only relatively so. Even otherwise dignified nobles and government employees gladly cut loose on the day of the Harvest Festival, indulging a good deal in considerable amounts of food and wine and entertainments of all sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA handsome, strapping, seasoned warrior of the Southern Water Tribe gladly showed off his burned arm and various other war wounds and battle scars to anyone who cared to see, boasting loudly and more than a little drunkenly of the prowess of Water Tribe men, such as himself, both on the battlefield <i>and</i> in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is in the Court of the Earth King, in the Palace of Ba Sing Se, that our focus will be placed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka fought the urge to fidget uncomfortably. He was <i>really</i> beginning to see why Toph despised these kinds of high society gatherings. Everyone was so stuffy and boring and <i>fake</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pain in the ass, quite frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes Katara had provided for him were <i>uncomfortable</i> to say the least, and he was forced to stand stock still with a painfully ersatz smile plastered onto his face as he nodded his head at what he figured were appropriate intervals in his current \"companion's\" speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swordsman was bored out of his mind, but he forced himself to at least <i>look</i> like he was paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese rich, high society types seemed to believe themselves at least thrice as interesting as they actually were, judging by the way they could carry on for hours just talking about the most inane details of their personal lives and business deals, and any conversations with them quickly grew<i> very tedious</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example: the young girl who was currently talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clearly the daughter of a nobleman or very well-to-do merchant, judging by the finery of her attire, and she was probably about thirteen years of age under all of that makeup. She had been talking interminably for the past ten minutes, only pausing to titter girlishly or bat her eyelashes at him every twenty seconds or so, and he had yet to hear her say <i>one</i> thing of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painfully obvious attempts at flirting did not help matters, either. Sokka wished he could say that he had no idea why the lass was so interested in him, but that would be a lie. Most probably, the girl's father or mother had put her up to it, perhaps in hopes of marrying her off to him to secure political leverage with one of the heroes of the Hundred Year War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other possibilities, of course, but most of them were not something Sokka wanted to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Not that he was interested in a political marriage, either, of course. Certainly not with someone he didn't even know. And while the girl certainly was cute enough, she was a bit too shallow for his taste. Sokka hadn't even realized he'd <i>cared</i> how shallow a girl was until he'd been forced to listen to this rich wee chit's seemingly interminable giggling and squealing, but there you have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to someone like Suki, this girl just seemed so simple and one-dimensional. She was pretty, he supposed, <i>maybe</i>, but beneath all of that (apparently) stylish makeup was an astonishing <i>dearth </i>of substance. She had no character, and most likely no real life experience outside the Middle Ring of Ba Sing Se, if even that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Sokka was engaged to Toph, anyways. And continuing a relationship with Suki, too, though that part was supposed to stay secret. Apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcement of his and Toph's engagement hadn't been made yet, however, and it would most likely still be a <i>number</i> of hours yet before it finally <i>was</i> made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo until then, Sokka would just have to grit his teeth and bare it. He didn't want to be rude, after all \u2013 he wanted to make a good impression of himself before the Earth Kingdom elite, or least do his best to <i>not</i> look like a complete buffoon. And so, not knowing the polite way to turn this lass away, he simply had to endure her company the best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if nothing else, she at least made a good shield with which to deflect other, less <i>tolerable</i> sorts from trying to engage him in conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause shallow or not, inane or not, at least she was pretty. That alone wasn't enough for much, but it at least made it relatively easier to suffer through the conversation. That she was very bubbly, and apparently an early bloomer, too, also made it easy for Sokka to nod along as she talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, <i>yeah</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014so then, Ming said, 'Aww, but I think poodle-monkeys are <i>adorable</i>,' but Ling told her, 'Of course not, dear, it's all about <i>rabbaroos</i>, this season.' And then Jing said, 'But I'm <i>allergic</i> to rabbaroos!' And then Ming \u2013 if you can believe it \u2013 turned around and told her to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing his mind to wander, Sokka idly wondered what Toph and Suki and the others were up to while he was standing here dying of boredom and sore feet.</span></div></div>",

No matter what you called it \u2013 be it a banquet, a gala, a ball, or <i>whatever</i> \u2013 she simply <i>loathed</i> them. They were boring, inane, pointless, boring, stuffy, banal, and worst of all <i>boring</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, there was the particular kind of people of who tended to gather at those sorts of parties, the schmoozers and snobs and ass-kissers and poseurs. Nobles. Courtiers. Rich folk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were the worst sorts of people, in Toph Bei Fong's opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe absolute <i>worst</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that his majesty? The prince of the Southern Water Tribe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I think it is. Ah! He is <i>gorgeous!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, isn't he <i>just?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph scowled intensely, dressed in fine, exquisite silk and made up in that subtly pretentious, yet undeniably <i>elegant </i>way that only a high and wealthy noble's daughter could manage. She did not at all like being so gussied up, and she liked listening to how these <i>trollops</i> fawned over Sokka even less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so shallow. All they talked about was how <i>handsome</i> he looked, saying nonsense and tittering about how Earth Kingdom dress suited him <i>so well</i>. It was sickening, how these women went on and on about such stupid things like that, and Toph dearly wished she could go elsewhere in the party and hang out with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept this was her <i>debut</i> as the Bei Fong heiress, and so she could not do anything like that, <i>no</i>. She had to make connections with the other noble daughters and women, had to stay out of the way until it was her time to come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear he once dueled the Fire Lord to a standstill,\" Toph heard one of the younger women say to a friend of similar age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean the new Fire Lord?\" said the girl's friend. \"Or the old one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it really <i>matter?</i>\" said the first one. \"He did it, and that's enough for me.\" She tittered girlishly, and Toph had to resist the urge to gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's funny,\" came another voice, dry and sarcastic and <i>wonderfully familiar</i> among all these shallow poseurs. \"The way I hear it, Zuko wiped the floor with him until the last spar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph felt the first two girls stiffen up, and they immediately went silent. Not that many would have blamed them for doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot when they had just been interrupted by the girlfriend of the Fire Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could not help the grin that came onto her face as the two girls quickly scurried away from Mai, no doubt intimidated by the young woman's quietly threatening demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said, addressing the surprisingly unarmed consort of Fire Lord Zuko. \"Those two were driving me <i>crazy</i> with their stupid gossip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sort tends to,\" said Mai laconically, dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"Can you believe how they were going on about Sokka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean <i>Prince</i> Sokka?\" said Mai dryly, and Toph detected a note of humor in the girl's voice. She supposed that the young woman still viewed Sokka somewhat as a <i>peasant</i>, and not anyone particularly <i>important</i> in the grand scheme of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose so,\" she chortled in a rather unmaidenly manner, but her words were not as joking as she perhaps tried to make them sound. \"He <i>is</i> a prince, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could feel Mai's head tilt ever-so-slightly to one side, and she perceived the faintest quirking of an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he was Water Tribe, though,\" remarked Mai idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being Water Tribe isn't exclusive with being royalty,\" replied Toph casually, echoing Katara's words from that conversation by the koi pond. \"And he <i>is</i> basically the next-in-line to become chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she almost thought that she could make out the crease of a small smile on Mai's face. But it was gone before she could be sure \u2013 if it had even been there to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Mai, and there was a world of meaning in that one, single word. So much nuance conveyed in a mere two syllables, that almost Toph marveled at how so many diverse thoughts and emotions could be invoked by a lone, solitary utterance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's grin widened, though, as she pinned down the heart of Mai's meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she murmured, smiling. \"<i>Maybe</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you can say he is a prince, then I suppose he's as good as royalty already.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Mai had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was, in a way, Toph's Prince Charming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i>oh</i>, but she only just <i>now</i> realized how <i>cheesy</i> that sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...though that still didn't make it any less true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

General How and General Sung were singing a dreadfully off-key duet of <i>Four Seasons</i>, while Chang, Lee, and Bai-Guan guffawed uproariously over some account or other of their troops' assorted petty misdeeds and misadventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth King himself was accompanied by an attractive, but faintly menacing woman with jet black hair and very pale skin, who was cozying up most shamelessly to the young monarch. Off to the side, a shirshu was lounging against a tall, intricately carved pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fire Lord, for his part, was sitting between his girlfriend and his uncle, quietly sipping at a cup of tea. Iroh, next to Zuko, had a pinkish flush to his face, and was chortling in amusement as he listened to an anecdote from his fellow White Lotus, Piandao. Mai, herself, was doing a very good job of maintaining an uninterested facade as she listened to Ty Lee talking about her adventures with the Kyoshi Warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang and Katara were still dancing, though the music had long since stopped, playing, smiling warmly at one another and staring each so intently into the eyes of the other. Momo was flying through the air, doing loop-de-loops and flips and barrel rolls to the amusement and delight of several partygoers, many of whom offered bits of fruit to the lemur, who gladly accepted their sweet, juicy tribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, commander of the Kyoshi Warriors, was sitting and talking with Sokka and Toph, the latter of whom was looking just the tiniest bit tipsy from the small cup of baijiu she had been nursing for the last ten minutes.

It's, like, to do with sunburns, right? I don't know about color, but my skin is kinda sensitive to sunlight,\" she explained. \"I get sunburned pretty easy, honestly.

Maybe it was the fumes of alcohol so heavy in the air, or maybe it was a product of certain proclivities born of old Kyoshi Warrior traditions, or maybe it was merely some manner of repressed emotions simply reaching the boiling point and bursting through her inhibitions, but Suki found herself smiling as she scooted closer to the earthbender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure do,\" she cheerfully remarked, a faint pink tinge to her cheeks as she casually wrapped an arm around Toph's waist. The metalbender was momentarily startled by this, but she shook it off after a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her cheeks were a still a touch redder than they had been before Suki initiated that contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're warm,\" Toph faintly heard herself mumble, leaning a little bit into Suki. \"So soft, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kyoshi Warrior smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a few years,\" Suki said, smiling at the way Toph blearily nuzzled her head into her bosom, \"and I'm sure that <i>you</i> will be just as soft, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph blushed, appearing to get pretty quickly the gist of what Suki was saying.

She tilted her face upwards, as though she were looking up at Suki, and the warrior was a little breathless at how eerily beautiful Toph's eyes appeared in that moment, glassy and clouded. Like the eyes of a ghost, they seemed, strange yet fair in a sort of ethereal, otherworldly way. \"Isn't it great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" said Suki, lost in Toph's eyes, not hearing really what the younger girl was saying. \"You have the most <i>beautiful</i> eyes, Toph,\" she said, and at that moment she realized that maybe the juice Tae had given her had <i>not </i>been nonalcoholic, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earthbender's blush deepened, and idly she became aware that she had wrapped her arms around Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could say the same for you,\" she said, half-joking, half-wistful. The baijiu had burned going down her throat, even just the small amount she had drunk, but now it felt so pleasantly warm and tingly in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki snorted, laughing gracelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she giggled, smiling more widely. \"But Sokka tells me they're gorgeous, if that helps any,\" she said softly, leaning down so that her face was closer to Toph's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind young girl could feel Suki's breath against her face, warm and humid and smelling faintly of some undecipherable mix of fruits and berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish he'd tell me that <i>my</i> eyes were gorgeous...\" Toph heard herself mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him time,\" Suki said warmly. \"I'm sure he'll be cooing over you, before long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's blush had deepened so much by this point that it was almost a wonder how her face could possibly get any redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you think so...?\" she wondered, sounding uncharacteristically nervous and anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki planted a kiss on Toph's lips. It was soft, warm, sweet, and enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>know</i> so,\" she said, breaking the contact between their lips after a few wonderful seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph felt her body kinda turn to jelly, except it was in the best way she could possibly imagine, and she let herself melt into Suki's side. She was smiling softly, happily bemused by this sudden, strange feeling in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one reason that nobody was present to see this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShow the reason?

The air sang with the sound of hard keen steel, light dancing off of blades in a deadly play of motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDao against jian. Two swords against one. Fire against Water. Ivory against ebony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a graceful dance, this combat, this spar, this staged real duel. Across the floor, they moved swift and fluid, sharp and deadly. Like wild beasts, graceful cats; swift, agile leolope, or powerful, lithe tigerdillo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey leaped, they sprang, darting and diving, bobbing and weaving. They were evenly matched, or so it should seem, ever moving, ever dancing, ever seeking an opening through which to slip their steel. Nimble, they were, skillful performers, or so it appeared. The advantage never went to either for more than a moment, always going back and forth like the movement of the tides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPush and pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike leaping flame, their movements were swift and unpredictable, yet graceful also. Well determined was every step, every stroke, never more or less than needed to be done. Deliberate, they were, in the way of martial violence, every swing and thrust and parry and feint carefully calculated to bring them that much closer to deciding the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight as air were their steps, toes skipping across the ground in a quick, lethal course. Neither could touch upon the other, their bodies always moving out of the way, seeming as impossible to pin as a flickering flame. Yet sturdy were their stances, solid their roots, immovable when they did not desire to be moved. And they flowed together, and apart, and as one, a motion circular and linear and indefinable at once, ever moving, never stopping, graceful and fluid and gradually each wearing down the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA longsword straight, and double-edged \u2013 a stately jian all in black. Twin dao, flashing silver, two members moving as part of a whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dance of blades, this play of light and sound and fighting spirit, was a marvelous thing, a spectacle sublime and incomparable among all of the Festival's entertainments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this was scarce an act. These were no performers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we fighting, again?\" asked Sokka, the edge of Space Sword scraping along the flat of Zuko's left-hand dao, sparks flying up as the Fire Lord deflected the slicing blade away from his body. \"I just came over here to get some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko sighed, shaking his head just a little as he moved his right-hand dao across in an arc, sweeping through the air. But Sokka's longer sword had him kept just outside of striking distance, and the stroke was for naught, save only perhaps to make Sokka pull back just a little, and draw Space Sword up in defense against any other oncoming attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who challenged me,\" he said. \"Did you already forget, Sokka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other teen shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My memory <i>might</i> be a little hazy,\" Sokka conceded. \"That wine was a bit stronger than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a step forward, thrusting towards Zuko's breast. But the Fire Lord sidestepped, and moved in forward, guarding his flank with one blade while he brought the other up to slash across Sokka's face\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say,\" Zuko remarked casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014if not for the young tribesman leaning back at just the right moment to avoid getting cut, his sword moving in harmony with his body as he batted aside Zuko's right-hand dao. Space Sword was inside Zuko's guard, now, and he thrust it forward\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Sokka. \"I'm not sure I'm even completely sober at this moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014except then Zuko brought his left-hand blade up, bringing the right-hand one back in as well to catch Space Sword in a scissor-block, pushing the blade's trajectory up harmlessly over his shoulder, before closing in and slipping his twin dao down\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That strikes me as being <i>incredibly</i> irresponsible,\" Zuko responded, frowning a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014only for Sokka to twist his sword out of the lock, and then twist his body out of the way, swiftly and fluidly circling around Zuko, pivoting on his heels as he swung his jian in an arc at Zuko's back\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'd say I'm doing well enough for myself, all things considered,\" replied Sokka dismissively. \"Wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014but Zuko was not immobile, and he ducked aside, his dao describing a deceptive path through the air as he brought them around to strike at Sokka's unguarded flank\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's careless,\" the Fire Lord grunted. \"And you'll get hurt doing something that stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014yet there was a flash of black, Sokka pivoting and twirling at a nearly impossible angle to bring Space Sword around, catching Zuko's edges on its flat. The momentum, he used to push the blades up uselessly over Zuko's head, before twisting his arms and bringing the obsidian-colored blade of his own sword down\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Sokka with a smirk, \"But it looks like it's a match set n\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014only for Zuko to expel fire from his mouth, forcing Sokka to instinctively jerk his arms and body back to keep from getting burned. The gout of red and gold stopped just inches from his face after he skipped back, and the heat of it caused beads of sweat to form on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the flames dissipated a moment later, and the two duelists became aware of the stunned onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014nnnow look at that!\" said Sokka, looking much too pleased with himself considering how close he had just come to getting his eyebrows burned off. \"I <i>told</i> you I could force you to firebend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko, looking rather like his body had only just all at once realized what a vigorous exercise it had been going through, as though the fatigue had only now caught up with the rest of him, smiled weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did,\" he managed to pant out, shoulders heaving and sweat running down his brow. \"That was a very good match. You've come a <i>long </i>way since the last time we sparred. Sifu Piandao has taught you well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in the air seemed to lessen, the observers relaxing once more when they saw no hostility between the two. And already murmurs were beginning to pass back and forth about the possible past between the Fire Lord and Prince Sokka. Some whispered of rivalry between fellow students, others of forbidden love between the leaders-to-be of two enemy nations, and even others still of an illicit tryst between them and everyone else that either one knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the word carried nonetheless that the prince of the Southern Water Tribe had matched the Fire Lord in a spar, in a duel, in a\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a <i>great</i> Swordbending Kai!\" Sokka declared happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko would have face-palmed, if not for the swords in either hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<i>Swordbending Kai</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had a certain ring to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As a story draws to its close, it is natural, and <i>expected</i>, for its author to tie up loose ends, and find some way to give an emotionally satisfying conclusion to their tale. As important as it is to know how to start a story, so too is it crucial to know how to end it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are, of course, many ways to go about this. There is much to be said for thematic continuity, and moral lessons, and even just the visceral thrill of a successful climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising action leads to the point of highest tension and emotion, the literary orgasm, and following that is the falling action, the denouement, leading inevitably to THE END. This is the most fundamental, basic structure of story telling, in its simplest form. It is all about emotion, the thoughts and feelings of the author being conveyed to the reader, being impressed upon their hearts. You must make the reader feel what you feel, what you<i> want</i> them to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many ways to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI, for one, prefer meaningless spectacle and pizzazz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike so:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeat was important, in the Water Tribes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeat is food. Meat is sustenance. Meat is fuel and strength and heart and soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo slay a mighty beast, to consume its flesh, to take a portion of its lingering essence, its life force, into yourself. That is the tradition of a Water Tribe hunter, a Water Tribe brave. The icy poles support all but naught, in the way of vegetation. What few manners of plant life can be harvested for sustenance, must come from the icy waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeaweed. Sea prunes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are the chief types of edible vegetation to be found in the North and South Poles. And they come from the sea, from the frigid, chilling waters. Because of this, they are rarities, delicacies. Harvesting such things is no easy task, when to dive into the waters is to face all but certain death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo meat, the flesh of beasts, was and is the primary food source for the Water Tribes. Produce, grains, vegetables and fruits are novelties, to Water Tribe men, and they are appropriately relished as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut meat is a <i>staple</i>. Meat is the foundation of a warrior's diet, a Water Tribesman's diet. A meal without meat is, to a person of the Water Tribes, scarcely a meal at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo naturally, a man of the South as hearty and strapping as the White Wolf, Hakoda son of Amaguq the Clever, would gravitate towards the section of the banquet where a veritable cornucopia of brazed and grilled and roasted meats were heavily laden on great ceramic plates. Like his son after him, and his father before him, Hakoda was a strong and cunning man of great appetite and vitality. Such a vast plethora of generous assorted helpings of beast-flesh would of course draw his notice, and whet his appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat there was no other person sitting at this particular end of this particular table did not bother or perturb him. He simply looked at it and said, \"All the more for me!\" to himself with a hearty chortle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was he <i>really</i> alone?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now, it should be noted that such a great feast of meats as were laden there before Hakoda would be <i>incredibly</i> costly to arrange. Fresh meat came at a premium, in Ba Sing Se, and such a carnal banquet as this would be no small expense, even for the Earth King himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then, Kuei <i>rarely</i> spared any expense when it came to Bosco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it <i>was</i>, in truth, chiefly for the Fifty-Second Earth King's most beloved pet and trusted ursine companion that this buffet was laid out. This was the main reason there were so few people in this area of the banquet. While Bosco was still quite tame, around its owner and master, the great, brown bear had, during the weeks of traveling incognito throughout the countryside along the then-deposed Earth King, relearned <i>much</i> of what once had been lost in its nurturing and domestication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had, when Kuei was first reinstated, been a few attempts on his life by various extremist groups, but every assassination had been thwarted \u2013 and quite <i>messily</i>, at that \u2013 by Bosco. For the hardships of the road had reawakened in the mighty beast the instincts of its ancestors, of the proud and terrible <i>bruin</i>, and Bosco was harder, now, fiercer and more savage when provoked to anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a bear as well-fed as Bosco tended to be <i>very</i> protective of its food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda eagerly piled meats onto his plate, steaks and sausages and briskets so tender, so juicy and mouthwatering and perfectly seasoned that they melted on your tongue, and the smell of them was enough to make his stomach rumble. His mouth was watering, a little, as he tore hungrily into the food with as much abandon as his son or father would have shown when faced with such a glorious buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as the Tribal Chief of the South Pole eagerly devoured a thick, meaty drumstick, Bosco began also to feast, tearing greedily into the savory meats laid out before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two made quite the sight, feeding more like a pair of wild beasts than the leader of a nation and the pampered pet of the leader of another, much <i>bigger</i> nation. Many partygoers could not help but stop and gawk in morbid fascination, beholding the frightful spectacle of Hakoda and Bosco ravenously assaulting the table so heavily laden with the flesh of so many beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of them, the meat was quickly devoured, a grotesque carnival of the rapacious appetites of man and beast alike. Soon, their gazes met, and they found, both of them, that there was but a single steak left on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a testament, perhaps, to the fearlessness of Water Tribe men, or else simply the borderline <i>foolhardy</i> love of meat in Sokka and his forefathers that, when Bosco made the move to snatch up the steak, Hakoda <i>immediately</i> tackled the eight hundred pound mass of teeth, claws, and brute animal strength straight to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was, at once, perhaps both the most farcical, and the most <i>epic</i>, showdown to <i>go</i> down in the court of the Earth King since the day that Avatar Kyoshi caused the rule against the serving of alcohol to the Avatar to be put in place within the city limits of Ba Sing Se. Hakoda wrestled with Bosco, and Bosco wrestled with Hakoda. It was the fight of the century (excluding maybe, y'know, Aang versus Ozai): man versus beast, nature versus civilization, predator versus predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda slammed Bosco through a table, only for Bosco to roll over, swiping a large meaty paw at Hakoda's flank, smashing him into the floor. Hakoda grabbed Bosco's foreleg, recovering to flip the bear onto its back. Except Bosco pinned Hakoda's arm between his two great paws, and threw the hunter down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlow after blow was exchanged, the pair grappling and wrestling unceasingly, determinedly. Bosco and Hakoda fought fiercely for the last piece of meat, clawing and hammering and biting and beating at one another's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A grudge over food runs deeper than the ocean</i>,\" as they say in the Water Tribes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they fought, seemingly without end, a spectacle of the terrible strength of the ursine race, and the indomitable ferocity of the Swerting warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda drove Bosco headfirst into a pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosco threw Hakoda against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda smashed a chair over Bosco's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosco bit down on Hakoda's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack and forth, on and on, the two went, and went. They fought tirelessly, driven by the desire for the last piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party descended into chaos as the pair went this way and that across the ballroom floor. Courtiers and nobles scattered before the dreadful, thunderous rumor of this warring duo's approach. Furniture was broken, bottles were shattered, and trousers were soiled as Bosco and Hakoda fought their way throughout the party, leaving scarcely so much as a single table unturned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, at last, they came to a stop, bloodied and beaten and exhausted. Neither had secured a victory. Their fight had been a draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(...although Hakoda was probably in<i> slightly</i> worse shape.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... heh...\" the Chief of the Southern Water Tribe panted, sweat mixing with blood as both trickled down his face and arms. \"You... are a worthy opponent...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoulders were rising and falling with the effort of every labored, weary breath, and yet Hakoda had a look of strange satisfaction on his face, a grimly fierce smile upturning the corners of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosco, fur mussed and grizzled, shirt torn and tattered, and funny green hat nowhere to be seen, lowed softly in what might have been something like agreement, growling contentedly, if that really made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked like nothing so much as hotblooded rivals in a sh\u014dnen fighting manga, perhaps, tired and battered after a long, multi-chapter duel. There was a sense of respect in their eyes, now, as they surveyed one another, a glimmer of the sort of camaraderie which could only be established between hotblooded men by beating each other into a pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda grinned. So would have Bosco, had the pampered brown bear a real understanding of human facial expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, that was when Sokka showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dad,\" said the teen with his mouth full, carrying what looked to be a half-eaten steak on a plate between his hands. \"What'cha doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda and Bosco's eyes widened as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey <i>recognized </i>that steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at one another. Wordless understanding passed between them in a single glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they pounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka <i>may</i> or <i>may not</i> have screamed like a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

The Kyoshi Warriors, their friends, the fire lord with his girlfriend, Foggy Swamp water bender, even the boulder was there.  He may or may not have been crying into a hanky.  Toph stood in a long green skirt that went to just above the ankles and had a cut up the left side.  Her blouse was a light yellow with green seems and trim as well as collar.  The blouse had quarter long sleeve and room for the new 15 year old bosom.  Toph wore a pair of hair loopies that were customary for water tribe brides that joined her bun in the back.  She smiled as she felt the steps with her feet and said to Sokka, \"I really hope that we make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said with his usual grin that now also had a moustache, \"After a three year engagement and growing to love you more than just a friend.  I guarantee that we'll make it, even if I have to carry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Earth Kingdom custom that at 15 you were capable of being married.  Sokka was 18 now and for him marriage should have happened 3 years ago as Southern Water Tribe customs saw 15 being an age of too late to get married.  Water tribe men were often married at 12 to 15, and women married at 13 to 16.  Sexual relationships between the two remained private, but usually happened when they turned 16 or 17.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA priest stood at the bottom with the two as he said to them, \"This climb of 20 steps represents the climb of marriage.  That the longer it is, the harder it gets to climb it.  But, when you do climb it the road will be flat a while longer.  That you must work together to climb the steps of marriage as you climb these wedding steps.  So, with that said, please climb to the top and be married if the spirits will it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair began to climb the steps helping each other, each step became taller and a bit more worn.  Sokka used his untied hand to offer her a step up.  When they came to the 19 step is was like a wall.  Toph earth bent a ladder for them to climb side by side.  They reached the twentieth step which was barely an elevation off the ground.  The pair stood in front of a priest as they stepped the last step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest then said to the pair, \"Now, that you have climbed the last step, please show your commitment to each other in front of the spirits with a kiss.  Then join together in the temple behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two reached in as Toph felt his fuzzy moustache and kissed her husband. She loved this.</span></div></div>",

Moving it with the handle bars the pulleys moved the belts on the wheels.  The pulleys were connected to a small container in front of the chair supported by metal bars by the arms of the wheel chair.  Filling the container with water the water wheel inside turned from the flowing as the crank it was on pushed pulled the pulley on the outside.  The pulley pulled the chord as the wheels went forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka wiped the sweat off his brow as he said to Suki who was standing at the door of the barn, \"It's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled as she said to him, \"She'll be thrilled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the barn an little girl was leaping as she earth bent a ramp at her mother.  It was little Lin practicing with her mother as Toph sent out an earth shard at the ramp cutting it down.  Sokka then said as he saw the wooden face broken to his bull hog pen, \"HEY!  I JUST GOT DONE REBUILDING THAT FENCE?  CAN'T YOU AT LEAST CORAL THE BULL HOGS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph then said to Lin, \"Alright, you heard your father, let's go get the animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a regular wheel chair was a little girl with tanned skin like her father and black hair like her mother.  Her eyes the piercing blue of her father's and her hair done up in a tail with side bang tails as well as four hair loopies two on each side.  She sat in the wheel chain depressed as she water bent a puddle up and down with the pillar in the middle plummeting the drops.  She hated depending on someone to push her chair or to push her own chair without being able to water bend for fun. She was only 7 years old and discovered about a year ago that she was a water bender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her with a grin, \"Soph, how's my little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoph replied to him, \"Not having fun with mom and sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \"Well, with this you'll out run them for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka rolled out the new wheel chair as he picked her up with a tickle making her laugh. He placed her into the chair and tied the rope around her waist.  He then said to her pointing at the container, \"Inside there, is water and using your bending you can make the water turn.  Do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoph looked at the water and moved one hand like one would do the worm. The chair began to move forward as she gasped and smiled with happiness. Sokka then said to her pointing at the small wheels at the bottom of the chair, \"And those wheels had a small container on them with water inside them to allow you to turn the wheels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoph used her other hand to swish the chain to the left in a full circle.  She squealed as she moved her arms out and said to him, \"Daddy this is the best chair ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went in and the father and daughter hugged as they both smiled.  Suki saw how great of a father Sokka was and couldn't wait to tell him the good news.  But, of course Toph would also like the news. As the three had a special relationship and Toph was already a mother of two.  Maybe Toph would like this news too. But, dinner first.</span></div></div>",

The cloths were dyed blue with a white collar and white cuffs at the ends of the sleeves of both pants and jacket.  He had a right breast pocket with two medals under it.  He stood there with his hair down attracting all sorts of women to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was beside him wearing a green dress that was a formal gown dress.  It was sleeveless with a heart shaped pendant around her neck made of sterling silver.  She wore the space stone bracelet in a very beautiful bracelet with flying boars and coyote wolves.  She had on make-up that made her feel pretty.  She could feel the blood rushing to Sokka's cheeks when she first walked in front of him in her formal gown.  She knew that blood rushed up to the cheeks when people blushed.  After all that's what happens to her when she blushes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was announced as he stood at the top of stair with Toph, \"Introducing Captain of the Southern Water Tribe Hunters <u><span class=\"clteal\">(army/navy)</span></u> Corps and Prince of the Southern Water Tribe, Sokka son of Hakoda Chief of the Water Tribe.  And with him daughter to Loa and Poppy Bei Fong, Toph Bei Fong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked down the stairs as Toph walked down the stone steps she earth bent her path flat.  She did not care for steps, they were a trick to her feet.  Plus with these damn green wool stockings that her mother insisted on wearing were confusing enough already.  This must have been what they when they say pulling the wool over your eyes.   She wore beautiful wool stocking that were padded at the soles to look like a new pair of fancy shoes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka took her hand as she and he danced with some difficulty.  It had been a year since she'd dance last and that was when she wasn't wearing stockings.  She decied to put her fate into Sokka' s hands  As the two were dancing Sokka then said to her, \"Uh, you're very beautiful tonight.  Like the moon set on a clear morning at sea.  With the ocean spray upon the air the eyes to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph blushed deeper as she lowered her head.  Sokka and her danced as they then came to a halt after the music stopped.  Sokka, then let go of her hands as he bowed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snob earth kingdom noble then said to his wife, \u201cCan you believe that?  A savage called the 'prince' of the water tribe?  And did you see him trying to dance?  It was pathetic, but I must say it was amusing to watch him make a buffoon of himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph did not like how this man was making fun of <i>her fianc\u00e9</i>.  Sokka then said to throwing his arms down, \u201cHEY!  I MAY NOT KNOW YOUR DANCE BY HEART!  But, I'll tell you what I do know.  How to dance with style, the dance only a hunter would do at the defeat of the enemy, of the kill and of the day won by the hunters.  <span class=\"clteal\"><b>The Dance of the Hunt!</b></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka began to rotate his fists near each other having one go in front of the other.  He then began to kick his feet as he was dancing a weird dance.  He turned around as he danced and hopped into the air kicking his heels.  Landing he began to dance again as he stomped and swung out his arms.  Swinging them out wildly he clapped every 15 seconds as the other tribesmen began to do the same dance.  Sokka along with the as if on cue began the dance all over again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph then heard the man say, \u201cNo, Earth Kingdom man or woman would be caught dead doing that stupid bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph earth bent her stockings off as her mother's gasp.  The earth cut the lower half of the formal gown's skirt off as she then began to follow Sokka.  Sokka grinned at her as he danced over to her with a bopping of his head.  The two bumped fists as they began the dance over again only they looked and faced one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae and Suki stood guard as the latter began to chuckle.  Tae then asked, \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then said to her 23 year old companion, \u201cThey are dancing the dance of the hunt.  The most honorable dance that a hunter or warrior can do in the Southern Water Tribe.  Only those who have honor by killing an animal or defeating a problem to the Tribe are allowed to dance it.  And I am proud of both of them.\u201d</span></div></div>",

His breath hitching, he began to stroke up and down his length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned a little, allowing himself to melt just a little into the pleasure as he masturbated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe imagined that it was not his hand on his member, but Mai's, and that she was looking up at him with one of those rare smiles curving her cute, kissable lips. He envisioned her golden eyes gleaming with desire as she worked him on to greater heights of pleasure, maybe licking her lips a little as she saw a bit of precum begin to leak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko groaned, jerking himself off as he imagined his girlfriend doing a little striptease for him -- and maybe one of Ty Lee's sisters joined her, too, pressing their sizable tits against Mai's own modest, shapely bosom, putting on a show for their Fire Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, this was better, he thought. This was familiar ground, this was something he could deal with, something that didn't confuse him so profoundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet even as Zuko thought that, the contents of his mental image changed. It wasn't anything too noticeable, at first, aside from the fact that the hand stroking his cock was like his own, except brown, darkly skinned.

He shot a large wad of semen into the washcloth, his penis twitching and shivering in the moment of orgasm as it expelled his load. Then it softened, and as it did so Zuko perceived that his legs also felt soft, weak, and he sat himself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin was red and hot and slicked with sweat. He was trembling and panting, his heart racing and his mind frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for taking his mind off of Sokka, Zuko could not help but muse with a sigh.

He devoured the Fire Lord's mouth, kissing him deeply, passionately, longingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko welcomed the kiss happily, not resisting in the slightest as Sokka used his tongue to do some of the most incredible things to Zuko's mouth that the Fire Lord had ever experienced. He moaned into the warrior's kiss, and as he did so, the younger man brought his hand down to the Zuko's groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko gasped when he felt Sokka's cool, firm fingers curl around his shaft, expertly teasing and stimulating it with the practiced ease of someone who had lived to fifteen years of age without so much as a single other non-sibling person his age.

Zuko felt Sokka's manhood rub up against his own, and he came all over Sokka's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's huge...\" he murmured weakly, shakily, reluctantly pulling away from the wonderful kiss to marvel at the size of his friend. He stared in something like awed disbelief at the intimidatingly pulsing veins which ran up and down the considerable lent of Sokka's honestly massive penis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko felt a little embarrassed, comparing the size of Sokka's dick to his own. Even though he was still hard, remarkably, and even though he <i>knew</i> that he himself was rather quite well-endowed for his age and size, Zuko felt almost <i>tiny</i> next to Sokka's massive cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden, the first place his mind went was <i>How will I ever fit that inside me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko blushed even deeper, if that were possible, and he was panting and sweating. Feeling hot, uncomfortably hot, he weakly, shakily removed his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty big, yourself,\" Zuko belatedly heard Sokka remark, and the Fire Lord felt equal parts embarrassed and excited by this remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, softly shaking his head, Zuko looked up into Sokka's eyes. And when he met the tribesman's gaze, he knew immediately what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor better or worse, he realized, Sokka was, if not in love with him, then at least desiring of his touch, and longing for him. Perhaps it was nothing deeper or more meaningful than simple lust, but Zuko supposed that this was all they needed. If Sokka only lusted for his body, then Zuko supposed he could at least pretend, could at least tell himself, that it was the same way for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had to, he could tell himself that lust was the only thing he felt for Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it would be a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, looking at Sokka's member, Zuko decided that he wanted to repay his friend for making him feel this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how?</span></div></div>",

Blushing fiercely, he glanced back over his shoulder at the young warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw, with a blush, that Sokka was eyeing his rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips feeling suddenly very dry, Zuko forced from his mouth the words he so dearly wanted to say but also so greatly feared speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" he told Sokka softly, his voice a little weak and raspy. He bent forward a little, spread his legs the slightest bit, pushed his ass back the tiniest amount. \"I... I'll let you... if you want to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was blushing deeply, he knew, and he turned his gaze forward, unable to meet Sokka's eyes for any longer than he already had. He focused intently on a spot on the wall, biting his lip nervously as the seconds seemed to stretch out over hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was nervous with anticipation, uncertain what Sokka would do, but silently hoping he did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seconds seemed to stretch out into eons as he awaited Sokka's response. But at last it came, and Zuko gasped when he felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned a little, feeling Sokka's hardness pressing between his buttocks, feeling Sokka kneading and spreading his cheeks. His cock throbbed and ached painfully as Sokka slowly began to inch the vast girth of his manhood, inch by painful, torturous, <i>wonderful</i> inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...!\" he gasped, feeling both pain and pleasure from what Sokka was doing to him, nibbling on his ears and stroking his member as he teasingly, carefully inched his manhood into the Fire Lord. \"It...it hurts...\" he whimpered a little, biting his lip again, hissing through his teeth as he felt the walls of his anus stretch far beyond how they were intended to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to stop?\" he heard Sokka ask, but his voice seemed faint, as though coming to him from across an unfathomable gulf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...\" Zuko managed to murmur, shivering a little as Sokka licked his neck. \"It... it feels good, too. It just... hurts a little, at first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned, feeling a bit of precum leak from the tip of his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt Sokka smile into his neck, biting and sucking on his skin in such a sublimely titillating manner. Then he felt Sokka begin to pick up the tempo, beginning to thrust in and out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko lost it, at that point. Just a little bit, but still he lost it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned loudly, uncaring of who heard. He felt wonderful as Sokka fucked him, wonderful in a way that was equal, yet  also separate, to how he felt when he made love to Mai. Because, it seemed, Zuko loved his friend every bit as much as he loved his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsently, with a strange sort of detachment as pleasure flooded his body, Zuko wondered if this was how it felt for Mai, when they did this kind of thing. He could see why she liked it so much, if it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cry, Zuko came, pushed past the point of orgasm by Sokka's ministrations, and by the feeling of Sokka's manhood inside of him. And Sokka matched his cry with one of his own, and Zuko felt the tribesman's body shudder as Sokka came in unto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boneless, exhausted, they fell in a heap of tangled limbs to the bathroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrained, basking in the afterglow of orgasm, Zuko said something he never would have said otherwise, something which only the ecstasy of intercourse could have emboldened him to say to his friend, to Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sokka hearing this, simply smirked and gave Zuko a surprisingly soft, sweet kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

She had been the future, the hope of their tribe (she still was, in truth), and Gran-Gran and the other women had always favored Katara just a little bit over himself. They had kept her safe, ignorant, of just how desperate, seemingly hopeless their tribe's situation really was. They had encouraged her to play with water, to waste hours splashing around with her bending, talking about reclaiming their culture and rebuilding their tribe and ensuring the future of the South Pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara had never truly realized it, how often and close they had come to starvation, to being finally wiped out. Sokka had just been a boy when the men left for war \u2013 he had been only a child, really \u2013 yet still he had borne on his shoulders the burden of safeguarding the tribe, of providing for it. An inordinately heavy burden to place on one so young as he had been, but he had not complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot when it mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how much he had so often wanted to snap at Katara whenever she went into one of her tirades, how much he had so often wanted to grab her by her hair-loopies and shove her face-first into reality, he had nonetheless endured as best he could for the sake of the tribe, had thrown himself mind and body and soul into hunting and fishing and training. He had only been able to get so good, so strong without older, more experienced warriors there to train and guide him in the martial arts and traditions of their people, but he had made it <i>work</i>, he had made it suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had been hard, but he had done his best to ensure the survival of his tribe. He had been forced to grow up before his time, in a way, been forced to sacrifice his childhood for the sake of his tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men of the tribe left for war shortly after the death of his and Katara's mother, ten years before they met Aang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's friends, even those who knew the details of his and Katara's childhood, never seemed to stop and consider just what it all meant. Certainly, if they realized how small and young and <i>afraid</i> Sokka had been when the men had left, when circumstance had forced him to hunt and fight and provide for the tribe as best he could by himself, they did not show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Katara didn't realize how dire things had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sokka did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that the men had had no hopes of ever returning alive, had had no illusions that Sokka would be able to provide for an entire tribe by himself, even with the women and elderly pitching in where they could. It had been, for all intents and purposes, a suicide mission, intended as one last hurrah for the Southern Water Tribe. Better to go down fighting to the last man, than to slowly dwindle and diminish, cowering in the frozen wastes of their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still it had been the duty of the women to do what they could to ensure that there would still be a home for the men, even if they never returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Katara never wonder why there were no other children their age in the tribe? She might not have remembered it, and Sokka never brought it up, but it had not always been that way. Did she never wonder, how someone so small and young as Sokka had been, back then, could have managed to keep food on the table, or why, aside from themselves and Gran-Gran, the only surviving members of the tribe, by the time they finally met Aang, had been a few mothers with young children?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanna had not been the only elder, when the men left for war. Himself and Katara had not been the only children. Not back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, by the time Sokka had grown big and strong and skilled and experienced enough to reliably bring in game and fish to feed the tribe, there had only been himself, Katara, Gran-Gran, and that handful of others. After the men left, their numbers had dwindled even more, and Katara had been too caught up in the death of their mother, the departure of their father, to really notice. She never thought about what happened to truly leave so few alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sokka TRIED not to think about it, tried so hard that after traveling a while with Aang, almost he could tell himself that the memories were only nightmares, merely dark dreams brought on by dark times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Almost.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were things no child should ever be forced to do. It was not starvation which had diminished their numbers, in those years after the men left. No, even when Sokka had been too small and weak and young to bring down the hardy beasts of the antarctic, he had still always managed to keep meat on their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably for the best that Katara had never questioned where it came from, back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka still had nightmares about it, himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat of hunger could force people to do terrible things. The Water Tribes knew this better than most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

That kind of thing stayed with a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Katara had not realized, and if Sokka had anything to say about it, she never <i>would</i>. She might have resented the thought, but there were still ways he could protect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always would. Not just because she was his sister, either. No, he could remember when she had been so vulnerable, so helpless, when she had needed to be protected and safeguarded at any cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been that way up until relatively recently, in all honesty. Before leaving the South Pole, Katara's waterbending had been <i>entirely</i> self-taught, without even any waterbending scroll's to work from. She hadn't even known that <i>the moon was the source of waterbending</i>, for ocean's sake! That was just how fragmentary and incomplete his sister's understanding of the art had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, naturally, even with as talented as she eventually proved herself to be, there was only so much Katara could have done just by teaching herself. Without any documentation to work from, or elder benders to study under, or even anybody who could show her what the proper forms <i>looked like</i>, Katara had had to essentially develop her waterbending through trial and error, try to build up an entire martial style from scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Sokka himself had been better off, in teaching himself how to fight, because he was at least able to draw from vague childhood memories of watching the men of the tribe train and hunt and fend off raiders. Until reaching the North Pole, Katara had never before even <i>seen</i> another waterbender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo even with as much as her brother's abilities as a warrior had languished and stagnated and poorly developed, without senior warriors to show him the ropes and correct him when he made a mistake, Katara's abilities as a bender had suffered even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite frankly, until they met Aang and began traveling the world, Katara had been weaker than Sokka. And until they met the Kyoshi warriors, Sokka had not been given any reason to doubt his preconceived notions as to the natural order of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Suki had made a fool of him, and forced Sokka to reevaluate his worldview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sitting there, blushing in spite of himself as he sat next to the Kyoshi Warrior and Toph, and the Fire Lord and his girlfriend, Sokka tried to focus on the positive of this, and not the negative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to think of how much he loved Suki, how he was<i> sure</i> they would be able to make things work, how he would do his <i>damnedest </i>to figure out a way for everything to work out. He clung to that though like a lifeline, even as his introspection brought up deeply buried fears and regrets, and terrible things he wanted so badly to forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to focus on how to solve the problem before him, tried to distract himself with plans and ideas and plots and stratagems. Slush, even the strange feelings that now bubbled up in his stomach whenever he happened to glance at Toph's still faintly pink face would be a preferable avenue of contemplation to what things now presently gnawed at the back of his mind, creeping up from the deepest, darkest, blackest recesses of desperately repressed memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked into Suki's bright hazel eyes, and tried not to think of the light leaving the painfully similar eyes of sweet, innocent young Aumanil and her brother Issitoq, who had looked up at him so confusedly, in their last few moments of life, moving their lips without sound as if to ask him why he stood above them, a bloodstained bone hunting knife in his hand. He glanced at Toph's cloudy eyes, and tried not to remember the tears in the eyes of old, weary, blind Anik, or his wife, Atiqtalik, who had submitted themselves with resignation, knowing what needed to be done for the future of the tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiercely he shoved back these memories, the memories of kind Estuuya, capricious Kadlu, steadfast Ilannaq, lighthearted Natsiq, and clumsy Palluqtuq, and how each of them had met their end, how he and Gran-Gran and Katara and the young mothers and their children had survived the long famine of harsh antarctic winters. He did everything he could to avoid thinking about this, to keep his mind on track and push these black, dreadful thought back into the furthest depths of forgotten memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not think about these things, because if he did, he knew that the fear of failure would overwhelm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been too weak, too inexperienced back then, and so many others had died because of his failures, but no longer. He could not let these fears rule him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki and Toph were counting on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he would do everything in his power to <i>not </i>let them down.</span></div></div>",

Sure, they were aluring and it made Suki think she'd have to get some to wear with Sokka.  Just to get him to stop recieving from those girls 'services rendered' in alleyways.  The least they could do if they 'render services' is invite her and treat them to a hotel.  Currently she was wearing a light green crop top with a large square of the fabric on the back cut out to show off her shoulder blades and shoulders.  The sleeves were quarter long and the front had a heart cut out showing some breast.  She also wore a green choker with a gold chain going down to her shirt collar.  Her skirt was extra high giving panty flashes during light jumps or hops.  And her shopping partner told about this new no wrap silk under garment called panties.  They were cute and painless to put on, so she would have to remember to buy a few of these for Sokka's pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Toph everything was on her tonight, she was properly picked of cloths by the store owner.  She wanted to fit in this one night, make this new trend hers.  She got a similar out fit to Suki only a little bit more tamed as she was 12 years old and could not pull off all the right curves some of the cloths were designed for.  But, she was undeniably lust commanding, if there was a bending art to make boys drool over you.  She was a master of it, with her cute dark green spighetti string tank top with low cut and rose on the front; she was the girl that wafted with lust and desire, but could not be touched.  She was the forbidden fruit on the tree of the seven sins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair then went out after Toph Bei Fong paid for it with her families resources.  It costed a fortune 200 gold Earth Kingdom coins per each of them, a grand total of 400 earth kingdom coins. (680 US dollars, there is no real conversion from Avatar money except Yuans to American dollars.) And she had to admit that the cloths she was wearing and weren't wearing were worth it.  She bought three outfits an several of these new panties figuring she could wear them with anything that she already owned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were getting looks from older men causing their wives to slap them.  Looks from little boys causing the mothers to gasp and chide them as they walked off.  Suki was starting to get what the new word 'Hot' meant.  And she was liking it as she then went to the club with Toph.  Did they enter?</span></div></div>",

Sokka was sketching her as she smiled at him and made general chit chat, \"So, while I was gone protecting Zuko I heard about this cult that was springing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then asked her as he drew more of her bosom, \"Is it going to be any trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging her shoulders she then said to him, \"They could be, its part of the reason why I'm here.  I heard that someone was after the general of the gaang.  I spent a couple of weeks beating up some people.  Girls that were no older than me.  According to the last prisoner the general of the gaang is you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked up at her as he stopped sketching he then asked curiously, \"Really what do they want with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then said something that really preplexed him, \"They want to know your awesome strategies so they can complete their final goal.  Which is still a mystery, but we do know three things about them.  The first is that they are united in benders of all three elements with fewer fire benders. A majority of them are earth benders and several of the female water benders actually fight which from intelligence reports the North does not support such actions.  The second thing we know about them is that there are no male members.  And we know that there is a whole squad of jian wielders called the Straight Sword supposedly they can fight with such precision together they are like one straight defined blade with one purpose.  But, the funny thing is that none of the members have taken any life nor done any real property damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said as he went back to sketching, \"I wonder who they are.\"</span></div></div>",

He took in her soft lips and shining hazel eyes, and he cute nose and feminine cheeks. He drank in her slender, pale neck -- her bare skin, smooth and free of blemish, so appetizing and salty sweet with the tang of sweat and underlying flavor of <i>Suki.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced further downward, to where her bosom heaved and swelled as she breathed heavily, deeply. Her skin was flushed a ruddy, rosy pink with arousal, and her nipples stood upright -- though not from any sort of cold. Her breasts seemed so enticing to him, so round and firm and shapely. They were of a modestly goodly size, and he could feel the palms of his hands itch pleasantly with the memory of soft, supple flesh conforming to the shape of his hands as he lovingly, passionately kneaded and caressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see, baby?\" he head Suki said lowly, suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh yeah</i>,\" Sokka said, his voice husky, coming out as more of an animalistic growl than actual speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled, a sensual, vulpine grin curving her lips and dimpling her cheeks. Her eyes seemed to twinkle and flicker as she raked them in turn over Sokka's body, drinking in the sight of his dusky skin, and the lean, faintly bulging muscles beneath -- muscles which were still developing to the full girth and breadth of manhood, but nonetheless appeared undeniably powerful as he stalked toward her on all fours. His manhood was erect, throbbing, seeming almost out of place on Sokka's gangly teenaged form, for it was great in length and girth, so much so that it seemed almost overlarge, protruding from her lover's pubic region. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to her eyes that this particular member had, in growth, outpaced most of the rest of Sokka, and she took it as a sign that her boyfriend was going to be filling out a <i>lot</i> as he grew into the fullness of his manhood. (Not to be confused with his manhood of fullness, for which a small part of Suki was already aching, already longing)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Suki's thoughts were cut off as she felt Sokka's mouth swallow hers, his tongue slipping past her lips to explore the depths of her mouth. She did not give him free reign, for very long, however, and soon her tongue had risen to wrestle with his. And it was a long, intense battle which proceeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki moaned, a little, into Sokka's mouth, feeling his broad, calloused hands (another part which seemed to have slightly outpaced the rest of him) cup her breasts. They squeezed, tentatively at first, gently, as though apprehensive of bruising the the sumptuous mounds. But as their kiss intensified and Suki began running her own hands up and down her lover's abdomen and chest, they soon became bolder, more passionate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kneaded her breasts, rolling them beneath his palms and tweaking her nipples between his fingers. And Suki scraped her nails over Sokka's gradually broadening pecs, leaving long, thin pale marks behind as she pawed at his firm, hard chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka could feel Suki growing hot to the touch, could feel her frame shudder beneath him, and he could hear her moans -- even muffled by his lips -- which seemed to plead with him in some primal, instinctive language to <i>join</i> with her, to fill the ache in her loins, and relieve the itch in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was inclined to oblige her, feeling his erection throb and twitch as he made sweet, hot love to his girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

This bridge that had a small shack under it and was only 20 minutes away from the all girls school of White Lotus city.  Three girls in white skirt with near transparent white blouses walked into the shack under the bridge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were inside the shack that was full of garden tools thus identifying it as a tool shed.  They moved a shelf out of the way to show a cracked wall. One of the girls, Ju Jing, had long curly black hair with a near 'S' shape to all her back strands of hair.  Her eyes were green with red eye shadow and her lips painted with red lip stick.  She moved her fist punching just an inch away from the wall.  The wall blasted back as she walked down the black hall.  Her c-cup bosom bounced with every step.  As her skirt flapped to her steps her pink panties could be seen and her twerkable ass bounced heavenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next girl, Mo Lee, entered the hall with long black hair in a pony tail.  She wore blue eye shadow to go with her blue lip stick that she wore upon her thick lips.  She had three large braids in the middle of the pony tail and three hair loopies on her left side going to the back to join the pony tail at the middle braid.  She had gold accent beads on the three left hair loopies.  Her eyes were a pair of red brown like cooling lava from a volcano.  Her right eye was covered by a wide bang of hair as her d-cup bosom bounced with her walking.  She fire bent at the torchs inside allow them to see the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third school girl, February or Feb for short, was a slightly tanned Earth Kingdom girl.  She had black eyes yellow eye shadow as her lips were thin and painted with yellow lip stick.  Her hair was in a bun with a couple of long bangs coming from the bun making it look fancy and messy at the same time.  Her hair was a rich autumn leaf red and her bosom while perky was still very visible to the human eye.  Only an idiot would turn her down.  The three got to a private room with posters of Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeb went to the wall as she grabbed her favorite weapon.  A Southern Water Tribe boomerang replicate only made of silver.  It had a edge to the inside that was painted yellow.  She smiled as she began to practice with it.  Ju Jing swung a Jian that was made of a brown red metal as she attacked a dummy.  Mo Lee had no talent for weaponry as of yet, but she did appreciate Sokka.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes this was the three girl cult of Sokka.  The Wolverine Fox of the South as they called him, they all three thought that baby wolverine foxes were cute and fierce when grown up.  And they just made them think what Sokka was like.  Mo Lee decided sense this was their sanctuary that she wanted some privacy from local pervs.  Mo Lee asked Ju Jing, \"Hey, can you bend the shelf and wall back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJu Jing did as she was asked as she then said to her, \"Getting out the book again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing Mo Lee nodded as she then went to a book shelf.  There on it were several books that they all wrote.  Each had a Sokka in the title.  Grabbing one that was written by herself she pulled it off.  She opened the book as she then pulled up the front of her skirt. Her blue panties would get in the way of what she was about to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling them off she opened the book up to see a sketch of a naked Sokka sitting on a rock. With his right fist under his chin as he was thinking.  The illustration showed a bubble of his brillant mind as he was making mental blue prints to the first moon explorer.  She saw the cock standing up in the illustration.  She tapped her clit while her other girlsfriends practiced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to moan as she bit her lower lip as she felt herself get wet.  She would shake the book every once in a while as she turned the pages.  The story progressed to show that Sokka was missing a key part.  This key item would make or break the moon explorer.  But, he was becoming frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the book another page flipped over as she fingered herself, putting two fingers of her left hand into her pussy.  She moaned as her thumb stroked her clit.  She saw the page have her in skimpy lab coat with a thong and bikini bra.  She was giving Sokka head as he hand his hand on her head now instead of his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next page showed her on the ground with his cock between her tits. She moaned as she saw herself being tit raped by the man she admired.  She was pumping in and out of her pussy faster and faster.  There were words on the opposite page saying phrases like ,\"Oh Sokka your sausage is so hard!  Sokka my milk is coming!\"  She envisioned that Sokka did like a girl who lacitated early in life.  She was always made fun of by the other girls for having wet spots on her shirt.  So what if she produced milk early, she wasn't a cow like the girls called her.  No, she was Sokka's lovely milk maiden. She imagined that he would love her early puberty defect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would hold her and stroke her belly while she sat in his lap.  Oh, she loved how she imagined his teeth biting into her neck.  She dropped the book by now on the tiled floor as she lolled her head.  She imagined his rough calloused hands grope at her bosom.  His cock inside her pussy and his lips moving to her right bosom.  He pulled it up as he licked the nipple and sucked on it.  She felt her milk leak out as she was happy to nourish Sokka after a long day on the rebelling front lines.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as her fingers went faster and faster she seized up.  She screamed as her cult sisters saw her achieve greatness.  She came all over the tiled floor as she had her tongue come out.  She slumped back as she began to lay in her own juices.  If only she and her sisters had enough money to meet their idol in person.</span></div></div>",

So, Ju Jing demanded her father the owner of the White Lotus city art museum to buy Sokka like art what she called 'Sokkaism' or Abstract as the art community called it later. But, still, what she had was a Sokka original.  It was of some brown person with a sword with a green person holding gold fans.  It was called 'Fan and Sword', it was an abstract piece of Suki and Sokka holding their weapons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over as she said to Mo Lee, \"Hey, mind cleaning up that mess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the mess leaked over to her foot as she slipped and fell.  She hit her head as she landed between Mo Lee's legs.  Smiling after a giggle fest Feb then pulled one of the chairs as she sat down to enjoy the show.  Mo Lee reacted when she felt Ju Jing's tongue on her pussy.  She elated as she then screamed at her trying to push her away, \"Hey! DON'T JU JING NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJu Jing had entered her rape state, Ju Jing had this unlikely berserker state.  When she often banged her head or got too into the moment she would become an insatiable pervert.  She would attack girl or boy alike and devour their sex until she exited the state. And was only after her head ache went away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJu Jing saw Mo Lee turn into Suki as she felt Sokka behind her insert his long 30 inch girth into her ass.  She felt hot and panted out as she licked at Suki's clit.  Mo Lee's voice came from Suki, but then again she had never met her girl crush so she didn't know what she sounded like.  But, Mo Lee's voice was sexy as she licked Suki's auburn trimmed pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Sokka spank her as she moaned and then lightly rake her teeth on Mo Lee's outer pussy flesh. Mo Lee screamed in pleasure and fear as she then came all over Ju Jing's face.  Ju Jing then felt her head ache numb as she Sokka vanish and that long cock of his, those 30 inchs she so wanted to feel.  Then Suki turned into Mo Lee as she stood up and pulled her skirt a little more comfortable position and straighten out her panties.  She then said to Mo Lee with a yell, \"THAT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU'D CLEAN UP AT LEAST!\"</span></div></div>",

She got up as she then said swinging her boomerang, \"HEY!  Let's calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair calmed down as they listened to her as she said to them, \"Okay, let's just do our homework and then go see the unveiling like we wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair then looked at each other as they were about to do something.  The earth bender Ju Jing then lowered her hands as the sand shuriken floating in the air fell apart.  And Mo Lee's fire ball vanished as the pair shook hands, Mo Lee's clean hand that is.  The two then began to clean up as they then did their home work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the girls were done they had decided to walk out of sanctuary.  They ventured the road as they then got to the bus station.  The bus station was a brand new thing.  It was an institution made by the great Sokka from his great idea (Joke) that he came up with on the trolley of White Lotus City.  There were long stone made carts with tamed Zebra Bison.  The carts had doors on them and thanks to the Zebra Bison having a easier time with travel the bus system worked great. People could get on a bus/extra long carriage and the zebra bison could run.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZebra Bison were a rare animal that had limited earth bending that allowed them to take a step and only use a quarter of the energy thanks to earth bending the ground under their hooves to be more stable.  Walking on stomped and softened earth while easy on the feet was hard to walk in, like packed sand.  But with zebra bison the dirt paths became harder and easier to walk on, as well as save energy thus allowing longer and faster travel.  It was the first saddlemobile as Sokka called it.  It was a large cart with zebra bison at the front.  But unlike such a large carriage it was only pulled by 4 zebra bison.  Usually such a long carriage that could hold forty people would be pulled by 20 animals. But, with the cranks on the wheels with the gears and belts, the wheels in the back push and pulled the other wheel.  Eliminating the work of 16 animals for such a large cart.  And the first one would be here in White Lotus city.  He even came up with a truly unthinkable idea he called an automobile that was rumored to be worked on by Sokka and the Mechanist.  As well as the up and coming business man Koji Sato who was helping them work on such a project.  The automobile would be the first non coal powered or animal powered vehicle in history.  Not even an air ship could pull that off and that was the most impressive technology sense the submarine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls got to the bus station they saw the first of four buses be unveiled.  Mo Lee hopped as she then said to the others, \"It's starting, it's starting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then walked out as he stood in front of the blue building.  The girls squealed as they cheered throwing up a sign.  The sign then said, \"WE <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> you Sokka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka spoke through on a behind a podium with a speaking horn that was the size of Toph.  The speaking horn amplfied his speaking as he spoke to the crowd.  He said to the crowd, \"When I first came up with the saddle mobile, it was more of a joke of what if we got Momo to pull all of the Gaang.  But, me and the Mechanist made that joke into reality.  Thanks to gears, cranks, wheels and leather belts we took the long carriage usually powered by 12 to 30 animals and made it pulled by just four animals.  Truly a historical moment, and someday we will live in a world where animal will no longer have to be the main transportation or coal powered machines.  The future is wonderous indeed, but nothing will be the spirit and thought of minds like you or you or you (Just happened to point at Mo Lee, Ju Jing and Feb as they screamed in happiness). It is your minds and will that will make even those futures pale to your dreams and idles.  So, I ask you please, keep thinking and keep dreaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was given two sword as he cut a long green ribbon.  The white cloth was lifted by laborers as there was a white stone statue of Sokka standing in front of the bus station.  Sokka was guarded by white lotus recruits as he was shuffled away.  The girls screamed in happiness and cheers!</span></div></div>",

The three pretty members of the young tribesman's cult -- the \"Sokka Sect,\" as they called themselves -- nodded to one another, and quietly began slipping through the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were <i>so close</i>, presently, to their idol, their hero, the object of their lustful worship. Who knew when they would get another chance like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved through the people, quickly but inconspicuously making their way to the edge of the gathered crowd, the edge nearest to Sokka. Feb nearly swooned over how close they were to the man she and her two friends so greatly adored, and Mo Lee and Ju Jing could not blame her for this reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the White Lotus recruits, who were acting as a human cordon in the space between the crowd and Sokka, the three faithful devotees were getting a better look at the object of their worship than they ever had before. They had seen drawings of him, of course -- their club house held a considerable collection of reproduced portraits, sketches, and even Fire Nation wanted posters from during the war -- but nothing could really do justice to subtle rippling of lean, gradually building muscles beneath his dark, bronzed skin, or capture the way his ocean blue eyes sparkled with verve and humor and hidden depths of intelligence and passion in the sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human hand could only do so much. No artist could truly capture every subtle facet of the divine, natural work of art which was the human body -- and to the members of the Sokka Sect, their idol was masterpiece among masterpieces, the magnum opus of the spirits, a work of the most sublime beauty and majesty, before which all others paled in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Sokka in person only strengthened the trio's devotion to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they had to get closer. They could not bear to be so near to Sokka, and yet also still so far. They wanted his eyes to alight upon them, wanted to see his incomparably handsome face brighten with warm affection as he beheld them. They wanted to feel his strong arms wrap around their bodies, his calloused hands gently caress their womanly curves, his hot lips lovingly devour their sweaty skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJu Jing, Mo Lee, and Feb could not restrain themselves from rushing forward towards the object of their absolute adoration. Sokka was the only thing they could see, as the barreled forwards, crying out his name and declaring their undying love for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeb called out Sokka's name over and over, eyes wide with a fanatical zeal as she shoved aside everyone in their way, civilian and White Lotus alike. She did not care what happened to the people she pushed, so long as she was able to unite with her idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMo Lee tore off her shirt, under which she had worn no breast wrappings, and bared her large, generous bosoms for their idol to behold. She did not care who else might see, so long as Sokka was there to behold her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJu Jing begged Sokka at the top of her lungs to fuck her and father her children. She did not see the or care about the dark looks sent her way by the detachment of Kyoshi Warriors who stood at attention a meter or two away, there to rendezvous with Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's could only see Sokka. He was the only thing that mattered to them. They did not see the short, petite, milky-eyed White Lotus recruit take an earthbending stance, or the pair of Kyoshi Warriors -- one with a striking resemblance to Mo Lee, the other with short auburn hair and the ornamentation of the order's commander -- spring into action with an almost supernatural grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did not notice, and they did not care. To them, only one thing mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when Mo Lee was swallowed up to her chin by solid rock only inches away from Sokka's feet, and Ju Jing was reduced to a boneless heap by a series of quick, sharp jabs, and Feb was flipped onto her back and pinned to the ground beneath one of the Kyoshi Warriors, the only thing they could see was Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next? Were the three taken into custody and locked up, or did Sokka try to see if he could figure out what they wanted?</span></div></div>",

They were in a spacious earth tent, erected by Toph, and the trio of girls that had been tied up by Suki (though not before putting a shirt on the topless one) were seated before him, looking up at him with glimmering eyes and wide, dopey grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked to his side, where Ty Lee, in her uniform as a Kyoshi Warrior, was curiously eyeing the one who had torn off her own shirt and tried to tackle Sokka.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't been able to look that one in the eye since she had been brought in, the memory of very generous breasts bouncing and jiggling all about in a very <i>interesting</i> manner being still quite vividly burned into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka knew they were supposed to be questioning the girls -- it wouldn't have been the first time assassins had tried a gambit as crazy as what had happened back outside the newly opened bus station -- but he could not think of anything to say. What could he really <i>ask</i> of people who were so obviously either wolfbatshit insane lunatics or brilliant criminal masterminds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet he could not just stand there with Ty Lee forever. They wouldn't get anywhere if someone didn't get this interrogation started, and Ty Lee hadn't said a peep since they had apprehended the perps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging internally, Sokka cleared his throat and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he said, \"What are your names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feb!\" said the redhead excitedly, looking almost like she was ecstatic just to be addressed by him. \"It's short for February, but you can call me <i>anything you want!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two squealed and giggled, and the redhead was blushing and tittering along with her two cohorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka resisted the urge to sigh. These girls were toying with him, weren't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the curly-haired one spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Ju Jing,\" she told him in a distressingly flirty, girlish tone of voice, batting her eyelashes up at Sokka and smiling suggestively. \"Your holy Sokka-ness,\" she added a moment later, appearing to attempt a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka quirked an eyebrow at the bizarre, title, assuming it was intended as some sort of veiled insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you?\" he asked the last one, the one who had flashed her (<i>large, bouncy, delicious</i>) breasts at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the girl could speak however, Ty Lee's eyes widened, as though in recognition, and the former acrobat cried out, \"<i>MO?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused the girl's eyes to widen in turn, and she looked up at Ty Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ty?</i>\" she exclaimed, apparently recognizing the newest Kyoshi Warrior. But then the next words out of her mouth made no sense, or at least none that Sokka's brain was willing to accept. \"Oh my <i>Sokka!</i> My big sister is friends with <b><i>Sokka!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a joyous, high pitched squeal at this, and her friends joined in tittering and babbling at one another in apparent delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka couldn't help but frown a little in confusion, unable to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee, on the other hand, seemed to have put two and two together, and she looked like she was...</span></div></div>",

Raising one of his hands to Feb's face, he began brushing his fingers through her unusually colorful hair. It felt remarkably soft and well cared for, and Sokka almost got a little lost just in the feeling of her silky, smooth strands running and flowing between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeb whimpered a little, her face by now an even brighter shade of red than her hair, but she looked immensely happy just with this closeness. She was practically purring, rubbing her head up against Sokka's hand, and if Mo Lee and Ju Jing had to pull their fellow founder away from their idol before she could get too cozy, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Midori. The buxom, black-haired Kyoshi Warrior was a little bashful about her fantasy, but seeing her mistress give her the go ahead, she shyly went ahead and sat down in front of Sokka, her back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-could you... rub my shoulders?\" she asked him, quietly, hesitantly. \"It's always been a fantasy of mine, to come home from a long day of training to a handsome man who would rub my shoulders and, well... I'm not sure the commander would approve of the rest... But you could at least rub my shoulders, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grinned, puffing up at being called <i>handsome</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" he said, before putting his hands on Midori's shoulders and getting to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it should be noted that if there was one talent alone above all others with which Sokka had been gifted, it would probably be what Suki affectionately referred to as his <i>muscle-bending</i>. It was common for muscles to get stiff or sore in the frigid antarctic weather, and Sokka had gotten very good at massages simply as a matter of course. Nothing particularly sexual about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...at least, not by <i>Water Tribe</i> standards. On Kyoshi Island, however, massages were a very intimate act, and as often as not a prelude to intercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, while Sokka found nothing weird or sexual with giving a pretty girl a massage, Midori was all but getting off on the way he so skillfully worked the knots out of her muscles. And much of her moaning was from a lot more than just relief at having her sore muscles being cared for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki did not call Midori out on this, however, even though she knew better than anyone else just how sexual this really was for her fellow warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoshi Warriors stuck together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though Sokka finished, and Midori, by this point a barely conscious puddle of sensual bliss, had to be hauled away by Feb and Ju Jing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho had their fantasies fulfilled next?</span></div></div>",

She grinned at him, blinking the semen out of her unseeing eyes, wiping it away on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeb cooed, seeing this, and Suki, smirking, gave Toph a deep kiss on the lips. Mo Lee and Ty Lee both giggled at this, and Ju Jing whistled wolfishly. Midori blushed, clearly intrigued by the way her commander so passionately devoured the younger girl's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sokka gasped when he saw and felt Suki turn Toph around -- still kissing her -- and back the girl up to his groin. Mo and Ty Lee smiled vulpinely, seeing what Suki was doing, and they took Sokka's member and Toph's behind in hand. They guided the two together, and Ju Jing, Midori, and Feb were all three masturbating with varying levels of reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph moaned into Suki's lips, feeling Ty Lee part her firm, round buttocks as Mo Lee guided Sokka's cock into her anus, inching it in little by little. The earthbender shivered, eyes rolling back as she came from the feeling of Sokka inside her and Suki kissing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't done yet, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sokka had been guided into Toph, he began to rock his hips up and down of his own accord, looking shamefaced but also undeniably aroused as he grabbed the young earthbender's hips and began pushing them back and forth on his hardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMo Lee and Ty Lee then turned their attention to molesting Toph's breasts, eagerly licking and fondling the small, perky globes as Suki continued kissing the blind earthbender while Sokka fucked Toph's ass. Feb, Ju Jing, and Midori all masturbated as they watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Not saying I would never do it for him, I just don't want to harm that hard treasure.  I've never really done it for him cause of my rough feet.  But, your feet are perfect for a foot job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \"HEY! YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER TELL ANYONE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee squealed as she leaped onto the bed as Toph got off. Her ass was sore, but her heart fulfilled. Ty Lee then hand stand on the bed as Mo Lee and Feb grabbed his shoulders preventing him from running off. Ty Lee rested her elbows and forearms onto the bed. Her chin into her hands as she bent her back over letting her feet go to his cock. She had kicked off her shoes before getting on the bed.  Her silky smooth feet touched his shaft as her left big toe traced along the cock's head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee smiled at his moaning as he sounded like a groaning door giving way. She licked her lips as Sokka's cock shook with pleasure. Her feet brought him to new heights as she the then began to pump him with her feet. Going at his cock she stroked, poked and fondled his penis as he leaned back. He was ready she thought as he came after being tapped on the head of his cock. Sokka let loose a storm as his eyes darkened with lust. That's when he went at it.</span></div></div>",

She gasped, a little, in surprise as the young warrior began devouring her lips and groping her breasts. She also moaned when she felt him plunge into her womanhood, beginning to fervently pump his hardness in and out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls smiled, perceiving that at last Sokka was willing -- and eager, in truth. They were exceedingly aroused, watching him pound Ty Lee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smirked, watching her boyfriend fuck the newest of the Kyoshi Warriors. Feeling horny from the spectacle, she went up to Sokka and began kissing his neck from the side, teasing the sensitive area and pushing Sokka to further heights of lust. Midori joined her, doing the same from the other side, and Mo Lee, Ju Jing, and Feb went up and started fondling and teasing the asses of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph may or may not have used her earthbending to create a smooth, stone dildo with which to ream Ty Lee's ass as it smacked against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, Ty Lee came with a loud scream, and Sokka came as well. Blinded by animal lust, he pumped the former acrobat's flower full of his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he turned around and growled hungrily, pushing Ju Jing to the ground. The back of her head hit the earth just hard enough to activate her so-called \"berserker state\", and the earthbender went wild with lust. Rolling over to give Sokka access to her ass, she grabbed the nearest pair of legs she could find, pulling the buxom, black-haired Midori to the ground before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, zealously bumping and grinding her ass onto Sokka's manhood, Ju Jing proceeded to lustfully assault Midori's pussy, ravenously eating the Kyoshi Warrior out as Sokka reamed her anus with his cock. Midori came quickly under Ju Jing's furious ministrations, and Ju Jing happily lapped up the juices.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Ju Jing's head started to clear, with the taste of Midori's nectar on her tongue, she felt herself shudder and explode in orgasm, Sokka's dick shooting his semen deep into her ass. She moaned happily, and Sokka moved to the next girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raped Mo Lee's tits, shoving his rod between them and making the girl kiss and lick and suck on the head until he came, and she greedily drank it up. She was lactating, some, as she came from his taste, and Sokka thirstily drank up her milk for a few minutes, causing her to come again. While he did this, Feb happily sucked him off, Suki and Toph making their own fun as they observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, once he had drunk his fill of Mo Lee's milk, Sokka pushed Feb down and fucked her. He drilled her pussy for several minutes, playing with her shapely, perky breasts as he did so, nipping and sucking her lips as her hungrily kissed her. Feb came happily, ecstatic from being fucked by her idol, and Sokka came as well, pumping her full of his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sokka turned his attention back to his girlfriend, who was in the process of biting and kissing Toph's small, burgeoning breasts while massaging and kneading the metalbender's firm, round buttocks. Suki was on all fours, pinning Toph to the ground beneath her, and Sokka licked his lips, seeing his lovely lover's soaking wet womanhood and tight, cute asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis member twitching, still hard, fueled by a genuine, incomparable Southern Water Tribe libido and sustained by the stamina of a young warrior still growing into his prime, Sokka grinned wolfishly and took Suki in the...</span></div></div>",

His leg was in a cast thanks to that leap he took and landed on the war balloon with. He was reading a magazine as he looked at the women that worked at the hospital. They were all members of the fire nation that had chosen to heal and mend the wounded of the war's victors. Thanking them for ending the chaos and blood shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNymphs of mercy and mending were these girl dressed in short skirt red kimonos. With pink paper folded hats on their heads with a red cross on the front. The trim was white and the cleavage exposed slightly with a white shirt underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka lowered the magazine as he looked at one of the nurses and then looked back at the pages. Suki who had walked in had noticed this as she then glared at the slutty bitches that used to be their enemies. Well if he liked those scantly outfits then he needed to stop, or <i>maybe</i> she thought with a naughty smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was sitting in a wheel chair as he was pushed by Suki. He then said to her, \u201cSo, what's for dinner tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki leaned down as she kissed his cheek and said, \"Wild boarbear meat laced with honey, lionmoose steak peppered and finally giant lobstercrab drenched in butter.  And granny Kyoshi apple pie for dessert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was drooling as he then said to her kissing her hand, \u201cYou're too good for me, honestly you are awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was at the table as he began diving into the food. He then heard a cough as he turned his head over his shoulder. There in a stunning Fire Nation nurse's uniform was Suki as she smiled at him wearing red lip stick and an attractive pair of stockings that were red. Where the shirt for the exposed cleavage was supposed to be was bare skin that was ever so supple. Smiling she stroked the side of her hair that was wavy now as she must have altered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then swallowed his mouth full of food as she then approached in with a sway in her hips. She then said as she sat down on his lap, \u201cThe doctor said that you'd still need some medical attention. So, I decided to nurse you back to health.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki moved her butt as she felt him getting hard as she then took a pair of chop sticks full of lobstercrab. Feeding him as she then saw the butter drip on his chin. She then licked his chin as she then felt him grow harder and heard him grunt. Smiling Suki then took a piece of boarbear and feed her boyfriend mouth to mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTongues batted at each other as Suki saw him close his eyes. She moaned as she wrapped her hands around his neck pulling in deeper. She felt him win as she let him cram his tongue into her mouth and felt him lick teasing her throat. She giggled as she then felt him attack her finding a new ticklish spot on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then moaned as he felt his hard on being pressed. The rotation of her hips made him groan a lot as he then placed his hands on her breasts. She groaned as she felt him open up her shirt as he said to her, \u201cGot to get me some special treatment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki moaned out, \u201cOh, yeah Sokka got to get your medicine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then began to lick her breasts as she then moaned and felt his teeth lightly rake her nipples. She squirmed making him all the more aroused as she then said to him hotly, \u201cOh, Sokka give me some that pecker cock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then asked her as he groaned, \u201cWhen did my penis become a farm animal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then giggled as she then said to him, \u201cIt was the first thing that came to my head. Speaking of head, it looks like I need to examine your head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said in dumb reply, \u201cMy head is just fine, I mean it didn't get hit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then slithered down his body like a weasel snake as she pulled open his pants. She then said to him giggling, \u201cNot that head, this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecker cock was seven inches long as she then gasped and said to him, \u201cI've seen this twice and it still surprises me. Now, to give this bird a kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing the slit of his pecker cock she licked at the ridge of his helmet. She then kissed as she then plunged her head on the pecker cock. She pumped her head up and down on his pecker cock. She then moaned on it as she hummed a tune of victory as he came in her throat. She then pulled up as she swallowed and smiled naughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulled off the robe she showed her red panties with red ribbons clipping to her stockings. Her panties had a hole cut out at her pussy. Drops of and long lines of juice hit the floor as she then sat on his waist. She placed his cock at her opening and moaned as she felt him enter her. She moaned as she then said to him, \u201cOh, yeah, fuck this nurse. Fuck her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka humped her and bounced his waist as he attacked her pussy. She bit her lower lip as she moaned and felt the hat fall off. She bounced herself on his cock as she moaned deeply and hotly. She came on his cock as she shuddered licking his neck as she drove her teeth to his neck. Like viperdillo she enjoyed the lunching on human flesh, as long as it was her boyfriend. Moans were heard from both of them as they both came at the same time. Mewls and strangled sighs of relief mixed with relaxation were heard. Suki then said to him as professional as she could while gulping air ever couple of words, \u201cIt looks like your examination is complete, it also looks like you have a speedy recovery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grinned as he then said to her, \u201cYup.\u201d</span></div></div>",
