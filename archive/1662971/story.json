You looked around frantically and noticed a man sitting at the far side of the limo. He wore a black suit with a crest on the pocket. You looked at it carefully and recognized it. It was the seal to the royal family of Resaria. You were about to say something when the man stopped you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello son,\" he said in a heavy accent. \"My name is Rauru, King of this country.\" You were shocked, what did the king want with you. \"Recently my beloved daughter was assassinated. The event was quickly suppressed and no one knows about the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do you want with me?\" you asked as your heart raced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see my new wife is very sterile. I can no longer have offspring, and as such with the death of Vivavie I have no heir to the thrown and thus ending my blood line. This is where you come in, I discussed it over with my finest men and we came to a decision.\" he told you pulling out a small emerald sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" you ask trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When excavating a old ruined castle we found this along with an old manuscript. According to the manuscript, this orb can transform anyone into someone else.\" he said. You weren't sure but you knew what he was thinking. \"We decided that it would be in best interest to use this to recreate my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why me?\" you ask slightly curious as to this twist in your vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We randomly chose one young person from the airport, someone that wasn't a citizen of our country.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my family?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will be let known that you were found dead on the side of the road.

As your eyes started to gain focused you noticed some other things. This girl appeared to be only 12 or 13 and was barely into puberty. You looked down and confirmed it, this girl was definitely you. You seemed to be wearing a long elegant dress. It reminded you of a prom dress( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://prommafia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/green-princess-prom-dress.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://prommafia.com/wp-content/uploads/...</a>). You were quite confused, especially because you could still notice some of your cuts were still there and bandaged. You felt that you were about to faint again so you wondered over to a large bed and fell onto it and blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke again you noticed a bandage on your arm was very red, you examined the cut and replaced the bandage. Then a women walked in carrying a medical kit. She sat down next to you, \"Don't worry princess we'll replace these bandages without a problem, you just gotta remember to not move around so much or they will open up again.\" the woman said. What was she talking about, you weren't the princess and you didn't look like her either. The woman re bandaged you and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there for a while staring around the large room, you could tell that it must have been the princess' room, it was very nice and quite girly. Then you heard a clicking sound and the large doors opened and in came the king and his body guards. \"What's going on? Didn't you want me to be your daughter?\" you ask in a harsh tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did until the media figured out the assassination. We quickly thought up a new plan for you, you are now my new wife's long lost daughter. We told our country that we had found you in an orphanage in America and were glad that we had found you. Your name is now Princess Sophia  Villara. Oh and your parents have already been informed of your...death.\" he said. \"Unfortunately when we changed you into this girl you sustained the cuts. Do be careful not to reopen them.\" he said as he walked out of the room. You quickly ran after him but the door closed and locked. You sat there banging for someone to let you out, but no one came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of thinking you......</span></div></div>",

A large closet off the side, a large bathroom a large bed. It was all very girly and princessy. But you hated being in that dress, you had to change out. So you walked into the closet. The problem though is that there were no pants in the closet at all. You had to go with the next best thing, since you were really tired, you grabbed a nightie.(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://image3.dhgate.com/upload/20101/58/ff80808122da8daa0122db6304d6205f/productimg1263803827104.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://image3.dhgate.com/upload/20101/58...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid the dress off slowly around your wounds.

As you exited your you walked into a long hall, you walked down the hall and opened several doors. There were rooms of all kinds, at the end of the hall was a large pair of doors. When you went inside you found a large library, it didn't interest you much and you went the other way down the hall. You got to the middle and it opened up int a bridge in a large hall. There were large crystal chandeliers on the ceiling. The floor of the hall was made of marble and there was a large fountain in the middle. On the other side of the bridge were many more doors in which you would explore later. You headed down the closest side of the curled twin stairs. You explored the house finding large rooms, one was a ball room. At one end of the large hall was another very large door, the largest you had seen so far, you open it up to find a large throne room. It appears as though you are still a princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened, why was it your family that was royalty, and why are you a girl. It was all very confusing. You walked around your large house for quite a while, you were greeted by guards and maids and assorted other workers. You had noticed several things that were rather strange, the family crest that you had seen all over the house, it was one that you had drawn for a fantasy story you were writing. Another was that you couldn't figure out where this mansions was. You had walked out onto the back deck and saw a large forest behind the mansion. From the outside you could tell the this mansion was designed to look like a castle from the outside, you saw several towers and thought that you would find a way to them later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept looking for clues as to what happened to you when a servant girl ran up to you. \"Lady Sophie, your mother is looking for you.\" she said as she bowed. It appears as though you kept the name from the dream you had, Sophie Villara. You followed the girl to your mother, she hugged you good morning and let the servant girl go. \"Hey mom, whats up?\" you asked trying to play the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I just wanted to tell you about....\"</span></div></div>",

You hugged her again and left the room, you had to figure out more about this world, and how you got here. You walked around till you found a room with a large map on the wall. It was a map of some country you had never heard of, Ferrenia. There was a star on the map, you found it to be the capital city and the city you must live by because of the large forest to the south. The city was the city of Lucenna. On a desk was a globe, the globe looked nothing like earth, it was strange. None of the continents looked the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell by the large desk and decor of the room that this must be your fathers office. You left and headed back to your room. It had changed while you were gone, it grew in sized, the girly decor was the same. But it was much more extravagant. The bed was queen sized, with four large posts and white drapes hanging around it. Whatever happened must not have finished till you left your room. As you looked out the large windows in the back of the room, you heard a knock at the door and told them to come in. It was the servant girl from before, bowing as she spoke. \"Your mother requests your audience in the main hall.\" She said and you followed her downstairs to the main hall. She said it was time to go look for a dress and you agreed. Before you left your mother asked you why you weren't wearing your tiara. Just as soon as she said this the servant girl ran up to you holding a tiara out to you. You grabbed it and placed it on your head, apparently you are required to wear it whenever you go out. It was covered in diamonds and light pink stones of some kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hopped into the back of the limo following your mother and you drove towards town. What kind of city was Lucenna?</span></div></div>",

You exited the limo after your mother and entered the store. The store owner bowed to you and welcomed you to his store. Apparently you have been here many times and were friends with the store owner. You walked around and looked at several dresses your mother was pointing out. She finally found one the you had approved of, despite you being a guy trapped in a girls body in some strange world. You were surprisingly accepting of all this, you were even getting into shopping with your altered mother. She handed you the dress and you went into a dressing room, the theme of the dance was fall so you were going with a very fall color, (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bayliy.com/images/uplode/cheap-prom-dresses/prom-dress-orange-p142a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bayliy.com/images/uplode/chea...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a very poofy dress you liked it. It seemed very princessy and your mother enjoyed it as well. The color of the dress was also the color the national tree turned in the fall. You changed back into your blue outfit and gave the dress to your mother who payed for it and her dress. You walked back to the limo and went home. You went and looked for your dad, who was being trying on his tux, your brother was being fitted for his. You talked to him for a while to try and find out more about this world. Apparently it was a very peaceful world. You and the neighboring nation were the world powers and had very good relations. But you couldn't figure out how you got here, and how you became Sophie Villara, princess of Ferrenia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ball was in two days....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up to the sun filtering through the curtains covering your large windows. You had been living as Sophie Villara, princess of Ferrenia for three days now and couldn't care less that you were a girl. You had given up trying to find your way back to being Ryan Harris, average 15 year old. To the cute and beloved princess. You opened the curtains, and gazed at the colorful Autumn forest outside. You turned around, your nightie twirling as you did, it was something you enjoyed, and sat down in the vanity. Some things that didn't change were your age, you were still fifteen, still going through puberty. Your eyes were still blue, your hair was still light brown. But of course there were some things that were different, you were a girl of course. You had b-sized breasts and you had quite the hourglass figure for your young age. You were smaller than you used to be, you had shrunk 5 inches and were now 5 foot 4. You walked into your marble floored bathroom and proceeded to take a shower, you had gotten used to washing and conditioning your long, shoulder length hair. After you got out you proceeded to change into a pair of light pink panties and matching bra. You then slid into a black sweater dress and tights. You then put on some ugg boots and placed your hair into a pony tail. You sat down at your vanity and a servant came in to do your makeup. It was something you were glad you didn't have to learn to do. You headed down stairs to the dinning room to eat breakfast, your brother was eating his food, when he was done he gave you a hug and left. You mother joined you while eating breakfast, your father was busy organizing the ball. You had enjoyed the changes to your family, your brother was no longer a jerk to you, and your mother was like one of your best friends. Your father was nice and got you things all the time. When you finished you made your way into the ball room, everyone was hurrying this way and that, it was hectic. But all the work was wonderful, the ball room looked amazing. A the far end were two large thrones flanked by the smaller ones for your brother and yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you left the ballroom the girl servant, whom's name you found to be Lisanna, came up to you and told you the hair dresser was here and waiting for you. You followed her back to your room and sat down at the vanity, the hair dresser kissed you on the cheek, you replied in kind, and she proceeded to do your hair, she curled it in long yet tight curls and put it up in a bun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball started in an hour and you proceeded to get into your dress. When you were done, Lisanna came to get you saying all the guests had arrived and it was your family's turn to enter. You stood next to your father, who had your mother to his left and your brother to her left. The large ballroom doors swung open and a man said, \"Presenting the Royal family, George, Anna, John, and Sophie Villara!\" You walked towards the thrones at the front of the room and took your seat, sitting like a pleasant young princess. Your father made a speech and the ball began, people started to dance. A young man walked towards you, your father introduced him as the Prince of the neighboring country, his name was Alphonse Rosch. He had dirty blonde hair and had dark green eyes. Something was familiar about him. He kissed your hand and asked you to dance, you smiled and blushed and agreed. He lead you to the dance floor and you both started to dance. It was a few minutes before he said anything, but when he did, he said. \"......\"</span></div></div>",

The sphere can not change you into just anyone, it changes you into your from an alternate dimension. Basically you really are in your own body, the body of the you of this world Sophie Villara, Princess of Ferrenia. What I did, is fake my own death, my father paniced and kidnapped a random person, that being you. Once he switched you with your alternate body, he was stunned that you didn't turn into me. This gave me my chance to steel the emerald sphere. I just played around with it and eventually it through our souls into the alternate dimension, where you are a princess, and I am a prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned, this was one smart person to be able to pull all that off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like it payed off too, because you make one super cute princess!\" he told you, you blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way back.\" you ask her.</span></div></div>",

While you partied the rest of the night, you had found out that the wedding was to be held a few days before Christmas, giving you two months exactly to have everything read.

You then lead Ashelynn to the large closet, you each took off your dresses, and hung them up, your orange one next to her pink one.

My best friend is a girl named Megan Hutchinson; we\u2019ve been pretty much inseparable since we were 6 years old.  When I\u2019m not hanging out with Megan or playing video games, the only social activity I take part in is the History Club at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that all that\u2019s out of the way, I guess you probably want me to start my story.  It all started on the last day of school; classes had just ended but I couldn\u2019t leave yet, because of an important History Club meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked down the hall to the room where the club met; walking in to find most everyone was already there.  I quickly found a seat next to Megan as Mr. Jacobs, the faculty advisor, walked into the room with some folders in his hands.  \u201cOkay folks, tomorrow is the big day.\u201d Closing the door, he said, \u201cOur flight to Verthaven leaves at 5:30 tomorrow morning; so make sure you\u2019re all at the airport by 3 AM.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr. Jacobs walked down the rows, handing out folders with trip information, Megan leaned over to me and said, \u201cYou excited about the trip?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally excited; I could definitely use a vacation.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cHow about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here; I can\u2019t wait to have a vacation.\u201d Looking at me, a frown on her face, Megan said, \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I\u2019m not looking forward to, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat Gala we got invited to at the Palace; the one for the Kingdoms Bicentennial.\u201d Looking at me, Megan said, \u201cI'm not looking forward to wearing one of those frou-frous, Disney Princess ball gowns.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose I should mention that Megan is the definition of a tomboy; the girliest outfit I\u2019d ever seen her in was a skirt for picture day in 7th grade.  \u201cOh come, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d pulling out her phone, Megan showed me some photos, \u201cWould you want to wear one of those?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the photos on Megan\u2019s phone; the dresses looked very extravagant.  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d like to wear one of those.\u201d<br>\r\nAt that point, Mr. Jacobs had arrived at our section.  He must\u2019ve spotted the photos on Megan\u2019s phone, because he said, \u201cNow remember, I\u2019ve made arrangements for you all to be fitted for your Gala attire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting ended a short time later; with Megan and me amongst the last to leave.

There was 90 minutes to go before we landed in Klapava, the capital city of Verthaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving paused the movie, I turned to look out the window at the mountains below.  I was still looking out the window when I felt someone tap my shoulder.  Turning to look at Megan, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found something interesting I think you should see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Megan placed her tablet on my tray table, I looked closer to find out she was looking at photos of Princess Catherine; the Crown Princess of Verthaven.  \u201cWhy are you showing me photos of the Princess?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cI mean she\u2019s attractive, but she\u2019s also way out of my league.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m showing these to you, dummy.\u201d Sighing, Megan zoomed in on the Princess\u2019 face. \u201cTake a look at her face; if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that you were a boy, you\u2019d look almost exactly like her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked closer at the photos and realized Megan was right; I was almost a spitting image of Princess Catherine, we had the same smile and nearly identical hair color. Had I been born a girl, we probably would\u2019ve been confused for twins. \u201cOh wow, that is so weird.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cYou think I should mention that to her at the Gala?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Megan said, \u201cYou totally should, I think she\u2019d get a kick out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the flight passed without incident; I tried my best to get some sleep since I\u2019d been awake since around 1:30 this morning.  I was jarred awake but the sound of the pilot announced we\u2019d started our descent.  Megan and I both turned to look out the window as the city came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not very large, or modern, like other European cities, Klapava was still home to about 500,000 people.  As we flew over the city, towards the airport, I found myself focusing on the Royal Palace in the center of the city; nestled between rows of trees on all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we got off the plane, the group made its way to the Customs checkpoint.  Everyone was going through quickly, and without a problem; so you can imagine my surprise when some guy in a suit approached me as I waited in line. With a thick accent, the man said, \u201cAre you, Josh Hamel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Suddenly feeling worried, I said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what to do, I quickly obliged and followed the man towards a nearby door. Mr. Jacobs, having seen what was going on, came running over. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Where are you going with my student?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m with airport security.\u201d  Looking at Mr. Jacobs, the man said, \u201cMr. Hamel\u2019s passport was flagged as suspicious; we need to interview him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me as I walked past, Mr. Jacobs said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Josh; you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking at me, in a similar accent to the first man, the second man said, \u201cHello Mr. Hamel, my name is Franz Gerhardt; and this is my associate, Jonas Fischer.

It seemed some of my classmates were angry that I\u2019d held them up at the airport; with only Mr. Jacobs and Megan showing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent 5 minutes assuring Mr. Jacobs that everything was fine; it was all just some misunderstanding.  Once he walked off, Megan came over with my luggage.  \u201cYou should\u2019ve heard some of the others talking.\u201d Handing my suitcase to me, Megan said, <br>\r\n\u201cThey were joking around about how you were some terrorist or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megan and I followed the group outside, I said, \u201cThose two men said the same thing; I kept telling them they had me confused for someone else.\u201d  Looking at Megan, I said, \u201cThe weirdest thing was they asked me some really unusual questions and took photos of my face from all sorts of angles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is weird.\u201d  As the shuttle arrived for the trip to the hotel, Megan said, \u201cBut don\u2019t let that ruin your trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride to the hotel, a high-class hotel a few blocks from the palace, was pretty uneventful.  If you\u2019re wondering why a group of high school students was staying at a ritzy hotel; in addition to invitations to the gala, the palace also offered to pay for the hotel for the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was looking out the window at the scenery when I suddenly started to feel queasy.  Taking a look at me, Megan said, \u201cAre you okay, Josh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine; just feeling a little nauseous all of a sudden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to the hotel a short time later; after giving us a talk about behaving in a foreign country, Mr. Jacobs let us all go off to do what we wanted.  My nausea hadn\u2019t subsided at all; if anything it was getting worse.<br>\r\nMegan helped me up to my room; where she lay me down on the bed.  \u201cI\u2019ll be right back; I\u2019m going to find Mr. Jacobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan quickly left the room and closed the door behind her.  I lay on the bed for a few minutes fighting the urge to throw up.  I was brought back to reality by the sound of someone knocking on my door.  Sitting up, I was confused \u2013 because I\u2019d given Megan a copy of my room key.  <i>Not for the reason you\u2019re all thinking.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, I slowly walked to the door and opened it \u2013 only to find 3 masked individuals standing there.  Before I could do anything, one of them grabbed me while another put a rag over my face.  The last thing I saw before losing consciousness was the trio carrying me down the stairs.</span></div></div>",

At one point, I think I saw a naked girl with my face coming toward me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke to bright sunlight streaming through my window. I remembered Megan going to get Mr. Jacobs, but where were they? Even if Mr. Jacobs had blown her off, I would have thought Megan would keep me company. \"Megan... ?\" My voice sounded... <i>off.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, excruciatingly slowly, my eyes began to adjust to the light. As I looked around, one thing became clear: <i>this was not my room.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI relaxed. I had been sick. This must be a hospital room. That would explain why Megan and Mr. Jacobs weren't in the room with me. I lay there, picturing the reaction to the news that I was sick. <i>\"First Customs, now this. If you didn't want to come, why didn't you just stay home?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up, and realized that my stomach felt better. I also saw how fancy this room was. Way too fancy to be a hospital room. \"What the... ?\" Again, my voice didn't sound like mine anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down, and couldn't believe what I saw. <i>Breasts?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got out of bed, and saw a full-length mirror. Walking up to it, I saw the closest thing to a familiar sight. My face was the same. Everything else about me, however, was a girl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered Megan showing me the princess's picture, and commenting on how much alike she and I looked. Now, we were even closer in appearance. Identical, I'd say.</span></div></div>",

I had to admit that despite my limited interactions with both of them; I realized I liked the Queen more than her husband.  She actually seemed to show genuine concern about what they were asking me.  She was a rather attractive woman; perhaps in her late 30s.  She was wearing a v-neck dress that showed just a hint of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to thank you, Josh; for consenting to this.\u201d  Looking at me, the Queen said, \u201cYou\u2019re putting your own life on hold to help us.

Out of an abundance of caution, we brought her here to be checked out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, something happened to her here at the hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure how they did it, but three masked men took her from her room in the dead of night.\u201d Taking a deep breath, the <br>\r\nQueen said, \u201cOur only communication with them was a request for 5 million Euros.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m here to cover for her while you get her back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Looking at me, the Queen said, \u201cYou\u2019ll fulfill all her social obligations while our security forces try to find her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say, you\u2019re treating me much differently than your husband is.\u201d With a sigh, I said, \u201cHe seems to view me as nothing more than a tool; while you\u2019re treating me like a human being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s just Harold\u2019s personality.\u201d Looking at me, the Queen said, \u201cI\u2019m sure that, given time, he\u2019ll come around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the King returned with a Doctor; who had two syringes in his hands.

I had to resist the urge to play with them as my face started to get all tingly. <i> I\u2019ll check them out later on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel my hair getting longer as the Queen walked into the room.  Seeing me, she said, \u201cYou seem to be coming along nicely, Josh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was something I wanted to ask you before my husband came in.\u201d sitting next to me, she said, \u201cIf we were to contact your family, how do you think they\u2019d react to this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019d react very well at all.\u201d  My voice started changing at this point; getting higher and developing an English accent.  \u201cThey\u2019re very protective of my brother and me; I spent weeks convincing them that I would be okay on this trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Sighing, the Queen said, \u201cHow would you recommend we explain this to them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you do anything, I\u2019d suggest you get legal protection.\u201d Looking at the Queen, my voice now that of a young British girl, I said, \u201cMy dad\u2019s a lawyer.  I can guarantee he\u2019s not going to like that you did this to me without parental consent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll, as the Americans say, cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point in the transformation, I was a girl from the waist up.  While the doctor assured me I wouldn\u2019t feel any pain or discomfort, I did feel a weird sensation when my penis turned itself into a vagina.  It wasn\u2019t long after that that the changes finished; I was no longer Josh Hamel \u2013 I was now Catherine, Crown Princess of Verthaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the muscle relaxers wore off, and with some help from the Queen, I climbed out of bed to look at myself in the mirror.  I had to admit that the princess, or rather I, was a very attractive girl.  I could no longer resist the urge to feel my breasts; as my hands went up to grab them through the hospital gown.  I played with them for a moment until I realized the Queen was still in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving my hands, blushing, I said, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve just never had breasts before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to apologize to me; I\u2019d be doing the same thing if I were in your position.\u201d  Looking at me, she said, \u201cI suppose now I should mention that, from here on out, you\u2019ll have to answer to the name Catherine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me if I\u2019m not quite ready to call either of you mom or dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cTake as much time as you want...Catherine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I should have asked this before; but why choose me instead of another girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were desperate; afraid that word would leak out to the press.\"  looking at me, the Queen said, \"We would have preferred to use a girl, but then we saw how similar your facial structure was to Catherine's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King returned a few minutes later; walking into the room carrying a garment bag.  \u201cI\u2019m glad to see the procedure was a success.\u201d Handing me the bag, he said, \u201cPlease get dressed; we\u2019ll be leaving for the Palace shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to go into the bathroom when the Queen placed a hand on my shoulder and turned me around.  \u201cThis young man just made a tremendous sacrifice for us, Harold.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI would think that deserves a little gratitude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right, Elena.\u201d Turning to me, the King said, \u201cThank you, Joshua, for your assistance in this matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the best thank you I\u2019ve ever received, but it was good enough.  After the King left, I turned to the Queen and said, \u201cThis was his idea in the first place; you\u2019d think he could be a little more sincere with his gratitude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive him, Catherine; your...father is under a lot of stress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent a little while in the bathroom just standing naked in front of the mirror; getting a good look at my new body.  Other than the one time I accidentally saw Megan getting changed into her bathing suit, this was the first time I\u2019d seen a girl\u2019s naked body.  I just never figured it would be mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eventually got around to putting on the dress; which was similar to the Queens, only this one stopped just above my knees and was red in color.  It definitely did nothing to hide my new figure; if anything I accentuated it.  It then came time to put in the heels that were included in the bag as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took my first careful steps before walking out into the room.  Seeing me, the Queen said, \u201cYou look lovely, Catherine.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that this felt...well, right.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ride to the Palace was about as uneventful as I\u2019d thought it would be.  There were a handful of reporters outside the hospital waiting to catch a glimpse of the Princess...me leaving.  The King and Queen did their best to shield me from the cameras as they ushered me into the limo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we drove through the city streets, the King looked at me and said, \u201cAs far as the staff at the palace is concerned, you\u2019re the real Princess Catherine.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cWe\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t tell them otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course your Majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the King was about to say something; until the Queen said, \u201cHarold, dear, give her time.  She\u2019s not ready to call us Mom and Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, your Majesty is acceptable.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cThere are some rules we want you to follow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of rules?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn light of what\u2019s happened, you\u2019re not permitted to leave the Palace grounds.  We can\u2019t afford to let anything happen to you.\u201d Sighing, he said, \u201cSecondly; we expect you to act as though you really are our daughter; take part in her hobbies, use her mannerisms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen took one look at me and said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you with all that, Catherine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at the Palace gates a few minutes later; to find a large crowd by the gates.  It reminded me of the tourists congregating outside of Buckingham Palace.  They were probably hoping for a chance to spot the King, Queen and me.  As we drove through the gate, into a small wooded area, I caught my first glimpse of the Palace in the distance.  It was truly a spectacular sight; I couldn\u2019t believe that I was going to be living there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the limo arrived at the main entrance, some servants came to help us all out.  One of them, a man in his late 30s, took my hand and said, \u201cWelcome home, Your Highness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed the King and Queen inside the Palace; finding myself inside a large foyer with two large staircases on either side.  While the King went off down a hallway, the Queen looked at me and said, \u201cIt might be a good idea for you to explore a little bit; get the lay of the land as it were.\u201d  Gesturing to an upstairs hallway, she said, \u201cYour bedroom is down that hallway; take your first left then your second right and you\u2019ll find it at the end of the hallway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Thinking this place was turning into a maze, I said, \u201cWhere else might you suggest I check out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would suggest checking out to the Palace grounds; you\u2019ll find a large garden and a stable with several dozen horses.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cDinner will be served in about an hour in the dining room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

However, walking into Catherine's... my bedroom taught me that was <i>nothing</i> like a princess's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, there was what I later learned was called a sitting room, which was the first space I entered. This room contained several chairs, along with a bookcase, a table, and a desk. There was also a life-size portrait of the king and queen on one wall, and photographs of Catherine growing up on the opposite wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two doorways, not counting the one I came in through. One door led to the bathroom, where I saw that Catherine was one of those girls who keeps the sink counter covered with makeup. <i>Oh, crap,</i> I thought, <i>I'm going to have to learn how to do this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom had a second door, which led to the bedroom proper. This room was dominated by a canopy bed. Looking around, I didn't see a TV anywhere. Unless it was hidden, my guess was that the king and queen preferred to watch as a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look around, I did some mental measuring, and figured that my new bedroom took up more space than one floor of the house I grew up in. <i>I could learn to like this,</i> I thought, <i>even love it.</i></span></div></div>",

As I walked through the halls, I lost count of how many rooms I came across \u2013 I\u2019d probably never get to see all of them before I left here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the private dining room to find that the King and Queen were already sitting at the table.  Having watched a lot of Disney, and classic, movies I was surprised to find the table was no bigger than my folk\u2019s dining room table at home.<br>\r\nSeeing me, the Queen said, \u201cHave a seat Catherine; dinner is about to be served.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly took a seat next to the Queen as a servant walked over to me.  \u201cWhat would you like to drink this evening, your highness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to give that a brief thought; before saying, \u201cI\u2019d like a glass of ginger ale, please.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cMy stomach is still a little unsettled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, your highness; I\u2019ll be back momentarily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the servant was gone, the King turned to me and said, \u201cI trust you\u2019re happy with your living arrangements?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d Nodding, I said, \u201cThe bedroom is quite large; almost larger than one floor of my home in the US.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatherine enjoyed her privacy; as I\u2019m sure most teenagers do.\u201d  Looking at me, the King said, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you need while you\u2019re here, just ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised by the King\u2019s sudden generosity; maybe the Queen had spoken with him.  \u201cOf course, your majesty; thank you for the offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the servants came into the room carrying trays of food, as well as my ginger ale.  Once the trays were on the table, they removed the covers \u2013 I saw a lovely seafood dish in front of me.  I was so hungry that I immediately reached for the fork and started eating; only to be interrupted by the Queen clearing her throat.  \u201cMind your manners, Catherine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the fork down, I said, \u201cSorry your majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner was a quiet affair, nothing compared to the noise when my family would eat dinner \u2013 my dad was constantly talking about some legal case he was working on.  Once the dinner was over, I excused myself in order to return to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway up the stairs, I heard the Queen\u2019s voice behind me.  \u201cWait for me, Catherine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping on the stairs, I turned to wait for her and said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to see if you wanted some help; with learning to act like my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I was hoping you could help me with some makeup and hair techniques.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be honored to.\u201d As we continued up the stairs, she said, \u201cBe just like when Catherine was growing up; we\u2019d spend hours putting her hair into different styles.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Rusty raised his mitt, eyeing both his pitcher, the incredible Louis Lewis, and the opposing side's batter.  He flashed the signals to the pitcher: one finger, three fingers, index and pinky (the horns), and four fingers.  The first batter of the game, no outs, count is 0-0.  Under their agreement, that meant the first sign: a nice, easy pitch down the middle.<br>\r\nLewis wound up for the pitch, and Rusty observed the almost dance-like grace in the combining of so many actions into one fluid motion.  Rusty used to be a pitcher himself, but didn't quite have as much of a knack at pitching than catching.  He wouldn't have it any other way than with him behind the plate and Louis Lewis at the mound.  As far as the both of them and Coach were concerned, they had found their indelible positions this season as starting pitcher and catcher for the school's C-team baseball.  Together, the unstoppable duo, they had brought this team to the state championship after countless injuries and hours of practice.  Now was a critical time for the team.  Neither of them could fail.<br>\r\nAs Lewis released, Rusty watched the trajectory of the ball soaring through the air.  Louis Lewis had made perfect aim for the target Rusty gave him.  Rusty opened his glove wide, watching the batter swing his heavy bat into motion jsut a fraction of a second too late.  <br>\r\n\"STEE-RIKE ONE!\"<br>\r\nHalf of the crowd cheered.<br>\r\nRusty set up on the inside of the plate and signaled their code for another fastball.  'Bust him in,' Rusty thought at the climax of Lewis's windup.  This time, the batter overanticipated.  Rusty couldn't help but think about the precise timing and mathematical formulas and science that all went behind this stuff.<br>\r\n\"STEE-RIKE TWO!\"<br>\r\nMore cheers.<br>\r\nOutside now, but still fastball...<br>\r\nLewis shook Rusty off and planted a curveball on the back inside corner.

He had a bit of a late shift, and also had to run a few errands for his family before heading home, which meant it was fairly dark as he approached the crack in the old wooden fence. The alley started off pretty narrow, almost squeezing any who walked through it between two stone gray buildings. However, after the first few paces, it opened up considerably. The cold stone on each side diverted away, revealing small patches of green grass, some of which were equipped with an inviting bench calling any who wished to rest in this most unexpected sanctuary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passed by, one of the benches caught his attention, something was strange about it, but with the lack of light, it was hard to make out why. He decided to step of the pathway and take a look. As his foot quietly rustled the grass, a somewhat noisy clang came from the bench. He was caught off guard by the sound and stood still, squinting to see what was going on. Fortunately, his eyes had become more used to the darkness of the alleyway; it looked like there was someone on the bench. They appeared to be fiddling with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I've seen anyone else in here before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that brief aside to himself, he pressed forward, curious as to who was there and what they were doing. Whoever it was was so engrossed in their task that they didn't notice Neil at all. As he got closer he saw that the person had long, silver looking hair in a pony tail. It was probably a woman. Another clang came from the bench, and Neil's curiosity grew once more. Finally, he was right behind the person, and trying not to be rude, whispered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I don't think I've...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attempted greeting went awry from the start. The person on the bench let out a small shriek of surprise and threw her arms up in the air. At that, Neil jumped back and tried to apologize for scaring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cut short, something dug into his shoulder as he spoke. It felt heavy, and sharp, like a dagger. Before he could even think, Neil began to lose track of his senses and his thoughts, and soon fell to ground unconscious.</span></div></div>",

As his vision cleared, he could see a figure looking down at him, it was the woman from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked in a weak, groggy voice. The look on the woman's face bothered Neil, she was clearly upset about something. She sighed before giving her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't drag this out, the vile I was carrying contained the physical essence of another body. When you startled me, it flew from my grasp and landed in you. Since you have no ability to manipulate ether, it overwhelmed your form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing that gave Neil a headache. He thought to himself that he must not have heard something right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to take you with me now. It will make things clearer, and don't worry about this world, your leaving it will not have many effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Neil struggled to gain some kind of understanding from those words, the woman lifted a pendent lying on her chest; it began to produce a faint green light, and then suddenly, it released a tremendous flash. The light seemed to stay on for a while, but eventually Neil realized that what he was seeing was not the light of the jewel, but of the Sun. It had somehow become broad daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Aldeltia, the land that I come from. The people of this world have a great understanding of the ether.\" As the woman said this, Neil finally got his first good look at her. She was older than him, maybe twenty, and had strange silver colored hair tied in a ponytail. Her clothes were somewhat odd, but looked expensive. Neil still wasn't following what she was saying, but he felt so weak and tired that he just went along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should be able to return you to normal. However, your absorbing the essence from that vile is a serious problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman briefly glanced over her shoulder, then turned back to Neil, biting her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take you somewhere to rest, then we can decide on what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil simply passed out again after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up in yet another place, no longer in the woman's arms, but laying on something soft. Upon opening his eyes, he saw some bright white silk all around. He was in one of those fancy beds with its own curtains all around. Neil finally felt good enough to sit up, and did so, but as soon as he did, he heard something outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's activity in the room, she is awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a door practically being kicked open swiftly followed, through the silk curtains, Neil could see some figures approaching. A hand appeared between the two silk curtains, and parted them, revealing an old man who looked something like a doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, as the transfusion of ether that lead to your body being altered was not intentional, we must very carefully examine you. Please bear with us for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAltered? What did he mean? Neil thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm sorry, I really don't get...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil noticed that his voice was way off, he couldn't even get it to sound like that when your tried on purpose in the past. The doctor just looked on, with an expression that looked half amused, another man was now behind him, perhaps an assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with my voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Neil noticed that his voice wasn't just wrong, it sounded like a girl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey\" he said to test his voice. \"What? I sound, almost like a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old doctor made a light chuckle, and then turned around to face his assistant, who handed him something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is because, you are a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil shook your head when he heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer came from his mouth, instead he only turned and rested a stethoscope on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was cold, very cold. In fact, Neil never felt one as bad as this. He immediately recoiled and crossed his arms over his chest. It actually felt a little sensitive, but he brushed it off and scowled at the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to that? Dip it in ice water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression of amusement returned to the doctor's face returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry it is a good sign, your body seems to have developed healthy nerves. But I think, it's best that you actually find out what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called for his assistant, who brought over a small mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant placed the mirror in front of Neil, but in place of his face, complete with boyish short black hair and brown eyes, Neil saw some girl with a amazingly abundant wavy brown hair and bright green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean that's me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as he said that, the girl in the mirror did the same, and the only voice Neil heard, was not his own, but clearly female and perfectly fitting to the girl staring back at him from the mirror. It caused him to go into a bit of a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Where am I? Is this a dream or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is a serious predicament. We need you to cooperate with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil turned and saw the woman from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! What was in that thing you stabbed me with? What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't stab you.\" She said with a slightly annoyed tone before making an apologetic look and coming closer to you. \"I hadn't noticed you, and when you came up behind me, I was so surprised that I lost my grip on it and threw it into the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Neil pretty much agreed that that was what happened, it felt easier for him to blame her, and so he didn't let off glaring at her in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm sorry, but it can be fixed. We just need you to help us first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelp? Neil didn't know why you should help them with anything after what happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I do anything after being turned into this?\" Neil said pointing to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one will recognize me, and I can't even get over my own reflection. Did you have to make me a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked slightly more impatient after Neil's little outburst. She pushed herself through the bed curtains and leaned on the mattress with one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that it was an accident. I didn't come to cause you any problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost scary, so Neil decided not to snap at her for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, what's done is done. The reason you're in that body is because it is the body of the princess of the caves. She is the one who must communicate with the incarnations of the ether on behalf of all of our people. Without her, we cannot fully understand the ether's feelings and will. Lately the incarnations have seemed angry. We were counting of the princess to calm them, but something went wrong. We barely managed to save her. In the mean time, the incarnations became more and more wild. We ended up forging a new essence to inject into her body to restore it to health, but it ended up in you, and changed you. That's why you are the girl you see in your current reflection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out with her hand and grabbed Neil's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, we need you to take on the role of the princess. You will be a hero to everyone, surely you see out plight? We only need you to remain like this until the true princess is healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Neil could answer, if he was even going to, the doctor interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure that's enough to chew on for now, but we must finish here, so if you would kindly wait outside while we work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded and left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neil had quite an experience going through his examination. Usually, the person being examined is the one most familiar with their body, but it was not so in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the doctors determined that his body was in tact, and they invited the woman from before to return inside as they left. She approached Neil and continued to explain after properly introducing herself for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Cille, I am an ether-caster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil was still upset, but he could clearly see that Cille was sorry for what had happened and was trying to be nice, he deiced to act in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Neil, um, a part time convenience store worker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neil, I know that you are confused by all of this, so I will explain the situation to you, if you are ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last princess of the caves was Tiahara of the royal family. Over the course of the past months, she noted that something was disturbing the ether. She went to the southern caves intending to communicate with its incarnations, but for some reason, they responded violently. We do not know what happened exactly, as usually no one but the princess may enter the caves. I was part of her escort waiting outside. When the ground began shaking, we became concerned. Soon afterward, the caves themselves shook terribly, some of the nearby rock formations even began to collapse. The princess never emerged, so we knew that we would have to go in and find her. After a short while navigating the collapsing underground passages, we found her badly injured on the ground. We almost thought that she had been killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil could not help but feel Cille's pain in retelling the story. She was clearly explaining this for his sake, as she had seen it first hand and probably wished to forget it. Cille paused for a brief while, bringing her sad gaze up towards the roof of the bed that she was sitting on. Neil almost wanted to reach out to her, though there wasn't really anything he could do, and he could tell that Cille wasn't finished. She had paused only to collect herself enough to continue telling the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was then that I saw the incarnations for the first time. I had always imagined them as being benevolent, divine being, however what I saw could not be described in such a way. When I caught my first glimpse, I did not even think that the creatures I saw could be incarnations of the ether that brings us life and happiness. They were monsters, cold and dark. A faint white glow ran through their figures, outlining their body, their arms, their legs, and their heads; it resembled a skeleton, only it was one continuous thing. Around this was some form of transparent flesh, deep purple in color, nearly black. It distorted the skeletons underneath, making them look like a pack of apparitions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCille stopped for a brief moment once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This flesh seemed to be burning off - when ever they moved, I could see a shadow of where they had previous been, but it always broke apart and disintegrated into the air like paper turns to ash when thrown into a fire. The sight of these things terrified me. After I saw them, parading around slamming into the walls, the floor, and roof; I didn't move until someone else grabbed me by the arm and dragged me away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCille turned back to Neil, his face was full of fear and confusion. She reached out with her hand, and took his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to frighten you, but you must know what you will face as the princess. No one else but you can face the incarnations now. No one is allowed into the cave besides the incarnations because they, despite being so monstrous in appearance, seem to fear what they do not know. They will only recognize a handful of people at once, all others will be attacked. I myself did not know this until after I had seen them myself, only then was I, and those with me who had seen the incarnations, allowed to know all about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I have to do? Fight them?\" Neil was left uncertain about being able to confront something as terrible as these incarnations. He felt that beasts so terrible would only kill him, and he felt even weaker in his new body, with its soft quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" The incarnations are being through which people can communicate with the ether. All we need you to do is ask find out from them how well we are using the ether, are we being wasteful? destructive? careless? We cannot know unless the princess goes to them. It is as I have told you, lately they have not been pleased. We are doing something wrong, and we need to find out before something terrible befalls us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Cille moved back towards the edge of the bed, and stood up. She turned away from Neil, and slowly slid away towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should understand now. In the coming days, you will be prepared for this mission. I'm sorry that because of me, you must go through with this, but I personally will ensure that something is done to repay you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left as soon as she finished speaking. Neil was now alone, left to ponder all that he had taken in. Cille had sounded so sincere, but she had also instilled a fear in Neil. The incarnations were not trifle matter; Neil did not know if he was willing to go through with the ordeal. Already, he missed his simple life, even more than the body he had lost.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just by hearing Cille's explanation, Neil had become quite drained. He turned over and attempted to sleep, however, his new figure made that uncomfortable, so he had no choice but to lay on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil slept for quite some time, the entire day past before he woke up. He had nearly forgotten about his predicament in his sleep and almost fell over when he looked in the mirror that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess this is reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil went over to the door, he wanted to find the bathroom and go through his usually prep for the day, but he soon realized that he didn't know where anything was. But just then, the door flung itself open, nearly slamming into Neil's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neil, I am Lutethar, the head of security of this palace. You will need to be trained before you can be sent out to do your job. I will see to it that you are ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming voice only grew louder until a large man entered the room. He wore a silver helmet and some kind of armored vest that was partially covered by his impressive white beard. It was clear that the man, apparently called Lutethar, did not intend to give Neil room to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, due to the nature of the situation, it is very important that we begin training at once. I will bring you to the knights' barracks where you will be prepared and then brought into the field to hone your abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil was caught off guard by this approach and began to have second thoughts on agreeing to be the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this is a bit fast isn't it? I'm not even used to seeing this body yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I get freaked out by my own voice too. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are all things that will be put behind you. A good warrior can overcome fears and anxieties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man firmly placed his fist over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make you a good warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLutethar began to step closer, all the while seemingly becoming larger in Neil's terrified eyes. However, a now familiar voice interrupted, much to Neil's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCille stepped in and bowed to Lutethar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that he is ready yet. Not just mentally, but physically. He must learn to use that body as if it was his own. Let me take him for a few days, then I will turn him over to you. This will make things quicker, I am sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLutethar ran through his beard with one hand, while he placed the other behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I do suppose that you may be right. If you so insist, I'll let you go through with it. Just do not forget what is at stake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave what looked vaguely like a salute to Cille, who returned the gesture, and then exited promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil fell back on the floor, trying to calm his pounding heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Who was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like he said, he leads all the warriors here at the palace. Lutethar is one of the most talented soldiers this world has ever seen. But he's much less amazing in other areas like conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCille smiled and worked over to help Neil up. When he was on his feet, she covered his mouth and whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we are alone, I can tell you what I really came here for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly stepped back towards the door and shut it quietly before returning to Neil's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't help but feel sorry for getting you into this, and I decided that I should do something for you before you go and confront the ether for our sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably miss your world. I can take you there and let you see your people once more before facing the incarnations. This will also help you become used to your body, so we will still be obeying Lutethar's orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil didn't need to hear anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take me there, I've only been gone for a short time, but I miss home so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCille rested her hand on Neil's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we can go shortly, but I must explain some things to you. Firstly, this is my doing, I did not ask for permission, so no one must find out. Second your world does not share time with this one, so we can go back to the moment you vanished as if you never left. This can only be done going to your world however, as we need to be linked to this world to travel. The link will be affected by time. Third, don't forget that no one will recognize you, so you need a new identity if you want to talk to anyone. Lastly, the longer we are there, the more people might notice your disappearance. Unless you can get around this, we might only be able to visit there for a limited time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil merely nodded, no matter what needed to be done, he wanted to go back and experience his old life, hoping that it would not be the final the time.</span></div></div>",

Please don't careless make a mistake. What will we tell your family who will be looking for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil's face drooped, but he knew that Cille was right. He turned around and began thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't speak to them... I know! I'll send them a text.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to see Cille's confused face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a text?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil soon realized that telling her exactly what it was wouldn't amount to much good, because she would probably then ask what a cell phone was. He hadn't been here long, but it seemed to a world built around magic, or ether, so he guessed it was like all those magical worlds he saw on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like a letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut upon saying that, he realized that he had not seen any of his possessions since he came here. He had kept his things in his pockets, but a quick look down reminded him that he was no longer in his own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cille, do you know where my clothes and things are? I'll need them to send the text.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked past him to a chest placed a corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything you had with you is in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the chest and stepped aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil walked over and looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be in my pocket here... Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a small black phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just in case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reach in and searched his clothing, eventually taking out a ring of keys and his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that this is all I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back down at the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's probably all I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCille smiled and grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you are ready to return to your world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil smiled back and gave a large nod.</span></div></div>",

He knew that he probably would not be able to see anyone, but it would give him some time to himself, just to feel more comfortable. Cille reached for her necklace. The pendant once again began to radiated its light, and suddenly the room was left empty. When the light receded, Neil saw nothing but perfect darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cille?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a hand on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil's sight adjusted. He was merely standing in the dark while his eyes were used to light. Soon, the bench where his adventure started came into view. A smile grew on the recently crowned princess's face. Neil turned and saw the paved path, the tame grass, and the pathway squeezed between the grey stony buildings. He truly was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon this realization, Neil began to sprint down the path in the same direction that he had been traveling earlier, but he did not keep his momentum. His legs slowed, and the hair flowing behind him fell back onto his neck and shoulders. He was not himself, and that meant he could not truly go home. His family would not accept him, at least not under the current circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could try to bump into them tomorrow during the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil felt something cradle him, and them turn him around.

It will be easier to see them later. I'm going to visit a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCille got up off the ground and offered a hand to Neil to pull him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you call yourself? And what about me? I don't understand this world very well, so I shouldn't try to talk with anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about that. I will tell you as we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil led Cille to a large park. They followed a trail through some trees and came to a small enclosed field. Within it was a girl kicking a soccer ball around. She was doing more than just playing, her breathing was heavy. She was working out pretty hard. Neil merely stood with Cille and watched the girl as she kicked the ball at some trees and then chased after it and kicked it again. After a bit of time, she missed one of her shots, and the ball came bouncing down the field towards Neil. The girl turned around and noticed that she had not been alone. When Neil saw her face, he lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sorry, we didn't mean to stare. We just happened to be walking through this place and noticed you playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil walked over to the girl with the ball in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to worry about, I don't mind. Just getting a bit of exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked over Neil and Cille quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember ever seeing you around here. Did you move from somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCille subtly looked over at Neil who presented the ball to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more of a vacation. I'm not from here at all, I'm only briefly visiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl noticed the pair's rather exotic clothing and became curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are from then? And my name is Analise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil cleared his throat, he was a little nervous, but there was no turning back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Nel, the princess of Andelta. This is my bodyguard, Cille.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil motioned toward Cille who hurriedly bowed after catching Neil's mispronunciation of Aldeltia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, a real princess! I'm honored to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a big deal Analise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil caught himself acting a little too familiar with Analise, and tried to make something up to cover himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually like to get away from being a princess from time to time. I really enjoy living a simpler life every now and then. That's why I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it alright if I call you Nel then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil nodded although it still felt a little strange, even if his new name was almost the same as his old one. He was getting a bit worried about Analise asking about where he came from, and his supposed duties as a princess. Although he technically wasn't lieing, telling the truth probably wouldn't work out well. Neil decided to avoid the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Analise, is it alright if I join you? Your exercise looks like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it alright in that dress? I mean it looks valuable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Neil thought his clothing was valuable, it wouldn't have stopped him. He was so glad to be talking to a familiar face again and not worry about terrible monsters. In the corner of his eye, another tear began to form, but he closed his eyes and hid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem. This dress isn't really all that special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnalise giggled a little and motioned for \"Nel\" to follow her. The two girls laughed as the played together, and Cille couldn't help but smile as she looked on.</span></div></div>",

Both of them were silent, simply waiting for the sun to retire for the day. When it finally fell below the horizon, Analise let herself fall backwards and land on the grassy hillside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to believe that I've been out here so long. I just met you Nel, but it doesn't feel that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil set himself down next to Analise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? I feel the same way. Maybe we used to do things like this in another life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter broke out between the two. It steadily faded into silent smiles, which prompted Analise to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a lot of fun today Nel. I kind of wish I could run into someone like you everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remember than Analise. I'll be leaving here very soon, but I'll make sure that you'll have more days like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnalise walked behind Neil, and moved around until she was to his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let me get in the way of your duties as a princess. I'll wait until you can come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel walked up to Analise and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll miss you, Analise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater than night, Neil and Cille were wandering through town looking for a place to sleep. They had left the park, saying that Nel had to attend to a meeting with her family, though as soon as they were out of sight, the two of them dispensed with their act. However, Neil had not thought about what to do after this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Cille, I didn't think far enough ahead. I can't afford to rent a hotel room or anything, and I can't go home since my family wouldn't recognize me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, if the need arises, I will make a small barrier that we can hide in for the night. Have you decided who you want to see next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil remained silent for a moment, still focused on the street sidewalk in front of him. Cille did the same. It was only after they reached the next block when Neil responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cille?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that when we're in the other world, Aldeltia, that time here stops, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. If we left now and then came back after many years in Aldeltia, it would still be this night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that it might be easier if I go into the caves and return before anyone realizes that I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do you want to go back now, Neil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there's one thing I need to do first.\"</span></div></div>",

No doubt the city was replete with inns, but with her small budget, it would be difficult to get a place to rest somewhere safe. Not to mention she wasn't sure how to find the inns.

Now that she could rest, she found herself smiling at the lively antics of the bard. He had the crowd roaring with laughter at a comedic rendition of how a blind man kissed a horse, thinking it to be his shrewish wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, dear.\" The proprietress appeared at her elbow with a steaming plate heaped with food.

After a few minutes she breathed in deeply and looked at him. A strand of curly brown hair escaped from its braid and fluttered around her face before she tucked it back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember tha farmlands?\" she whispered. He nodded. \"All the other girls would stare at me, call me silly or stupid, because I didn't want to be a princess. And they did. Why couldn't they have come to the castle and looked after the king's children? Why did he choose me? And why do I have to do this now? I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in silence again, Christopher unable to think of an answer that would comfort her, and Tia preparing herself for the impossible task of being princess. She stood suddenly, spread her arms and let the wind hold her for a moment, before climbing off of the roof and back into the castle's tower, where the prince's men were waiting to accompany her back to Agui.</span></div></div>",

I had hair the colour of ravens wings - many had said that it was as dark as the night. Tears slipped down my bronzed cheeks from blue eyes. Those lily coloured eyes had been the cause of much wooing from nobles in the past, as much as I hated it, but today the lily had turned to a sea of tears. It was not everyday that my good father, the great king of all Palistia, died. Now tears flowed freely. Nothing in Palistia would ever be the same again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smoothed my blue silk dress, the colour of mourning in Palistia, rose gracefully and walked to the door. I was followed by a train of maidens, also in mourning blue. Philip, my faithful guard, fell in step behind me and my maids respectfully distanced themselves from him. The palace at Susawa was the greatest in Palistia. Great marble pillars flanking the hallway towered high into the roof. Windows as tall as three men on top of each other stood proud on my right - this was only a small corridor in a small wing of the majestic palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe swept past the pillars and windows, across the glassy surface until we came to a stairway. My mind was dull with grief and anxiety. My brother was now the King of Palistia, yet he was young - only sixteen summers - and inexperienced in this dangerous world. He knew more than me, his little fifteen-year-old sister, but I knew that we were both in a very dangerous situation. We had not been able to speak privately together since our father's death, but I was sure he thought the same as me: our father was murdered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reached the foot of the staircase and I paused as Medrek stepped out from beside a pillar and approached. He was the only person left in the world apart from my brother whom I trusted. Standing six feet five, he could be rather intimidating with his massive bulk, but he had kind eyes and a gentle face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mara.\" He was one of few in the kingdom who could call me that. I liked the way my name rolled off his tongue, but I brushed such thoughts aside. He was serious. He wanted my attention. \"May I speak to you about something?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would go to the little garden temple to mourn my father today. The garden temple was my favourite place to mourn and be alone. It was so comforting down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued up another corridor before reaching a half-room opening out onto a garden. This was my little garden. I wandered through the garden, the gentle evening breeze caressing my honeyed skin. A fountain, a serene pool, some birds singing in nearby trees, and a stone path leading to a temple. The great golden pillars were not as big as those in the palace, but they were nonetheless grand. I walked up the stairs and a priest advanced to meet me. Along either side of the room were statues of different precious metals and woods, and at the end an alter. A sacred silence hung respectfully over the whole building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI exchanged some words with the priest and advanced slowly to the alter. My servants and the priest remained behind me, the women kneeling on the ground in traditional lamenting, and the priest stood, his eyes closed, waving his hands over the scene and murmuring - I knew he was praying to the gods for my father's soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knelt before the alter and bowed my head. <i>Oh, Samika, beautiful goddess, be with the spirits of my parents. Watch over us and bring peace on the palace and the whole realm. Do not deny your blessing on my and my brother's head. Please be -</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shriek and I spun around. Ten guards, armed with swords and spears, had burst into the temple and were advancing on me. I knew they had come to kill me.</span></div></div>",

My loyalty lay with my brother, Medrek, my country, the memory of my father. \"Yes, I will go.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well. We have little time. We leave immediately. When we leave this room, you must order all except one of your servants to stay where they are. Is your guard reliable?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Philip is loyal to me until death.

You email them back that you will be going and start getting ready. You take leave, have your daughter stay with your wife, and pack everything up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about a week you get on the plane and start flying over. Not only did they pay for your tickets, they also bought you first class.  With the great seating and the free alcohol the 12 hour flight felt much shorter. Before long you were in Tokyo/Narita.

The older of the two men appears to be about 60 years old, and both the younger man and the woman appear to be in their twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Koichi.\" The older man says. \"I am your Uncle, Daisuke. This is your cousin, Noburu and his wife, Aiko. Welcome to our home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir.\" You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very welcome. Come, let's give you a tour of the house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up the stairs and he let's you into the house. The house seems somehow even bigger on the inside. You never knew a home could have so many rooms. Some are devoted to family heirlooms, including two full sets of samurai armor. No matter where you go however, a servant is not far. Most are cleaning, but others are standing by in case a family member would require assistance. The tour ends at your room. It is incredibly comfortable looking, but also quite feminine, must be because it is a guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you would like, you can rest. You must be incredibly jet lagged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only just noticed, now that he's brought it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I think I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he has left you get undressed and go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would have too, up until I saw your email. Luckily I caught it before my father. I knew I couldn't hide you forever, however there is one loophole in succession. You have to be a man, and since I am not willing to have you killed. I will simply render you unfit for succession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to contemplate what is happening you feel a prick, and it all goes dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly regain your senses. You are back in your bed it must have been a dream. But when you look up you see you are sadly mistaken, it happened and it was finished. You get up and look in the mirror, they were thorough, someone would be insane to think you were previously a man. You have no hair save that on your head, your eyebrows and a small patch pointing to your biggest change. They somehow changed your entire body type, from fairly straight from top to bottom, to a slight hourglass, extenuated by your Double D breasts.  Even your face is completely different, now you legitimately feel you are cute, with big eyes, soft lips, and a subtle nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to get chilly, you decide to get some clothes. There are some in the wardrobe. Regrettably, all of the underwear is full blown lingerie. You grab some lilac lace and put them on. Now you look for some day to day clothes, but you can't even find any pant. You look in the closet and realize you only have dresses.

You were very careful however, not to be visible to her.  The last thing you wanted was for this woman to know you were still living at home.  Of course, it wasn't unlikely that your parents would bring it up in their conversation anyway as if it were no big deal.  Still, the least you could do was preserve the idea in your head that no one but your parents and yourself knew your current living situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your friends had gone off to college.  Some of them were already kickstarting their careers.  You had tried that, but your own insecurities and fear of failure led you down a dark rabbit hole and back to your parents house.  No college degree, no job training, no career.  Your mother treated it as if you were experiencing a slight set back and acted as if you'd be back on your feet at any given moment.  Your father however did not hold back his disappointment.  He kept reminding you that your situation at home was temporary and that you WOULD be leaving after a certain amount of time had left, whether you had your shit together or not.  The truth was, you had absolutely no idea which direction you were going to take in your life.  The future terrified you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn abrupt knock at the door pulled you away from your self pitying thoughts.  <i>How strange,</i> you thought. <i>Could my parents be done talking already?</i>  You took a brief glance out the window. Your parents were still chatting away with your former friend's mother.  <i>Who could be at my door then?</i> You wondered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly smoothed your hair, and made sure you did not look like a basement dweller and walked over to your bedroom door.  When you opened it however, there was no one on the other side.  Just an empty space and the stairs a few feet away. You shut the door, wondering if you were imagining things when the knocking sounded you again, startling you.  This time you realized the knocking was not coming from your bedroom door.  It was coming from your closet!</span></div></div>",

Another thing around the room is that it has just a mattress, where the other two rooms still have beds in them.

Also, even though it is impossible to see for you, under the dress your legs become smooth and small, your hips are wider, your penis is smaller and under it a small slit already appeared. Also your underwear, which you didn't change because they were still dry, changed from black boxers to blue panties.<br>\r\nAfter a while wandering through the corridors of the mansion you hear a sound and you decide to go to the source of it.

Panicking you try to rip it off, but it just accelerates the growth of the skirt, or now, gown, unti it completely covers your torso, and forms little puffy sleves, two inches away from your now gloved hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a mirror, you reluctantly look at the damage, and you see that you're dressed in a blue princess gown and gloves, like some girl from school.

You quickly thought, wait, you said, in the hands  we're many not will carry away and we have no pocket. Stay on the road watch if you see anyone coming, I'm going to look for something to carry the food . Emily nodded to you and you went scouting the farm. You've seen the farmhouse and its grounds: corrals for animals, barn where you can hear the noise of cows, a barn for wheat with flour, a house, ridges with planted plants and a strange small house with a door without windows. Suddenly you heard a noise from the house and ran into the house with no windows, there was very little space inside, everything was littered with tools and things different.You managed to cover yourself with a big basket, the man who came in, opened the door and threw some empty sack at you and left. Coming out of his hiding place you took the sack on the denser and returned to Emily, she waiting that you have been long. She quickly scored a sack full of food, and we continued on our way. Some time later the sun was already at sunset, the road led to the dense forest and in its depths we found an abandoned house with a clean stream.It was a big luck for Emily and me ,better than nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Soon outside you heard a noise and looked through the windows, the forest was searched  a group in four Palace guards. You knew right away they were looking for you and Emily, as soon as you left the window, Emily said you: come here I found a hidden basement in the living room under the carpet. Without wasting time you went down to the basement and covered the door with a carpet, after 10 minutes, the Palace guards entered the house and searched all the corners in the rooms but you were not found and came to the conclusion that in the house already nobody  lives and went farther into the woods. You and Emily breathed a sigh of relief and returned to the living room. In the kitchen because of the Cabinet you fetch stash, sack of food, and  a pitcher went to the stream to collect water and firewood . The night you lit the fireplace, warming himself and talked to Emily. When you started asking Emily what she wanted to do next, she said thoughtfully that she didn't know yet; and then asked me what I want. I think that when you all will be fine I will find a way to get into my world to my home, you said. So you from another world surprised said Emily, I never thought that there might be other worlds. Tell me how you our world got here she asks you. You all talk and talk and Emily listens with great interest until you see that she falls asleep and carry her to the bed in the bedroom. But as soon as you moved away from the bed Emily woke up and thought:What did you mean when you said you wanted to help me, she asked? You're not sure asked: if you really want to stay a boy or if you want to be a girl again? Emily thought seriously: I'm used to being a boy, but since we met, I always remember myself my old life;I'd like to be with you all the time; but if there's a way to remove the spell, e can be friends when I'm a girl again. of course you said,  if there is a way we obizatelno will find him. It made Emily happy: please  stay with me a little longer. You sat down on the bed until she fell asleep, she  asked you: I wonder what he is your world? Then, abruptly, drowsily opened she eyes and asked:Tell me about your world! And you talked about your world, and Emily kept asking you questions about your world, you kept talking and talking until the two of you noticed you were both fell asleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You shake yourself, realizing what you are doing and quickly put on a blouse, skirt and boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou straighten and make sure it's tucked in and neat, this time without thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you do so, you notice the bathroom, and the window. You go over to it, and look down. There is a long way down. But you have all these clothes. And it's outside in the courtyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the building you see what you think is the building where the closet to your world is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the door where Matt is still watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long,\" She looks at you, measuring you. You suspect you look girly to her. \"Did you try on every dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a window in the bathroom. If we wait til nightfall we can tie up the dresses and make a rope and go directly to the building with a gate home,\" ignoring the all too real implication of your momentary lapse into femininity as you look out  door and Matt goes to dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would take a long time, and I'm not sure we should stay here too long,\" Matt says,  as she come out in a pink lace party dress that looks absolutely adorable on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point,\" and you do, looking at Mattie. She's clearly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lets--\"</span></div></div>",

Yesterday, you were an average high school student boy, looking forward to the up coming summer vacation. Now, thanks to a freak TG (Trans-Gender) Dust incident, you were suddenly regressed back in age to a toddler! The good news was that you still had your original mind with all of your memories and intelligence. The bad news was that you had lost all control over your bladder so diapers became a necessary evil of which your little, now big sister loved to torment you with by insisting on changing and caring for you in her own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought back to the incident, you were not certain if it was fortunate, or unfortunate that you were the only victim.  Unknown to you at the time, some man had stolen a vial of the pure stuff from some secret, government run research facility. Security teams were immediately sent out to capture him and the dangerous substance he had taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking home from the last day of school for the summer when you saw what only could have been a car chase on the road.  The car in the lead suddenly lost control and rammed into a tree.  The driver, shaken, but unhurt, left the vehicle and ran with something in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's going on.\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as three men in the pursuit vehicle poured out and gave chase.  As the lead man came near, you stepped aside, not wanting to be a part of it. But then, one of the pursuing men caught him by the legs and he fell, unintentionally throwing the vial that was in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few seconds played out in slow motion as you did not see the vial coming and it struck you in the head, releasing all of its contents onto you!  You coughed as you breathed in some of the dust and the rest of it quickly burned through your clothing and became absorbed into your skin.  That was when the changes occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken to the research facility by force, not that you could have given any resistance in your new tiny, toddler form. There, they ran a number of tests, again weather you liked it or not, then contacted your parents and informed them of the situation before returning you home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were very fortunate.\" said one of the government doctors. \"That TG dust could have transformed you into literally ANYTHING. You could have ended up as a girl, an animal, or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mind returned to the present, you remembered being told that, because the TG dust was in its most pure form, the transformation was most likely permanent and you would have to grow up all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those IDIOTS!\" you thought. \"If that dust was so dangerous why didn't they keep it in a safer place than some dinky little safe in an office!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw your fist onto the floor with all of your infantile strength then began to shake with frustration until you felt a warm dampness against your skin. You had just peed into your diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAHHHHH!\" you screamed. \"NOT AGAIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard someone coming into the room. You looked up to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you're waving, to your surprise, you spot Professor Murdoc and your, former, classmates.  Pointing them out to Jacie, you say, \"Wonder why they're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into her role, Jacie says, \"Mother and Father must've invited them as a way to say sorry for our 'kidnapping.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of mother and father, you spot them walking towards you.  Smiling, Jacie and you walk over to them.  As the four of you are 'reunited,' father says, \"You two look beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you say, \"Thank you father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the four of you head over to a podium where Jacie and you are introduced to your country.  After the applause died down, both Jacie and you spoke about how good it was to be home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking some photos, the four of you were escorted to a waiting limo and taken to the palace.  On your way to the palace, you say, \"Father, why were our old classmates, and our professor, in the audience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought letting them have front-row seats to your 'return,' would make them feel better about your 'kidnapping.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Jacie, then back to your father, you say, \"Would it be alright if Jacie and I met with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your mother, then back to you, your father says, \"That would be okay.  But, if you don't mind my asking, why would you want to see them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would like to express our sorrow about the loss of their friends.  Also, it would be a good way for us to say goodbye to our old lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable,\" smiling, your father says, \"I'll have it arrainged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you father.\"</span></div></div>",

You spot two king sized canopy beds on one side of the room, with a walk-in closet and bathroom for each of you.  In one corner of the room, you spot a sitting area with a couch, recliners, and a big screen TV.  In another corner, you spotted a desk with 2 top of line laptops, one for each of you, sitting on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you look at Alina and Veronika.  \"Thank you for showing us to our chambers,\" pausing, you say, \"We'd like to be alone, until dinner, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina, bowing, says, \"As you wish, m'lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the door closes, you look at Jacie with a smile, \"Can you believe this all ours!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on her bed, Jacie says, \"I know!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacie sat on her bed, you walked over to the, almost floor to ceiling, window.

You also discovered how soft your skin had become; as well as how sensative your new equipment was; not realizing that you were moaning the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied about your body, you decide to start taking a shower.  Stepping out 10 minutes later, you receive a towel from Alina.

That was the dress I was going to suggest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Alina's, and Veronika's help, both Jacie and you were dressed in about 20 minutes.

Walking you over to a bench she, like a gentlemen, helps you get seated.  As Kelly takes a seat next to you, you say, \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Kelly says, \"Anything for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that you, remembering a high school dance from a few years ago, start giggling.  \"That reminded me of the first time you and I danced together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly thinks about that and says, \"I remember that too; you said you'd do anything for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, that's right.\" pausing, you say, \"T-that was also the first time I realized that I was in love with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" blushing, Kelly says, \"That was when I realized I was in love with you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things sure have changed since then.\" pausing, you say, \"Do you think there's a chance we'll...fall in love again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kelly, you suddenly have the urge to kiss her.  While the girl part of you wanted to kiss Kelly, the small part of you that was still a boy was hesitant.  Realizing that you were no longer a boy, you decide to give into the urge.  Standing up, carefully, you turn to face Kelly.  \"Stand up, Vladimir.  I don't want to do this sitting down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Kelly says, \"Do what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never answer the question, as you wrap yourself around Kelly and kiss her on the lips.  Neither of you could remember ever feeling so good; as you stood on the balcony kissing.  After a few moments, you break the kiss and, smiling, say, \"I didn't want to do that sitting down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Kelly gets back into her Vladimir personality. \"I love you, Princess Josefine, and I have from the moment I laid eyes on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you say, \"I love you too, Prince Vladimir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When should we tell our parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can tell them tomorrow over breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kelly drops her Vladimir personality.  Whispering, she says, \"I wonder if Joey and Allison are doing the same thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the ballroom, you say, \"I don't know; maybe they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the two of you didn't know was that Allison had escorted Joey to the room where you'd talked with your mother.  The two of them had the same talk; where Allison admitted that, although she pretended to hate Joey and you, she was only hiding her feelings.  The two of them had been kissing for the last 10 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the ball went by quickly; with Jacie and you dancing with some of the other guests.  Once the ball was finished, Alina and Veronika escorted the two of you back to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the room, you turn to Alina and Veronika.  \"I know this is highly unorthodox, princesses becoming such good friends with their servants, but we were wondering if you'd like to have a slumber party tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter discussing it with Veronika, Alina turned to you and said, \"We'd be honored to, M'lady.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is my first slumber party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you, Jacie says, \"Well we could, I can't believe I'm saying this, give each other makeovers or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore turning into a girl the idea of a makeover sounded boring.  Now, however, you were excited.  \"That sounds like fun.  What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my sister threw a lot of slumber parties.  She would always talk about boys, or music.  She, and her friends, would stay up all night talking, or singing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do that.\" pausing, you say, \"We can find out if Alina or Veronika are seeing anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacie, unknown to you, was feeling a little depressed all of a sudden.

While you wanted to give her some space, your new found twin telepathy told you something was wrong.  Getting up, you walk outside to the balcony.  Stepping outside you see Jacie standing by the railing, crying.  Walking over to her, you say, \"Come on Jacie, I know something's bothering you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you, in tears, Jacie says, \"Next week's Ashley's birthday; and I'm going to miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling Jacie into a hug, you say, \"You miss your family, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do.\"  Crying into your shoulder, Jacie says, \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss my family too.\" tearing up, you say, \"But w-we have to put that behind us now; we're princesses now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish there was a way we could let them know we're alright.\"  Looking at you, Jacie says, \"I mean, they think we're dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking to yourself for a moment, you say, \"I have an idea how we can let our families know we're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We talk father into letting us visit the States to see our families.  We can tell them that we're okay, and happy with our new lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Alina and Veronika walking into the room, you say, \"We'll talk to father tomorrow at breakfast.\" pausing, you say, \"I have something else to tell him as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you, Jacie says, \"Really?

You gave each other makeovers, had pillow fights, and had snacks brought up from the kitchen.  You also found out that Alina was engaged to Sacha, your 'kidnapper;' and Veronika was dating Mickiel the photographer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the first to wake up the next morning, around 7:30.  Opening your eyes, you saw that everyone else was asleep; Alina and Veronika in sleeping bags on the floor; while Jacie and you were in sleeping bags on the couches.  As you sat up you remember them insisting that Jacie and you sleep on the couches, saying that it would be inappropriate for the two of you to sleep on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the urge to pee, you quietly get up and walk to the bathroom.  You were washing your hands a few minutes later when the door opened, to revealed a startled Alina.  \"So sorry m'lady.  I didn't know you were in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you say, \"It's alright Alina.  Come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina hesitated for a moment, before walking over to the toilet.  Sitting down, she says, \"Did you enjoy the slumber party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did, very much.\" pausing, you say, \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did as well, m'lady.  Until Lady Jacie and yourself came, Veronika and I were the youngest people here.  It's nice to have girls our age to spend time with.\" flushing the toilet, she says, \"Even if they're members of the Royal Family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We feel the same way, Alina.  Back when we were men, Jacie and I had friends, who were girls, that we'd occasionally hang out with.  But,\" smiling, you say, \"I must say that Veronika and yourself are the first we can consider girl friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronika and Jacie woke up a short time later.

Wanting to say good morning to Vladimir, you look at Alina and say, \"Could you give us a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing, Alina says, \"Of course m'lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to Vladimir, as Jacie walked over to Nickolai.  Putting your arms on his shoulders, you say, \"Morning my prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Lady Josefine, you look beautiful this morning.\"  Smirking, he says, \"Are you sure you were a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite Vladimir.  If any part of me was still a boy,\" smiling, you say, \"Would I do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVladimir never got the chance to ask what 'this' was, as you kissed him on the lips.  As the two of you kissed, on the foyer, you thought to yourself, \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Never in a million years would I have thought I'd be in love with a prince!! But this feels <b>GREAT</b></i></span>!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped kissing a few minutes later, realizing you'd kept the servants waiting.  Pulling away from Vladimir, you see Jacie pulling away from Nickolai.  Smiling, you say to yourself, \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Yeah, there's no way we're still boys.</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone arrived in the dining room a few minutes later.  While Alina and Veronika helped Jacie and you into your seats, you saw Vladimir and Nickolai sit down directly opposite from you.  After excusing Alina and Veronika you waited for Father, mother and Vladimir's parents to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only had to wait a few mores, before you heard the door open.  Standing up, with everyone else, you turn to the door as a servant says, \"Announcing his majesty King Marcus and his wife, Queen Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bowed as your parents entered the room, followed soon after by Vladimir's parents.  Once everyone was seated, you sat down to breakfast.</span></div></div>",

We're going a little stir crazy here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely.\" smiling, Father says, \"It's the perfect opportunity to present each of you with a present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, two servants came in; each of them carrying a box.

That's interesting, what happened next?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We started to follow the guide when he led us to a room and asked us to enter, and almost as soon as we did we fell into a trapdoor falling about 10 feet into a pile of hay with Jake following right behind me.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch I bet that didn't feel very good did it?\" He asked while laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it didn't hurt me at all I don't know about Jake though.\" You said giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that we followed the King and Queen into a hall where there they explained what the purpose of the sign was for.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was the purpose of the sign?\" He asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make a long story short, they needed us to be their heir, or rather heirs as the case may be, and while the King and Queen would've loved to have a biological heir of their own, it turns out they can't have children. To make matters worse, there was a rumor going around that they had a child, but were keeping her out of the country to avoid spoiling her and making her unfit to lead. While the rumor was that there was only one child, they were sure a rumor that the royal twins were coming home would make everyone forget that detail of the original rumor.\" You said taking a breath after that explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like they had a major problem on their hands.\" He said scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me at the time it sounded like quite a story, and I wasn't even sure that they were even the real King and Queen yet, Jake seemed convinced though and wanted to do it, so they asked me if I wanted to do it as well, and after thinking about it for a few moments I decided to go ahead and do it as well, after agreeing they gave us a tour of our new home and sent us back to the hotel as to not raise suspicion.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you both did a good job hiding it from the rest of us most people would have been giddy as could be.\" He said teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but we had to, if anyone found out, things could've ended up pretty bad.\" You countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, what about the kidnapping that happened the day after the class tour, that wasn't just a random kidnapping either was it?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your quick to catch on, no that kidnapping wasn't a coincidence, the King and Queen had planned the whole thing out in advance as a way to get us away from the class without drawing any suspicion to them.\" You mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was actually a pretty clever idea and looks like it paid of.\" He pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me, after the kidnapping happened we were taken to a room in the castle and waited there until after the King and Queen's formal apology and announcement of the arrival of their heirs, Princess Josefine and Princess Jacie at the same time.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that, why exactly did they make you princesses?\" He asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, me and Jake were surprised as could be at hearing the name princess, so we asked the king and Queen about it, and as it turns out, Manonia is a matriarchal monarchy, meaning only Princesses can inherit the throne.\" You replied. \"To add the finishing touches on the plan, they needed us to be on a plane so that we'd become their heiresses, and wouldn't just suddenly appear in the castle, the rest after that is pretty much what led up to this.\" You say finally finishing you explanation of how this all happened. \"Okay I've told you how this happened to us, now it's your turn.\" You say eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright here's how I ended up in my situation.\" He said as he started his story.</span></div></div>",

As he sat up on the hotel bed, he could not help but feel a little anxious about what was going to happen today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was getting up to go to the bathroom, he heard his phone vibrate; telling him he\u2019d received a text.  Looking at it, he saw that he\u2019d gotten a text from an unknown number that said, \u201cAlley by north end of Liberty Park; 8;30 AM.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew exactly what that meant; but it did pose a problem for him.  The group he was with was scheduled to leave for a museum tour at 8:00; he had to find a way to get out of it.  As he got into the shower, he said to himself, \u201cI suppose I could tell the professor I <br>\r\nwas sick and couldn\u2019t get out of bed; he might believe that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the professor did believe him; and when 7:55 rolled around he was lying in bed when Jake walked into the room.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re sick; and not trying to get out of this lame tour?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really am sick, Jake; I guess I ate something last night that isn\u2019t sitting too well with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever man, I hope you feel better.\u201d Chuckling, Jake said, \u201cWhen we get back from the tour; perhaps you and I could hit the town and find some local girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Little does he know that I\u2019ll soon be one of the local girls,</i></span>\u201d looking at Jake, Joey said, \u201cSounds like fun, man; see you when you get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake walked out of the room, he had no idea he would never see his best friend again.  Joey stayed in for another 10 minutes or so to make sure everyone had left; once he was satisfied they had gone, he got dressed.  Just as he was leaving the room, he looked around and wondered if there was anything he wanted to bring with him to his new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over, decided to grab an old photo of him and his sister when they were kids.  As he walked out of the room for the last time, he looked down at the photo and was amused by the fact that his sister was dressed as a princess; something which he <br>\r\nwas about to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for him to reach the alley; walking around until he saw a nondescript truck parked towards the end.  As he made his way towards it, he wondered if those in the truck knew what was going on; if so he wondered how they felt about him becoming their princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the truck, he was quickly surrounded by several people in uniform.  Joey quickly realized they were Palace Security <br>\r\nguards.  One of them walked over to him and, in a Russian accent, said, \u201cAre you Joseph Warner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were beginning to think you wouldn\u2019t show; that you would get cold feet about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, I don\u2019t get cold feet.\u201d Following the man inside the truck, Joey said, \u201cI know it\u2019s weird that I\u2019m even considering this; but I figure becoming female is a small price to pay to have a better life for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is not my place to judge you for your decision.\u201d Handing Joey a vest with what looked like small firecrackers on it, the man said, <br>\r\n\u201cPut this on; at the push of a button it will simulate gunshot wounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joey put the vest on under his shirt, he said, \u201cWhat exactly is the plan here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as if on cue, a young woman appeared in the doorway at the front of the truck.  She looked to be wearing a somewhat expensive outfit and looked like an exact duplicate of Princess Natasha.  Walking over to Joey, she said, \u201cThe plan is that I\u2019ll pretend to be the Princess while she\u2019s walking  through the park.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cAt some point a security guard posing as a disgruntled citizen will shoot my bodyguards and kidnap me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess; I\u2019ll come to your rescue and get shot in the process?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Smiling, the girl said, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad you\u2019re going to become the princess; not only are you smart but you\u2019re cute as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for Joey to get the rest of the details from the girl; whose name was Beatrice.  Once everything was squared away, Joey said, \u201cSo I guess we should get this over with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d Smiling, Beatrice said, \u201cOnce this is done I look forward to being your bodyguard, Princess Natasha.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As he made his way there, he saw the horse drawn carriage carrying Beatrice heading towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping at the pre-arranged spot, Joey waited until his cue; watching as the crowd of onlookers waved and tried to snap pictures of the woman they thought was their princess.  With a smirk, Joey said to himself, \u201c<i><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">I\u2019m over here, you fools; I\u2019m your princess.</span></i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as planned, Joey heard gunshots and saw one of the guards fall to the ground.  While the other guards scrambled to do their prearranged task, Joey ran towards the exit.  He got there just as the last guard fell to the ground; leaving the \u2018kidnapper\u2019 an opening to jump onto the carriage and ride off with the panicking princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he knew the carriage was going slow, Joey still had trouble catching up to it.  He caught up as the carriage turned down what would become a dead end.  Once there, Joey made his move.  \u201cStop right there, you bastard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joey jumped on the carriage to \u2018free\u2019 the princess, the \u2018kidnapper\u2019 shot him several times; or so it would seem to any onlooker in the area.  After pretending to scream in shock, Beatrice climbed out of the carriage.  Looking at Joey, she said, \u201cYou did a fine job, m\u2019lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you; but please stop calling me that.\u201d Running towards the van, Joey said, \u201cI\u2019m not the princess yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice and Joey made it to the van just as a crowd of concerned citizens appeared.  After hearing the gunshots, the idea was they would assume both Joey and the princess had been kidnapped.

Once inside the room, he saw the comatose body of the princess lying on a bed; life support machines keeping her alive.  <br>\r\nEven without removing the blanket covering her body, Joey could tell she was attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat down on a nearby bed, he said to himself, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be a girl, I might as well be an attractive on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an eternity before anyone else entered the room; a doctor entered the room followed by two nurses wheeling in with a large machine.  With a thick German accent, one of the doctors said, \u201cHello, Mr. Warner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi doc.\u201d Gesturing to the machine, Joey said, \u201cIs that going to make me the princess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Pausing, the doctor said, \u201cWe\u2019ll hook it up to both of you; it will change you into the Princess while at the same time changing her into you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to admit I\u2019m curious about this procedure; is there any chance I could stay awake for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be awake the entire time; but pumped full of pain killers to keep you from feeling any pain.\u201d Leaning into to whisper, the doctor said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry; if I were in your position I too would want to be awake while I became a girl...just out of sheer curiosity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Joey was stripped down to a hospital gown and lying on the bed; lying still as the doctors attached tubes from the machine to various places on his body.  Joey\u2019s curiousity was peaked when he saw the doctors attach what looked like suction cups to his chest.  \u201cWhat\u2019s with those?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis machine will liquefy all of Natasha\u2019s breast tissue; bring it through the machine to ensure there\u2019s no abnormalities, and then solidify it under your skin.\u201d Pausing, the doctor said, \u201cThis way, you\u2019ll have Natasha\u2019s breasts without invasive surgery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d Wincing as the nurse injected him with some pain killers, Joey said, \u201cHow long will this take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe procedure itself should take about an hour; during which time you can watch TV or something.\u201d Sighing, the Doctor said, \u201cOnce <br>\r\nI\u2019m satisfied you\u2019re healthy, then you\u2019ll be released.  It\u2019s up to your...parents; but I see no reason for you not to begin your royal duties tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was ready to proceed not long after.  After the nurses had left, Joey said, \u201cIs it too late for me to change my mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not; but I doubt you will.\u201d Turning the machine on, the doctor said, \u201cSee you in an hour, Princess Natasha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Joey heard the machine start humming; as a tingling feeling washed over his entire body.  He knew the changes had begun; he just could not see them yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been almost 35 minutes and Joey was finally starting to see some changes to his body; for starters his arms and legs had lost muscle mass and became more slender.  His hair was also growing out and getting darker.  This was in contrast to Natasha\u2019s body; which was getting bulkier and her hair was shrinking and getting lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until that point Joey hadn\u2019t felt anything due to the pain killers; but he suddenly started to feel a dull ache accompanied by a series of cracking noises from his waist.  Looking down, he saw his skin shift; realizing his waist was realigning itself into a more feminine figure.  Once that was done, Joey immediately felt a pressure building in his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Joey watched as his male junk went erect one last time before changing into a fully functional vagina.  Joey guessed he was about 75% female now; wincing as he felt the bones in his face start to crack and rearrange themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a while since he looked over at Natasha\u2019s body; and while he was still male in some respects, she was no longer female at all.  Thinking back to what the doctor had said about the breasts, Joey wondered when the machine would kick in; just as he felt a sharp stabbing pain in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, in shock, Joey watched as some sort of liquid rushed from the machine to the devices on his chest.  The skin underneath startled to ripple and bulge; ballooning out until Joey was the proud owner of an impressive set of breasts.  Something on the machine clicked and it shut down; giving Joey the sense that he was now female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to call out for someone when the Doctor entered the room.  Disconnecting the machine, he said, \u201cWell Joseph...or should I say Natasha; how do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel...\u201d momentarily taken aback by his new female voice, with a Russian accent nowhere near as thick as the King and Queens, <br>\r\nJoey said, \u201cI feel strange, but good.  This voice will take some getting used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the nurses wheeled the machine and Natasha\u2019s body out of the room, the doctor said, \u201cI\u2019ve called the Palace, the King and Queen are on their way here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will happen to Natasha\u2019s body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already contacted your...former parents and informed them of your accident.\u201d Pausing, the Doctor said, \u201cThey\u2019ll be here to tomorrow to say their goodbyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Sighing, Joey said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind I\u2019d like to sleep before my parents arrive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood, m\u2019lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the doctor had left, a smile formed on Joey\u2019s face as he closed his eyes and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Surprised to see such an important figure to this nation sleeping in such an undignified manner, Joey realized she must have been here all night.

As he stood in front of a full-length mirror, he thought this bathroom was more appropriate for a 5 Star Hotel then a hospital.  He wondered if the room he was in was reserved for the special care of the royal family; figuring it would explain a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill getting use to his accent, Joey said, \u201cGuess there have to be some perks to being royalty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Joey a few minutes to get the courage to take off the hospital gown; but when he did, he was not disappointed.  He had always been somewhat on the overweight side as a boy; but as a girl, there was not an ounce of fat on his body.<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, I look really good.\u201d Admiring himself in the mirror, Joey said, \u201cNot to judgmental or anything; but I look like the perfect girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right in some regards about that; he was just the right height and weight for a girl his age, with a nearly flawless figure and an adorable face.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe Natasha would give this up; she\u2019s got the perfect body for a princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was admiring his new body, there was a knock on the door.  \u201cNatasha, I know this is all new to you, but your father will be here in 20 minutes and I\u2019ve yet to hear you in the shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry mom.\u201d Rushing to turn the shower on, Joey said, \u201cI, uh, was caught up in the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey spent 15 minutes in the shower; taking the time to make sure every part of his body was clean.  He initially found himself overwhelmed by how sensitive his new body was; especially water bouncing off hi breasts.  He managed to resist the urge to explore; knowing that the Queen could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting out of the shower, he dried himself off and walked back into the room wearing nothing but a towel.  Had he known what the Queen expected him to wear; Joey would have stayed in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the feminine dress, obviously made to accentuate his body, Joey said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t wear that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you can.\u201d Handing the dress to Joey, the Queen said, \u201cLook, I know this is all happening fast; but as much as she hated it, Natasha always dressed like this when in public.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo basically I have to keep up appearances?\u201d sighing, Joey took the dress and said, \u201cI guess I could get used to wearing something like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Smiling, the Queen said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you adjust to everything, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of the Queen, Joey soon found himself not only wearing the dress but also a pair of high heeled shoes.  He was even wearing some light make up.  Looking at the reflection in the mirror, Joey said, \u201cHard to believe I used to be a boy, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look beautiful, Natasha.\u201d Smiling, the Queen said, \u201cCome on, your father is waiting.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Lets's start from the top, literally. The dress was a nice cyan color, but that was the only thing that didn't bother him. It was sleeveless, completely showing his lithe arms and shoulders. He could feel the chill of the air-conditioning, actually making him fold his arms in front of his breasts. Speaking of which, the form-fitting dress did not leave much to the imagination. The tops of his breasts were clearly visible in the low cut. Joey was honestly a bit worried that if the dress went any further down, it would show his nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torso of the dress accentuated every little dip and curve of his body as well, but that wasn't the worst thing. The skirt part went down to just his knees, but Joey felt uncomfortable with how his legs rubbed together without any obstacles. He felt naked underneath. In addition, the heels were honestly not all bad, as they weren't too high, and clearly Natasha's feet were probably broken in to the heels, reducing the ache he felt. Still, getting used to the walk was tough enough, to when Joey was happy when they got into the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very comfortable is it?\" Joey jumped a bit when he saw the Queen smiling sincerely at him. \"Don't worry. I can tell. Surely, this is the first time you're wearing a skirt and heels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, very much so.\" Joey smiled weakly, letting the elevator take them down. \"I'm sure I can get used to them though. Well....as best I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen still gave him that understanding look. \"That's alright. You can take all the time you want to get used to it. I certainly won't think any different of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...mom.\" He added at the last second, giving the Queen a smile as the elevator doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out, they passed by some workers, who wished them well as they opened the door for them. However, it wasn't too long before Joey found himself wishing he hadn't left. Practically right as he took his first step outside, there was a rush of voices. People and cameras all around had circled the place, bombarding question after question about the status of the princess, as well as \"Joey\" himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I think I might respect movie stars a bit more now.\"</i> Joey thought to himself. The questions alone were starting to make him dizzy. However, he soon felt some gentle but firm hands on his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just follow me. Keep calm.\" the Queen said to him, curving their way through the mob. Thankfully, the car was just in front of them. The King himself was waiting there as well, looking as proud as you might expect. Joey suddenly found himself a bit apprehensive, finally standing in front of the impressive man as his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....hello dad..\" Joey said with a slight stutter, though not that noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King didn't seem to mind, even offering a hug which Joey ended up walking into. Needless to say, it was a bit awkward, and that came from both sides. It didn't last too long, before they separated and Joey was helped into the car. The door then closed, finally muffling the voices outside.</span></div></div>",

Joey was sitting in the back, legs crossed, watching the scenery as the car drove through the city.  He would occasionally turn and find the King just staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly his discomfort was noticeable, because the Queen said, \u201cDmitri, stop looking at our daughter like she\u2019s a leper; say something to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey was glad at the Queen was accepting of him as the daughter; but like many girls he knew, he really wanted the approval of his new father.

Taking a seat by the gate, I plugged in my headphones and decided to read up on Moldavia on the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two hours passed uneventfully; I either surfed the web or walked around the terminal.  I was starting to get antsy when the plane finally started to board.</span></div></div>",

Looking out the window, I watched as the capital city of Alastra grew larger in the window.  Of course that was all relative, considering that the capital was rather small in comparison to say London or Berlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only noticeable landmark was the palace in the center of the city; resembling Buckingham Palace more than one I might find in a storybook.<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before you got through customs and arrived at the hotel; where Professor Monroe handed out room keys.  After telling us the plan <br>\r\nfor the next few days, we all went up to our rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unpacking your things in the room, I saw Jake lie down.  Turning to him, I said, \u201cCome on, Jake!  We\u2019re in a foreign country.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m tired, man; I didn\u2019t sleep on the plane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Shrugging, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing my phone and wallet, I left the room and made my way to the lobby.  Once outside the hotel, I decided to take a walk towards the palace.  As I walked, I figured I had time to tour the palace before getting back for curfew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the palace, I saw that there were very few tourists walking around.  Spotting a ticket booth, I walked over.  As I walked over, I spotted a banner advertising the chance to \u2018live like a princess.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, I went to the booth and said, \u201cI\u2019d like one ticket please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter handing me the ticket, the attendant pointed me towards a nearby door.  \u201cYou\u2019ll have to use the side entrance, as the main entrance is being worked on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the door, I opened it and stepped inside...only to fall about 15 feet into a pile of hay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could get up, I heard a door open.

Once my vision returned, I saw two finely dressed middle aged people standing in the doorway.  \u201cWelcome to the Royal Palace.\u201d Looking at me, the woman said, \u201cI\u2019m Helena, Queen of Moldavia; and this is my husband King Harold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me what\u2019s going on here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in due time, young man.\u201d Smiling, The Queen said, \u201cCome with us; and we\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hesitantly got up and followed them out of the room; only to find myself in an ornately decorated hallway.

I saw a king-sized canopy bed; with a walk-in closet and a bathroom.  I didn\u2019t look in the closet, but I figured that it would be filled with high-end clothing for a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also saw a desk with a top of the line laptop resting on it.

Climbing out of the bed, I made my way to the bathroom to look at the rest of the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I found astounded me; the nanites had turned me from an average guy into an attractive girl, with long brown hair and green eyes.

Once the applause had died down, I was led to a waiting limo with mother and father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat in the limo, I said, \u201cThat was definitely an interesting experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you blame them, Katrina?\u201d looking at me, mother said, \u201cTheir princess has returned home after so many years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back in the seat, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I can get in bed and relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Father said, \u201cYou\u2019ve earned some rest, Katrina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got back to the palace, I followed Melina up to my room where I got ready for bed.</span></div></div>",
